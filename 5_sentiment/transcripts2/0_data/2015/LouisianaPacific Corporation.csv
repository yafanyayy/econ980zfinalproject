Well, thank you very much, Joyce, and good morning, and good afternoon for those of you on the East Coast. We thank you for joining our conference call today to discuss LP's financial results for the fourth quarter of 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2014.
I am Sallie Bailey, LP Chief Financial Officer. And with me today are Curt Stevens, LP's Chief Executive Officer; as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barckley, our primary Investor Relations contact.
I'll begin the discuss with a review of the financial results for the fourth quarter of 2014 and the full year. It will be followed by some comments on the performance on the individual segments and balance sheet.
When I finished my comments, Curt will discuss the general market environment in which LP has been operating and provide his perspective on our operating results and give some thoughts on the outlook.
As we have done in the past, we have open this call to the public and we're doing a webcast. That webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. Additionally, to help with the discussion, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I will be referencing these slides in my comments this morning. We filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information and expect to file our Form 10-K before the end of the month.
I want to remind all the participants about the forward-looking statements comment on Slide 2 of the presentation. Please also be aware of the discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation.
The appendix attached to the presentation have some of the necessary reconciliations that's been supplemented by the Form 8-K filing we made this morning. Rather than reading these 2 statements, I incorporate them with this one.
2014 was a challenging year for LP. Housing starts grew to just over 1 million starts or 9% higher than 2013. Single-family housing starts to grew 5% year-over-year. At L.P., we remain focused on activities which are in our control and continue to invest in our future, so we are prepared when U.S. housing starts return to its historical levels.
Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of the fourth quarter 2014 and the full year 2014 result. We reported net sales of $454 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, a 5% decline from the net sales of $480 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2013.
In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded net loss of $43 million or $0.30 per diluted share. The fourth quarter of 2013, we reported net loss of $20[ph] million or $0.15 per diluted share. The adjusted loss from continuing operations for the quarter is $32 million or $0.23 per share based upon a normalized tax rate of  35%. This compares to a loss of $9 million or $0.06 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was negative $17 million in the quarter compared to the [indiscernible] EBITDA of $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2013.
On a year-to-date basis, we recorded $1 billion of net sales, a loss of $75 million and a loss per share of $0.53 as compared to net sales of $2.1 million[ph], net income of $177 million and earnings per share of $1.23 for the full year of 2013.
On a non-GAAP basis, we recorded an adjusted loss from continuing operations of $60 million, a loss per share of $0.42 and adjusted EBITDA of $44 million for the full year of 2014.
In 2013, we recorded $121 million of adjusted income from continuing operations, earnings per share of $0.90[ph] and adjusted EBITDA of $330 million. The significant headwind experienced by LP in 2014 was a 26% decrease in LSL pricing. The lower LSL impacted operating income and adjusted EBITDA by $298 million, which is more than the year-over-year decrease in adjusted EBITDA.
I will now move to Slide 5 and our view of our segment results, beginning with OSB. LP's OSB segment recorded an operating loss of $29 million and $203 million of sales in the quarter compared to operating and profit of $7 million and $230 million of sales in the fourth quarter of 2013. For the quarter, we're reporting negative adjusted EBITDA of $50[ph] million compared to positive EBITDA of $27 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. We had a 1% decrease in volume and pricing for OSB was up 12% over the fourth quarter of 2013.
We took 136 done days during the quarter, which equates to approximately 200 million square feet. Most of the down days were market related. The positive utilization of our operating mills for the end of the quarter were approximately 77%.
For the full year, OSB had an operating loss of $53 million compared to income of $230 million in 2013. Adjusted EBITDA in 2014 was $4 million compared to $285 million in 2013. The impact of lower OSB pricing between the years was $298 million.
Slide 6 reports the results of the Siding business. This segment includes our SmartSide and CanExel siding product. The Siding segment reported sale of $141 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of 2% from $138 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2013. The Siding segment reported operating income of $14 million compared to $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, and adjusted EBITDA of $19 million as compared to $20 million in the same quarter of 2013.
During the quarter, the Siding segment did not produce any OSB compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 when the Siding segment produced 45 million square feet of OSB.
For the quarter, SmartSide average sales price were 4% and volume increased 4%. Volume is increasing in our SmartSide line due to continued penetration in several key focus market, including retail, repair/remodel and such. However, the Siding segment was negatively impacted by shortages in the space. We estimate that the Siding business lost 45 days of downtime or 27 million square feet of production in the fourth quarter. We estimate that the gross margin on the lost sales along with a higher mill cost decreased adjusted EBITDA by $5 million for the quarter.
CanExel prices were down slightly in U.S. dollars or up 6% in Canadian dollars. Canada is CanExel's primary market. Volumes were up 11% in the quarter due to higher Canadian and international demand. And on a year-to-date basis, the Siding segment recorded $617 million in sale, $80[ph] million in profit and $98 million in adjusted EBITDA.
For 2013, the Siding segment reported sales of $474[ph] million, profit of $86 million and adjusted EBITDA of $103 million.
In 2014, volumes of SmartSide increased 13% and prices increased 3%. The Siding segment produced 45 million square feet of OSB in 2014 as compared to 168 million square feet of OSB in 2013.
For the full year, the Siding segment was negatively impacted by log shortages. We estimate of the business loss 88 days or 53.8 million square feet of production due to those logs shortages. We estimate the impact of these log shortages in operating income and adjusted EBITDA with just over $10 million for the year.
Please turn to Slide 3 of the presentation, which shows the results for our Engineered Wood Products segment. This segment includes I-Joist, Laminated lumber, laminated veneer lumber and other related products. This segment also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi joint venture or under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood.
In past quarters, we've included log sales from our licenses in this segment. But beginning this quarter and going forward, these sales and operating income and adjusted EBITDA are being recorded as part of the Other Building Products category. The Other Building Products category includes log sales from other nonoperating mills. All prior periods have been adjusted.
The impact in EWP's results on an annual basis has been between $1 million and $1.5 million of adjusted EBITDA in each of the last 3 years. The Engineered Wood Products segment reported net sales of $66 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, down slightly from the fourth quarter of 2013. The segment's operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $6 million as compared to a loss of $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. For the fourth quarter of 2014, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations declined to a negative $4 million as compared to breakeven in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Volumes of I-Joist were down 9%, while volumes of LVL and LSL were down 3% compared to the same quarter last year. Pricing was up 3% in I-Joist and 5% in LVL/LSL reflecting price increases in all products.
For 2014, Engineered Wood Products reported net sales of $281 million as compared to $250 million in 2013, 12% increase. Sales volumes were up 6% in I-Joist and 9% and LVL and LSL. For 2014, Engineered Wood Products -- in 2014 Engineered Wood Products recorded an operating loss of $14 million and reported breakeven adjusted EBITDA as compared to a loss of $15[ph] million and negative EBITDA of $2 million for 2013.
Moving to Slide 8 of the presentation. For the quarter, our South American segment recorded sales of $36 million as compared to $41 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Operating income is $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $2 million in the fourth quarter 2013. South America's adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $5 million for the fourth quarter of 2013, which is comparable to the fourth quarter of 2013.
Volumes in Chile were up 16% and lower by 27% in Brazil compared to the same quarter last year. Sales volume increased in Chile primarily by increased demand, offset by lower exports.
In Brazil, the lower volume was primarily due to reduced exports to the far east market. Pricing was down 16% in Chile and down 6% in Brazil. In local currency Chile's pricing is 5% lower compared to the same quarter in 2013 due to continued pricing pressure from North American imports. And Brazil recorded a 1% improvement in pricing in local currency.
For the full year of 2014, South America recorded net sales of $150 million, profit of $11 million and adjusted EBITDA of $20 million. For 2013, South America recorded net sales of $172 million, profit of $20 million and adjusted EBITDA of $31 million.
Total selling, general and administrative costs were $41 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $47 million in the same quarter in 2013. For the full year of 2014, selling, general and administrative costs were about flat between the periods at about $150 million. For the quarter, the reduction in SG&A cost is primarily related to lower incentive compensation.
Now please turn to Slide 9 of the presentation where we announced that as of December 31, 2014, we have cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash of $548 million. Working capital of $778 million, net cash of $177 million. In addition to the cash on our balance sheet, we have $200 million of availability on our credit facility. Capital expenditures for the year were $80 million.
 Capital expenditures for 2015 are expected to be approximately $130 million of which around $80 million relates to our growth project, such as the siding mill conversion and the mill. And we did not repurchase any shares of LP stock during this quarter.
Now I'll turn the call over to Curt for his comments."

My comments today will focus on our accomplishments and challenges during the last year, talk about the current state of the housing market and provide you with my views on what is ahead for us in 2015. I will conclude by discussing the executive leadership changes that we announced this morning.
From a safety perspective, LP had a total incident rate of 0.35 for 2014, the lowest level in LP's history. This is the ninth year in a row that our total incident rate has been below 1.0. In addition, we completed all of our capital work in 2014 without single recordable injury to any of the many, many contractors that we used on site, truly remarkable performance.
For the year, housing starts were just over 1 million, led by a strong fourth quarter performance. However, this is only about a 9% increase compared to the beginning of the year forecast of a 20% plus increase. This shortfall put pressure on OSB pricing all year that resulted in north-central 716's pricing between $71 per 1,000 square feet lower than 2013, quite a disappointment for us.
In our Siding business, we had record shipments of SmartSide for the third year in a row. This success led us to convert all production at Hayward to Siding and to make the decision to accelerate the conversion of our Swan Valley, Manitoba OSB mill siding production. We expect this to be operational early in the fourth quarter of this year.
In Engineered Wood, we again had record shipments of Laminated Strand Lumber, products and higher volumes of both I-Joist and LVL than in 2013.
South America, weaker economies in both Chile and Brazil, plus the stronger U.S. dollar, reduced results, but we were still profitable in both these operations.
That leaves me a few comments on housing market. U.S. housing starts in December were at 1.089 million units with single-family starts at their highest level in 6.5 years. In addition, housing starts on both October and November were revised upward.
Housing permits were slightly below starts in December at 1.028 million. The average 30-year mortgage rate for the week ending January 23 was at 3.66, the lowest level since the spike in rates in May of 2013.
Last month, I attended the International Builders Show in Las Vegas. The attendance was very strong with an estimate of 125,000 attendees. From the supplier perspective, I'd say there was a universal caution as we were all caught off guard by the slow pace of the housing recovery in 2014. Most are using around 1.1 million housing start as a base assumption. Among the builders, I'd say there was more optimism around housing activity, but the express concerns the number of various: Cost and ability of prime lots, availability of construction labor and upward pressure on labor cost, the cost of building products and margin pressure as the ability to raise prices aggressively has dissipated.
Just last night, I returned from the Policy Advisory Board meeting of the hardware joint center -- housing study that was held in Washington, D.C. over the past 2 days. This is a group from all facets of the housing industry, builders, developers, producers, distributors, realtors, government agencies that support housing, banks and other financial institutions. I'm pleased to say that the general tenor of the meeting was the most positive in 5 years. The optimism was broad based, but the most discussed item was the expected return of the first-time home buyer due to a variety of factors. Sallie nointed household formations have been at extremely low level for much of the great recession. These number shot up in the fourth quarter to 3x what they've been averaging over the last 3 years.
Job growth and wage increases from an improving economy gave much of the credit for this.
On the financing side, the lowering of premiums on mortgage insurance, the reemergence of the 3% down payment loans and more favorable credit standards are making financing more available for first-time home buyer.
At the meeting, there's also a discussions are trying to assess the impact of falling oil prices on housing and it appears to be a mixed bag. In the oil-producing areas, it doesn't appear that housing activity has slowed, but there are certainly a lot of talk about the timing of beginning new housing projects.
Lower fuel prices are adding to consumer confidence, which should accelerate household formation, a precursor to the first-time home sale or apartment rental.
As and aside, we do expect to have lower raw materials cost out of our operations due to lower oil pricing, primarily resins and energy. Last December when we put our 2015 budget together, we estimated that the savings due to lower oil prices in the range of $25 million to $30 million. Today, with oil prices hovering just north of $50 a barrel, our estimated savings are in the $40 million to $50 million range.
In other markets, the National Association of Homebuilding Remodeling index had a record level in the fourth quarter of 2014. The Hardware Joint Center for Housing Studies just released their emerging trends in the remodeling market where they concluded that this market will continue to strengthen.
For the strong U.S. dollar, we don't see exports returning anytime soon to North America.
For 2015 and 2016, we agree with the forecasters that housing is going to continue to get better. The consensus forecast for housing starts in 2015 now stands at 1.19 million and 1.426 million in 2016, a 10% increase this year, followed by a 20% increase next year. I'll take that. As I mentioned in our last call, we're using 1.1 million as our 2015 base forecast.
OSB pricing is critically important to us and our financial performance demonstrated last year. Clearly, pricing was short of expectations in 2014 as new production that came online in anticipation of higher housing activity led to an imbalance between supply and demand.
While we don't provide guidance on earnings or OSB prices, we do use force economic advisers as a primary forecasting source. For 2015, they see an increase of about 8% in OSB prices and a further 14% increase in 2016.
We do see the Canadian dollar below the $0.90 level for 2015. To put this in perspective, the change in the exchange rate in 2014 compared to 2013 improved our results by about $14 million.
In the near term, we have several important projects on the growth agenda. We've been on allocation on our Siding business for several months due to low shortages and cost production shortfalls. We've been working diligently to put log into these mills so we can operate it without interruption. If nature cooperates a bit, I think this will happen.
In addition, we kicked off an accelerated project to convert our Sun Valley, Manitoba OSB mill production early in the fourth quarter. We have further capital projects under development to add capacity or capabilities as our other Siding mills to meet customer demand, having available siding capacity ahead of demand is a very high priority.
South America, we have submitted our environmental permits and have an initial comments back for our third mill in Chile, and we have started the detailed engineering to be ready to begin construction when the permits are approved. We believe that this will be sometime around the end of the summer.
While we always like housing to recover more quickly, we are pleased with our positioning in the market and we stand ready to serve the increased housing market activity.
Before I turn over to Sallie for questions and answer, I do want to take a few minutes to discuss the management changes that we announced this morning. The good news is these announcements is that we have a broad and deep bench within LP to assume important roles. The bad news is that we will be losing 2 very talented executives and good friends to retirement. Here's the summary of the changes: Rick Olszewski, EVP of sales and marketing at South America, will be retiring at the end of March of this year. As Rick demonstrates, Rick is both the Senior Sales and Marketing executive for LP and executive in charge of our South American operations.
For the first responsibility, Rick will be replaced by Mike Sims, our current VP of OSB Sales for the new title of Senior VP, Sales and Marketing. Mike has over 30 years of experience in the selling and marketing of building products and has held a senior role with LP since we acquired ABTco. in 1999. Because of the increased role that South American LP's growth plans, I will be taking over Rick's role in South America's Frederick Price, President of LP's South America will be reporting directly to me.
Jason Ringbloom has held a variety of sales roles with increasing responsibility over the years. He will take Mike Sims spot as VP of OSB sales.
Jeff Wagner, our long-term EVP and GM of OSB, and I have been talking about his retirement plans for some time and decided that Jeff will leave his full-time employment with LP around the middle of this year. In the meantime, Jeff will report to me and assume responsibility for an important internal LP project to get better growth and innovation. As we know, we can't rely solely on housing recovery.
Brad Southern, a long-time LP officer and currently the Senior Vice President and General Manager of our Siding business, will assume Jeff's responsibility as EVP and General Manager of OSB.  [indiscernible] creates more cascading.
Brian Luoma, another longtime LP employee and currently, Senior Vice President, GM of Engineered Wood business, will replace Brad and become EVP and GM of siding.
Neil Sherman, currently our VP of Procurement and Logistics, will take Brian's position become Senior Vice President and GM of EWP.
Finally, Mike Blosser, LP's VP of EH Forestry will once again have Neil's responsibilities to his portfolio.
While it seems like a lot of change at once, we were able to make all these moves internally as a result of the talent pool within LP and our robust succession planning process. I'm fully confident that each of these changes will bring a new perspective to position and will allow our executive management to acquire new skills that will allow for increased responsibility in the future.
I want to publicly thank Jeff for the many contributions he made to LP over his 35-year plus career with the company and Rick for bringing sales and marketing to the forefront of what's historically a manufacturing company in his 8.5 years with LP.
Now, I'll turn it back to Sallie for questions"

In fact, we could see a little bit higher pricing, particularly coming out of the Canadian railroads because of price increases they put in place, plus some of the changes they've made to their AMB routing, which is, of course, passed to increase our distribution channel with more railroads and other methods to support our customer. So we're not seeing that on the transportation side. On the log side, we have not seen any relief in the latest pricing. We see a little bit more availability but not on the pricing. In the south, we do expect log pricing to come off[ph] a little bit, but not significantly."

Well, thank you very much, Joyce, and good morning, and good afternoon for those of you on the East Coast. We thank you for joining our conference call today to discuss LP's financial results for the fourth quarter of 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2014.
I am Sallie Bailey, LP's Chief Financial Officer. And with me today are Curt Stevens, LP's Chief Executive Officer; as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barckley, our primary Investor Relations contact.
I'll begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the fourth quarter of 2014 and the full year. It will be followed by some comments on the performance of the individual segments and selected balance sheet items.
After I finished my comments, Curt will discuss the general market environment in which LP has been operating and provide his perspective on our operating results and give some thoughts on the outlook.
As we have done in the past, we have opened up this call to the public and we are doing a webcast. That webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. Additionally, to help with the discussion, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I will be referencing these slides in my comments this morning. We filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information and expect to file our Form 10-K before the end of the month.
I want to remind all the participants about the forward-looking statements comment on Slide 2 of the presentation. Please also be aware of the discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. The appendix attached to the presentation has some of the necessary reconciliation that has been supplemented by the Form 8-K filing we made this morning. Rather than reading these 2 statements, I incorporate them with this reference.
2014 was a challenging year for LP. Housing starts grew to just over 1 million starts or 9% higher than 2013. Single-family housing starts grew 5% year-over-year. At LP, we remain focused on activities which are in our control and continue to invest in our future, so we are prepared when U.S. housing starts return to its historical levels.
Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of the fourth quarter 2014 and the full year 2014 result. We reported net sales of $454 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, a 5% decline from the net sales of $480 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2013.
In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded net loss of $43 million or $0.30 per diluted share. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we reported a net loss of $20 million or $0.15 per diluted share. The adjusted loss from continuing operations for the quarter is $32 million or $0.23 per share based upon the normalized tax rate of 35%. This compares to a loss of $9 million or $0.06 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was negative $17 million in the quarter compared to positive EBITDA of $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2013.
On a year-to-date basis, we recorded $1 billion of net sales, a loss of $75 million and a loss per share of $0.53 as compared to net sales of $2.1 billion, net income of $177 million and earnings per share of $1.23 for the full year of 2013.
On a non-GAAP basis, we recorded an adjusted loss from continuing operations of $60 million, a loss per share of $0.42 and adjusted EBITDA of $44 million for the full year of 2014. In 2013, we recorded $121 million (sic) [ $129 million ] of adjusted income from continuing operations, earnings per share of $0.90, and adjusted EBITDA of $330 million. The most significant headwind experienced by LP in 2014 was a 26% decrease in OSB pricing. The lower OSB price impacted operating income and adjusted EBITDA by $298 million, which is more than the year-over-year decrease in adjusted EBITDA.
I will now move to Slide 5 and our view of our segment results, beginning with OSB. LP's OSB segment recorded an operating loss of $29 million and $203 million of sales in the quarter compared to operating profit of $7 million and $230 million of sales in the fourth quarter of 2013. For the quarter, we're reporting negative adjusted EBITDA of $15 million compared to positive EBITDA of $27 million (sic) [ $23 million ] in the fourth quarter of 2013. We had a 1% decrease in volume, and pricing for OSB was up 12% over the fourth quarter of 2013.
We took 136 down days during the quarter, which equates to approximately 200 million square feet. Most of the down days were market related. Capacity utilization of our operating mills for the quarter was approximately 77%.
For the full year, OSB had an operating loss of $53 million compared to income of $230 million in 2013. Adjusted EBITDA in 2014 was $4 million compared to $285 million in 2013. The impact of lower OSB pricing between the years was $298 million.
Slide 6 reports the results of the Siding business. This segment includes our SmartSide and CanExel siding product. The Siding segment reported sales of $141 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of 2% from $138 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2013. The Siding segment reported operating income of $14 million compared to $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, and adjusted EBITDA of $19 million as compared to $20 million in the same quarter of 2013.
During the quarter, the Siding segment did not produce any OSB compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 when the Siding segment produced 45 million square feet of OSB.
For the quarter, SmartSide average sales price were up 4% and volumes also increased 4%. Volume increased in our SmartSide siding line due to continued penetration in several key focused markets, including retail, repair/remodel and shed. However, the Siding segment was negatively impacted by log shortages in the Lake States. We estimate that the Siding business lost 45 days of downtime or 27 million square feet of production in the fourth quarter. We estimate that the gross margin on the lost sales along with a higher unabsorbed mill costs decreased adjusted EBITDA by $5 million for the quarter.
CanExel prices were down slightly in U.S. dollars or up 6% in Canadian dollars. Canada is CanExel's primary market. Volumes were up 11% in the quarter due to higher Canadian and international demand. And on a year-to-date basis, the Siding segment recorded $617 million in sale, $80 million in profit and $98 million in adjusted EBITDA. For 2013, the Siding segment reported sales of $574 million, profit of $86 million and adjusted EBITDA of $103 million.
In 2014, volumes of SmartSide increased 13% and prices increased 3%. The Siding segment produced 45 million square feet of OSB in 2014 as compared to 168 million square feet of OSB in 2013.
For the full year, the Siding segment was negatively impacted by log shortages. We estimate that the business lost 88 days or 53.8 million square feet of production due to the log shortage. We estimate the impact of these log shortages in operating income and adjusted EBITDA with just over $10 million for the year.
Please turn to Slide 3 (sic) [ Slide 3 ] of the presentation, which shows the results for our Engineered Wood Products segment. This segment includes I-Joist, Laminated Strand Lumber, Laminated Veneer Lumber, plus other related products. This segment also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi joint venture or under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood.
In past quarters, we've included log sales from our Malakwa forest licenses in this segment. But beginning this quarter and going forward, these sales and the associated operating income and adjusted EBITDA are being recorded as part of the Other Building Products category. The Other Building Products category includes log sales from other nonoperating mills. All prior periods have been adjusted.
The impact on EWP's results on an annual basis has been between $1 million and $1.5 million of adjusted EBITDA in each of the last 3 years. The Engineered Wood Products segment reported sales of $66 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, down slightly from the fourth quarter of 2013. The segment's operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $6 million as compared to a loss of $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. For the fourth quarter of 2014, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations declined to a negative $4 million as compared to breakeven in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Volumes of I-Joist were down 9%, while volumes of LVL and LSL were down 3% compared to the same quarter last year. Pricing was up 3% in I-Joist and 5% in LVL and LSL reflecting price increases in all products.
For 2014, Engineered Wood Products reported net sales of $281 million as compared to $250 million in 2013, a 12% increase. Sales volumes were up 6% in I-Joist, and 9% in LVL and LSL. For 2014, Engineered Wood Products -- in 2014, Engineered Wood Products recorded an operating loss of $14 million and reported breakeven adjusted EBITDA as compared to a loss of $15 million and negative EBITDA of $2 million for 2013.
Moving to Slide 8 of the presentation. For the quarter, our South American segment recorded sales of $36 million as compared to $41 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Operating income is $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. South America's adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $5 million for the fourth quarter of 2013 (sic) [ 2014 ], which is comparable to the fourth quarter of 2013.
Volumes in Chile were up 16% and lower by 27% in Brazil compared to the same quarter last year. Sales volume increase in Chile primarily increased demand, offset by lower exports. In Brazil, the lower volume was primarily due to reduced exports to the far east market. 
Pricing was down 16% in Chile and down 6% in Brazil. In local currency, Chile's pricing is 5% lower compared to the same quarter in 2013 due to continued pricing pressure from North American imports. And Brazil recorded a 1% improvement in pricing in local currency.
For the full year of 2014, South America recorded net sales of $150 million, profit of $11 million and adjusted EBITDA of $20 million. For 2013, South America recorded net sales of $172 million, profit of $20 million and adjusted EBITDA of $31 million.
Total selling, general and administrative costs were $41 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $47 million in the same quarter in 2013. For the full year of 2014, selling, general and administrative costs were about flat between the periods at $150 million. For the quarter, the reduction in SG&A costs is primarily related to lower incentive compensation.
Now please turn to Slide 9 of the presentation where we note that as of December 31, 2014, we had cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash of $548 million. Working capital of $778 million. Net cash of $177 million. In addition to the cash on our balance sheet, we have $200 million of availability on our credit facility. Capital expenditures for the year were $80 million.
Capital expenditures for 2015 are expected to be approximately $130 million of which around $80 million relates to our growth project, such as the Swan siding mill conversion and the third Chilean mill. And we did not repurchase any shares of LP stock during this quarter.
Now I'll turn the call over to Curt for his comments."

My comments today will focus on our accomplishments and challenges during the last year, talk about the current state of the housing market, and provide you with my views on what is ahead for us in 2015. I will conclude by discussing the executive leadership changes that we announced this morning.
From a safety perspective, LP had a total incident rate of 0.35 for 2014, the lowest level in LP's history. This is the ninth year in a row that our total incident rate has been below 1.0. In addition, we completed all of our capital work in 2014 without a single recordable injury to any of the many, many contractors that we used on site, a truly remarkable performance.
For the year, housing starts were at just over 1 million, led by a strong fourth quarter performance. However, this is only about a 9% increase compared to the beginning of the year forecast of a 20% plus increase. This shortfall put pressure on OSB pricing all year that resulted in North Central 7/16's pricing between $71 per 1,000 square feet lower than 2013, quite a disappointment for us.
In our Siding business, we had record shipments of SmartSide for the third year in a row. This success led us to convert all production at Hayward to Siding and to make the decision to accelerate the conversion of our Swan Valley, Manitoba OSB mill to siding production. We expect this to be operational early in the fourth quarter of this year.
In Engineered Wood, we again had record shipments of Laminated Strand Lumber products and higher volumes of both I-Joist and LVL than in 2013.
South America, weaker economies in both Chile and Brazil, plus the stronger U.S. dollar reduced results, but we were still profitable in both these operations. That leaves me to a few comments on the housing market. U.S. housing starts in December were at 1.089 million units with single-family starts at their highest level in 6.5 years. In addition, housing starts for both October and November were revised upward.
Housing permits were slightly below starts in December at 1.028 million. The average 30-year mortgage rate for the week ending January 23 was at 3.66, the lowest level since the spike in rates in May of 2013.
Last month, I attended the International Builders' Show in Las Vegas. The attendance was very strong with an estimate of 125,000 attendees. From the supplier perspective, I'd say there was a universal caution as we were all caught off guard by the slow pace of the housing recovery in 2014. Most are using around 1.1 million housing starts as a base assumption. Among the builders, I'd say there was more optimism around housing activity, but they expressed concerns in a number of areas: Cost and ability of prime lots, availability of construction labor and upward pressure on labor cost, the cost of building products. And margin pressure as the ability to raise prices aggressively has dissipated.
Just last night, I returned from the Policy Advisory Board meeting of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies that was held in Washington, D.C. over the past 2 days. This is a group from all facets of the housing industry, builders, developers, producers, distributors, realtors, government agencies who support housing, banks and other financial institutions. I'm pleased to say that the general tenor of the meeting was the most positive in 5 years. The optimism was broad based, but the most discussed item was the expected return of the first-time homebuyer due to a variety of factors. Sallie mentioned household formations have been at an extremely low level for much of the great recession. These numbers shot up in the fourth quarter to 3x what they've been averaging over the last 3 years. Job growth and wage increases from an improving economy gave much of the credit for this.
On the financing side, the lowering of premiums on mortgage insurance, the reemergence of the 3% down payment loans and more favorable credit standards are making financing more available for the first-time homebuyer.
At the meeting, there's also a discussions to try to assess the impact of falling oil prices on housing, and it appears to be a mixed bag. In the oil-producing areas, it doesn't appear that housing activity has slowed, but there's certainly a lot of talk about the timing of beginning new housing projects.
Lower fuel prices are adding to consumer confidence, which should accelerate household formation, a precursor to the first-time home sale or apartment rental.
As and aside, we do expect to have lower raw materials cost at our operations due to lower oil pricing, primarily resins and energy. Last December when we put our 2015 budget together, we estimated that the savings due to lower oil prices in the range of $25 million to $30 million. Today, with oil prices hovering just north of $50 a barrel, our estimated savings are in the $40 million to $50 million range.
In other markets, the National Association of Home Builder Remodeling index hit a record level in the fourth quarter of 2014. The Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies just released their emerging trends in the remodeling market where they concluded that this market will continue to strengthen.
For the strong U.S. dollar, we don't see exports returning any time soon to North America. For 2015 and 2016, we agree with the forecasters that housing is going to continue to get better. The consensus forecast for housing starts in 2015 now stands at 1.19 million and 1.426 million in 2016, a 10% increase this year, followed by a 20% increase next year. I'll take that. As I mentioned in our last call, we're using 1.1 million as our 2015 base forecast.
OSB pricing is critically important to us and our financial performance as demonstrated last year. Clearly, pricing was short of expectations in 2014 as new production that came online in anticipation of higher housing activity led to an imbalance between supply and demand.
While we don't provide guidance on earnings or OSB prices, we do use Forest Economic Advisors as a primary forecasting source. For 2015, they see an increase of about 8% in OSB prices and a further 14% increase in 2016.
We do see the Canadian dollar below the $0.90 level for 2015. To put this in perspective, the change in the exchange rate in 2014 compared to 2013 improved our results by about $14 million.
For the near term, we have several important projects on our growth agenda. We've been on allocation on our Siding business for several months due to log shortages in Lake States that cost production shortfalls. We've been working diligently to put logs into these mills so we can operate without interruption. If nature cooperates a bit, I think this will happen.
In addition, we kicked off an accelerated project to convert our Swan Valley, Manitoba OSB mill to siding production early in the fourth quarter. We have further capital projects under development to add capacity or capabilities at our other siding mills to meet customer demand. Having available siding capacity ahead of demand is a very high priority.
South America, we have submitted our environmental permits and have initial comments back for our third mill in Chile, and we have started the detailed engineering to be ready to begin construction when the permits are approved. We believe this will be sometime around the end of the summer.
While we would always like housing to recover more quickly, we are pleased with our positioning in the market, and we stand ready to serve the increased housing market activity.
Before I turn it over to Sallie for questions and answer, I do want to take a few minutes to discuss the management changes that we announced this morning. The good news is these announcements is that we have a broad and deep bench within LP to assume important roles. The bad news is that we will be losing 2 very talented executives and good friends to retirement. Here's the summary of the changes. Rick Olszewski, EVP of sales and marketing at South America, will be retiring at the end of March of this year. As Rick's title demonstrates, Rick is both the senior sales and marketing executive for LP and the executive in charge of our South American operations.
For the first responsibility, Rick will be replaced by Mike Sims, our current VP of OSB Sales, for the new title of Senior VP, Sales and Marketing. Mike has over 30 years of experience in the selling and marketing of building products, and has held a senior role with LP since we acquired ABTco. in 1999. Because of the increased role of South American LP's growth plans, I will be taking over Rick's role in South America. And Frederick Price, President of LP's South America, will be reporting directly to me.
Jason Ringbloom, who's held a variety of sales roles with increasing responsibility over the years, will take Mike Sims spot as VP of OSB sales.
Jeff Wagner, our longtime EVP and GM of OSB, and I had been talking about his retirement plans for some time and decided that Jeff will leave his full-time employment with LP around the middle of this year. In the meantime, Jeff will report to me and assume responsibility for an important internal LP project to get better at growth and innovation. As we know, we can't rely solely on the housing recovery.
Brad Southern, a longtime LP officer and currently the Senior Vice President and General Manager of our Siding business, will assume Jeff's responsibility as EVP and General Manager of OSB. So you can tell, this creates more cascading.
Brian Luoma, another longtime LP employee and currently, Senior Vice President and GM of Engineered Wood business, will replace Brad and become EVP and GM of Siding.
Neil Sherman, currently our VP of Procurement and Logistics, will take Brian's position and become Senior Vice President and GM of EWP.
Finally, Mike Blosser, LP's VP of EHS and Forestry will once again add Neil's prior responsibilities to his portfolio.
While it seems like a lot of change at once, we were able to make all these moves internally as a result of the talent pool within LP and our robust succession planning process. I'm fully confident that each of these changes will bring a new perspective to position and will allow our executive management to acquire new skills that will allow for increased responsibility in the future.
I want to publicly thank Jeff for the many contributions he made to LP over his 35-year plus career with the company and Rick for bringing sales and marketing to the forefront of what's historically a manufacturing company in his 8.5 years with LP.
Now I'll turn it back over to Sallie for questions."

And what we get there is we get a sales margin, we don't get a manufacturing margin. But we also have no investment in the planning equipment. In our I-Joist business, probably 70% of our I-Joist has come out of the 2 joint venture mills that we have with AbitibiBowater. And there, again, we get the sales margin and we get half of the manufacturing margin, but not all of it. So if you were to look at it on an RO -- return on assets, we look really, really good. But if you look at it just on a margin, we don't capture the full margin either on those I-Joists or the JV because we only get half of it. And then in the Murphy, we just get a sales margin. So there's the difference in the operating models in that we don't own and operate all of our own facilities. But we adjust for that, if you look at the sales pricing between the 2 other public entities, our sales pricing is right on top of -- maybe even a little bit ahead, and our manufacturing costs are right on top of them.

Well, thank you very much, Joyce, and good morning, and good afternoon for those of you on the East Coast. We thank you for joining our conference call today to discuss LP's financial results for the fourth quarter of 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2014.
I am Sallie Bailey, LP's Chief Financial Officer. And with me today are Curt Stevens, LP's Chief Executive Officer; as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barckley, our primary Investor Relations contact.
I'll begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the fourth quarter of 2014 and the full year. It will be followed by some comments on the performance of the individual segments and selected balance sheet items.
After I finished my comments, Curt will discuss the general market environment in which LP has been operating and provide his perspective on our operating results and give some thoughts on the outlook.
As we have done in the past, we have opened up this call to the public and we are doing a webcast. That webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. Additionally, to help with the discussion, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I will be referencing these slides in my comments this morning. We filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information and expect to file our Form 10-K before the end of the month.
I want to remind all the participants about the forward-looking statements comment on Slide 2 of the presentation. Please also be aware of the discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. The appendix attached to the presentation has some of the necessary reconciliation that has been supplemented by the Form 8-K filing we made this morning. Rather than reading these 2 statements, I incorporate them with this reference.
2014 was a challenging year for LP. Housing starts grew to just over 1 million starts or 9% higher than 2013. Single-family housing starts grew 5% year-over-year. At LP, we remain focused on activities which are in our control and continue to invest in our future, so we are prepared when U.S. housing starts return to its historical levels.
Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of the fourth quarter 2014 and the full year 2014 result. We reported net sales of $454 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, a 5% decline from the net sales of $480 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2013.
In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded net loss of $43 million or $0.30 per diluted share. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we reported a net loss of $20 million or $0.15 per diluted share. The adjusted loss from continuing operations for the quarter is $32 million or $0.23 per share based upon the normalized tax rate of 35%. This compares to a loss of $9 million or $0.06 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was negative $17 million in the quarter compared to positive EBITDA of $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2013.
On a year-to-date basis, we recorded $1 billion of net sales, a loss of $75 million and a loss per share of $0.53 as compared to net sales of $2.1 billion, net income of $177 million and earnings per share of $1.23 for the full year of 2013.
On a non-GAAP basis, we recorded an adjusted loss from continuing operations of $60 million, a loss per share of $0.42 and adjusted EBITDA of $44 million for the full year of 2014. In 2013, we recorded $121 million (sic) [ $129 million ] of adjusted income from continuing operations, earnings per share of $0.90, and adjusted EBITDA of $330 million. The most significant headwind experienced by LP in 2014 was a 26% decrease in OSB pricing. The lower OSB price impacted operating income and adjusted EBITDA by $298 million, which is more than the year-over-year decrease in adjusted EBITDA.
I will now move to Slide 5 and our view of our segment results, beginning with OSB. LP's OSB segment recorded an operating loss of $29 million and $203 million of sales in the quarter compared to operating profit of $7 million and $230 million of sales in the fourth quarter of 2013. For the quarter, we're reporting negative adjusted EBITDA of $15 million compared to positive EBITDA of $27 million (sic) [ $23 million ] in the fourth quarter of 2013. We had a 1% decrease in volume, and pricing for OSB was up 12% over the fourth quarter of 2013.
We took 136 down days during the quarter, which equates to approximately 200 million square feet. Most of the down days were market related. Capacity utilization of our operating mills for the quarter was approximately 77%.
For the full year, OSB had an operating loss of $53 million compared to income of $230 million in 2013. Adjusted EBITDA in 2014 was $4 million compared to $285 million in 2013. The impact of lower OSB pricing between the years was $298 million.
Slide 6 reports the results of the Siding business. This segment includes our SmartSide and CanExel siding product. The Siding segment reported sales of $141 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of 2% from $138 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2013. The Siding segment reported operating income of $14 million compared to $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, and adjusted EBITDA of $19 million as compared to $20 million in the same quarter of 2013.
During the quarter, the Siding segment did not produce any OSB compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 when the Siding segment produced 45 million square feet of OSB.
For the quarter, SmartSide average sales price were up 4% and volumes also increased 4%. Volume increased in our SmartSide siding line due to continued penetration in several key focus markets, including retail, repair/remodel and shed. However, the Siding segment was negatively impacted by log shortages in the Lake States. We estimate that the Siding business lost 45 days of downtime or 27 million square feet of production in the fourth quarter. We estimate that the gross margin on the lost sales along with a higher unabsorbed mill costs decreased adjusted EBITDA by $5 million for the quarter.
CanExel prices were down slightly in U.S. dollars or up 6% in Canadian dollars. Canada is CanExel's primary market. Volumes were up 11% in the quarter due to higher Canadian and international demand. And on a year-to-date basis, the Siding segment recorded $617 million in sales, $80 million in profit and $98 million in adjusted EBITDA. For 2013, the Siding segment reported sales of $574 million, profit of $86 million and adjusted EBITDA of $103 million.
In 2014, volumes of SmartSide increased 13% and prices increased 3%. The Siding segment produced 45 million square feet of OSB in 2014 as compared to 168 million square feet of OSB in 2013.
For the full year, the Siding segment was negatively impacted by log shortages. We estimate that the business lost 88 days or 53.8 million square feet of production due to the log shortage. We estimate the impact of these log shortages in operating income and adjusted EBITDA with just over $10 million for the year.
Please turn to Slide 3 (sic) [ Slide 7 ] of the presentation, which shows the results for our Engineered Wood Products segment. This segment includes I-Joists, Laminated Strand Lumber, Laminated Veneer Lumber, plus other related products. This segment also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi joint venture or under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood.
In past quarters, we've included log sales from our Malakwa forest licenses in this segment. But beginning this quarter and going forward, these sales and the associated operating income and adjusted EBITDA are being recorded as part of the Other Building Products category. The Other Building Products category includes log sales from other nonoperating mills. All prior periods have been adjusted.
The impact on EWP's results on an annual basis has been between $1 million and $1.5 million of adjusted EBITDA in each of the last 3 years. The Engineered Wood Products segment reported sales of $66 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, down slightly from the fourth quarter of 2013. The segment's operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $6 million as compared to a loss of $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. For the fourth quarter of 2014, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations declined to a negative $4 million as compared to breakeven in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Volumes of I-Joist were down 9%, while volumes of LVL and LSL were down 3% compared to the same quarter last year. Pricing was up 3% in I-Joist and 5% in LVL and LSL reflecting price increases in all products.
For 2014, Engineered Wood Products reported net sales of $281 million as compared to $250 million in 2013, a 12% increase. Sales volumes were up 6% in I-Joist, and 9% in LVL and LSL. For 2014, Engineered Wood Products -- in 2014, Engineered Wood Products recorded an operating loss of $14 million and reported breakeven adjusted EBITDA as compared to a loss of $15 million and negative EBITDA of $2 million for 2013.
Moving to Slide 8 of the presentation. For the quarter, our South American segment recorded sales of $36 million as compared to $41 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Operating income is $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. South America's adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $5 million for the fourth quarter of 2013 (sic) [ 2014 ], which is comparable to the fourth quarter of 2013.
Volumes in Chile were up 16% and lower by 27% in Brazil compared to the same quarter last year. Sales volume increase in Chile was primarily increased demand, offset by lower exports. In Brazil, the lower volume was primarily due to reduced exports to the Far East market. 
Pricing was down 16% in Chile and down 6% in Brazil. In local currency, Chile's pricing is 5% lower compared to the same quarter in 2013 due to continued pricing pressure from North American imports. And Brazil recorded a 1% improvement in pricing in local currency.
For the full year of 2014, South America recorded net sales of $150 million, profit of $11 million and adjusted EBITDA of $20 million. For 2013, South America recorded net sales of $172 million, profit of $20 million and adjusted EBITDA of $31 million.
Total selling, general and administrative costs were $41 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $47 million in the same quarter in 2013. For the full year of 2014, selling, general and administrative costs were about flat between the periods at $150 million. For the quarter, the reduction in SG&A costs was primarily related to lower incentive compensation.
Now please turn to Slide 9 of the presentation where we note that as of December 31, 2014, we had cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash of $548 million. Working capital of $778 million. Net cash of $177 million. In addition to the cash on our balance sheet, we have $200 million of availability on our credit facility. Capital expenditures for the year were $80 million.
Capital expenditures for 2015 are expected to be approximately $130 million of which around $80 million relates to our growth project, such as the Swan siding mill conversion and the third Chilean mill. And we did not repurchase any shares of LP stock during this quarter.
Now I'll turn the call over to Curt for his comments."

My comments today will focus on our accomplishments and challenges during the last year, talk about the current state of the housing market, and provide you with my views on what is ahead for us in 2015. I will conclude by discussing the executive leadership changes that we announced this morning.
From a safety perspective, LP had a total incident rate of 0.35 for 2014, the lowest level in LP's history. This is the ninth year in a row that our total incident rate has been below 1.0. In addition, we completed all of our capital work in 2014 without a single recordable injury to any of the many, many contractors that we used on site, a truly remarkable performance.
For the year, housing starts were at just over 1 million, led by a strong fourth quarter performance. However, this is only about a 9% increase compared to the beginning of the year forecast of a 20% plus increase. This shortfall put pressure on OSB pricing all year that resulted in North Central 7/16's pricing between $71 per 1,000 square feet lower than 2013, quite a disappointment for us.
In our Siding business, we had record shipments of SmartSide for the third year in a row. This success led us to convert all production at Hayward to Siding and to make the decision to accelerate the conversion of our Swan Valley, Manitoba OSB mill to siding production. We expect this to be operational early in the fourth quarter of this year.
In Engineered Wood, we again had record shipments of Laminated Strand Lumber products and higher volumes of both I-Joist and LVL than in 2013.
South America, weaker economies in both Chile and Brazil, plus the stronger U.S. dollar reduced results, but we were still profitable in both these operations. That leaves me to a few comments on the housing market. U.S. housing starts in December were at 1.089 million units with single-family starts at their highest level in 6.5 years. In addition, housing starts for both October and November were revised upward.
Housing permits were slightly below starts in December at 1.028 million. The average 30-year mortgage rate for the week ending January 23 was at 3.66, the lowest level since the spike in rates in May of 2013.
Last month, I attended the International Builders' Show in Las Vegas. The attendance was very strong with an estimate of 125,000 attendees. From the supplier perspective, I'd say there was a universal caution as we were all caught off guard by the slow pace of the housing recovery in 2014. Most are using around 1.1 million housing starts as a base assumption. Among the builders, I'd say there was more optimism around housing activity, but they expressed concerns in a number of areas: cost and availability of prime lots, availability of construction labor and upward pressure on labor cost, the cost of building products. And margin pressure as the ability to raise prices aggressively has dissipated.
Just last night, I returned from the Policy Advisory Board meeting of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies that was held in Washington, D.C. over the past 2 days. This is a group from all facets of the housing industry, builders, developers, producers, distributors, realtors, government agencies who support housing, banks and other financial institutions. I'm pleased to say that the general tenor of the meeting was the most positive in 5 years. The optimism was broad based, but the most discussed item was the expected return of the first-time homebuyer due to a variety of factors. Sallie mentioned household formations have been at an extremely low level for much of the great recession. These numbers shot up in the fourth quarter to 3x what they've been averaging over the last 3 years. Job growth and wage increases from an improving economy get much of the credit for this.
On the financing side, the lowering of premiums on mortgage insurance, the reemergence of the 3% down payment loans and more favorable credit standards are making financing more available for the first-time homebuyer.
At the meeting, there's also a discussions to try to assess the impact of falling oil prices on housing, and it appears to be a mixed bag. In the oil-producing areas, it doesn't appear that housing activity has slowed, but there's certainly a lot of talk about the timing of beginning new housing projects.
Lower fuel prices are adding to consumer confidence, which should accelerate household formation, a precursor to the first-time home sale or apartment rental.
As an aside, we do expect to have lower raw materials cost at our operations due to lower oil pricing, primarily resins and energy. Last December when we put our 2015 budget together, we estimated that the savings due to lower oil prices in the range of $25 million to $30 million. Today, with oil prices hovering just north of $50 a barrel, our estimated savings are in the $40 million to $50 million range.
In other markets, the National Association of Home Builder Remodeling index hit a record level in the fourth quarter of 2014. The Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies just released their emerging trends in the remodeling market where they concluded that this market will continue to strengthen.
For the strong U.S. dollar, we don't see exports returning any time soon to North America. For 2015 and 2016, we agree with the forecasters that housing is going to continue to get better. The consensus forecast for housing starts in 2015 now stands at 1.19 million and 1.426 million in 2016, a 10% increase this year, followed by a 20% increase next year. I'll take that. As I mentioned in our last call, we're using 1.1 million as our 2015 base forecast.
OSB pricing is critically important to us and our financial performance as demonstrated last year. Clearly, pricing was short of expectations in 2014 as new production that came online in anticipation of higher housing activity led to an imbalance between supply and demand.
While we don't provide guidance on earnings or OSB prices, we do use Forest Economic Advisors as a primary forecasting source. For 2015, they see an increase of about 8% in OSB prices and a further 14% increase in 2016.
We do see the Canadian dollar below the $0.90 level for 2015. To put this in perspective, the change in the exchange rate in 2014 compared to 2013 improved our results by about $14 million.
For the near term, we have several important projects on our growth agenda. We've been on allocation on our Siding business for several months due to log shortages in Lake States that caused production shortfalls. We've been working diligently to put logs into these mills so we can operate without interruption. If nature cooperates a bit, I think this will happen.
In addition, we kicked off an accelerated project to convert our Swan Valley, Manitoba OSB mill to siding production early in the fourth quarter. We have further capital projects under development to add capacity or capabilities at our other siding mills to meet customer demand. Having available siding capacity ahead of demand is a very high priority.
South America, we have submitted our environmental permits and have initial comments back for our third mill in Chile, and we have started the detailed engineering to be ready to begin construction when the permits are approved. We believe this will be sometime around the end of the summer.
While we would always like housing to recover more quickly, we are pleased with our positioning in the market, and we stand ready to serve the increased housing market activity.
Before I turn it over to Sallie for questions and answer, I do want to take a few minutes to discuss the management changes that we announced this morning. The good news is these announcements is that we have a broad and deep bench within LP to assume important roles. The bad news is that we will be losing 2 very talented executives and good friends to retirement. Here's the summary of the changes. Rick Olszewski, EVP of Sales and Marketing and South America, will be retiring at the end of March of this year. As Rick's title demonstrates, Rick is both the senior sales and marketing executive for LP and the executive in charge of our South American operations.
For the first responsibility, Rick will be replaced by Mike Sims, our current VP of OSB Sales, who has a new title of Senior VP, Sales and Marketing. Mike has over 30 years of experience in the selling and marketing of building products, and has held a senior role with LP since we acquired ABTco. in 1999. Because of the increased role of South American LP's growth plans, I will be taking over Rick's role in South America. And Frederick Price, President of LP's South America, will be reporting directly to me.
Jason Ringbloom, who's held a variety of sales roles with increasing responsibility over the years, will take Mike Sims spot as VP of OSB sales.
Jeff Wagner, our longtime EVP and GM of OSB, and I had been talking about his retirement plans for some time and decided that Jeff will leave his full-time employment with LP around the middle of this year. In the meantime, Jeff will report to me and assume responsibility for an important internal LP project to get better at growth and innovation. As we know, we can't rely solely on the housing recovery.
Brad Southern, a longtime LP officer and currently the Senior Vice President and General Manager of our Siding business, will assume Jeff's responsibility as EVP and General Manager of OSB. So you can tell, this creates more cascading.
Brian Luoma, another longtime LP employee and currently, Senior Vice President and GM of our Engineered Wood business, will replace Brad and become EVP and GM of Siding.
Neil Sherman, currently our VP of Procurement and Logistics, will take Brian's position and become Senior Vice President and GM of EWP.
Finally, Mike Blosser, LP's VP of EHS and Forestry will once again add Neil's prior responsibilities to his portfolio.
While it seems like a lot of change at once, we were able to make all these moves internally as a result of the talent pool within LP and our robust succession planning process. I'm fully confident that each of these changes will bring a new perspective to position and will allow our executive management to acquire new skills that will allow for increased responsibility in the future.
I want to publicly thank Jeff for the many contributions he made to LP over his 35-year plus career with the company and Rick for bringing sales and marketing to the forefront of what's historically a manufacturing company in his 8.5 years with LP.
Now I'll turn it back over to Sallie for questions."

And what we get there is we get a sales margin, we don't get a manufacturing margin. But we also have no investment in the plant and equipment. In our I-Joist business, probably 70% of our I-Joist has come out of the 2 joint venture mills that we have with AbitibiBowater. And there, again, we get the sales margin and we get half of the manufacturing margin, but not all of it. So if you were to look at it on an RO -- return on assets, we look really, really good. But if you look at it just on a margin, we don't capture the full margin either on those I-Joists or the JV because we only get half of it. And then in the Murphy, we just get a sales margin. So there's the difference in the operating models in that we don't own and operate all of our own facilities. But when you adjust for that, if you look at the sales pricing between the 2 other public entities, our sales pricing is right on top of -- maybe even a little bit ahead, and our manufacturing costs are right on top of them.

Well, thank you very much, Joyce, and good morning, and good afternoon for those of you on the East Coast. We thank you for joining our conference call today to discuss LP's financial results for the fourth quarter of 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2014.
I am Sallie Bailey, LP's Chief Financial Officer. And with me today are Curt Stevens, LP's Chief Executive Officer; as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barckley, our primary Investor Relations contact.
I'll begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the fourth quarter of 2014 and the full year. It will be followed by some comments on the performance of the individual segments and selected balance sheet items.
After I finished my comments, Curt will discuss the general market environment in which LP has been operating and provide his perspective on our operating results and give some thoughts on the outlook.
As we have done in the past, we have opened up this call to the public and we are doing a webcast. That webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. Additionally, to help with the discussion, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I will be referencing these slides in my comments this morning. We filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information and expect to file our Form 10-K before the end of the month.
I want to remind all the participants about the forward-looking statements comment on Slide 2 of the presentation. Please also be aware of the discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. The appendix attached to the presentation has some of the necessary reconciliation that has been supplemented by the Form 8-K filing we made this morning. Rather than reading these 2 statements, I incorporate them with this reference.
2014 was a challenging year for LP. Housing starts grew to just over 1 million starts or 9% higher than 2013. Single-family housing starts grew 5% year-over-year. At LP, we remain focused on activities which are in our control and continue to invest in our future, so we are prepared when U.S. housing starts return to its historical levels.
Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of the fourth quarter 2014 and the full year 2014 result. We reported net sales of $454 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, a 5% decline from the net sales of $480 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2013.
In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded net loss of $43 million or $0.30 per diluted share. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we reported a net loss of $20 million or $0.15 per diluted share. The adjusted loss from continuing operations for the quarter is $32 million or $0.23 per share based upon the normalized tax rate of 35%. This compares to a loss of $9 million or $0.06 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was negative $17 million in the quarter compared to positive EBITDA of $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2013.
On a year-to-date basis, we recorded $1 billion of net sales, a loss of $75 million and a loss per share of $0.53 as compared to net sales of $2.1 billion, net income of $177 million and earnings per share of $1.23 for the full year of 2013.
On a non-GAAP basis, we recorded an adjusted loss from continuing operations of $60 million, a loss per share of $0.42 and adjusted EBITDA of $44 million for the full year of 2014. In 2013, we recorded $121 million (sic) [ $129 million ] of adjusted income from continuing operations, earnings per share of $0.90, and adjusted EBITDA of $330 million. The most significant headwind experienced by LP in 2014 was a 26% decrease in OSB pricing. The lower OSB price impacted operating income and adjusted EBITDA by $298 million, which is more than the year-over-year decrease in adjusted EBITDA.
I will now move to Slide 5 and our view of our segment results, beginning with OSB. LP's OSB segment recorded an operating loss of $29 million and $203 million of sales in the quarter compared to operating profit of $7 million and $230 million of sales in the fourth quarter of 2013. For the quarter, we're reporting negative adjusted EBITDA of $15 million compared to positive EBITDA of $27 million (sic) [ $23 million ] in the fourth quarter of 2013. We had a 1% decrease in volume, and pricing for OSB was up 12% over the fourth quarter of 2013.
We took 136 down days during the quarter, which equates to approximately 200 million square feet. Most of the down days were market related. Capacity utilization of our operating mills for the quarter was approximately 77%.
For the full year, OSB had an operating loss of $53 million compared to income of $230 million in 2013. Adjusted EBITDA in 2014 was $4 million compared to $285 million in 2013. The impact of lower OSB pricing between the years was $298 million.
Slide 6 reports the results of the Siding business. This segment includes our SmartSide and CanExel siding product. The Siding segment reported sales of $141 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of 2% from $138 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2013. The Siding segment reported operating income of $14 million compared to $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, and adjusted EBITDA of $19 million as compared to $20 million in the same quarter of 2013.
During the quarter, the Siding segment did not produce any OSB compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 when the Siding segment produced 45 million square feet of OSB.
For the quarter, SmartSide average sales price were up 4% and volumes also increased 4%. Volume increased in our SmartSide siding line due to continued penetration in several key focus markets, including retail, repair/remodel and shed. However, the Siding segment was negatively impacted by log shortages in the Lake States. We estimate that the Siding business lost 45 days of downtime or 27 million square feet of production in the fourth quarter. We estimate that the gross margin on the lost sales along with a higher unabsorbed mill costs decreased adjusted EBITDA by $5 million for the quarter.
CanExel prices were down slightly in U.S. dollars or up 6% in Canadian dollars. Canada is CanExel's primary market. Volumes were up 11% in the quarter due to higher Canadian and international demand. And on a year-to-date basis, the Siding segment recorded $617 million in sales, $80 million in profit and $98 million in adjusted EBITDA. For 2013, the Siding segment reported sales of $574 million, profit of $86 million and adjusted EBITDA of $103 million.
In 2014, volumes of SmartSide increased 13% and prices increased 3%. The Siding segment produced 45 million square feet of OSB in 2014 as compared to 168 million square feet of OSB in 2013.
For the full year, the Siding segment was negatively impacted by log shortages. We estimate that the business lost 88 days or 53.8 million square feet of production due to the log shortage. We estimate the impact of these log shortages in operating income and adjusted EBITDA with just over $10 million for the year.
Please turn to Slide 3 (sic) [ Slide 7 ] of the presentation, which shows the results for our Engineered Wood Products segment. This segment includes I-Joists, Laminated Strand Lumber, Laminated Veneer Lumber, plus other related products. This segment also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi joint venture or under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood.
In past quarters, we've included log sales from our Malakwa forest licenses in this segment. But beginning this quarter and going forward, these sales and the associated operating income and adjusted EBITDA are being recorded as part of the Other Building Products category. The Other Building Products category includes log sales from other nonoperating mills. All prior periods have been adjusted.
The impact on EWP's results on an annual basis has been between $1 million and $1.5 million of adjusted EBITDA in each of the last 3 years. The Engineered Wood Products segment reported sales of $66 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, down slightly from the fourth quarter of 2013. The segment's operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $6 million as compared to a loss of $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. For the fourth quarter of 2014, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations declined to a negative $4 million as compared to breakeven in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Volumes of I-Joist were down 9%, while volumes of LVL and LSL were down 3% compared to the same quarter last year. Pricing was up 3% in I-Joist and 5% in LVL and LSL reflecting price increases in all products.
For 2014, Engineered Wood Products reported net sales of $281 million as compared to $250 million in 2013, a 12% increase. Sales volumes were up 6% in I-Joist, and 9% in LVL and LSL. For 2014, Engineered Wood Products -- in 2014, Engineered Wood Products recorded an operating loss of $14 million and reported breakeven adjusted EBITDA as compared to a loss of $15 million and negative EBITDA of $2 million for 2013.
Moving to Slide 8 of the presentation. For the quarter, our South American segment recorded sales of $36 million as compared to $41 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Operating income is $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. South America's adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $5 million for the fourth quarter of 2013 (sic) [ 2014 ], which is comparable to the fourth quarter of 2013.
Volumes in Chile were up 16% and lower by 27% in Brazil compared to the same quarter last year. Sales volume increase in Chile was primarily increased demand, offset by lower exports. In Brazil, the lower volume was primarily due to reduced exports to the Far East market. 
Pricing was down 16% in Chile and down 6% in Brazil. In local currency, Chile's pricing is 5% lower compared to the same quarter in 2013 due to continued pricing pressure from North American imports. And Brazil recorded a 1% improvement in pricing in local currency.
For the full year of 2014, South America recorded net sales of $150 million, profit of $11 million and adjusted EBITDA of $20 million. For 2013, South America recorded net sales of $172 million, profit of $20 million and adjusted EBITDA of $31 million.
Total selling, general and administrative costs were $41 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $47 million in the same quarter in 2013. For the full year of 2014, selling, general and administrative costs were about flat between the periods at $150 million. For the quarter, the reduction in SG&A costs was primarily related to lower incentive compensation.
Now please turn to Slide 9 of the presentation where we note that as of December 31, 2014, we had cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash of $548 million. Working capital of $778 million. Net cash of $177 million. In addition to the cash on our balance sheet, we have $200 million of availability on our credit facility. Capital expenditures for the year were $80 million.
Capital expenditures for 2015 are expected to be approximately $130 million of which around $80 million relates to our growth project, such as the Swan siding mill conversion and the third Chilean mill. And we did not repurchase any shares of LP stock during this quarter.
Now I'll turn the call over to Curt for his comments."

My comments today will focus on our accomplishments and challenges during the last year, talk about the current state of the housing market, and provide you with my views on what is ahead for us in 2015. I will conclude by discussing the executive leadership changes that we announced this morning.
From a safety perspective, LP had a total incident rate of 0.35 for 2014, the lowest level in LP's history. This is the ninth year in a row that our total incident rate has been below 1.0. In addition, we completed all of our capital work in 2014 without a single recordable injury to any of the many, many contractors that we used on site, a truly remarkable performance.
For the year, housing starts were at just over 1 million, led by a strong fourth quarter performance. However, this is only about a 9% increase compared to the beginning of the year forecast of a 20% plus increase. This shortfall put pressure on OSB pricing all year that resulted in North Central 7/16's pricing between $71 per 1,000 square feet lower than 2013, quite a disappointment for us.
In our Siding business, we had record shipments of SmartSide for the third year in a row. This success led us to convert all production at Hayward to Siding and to make the decision to accelerate the conversion of our Swan Valley, Manitoba OSB mill to siding production. We expect this to be operational early in the fourth quarter of this year.
In Engineered Wood, we again had record shipments of Laminated Strand Lumber products and higher volumes of both I-Joist and LVL than in 2013.
South America, weaker economies in both Chile and Brazil, plus the stronger U.S. dollar reduced results, but we were still profitable in both these operations. That leaves me to a few comments on the housing market. U.S. housing starts in December were at 1.089 million units with single-family starts at their highest level in 6.5 years. In addition, housing starts for both October and November were revised upward.
Housing permits were slightly below starts in December at 1.028 million. The average 30-year mortgage rate for the week ending January 23 was at 3.66, the lowest level since the spike in rates in May of 2013.
Last month, I attended the International Builders' Show in Las Vegas. The attendance was very strong with an estimate of 125,000 attendees. From the supplier perspective, I'd say there was a universal caution as we were all caught off guard by the slow pace of the housing recovery in 2014. Most are using around 1.1 million housing starts as a base assumption. Among the builders, I'd say there was more optimism around housing activity, but they expressed concerns in a number of areas: cost and availability of prime lots, availability of construction labor and upward pressure on labor cost, the cost of building products. And margin pressure as the ability to raise prices aggressively has dissipated.
Just last night, I returned from the Policy Advisory Board meeting of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies that was held in Washington, D.C. over the past 2 days. This is a group from all facets of the housing industry, builders, developers, producers, distributors, realtors, government agencies who support housing, banks and other financial institutions. I'm pleased to say that the general tenor of the meeting was the most positive in 5 years. The optimism was broad based, but the most discussed item was the expected return of the first-time homebuyer due to a variety of factors. Sallie mentioned household formations have been at an extremely low level for much of the great recession. These numbers shot up in the fourth quarter to 3x what they've been averaging over the last 3 years. Job growth and wage increases from an improving economy get much of the credit for this.
On the financing side, the lowering of premiums on mortgage insurance, the reemergence of the 3% down payment loans and more favorable credit standards are making financing more available for the first-time homebuyer.
At the meeting, there's also a discussions to try to assess the impact of falling oil prices on housing, and it appears to be a mixed bag. In the oil-producing areas, it doesn't appear that housing activity has slowed, but there's certainly a lot of talk about the timing of beginning new housing projects.
Lower fuel prices are adding to consumer confidence, which should accelerate household formation, a precursor to the first-time home sale or apartment rental.
As an aside, we do expect to have lower raw materials cost at our operations due to lower oil pricing, primarily resins and energy. Last December when we put our 2015 budget together, we estimated that the savings due to lower oil prices in the range of $25 million to $30 million. Today, with oil prices hovering just north of $50 a barrel, our estimated savings are in the $40 million to $50 million range.
In other markets, the National Association of Home Builder Remodeling index hit a record level in the fourth quarter of 2014. The Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies just released their emerging trends in the remodeling market where they concluded that this market will continue to strengthen.
For the strong U.S. dollar, we don't see exports returning any time soon to North America. For 2015 and 2016, we agree with the forecasters that housing is going to continue to get better. The consensus forecast for housing starts in 2015 now stands at 1.19 million and 1.426 million in 2016, a 10% increase this year, followed by a 20% increase next year. I'll take that. As I mentioned in our last call, we're using 1.1 million as our 2015 base forecast.
OSB pricing is critically important to us and our financial performance as demonstrated last year. Clearly, pricing was short of expectations in 2014 as new production that came online in anticipation of higher housing activity led to an imbalance between supply and demand.
While we don't provide guidance on earnings or OSB prices, we do use Forest Economic Advisors as a primary forecasting source. For 2015, they see an increase of about 8% in OSB prices and a further 14% increase in 2016.
We do see the Canadian dollar below the $0.90 level for 2015. To put this in perspective, the change in the exchange rate in 2014 compared to 2013 improved our results by about $14 million.
For the near term, we have several important projects on our growth agenda. We've been on allocation on our Siding business for several months due to log shortages in Lake States that caused production shortfalls. We've been working diligently to put logs into these mills so we can operate without interruption. If nature cooperates a bit, I think this will happen.
In addition, we kicked off an accelerated project to convert our Swan Valley, Manitoba OSB mill to siding production early in the fourth quarter. We have further capital projects under development to add capacity or capabilities at our other siding mills to meet customer demand. Having available siding capacity ahead of demand is a very high priority.
South America, we have submitted our environmental permits and have initial comments back for our third mill in Chile, and we have started the detailed engineering to be ready to begin construction when the permits are approved. We believe this will be sometime around the end of the summer.
While we would always like housing to recover more quickly, we are pleased with our positioning in the market, and we stand ready to serve the increased housing market activity.
Before I turn it over to Sallie for questions and answer, I do want to take a few minutes to discuss the management changes that we announced this morning. The good news is these announcements is that we have a broad and deep bench within LP to assume important roles. The bad news is that we will be losing 2 very talented executives and good friends to retirement. Here's the summary of the changes. Rick Olszewski, EVP of Sales and Marketing at South America, will be retiring at the end of March of this year. As Rick's title demonstrates, Rick is both the senior sales and marketing executive for LP and the executive in charge of our South American operations.
For the first responsibility, Rick will be replaced by Mike Sims, our current VP of OSB Sales, who has a new title of Senior VP, Sales and Marketing. Mike has over 30 years of experience in the selling and marketing of building products, and has held a senior role with LP since we acquired ABTco. in 1999. Because of the increased role of South American LP's growth plans, I will be taking over Rick's role in South America. And Frederick Price, President of LP's South America, will be reporting directly to me.
Jason Ringbloom, who's held a variety of sales roles with increasing responsibility over the years, will take Mike Sims spot as VP of OSB sales.
Jeff Wagner, our longtime EVP and GM of OSB, and I had been talking about his retirement plans for some time and decided that Jeff will leave his full-time employment with LP around the middle of this year. In the meantime, Jeff will report to me and assume responsibility for an important internal LP project to get better at growth and innovation. As we know, we can't rely solely on the housing recovery.
Brad Southern, a longtime LP officer and currently the Senior Vice President and General Manager of our Siding business, will assume Jeff's responsibility as EVP and General Manager of OSB. So you can tell, this creates more cascading.
Brian Luoma, another longtime LP employee and currently, Senior Vice President and GM of our Engineered Wood business, will replace Brad and become EVP and GM of Siding.
Neil Sherman, currently our VP of Procurement and Logistics, will take Brian's position and become Senior Vice President and GM of EWP.
Finally, Mike Blosser, LP's VP of EHS and Forestry will once again add Neil's prior responsibilities to his portfolio.
While it seems like a lot of change at once, we were able to make all these moves internally as a result of the talent pool within LP and our robust succession planning process. I'm fully confident that each of these changes will bring a new perspective to position and will allow our executive management to acquire new skills that will allow for increased responsibility in the future.
I want to publicly thank Jeff for the many contributions he made to LP over his 35-year plus career with the company and Rick for bringing sales and marketing to the forefront of what's historically a manufacturing company in his 8.5 years with LP.
Now I'll turn it back over to Sallie for questions."

So we're not seeing on the transportation side. On the log side, we have not seen any relief in the Lake States on pricing. We've seen a little bit more availability but not on the pricing. In the South, we do expect log pricing to come off a little bit, but not significantly."

In our I-Joist business, probably 70% of our I-Joist has come out of the 2 joint venture mills that we have with AbitibiBowater. And there, again, we get the sales margin and we get half of the manufacturing margin, but not all of it. So if you were to look at it on an RO -- return on assets, we look really, really good. But if you look at it just on a margin, we don't capture the full margin either on those I-Joists or the JV because we only get half of it. And then in the Murphy, we just get a sales margin. So there's the difference in the operating models in that we don't own and operate all of our own facilities. But when you adjust for that, if you look at the sales pricing between the 2 other public entities, our sales pricing is right on top of -- maybe even a little bit ahead, and our manufacturing costs are right on top of them.

Thank you very much, Michelle, and good morning. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss LP's financial results for the first quarter of 2015. I am Sallie Bailey, LP's Chief Financial Officer, and with me today are Curt Stevens, LP's C",1703,"Great. Thank you very much, Michelle, and good morning. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss LP's financial results for the first quarter of 2015. I am Sallie Bailey, LP's Chief Financial Officer, and with me today are Curt Stevens, LP's Chief Executive Officer; as well as Mike Kinney; and Becky Barckley, our primary Investor Relations contact.
I will begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the first quarter of 2015. This will be followed by some comments on the performance of the individual segments and selected balance sheet items. After I finish my remarks, Curt will discuss the general market environment in which LP has been operating, provide his perspective on our operating results and give some thoughts on the outlook. As we have done in the past, we have opened up this call to the public and are doing a webcast. And that webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. 
Additionally, to help with the discussion, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with our earnings release. I will be referencing these slides in my comments this morning. We have filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information as well as our Form 10-Q. I want to remind all the participants about the forward-looking statements comments on Slide 2 of the presentation. Please also be aware of the discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. The appendix attached to the presentation have some of the necessary reconciliation that has been supplemented by the Form 8-K filing we've made this morning. Rather than reading these 2 statements, I incorporated them with this reference.
The housing market was still in recovery mode for the first quarter during 2015. The results in our OSB segment reflects the lower pricing environment, down 13% from last year and impacted the company's financial results for the quarter. The reduction in OSB pricing accounts for approximately $29 million of the change in our operating loss and adjusted EBITDA relative to the first quarter of 2014. The stronger dollar, lower raw material cost, better plant operating performance and the record-setting quarter on our Siding segment offset the impact of the decline in OSB price. 
With that let me go into the details. Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of the first quarter 2015 consolidated results. We are reporting net sales of $472 million for the first quarter of 2015, a 6% increase from the net sales of $445 million reported in the first quarter of 2014. In the first quarter, we recorded a net loss of $35 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.24 as compared to a net loss for the first 3 months of 2014 of $14 million or loss of $0.10 per diluted share. 
Included in our GAAP results for the quarter is $11.6 million write-off of the timber licenses associated with our indefinitely idle facility. Given our ongoing losses in Canada, this write-off provides no immediate tax benefit to LP due to our valuation reserves. The Ministry of Forestry terminated our license in the first quarter of 2015, and Curt will discuss this a bit more detail in a few minutes. The adjusted loss for quarter was $19 million or loss of $0.13 per diluted share, based upon the normalized tax rate of 35% compared to adjusted loss of $7 million or a loss of $0.05 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2014. 
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $6 million in the quarter compared to $23 million in the first quarter of 2014. 
I'll move to Slide 5 and review of our segment results. Beginning with our OSB. OSB recorded an operating loss of $28 million on $190 million of sales in the quarter, compared to an operating loss of $2 million on $195 million of sales in the first quarter of 2014. For the quarter, we are reporting negative adjusted EBITDA of $13 million compared to positive EBITDA of $12 million in the first quarter of 2014. We have a 14% increase in sales volume and a 4% increase in the OSB segment production. Pricing for OSB was down 13% over the first quarter of 2014. The decrease in pricing resulted in lower operating results by about $29 million. OSB segment 127 down days or the equivalent of just under 200 million square feet of reduced production during the quarter. 
Despite the significant number of down days, our cost of sale per MSF improved relative to the first quarter of 2014 as well as the fourth quarter of 2014, due to the impacts of the weaker Canadian dollar, lower raw material cost and improved operating performance at our Clarke County facility. 
Slide 6 reports the result of the Siding segment. This segment includes our SmartSide and CanExel siding products. The first quarter of 2015 was a record quarter for the Siding segment for sales, operating income and adjusted EBITDA. The Siding segment reported sales of $174 million in the first quarter of 2015, an increase of 21% from $144 million reported in the first quarter of 2014. The Siding segment reported operating income of $33 million compared to $19 million in the first quarter of 2014, and adjusted EBITDA of $38 million as compared to $24 million in the same quarter of 2014. For the second quarter in a row, the Siding segment did not produce any OSB. 
Consistent with the past several quarters, the Siding segment continue to experience higher wood cost. However, we are able to acquire logs, run our facility as planned and took no downtime in the quarter related to offshore The higher wood comps in the first quarter of 2015 were partially offset by lower resin costs and improved absorption in our manufacturing facility. The results for the quarter were also positively impacted by improved product mix and higher sales volume. 
For the quarter, SmartSide average sale prices were up 8% and volumes increased 19%. Volumes increased on our SmartSide siding line due to continued penetration in several key focus markets, including retail, repair and remodel and markets and sheds. CanExel prices were flat in U.S. dollars, so were the prices were up 12% in Canadian dollars, which is CanExel's primary market. Volumes were down 18% in the quarter, due to decreases in Canadian and international demand. 
Please turn to Slide 7 of the presentation, which shows the results for our Engineered Wood Products segment. The segment includes I-Joist, Laminated Strand Lumber, Laminated Veneer Lumber plus other related products. This segment also includes the sale of our I-Joist and products produced by the Abitibi joint venture under our sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. 
The EWP segment did produce 10 million square feet of OSB in the first quarter of 2015 under the facility. 
The Engineered Wood Products segment recorded sales of $65 million in the first quarter of 2015, up from $62 million in the first quarter of 2014. The segment's operating loss in the first quarter of 2015 was $4 million as compared to a loss of $3 million in the first quarter of 2014. 
For the first quarter of 2015, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations declined to a negative $400,000 as compared to a positive adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2014. Volumes of I-Joist were down 12%, primarily due to lower volumes in Western Canada. While volumes of LVL and LSL were up 16% compared to the same quarter last year, as we focus more on exports and industrial markets. 
Pricing was up 6% in I-Joist and down 3% in LVL and LSL. The increase in I-Joist reflects price increases introduced to offset rising raw material cost during 2014. The decline in LVL and LSL reflects changes in mix through a higher percentage of industrial uses, which are sold at a lower price. 
Turning to Slide 8 of the presentation. For the quarter, our South American segment recorded sales of $36 million as compared to $37 million in the first quarter of 2014. Operating income was $2 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $4 million in the first quarter of 2014. South America's adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $5 million for the first quarter of 2014 as compared to $7 million in the first quarter of 2014. 
Volumes in the quarter were up 31% and lower by 18% in Brazil compared to the same quarter last year. The sales volume increase in Chile was primarily due to improved housing demand. In Brazil, the reduction in sales volume was due to the economic recession, which led to loss of demand. Pricing was down 13% in Chile and down 16% in Brazil. And in local currency, chile's pricing is lower by 1% compared with the same quarter in 2014, and Brazil recorded a 3% improvement in pricing. 
Total SG&A costs were $39 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $41 million in the same quarter of 2014. For the quarter, the reduction in SG&A cost is primarily related to legal costs incurred in the 2014 associated with the aborted Ainsworth transaction. We recorded $2 million of foreign exchange loss in the quarter compared to $4 million loss in the same quarter last year. And net interest expense was flat between quarters. 
Please refer to Slide 9 of the presentation. As of March 31, 2015, we have cash, cash equivalent of investments and restricted cash of $483 million, working capital of $742 million, net cash of $114 million, and in addition to the $483 million of cash on our balance sheet, we have $200 million availability on our credit facility. March year-to-date capital expenditures were $15 million. We do expect capital expenditures for 2015 to be in the range of $120 million to $130 million, with over half of this amount related to the Swan Valley mill conversion. We did not repurchase any shares of LP stock during the quarter, but we do continue to evaluate opportunities to repurchase shares, along with other uses of the company's capital. I will turn the call over to Curt for his comments."

Good morning to all of you and thanks for joining us on the call. Let me start with LP's safety performance.

Good morning to all of you and thanks for joining us on the call. Let me start with LP's safety performance. Last week, the APA announced the results of their safety and health awards program for 2014. I'm pleased that LP was named the Safest Large Company in our industry for the year. This is the fifth time we have been so recognized in the last 7 years. We also had 10 facilities included in the Incident-free Honor Society. I'm very proud of one of our employees recognize the value of being safe and act accordingly. 
In addition to the obvious savings in Worker's Compensation cost, LP believes that our safety culture gives us the competitive edge in the hiring and retention of our employees. 
This morning I'll provide a few comments on the results in the first quarter, talk about the state of the housing market and give you my views for the next several quarters. After that, I'll turn the call back to Sallie for questions. 
With 2 notable exceptions that negatively affected our results, OSB pricing and the write-off of the wood license, LP actually had a pretty good quarter. Let me just start with quick review of the 2 negative items. OSB pricing has fallen below analyst's projections for the last 6 quarters, and Random Lengths was 12% an already low 2014 pricing level. They easy scapegoat in Q1 is always the weather. While I know this did have an impact, the primary driver of lower pricing was more available supply than demand. As a result, we had to take significant downtime in our mills in the quarter. 
In Q2, we continue to evaluate and take market-related downtime as the recovery in residential demand has been short of economists projections. Further, while we are meeting our commitments to our customers, they're also aggressively exploring other applications beyond single-family new construction. These areas include repairing modeling, industrial, transportation and modest exports. 
Let me give you some background to Chambord wood license. We indefinitely curtailed production at the Chambord Québec mill in 2008 as the great recession whacked housing. Over the intervening years, we have been a regular contact with Québec government and we've met all of our mutually agreed upon obligations to obtain the license. Over the last year, there's been increasing pressure to use the wood to create jobs in the area. Unfortunately, the government decided that they would not wait for LP to restart the mill and informed us quarter that they have canceled our wood license. They will be setting up a project office to review alternative proposals for the wood. We'll be a part of this process and believe that the LP mills still the best alternative to use the wood in the area. We do have other options for these assets also been exploring. As to the write-off, the accounting rules dictated that we take on noncash charge for the carrying value of the wood license. 
On the positive side, as Sallie mentioned, our Siding business had a record quarter, SmartSide shipments, revenue and EBITDA. We did enjoy lower resin cost in Q1 and the lower Canadian dollar made our operations north of the border more competitive. Efforts to fully convert our Swan Valley to SmartSide production are underway, with initial production expected in Q4 of this year. 
Next, let me just share some views on the housing market. As you know, there are mountains of data on the featured housing market that are confusing, sometimes conflicting and definitely frustrating. But bottom line housing is improving, but not at the pace forecast by most economists. Here are some numbers expect that housing starts. The consensus forecast for this year is 1.153 million, which would represented a 15% increase over 2014. Consensus forecast for 2016 stands at 1.36 million, which is a further 18% increase on the forecast for this year. At LP, as I mentioned last quarter, we forecast 1.1 million housing starts for 2015 and I believe that still works like a reasonable number. In 2016, we expect a 10% to 15% improvement in starts. 
Other positive housing-related news, household formations accelerated in Q4 to 1.7 million and all that up about 1.5 million in Q1 of this year. This is much better than the anemic 400,000 to 500,000 piece over the last several years. And when the household is formed, it's usually means that the home is occupied, which is good news for our industry. A Deutsche Bank economist just published following tidbit, which might be of interest. The number of people per household returns to the 2000 to 2003 level, this would lead to 4 million new households, a very positive for housing looking forward. 
Mortgage rates remain below 4%, the inventory of new and existing homes for sale is shrinking, and most of the big boulders who have reported first quarter results have mentioned a strong spring selling season. Repair and model expenditures are expected to be strong, and the rental vacancy rate is t the's lowest level in 20 years. 
So what does this all mean for LP in the next several quarters? With spring finally happening in most of the country and positive momentum in the housing sector, we should see increased demand in North America. Obviously, we would like to see improvement in OSB pricing as well. With high channel inventories and ready wood in the market, we didn't see an increase in pricing or demand in April. We have taken steps to adjust our production levels to take this into consideration as we focus on meeting our customer commitments while limiting the sale of unprofitable open market wood. Before I turn back to Sallie, let me make a few comments South America. We continue to see high demand in Chile due to increased spending by government on housing. And with the terrible floods in Northern Chile, 24,000 homes were destroyed and we are helping with emergency shelters. We are supplying this currently from brazil. And as you know, we are working on a project to add a third mill into Chile to eliminate the costly freight coming from Brazil. With that, let me turn it back to Sallie for questions."

One, siding is not solely tied to single-family new construction. We have a big repair remodel portion of that. We also have at least 2 SKUs in every Home Depot, Lowe's and the Nordstrom North America. So we've been exploring those other markets and satisfying the needs there. In the first quarter, little bit of an anomaly is in the repair and model business. They need to prefinish -- we have a series of prefinishers that our customers that then sell directly into the market. Those pre-finishers don't have the capability of finishing enough product to meet the annual demand unless they do it in first quarter. So there is a little bit of a channel fill with the repair remodel part of that, and we enjoy those volumes that went into that market. As far as the sustainability going forward, for the next 2 quarters -- actually, the next 3 quarters, will be constrained until Swan Valley comes online. As Sallie said, we didn't produce any OSB in our siding mills. We ran them basically at capacity, but we also call down our inventories in the first quarter. And we won't have the opportunity to do that for the next couple of quarters."

What we did is we reach further out principally into Canada. And again, we were aided by the Canadian exchange rate, so that helped us a little bit. So we are going to pull in wood from Canada to support those mills  probably for the next couple of years. But then at that point in time, it also depends on what happens with the pulp mills in the area, we would expect to see wood cost to come down a little bit."

Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss LP's financial results for the first quarter of 2015. I am Sallie Bailey, LP's Chief Financial Officer, and with me today are Curt Stevens, LP's Chief Executive Officer; as well as Mike Kinney; and Becky Barckley, our primary Investor Relations contact.
I will begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the first quarter of 2015. This will be followed by some comments on the performance of the individual segments and selected balance sheet items. After I finish my remarks, Curt will discuss the general market environment in which LP has been operating, provide his perspective on our operating results and give some thoughts on the outlook. As we have done in the past, we have opened up this call to the public and are doing a webcast. And that webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. 
Additionally, to help with the discussion, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I will be referencing these slides in my comments this morning. We have filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information as well as our Form 10-Q. I want to remind all the participants about the forward-looking statements comments on Slide 2 of the presentation. Please also be aware of the discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. The appendix attached to the presentation have some of the necessary reconciliations that has been supplemented by the Form 8-K filing we made this morning. Rather than reading these 2 statements, I incorporated them with this reference.
The housing market was still in recovery mode for the first quarter during 2015. The results in our OSB segment reflects the lower pricing environment, down 13% from last year and impacted the company's financial results for the quarter. The reduction in OSB pricing accounts for approximately $29 million of the change in our operating loss and adjusted EBITDA relative to the first quarter of 2014. The stronger dollar, lower raw material costs, better plant operating performance and the record-setting quarter on our Siding segment offset the impact of the decline in OSB price. 
With that let me go into the details. Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of the first quarter 2015 consolidated results. We are reporting net sales of $472 million for the first quarter of 2015, a 6% increase from the net sales of $445 million reported in the first quarter of 2014. In the first quarter, we recorded a net loss of $35 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.24 as compared to a net loss for the first 3 months of 2014 of $14 million or loss of $0.10 per diluted share. 
Included in our GAAP results for the quarter is $11.6 million write-off of the timber licenses associated with our indefinitely idle Chambord, Québec facility. Given our ongoing losses in Canada, this write-off provides no immediate tax benefit to LP due to our valuation reserves. The Québec Ministry of Forestry terminated our license in the first quarter of 2015, and Curt will discuss this a bit more in more detail in a few minutes. The adjusted loss for quarter was $19 million or loss of $0.13 per diluted share, based upon the normalized tax rate of 35% compared to adjusted loss of $7 million or a loss of $0.05 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2014. 
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $6 million in the quarter compared to $23 million in the first quarter of 2014. 
I'll move to Slide 5 and review of our segment results. Beginning with our OSB. OSB recorded an operating loss of $28 million on $190 million of sales in the quarter compared to an operating loss of $2 million on $195 million of sales in the first quarter of 2014. For the quarter, we are reporting negative adjusted EBITDA of $13 million compared to positive EBITDA of $12 million in the first quarter of 2014. We have a 14% increase in sales volume and a 4% increase in the OSB segment's production. Pricing for OSB was down 13% over the first quarter of 2014. The decrease in pricing resulted in lower operating results by about $29 million. OSB segment took 127 down days or the equivalent of just under 200 million square feet of reduced production during the quarter. 
Despite the significant number of down days, our cost of sales per MSF improved relative to the first quarter of 2014, as well as the fourth quarter of 2014, due to the impacts of the weaker Canadian dollar, lower raw material costs and improved operating performance at our Clarke County facility. 
Slide 6 reports the results of the Siding segment. This segment includes our SmartSide and CanExel siding products. The first quarter of 2015 was a record quarter for the Siding segment for sales, operating income and adjusted EBITDA. The Siding segment reported sales of $174 million in the first quarter of 2015, an increase of 21% from $144 million reported in the first quarter of 2014. The Siding segment reported operating income of $33 million compared to $19 million in the first quarter of 2014, and adjusted EBITDA of $38 million as compared to $24 million in the same quarter of 2014. For the second quarter in a row, the Siding segment did not produce any OSB. 
Consistent with the past several quarters, the Siding segment continue to experience higher wood cost. However, we are able to acquire logs, run our facility as planned and took no downtime in the quarter related to log shortages. The higher wood costs in the first quarter of 2015 were partially offset by lower resin costs and improved absorption in our manufacturing facility. The results for the quarter were also positively impacted by improved product mix and higher sales volume. 
For the quarter, SmartSide average sale prices were up 8% and volumes increased 19%. Volumes increased in our SmartSide siding line due to continued penetration in several key focus markets, including retail, repair and remodel and markets and sheds. CanExel prices were flat in U.S. dollars, so were the prices were up 12% in Canadian dollars, which is CanExel's primary market. Volumes were down 18% in the quarter, due to decreases in Canadian and international demand. 
Please turn to Slide 7 of the presentation, which shows the results for our Engineered Wood Products segment. The segment includes I-Joist, Laminated Strand Lumber, Laminated Veneer Lumber plus other related products. This segment also includes the sale of our I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi joint venture are under our sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. 
The EWP segment did produce 10 million square feet of OSB in the first quarter of 2015 under the Houlton, Maine facility. 
The Engineered Wood Products segment recorded sales of $65 million in the first quarter of 2015, up from $62 million in the first quarter of 2014. The segment's operating loss in the first quarter of 2015 was $4 million as compared to a loss of $3 million in the first quarter of 2014. 
For the first quarter of 2015, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations declined to a negative $400,000 as compared to a positive adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2014. Volumes of I-Joist were down 12%, primarily due to lower volumes in Western Canada. While volumes of LVL and LSL were up 16% compared to the same quarter of last year, as we focus more on exports and industrial markets. 
Pricing was up 6% in the I-Joist and down 3% in LVL and LSL. The increase in I-Joist reflects price increases introduced to offset rising raw material costs during 2014. The decline in LVL and LSL reflects changes in mix through a higher percentage of industrial uses, which are sold at a lower price. 
Turning to Slide 8 of the presentation. For the quarter, our South American segment recorded sales of $36 million as compared to $37 million in the first quarter of 2014. Operating income was $2 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $4 million in the first quarter of 2014. South America's adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $5 million for the first quarter of 2014 as compared to $7 million in the first quarter of 2014. 
Volumes in the quarter were up 31% and lower by 18% in Brazil compared to the same quarter of last year. The sales volume increase in Chile was primarily due to improved housing demand. In Brazil, the reduction in sales volume was due to the economic recession, which led to loss of demand. Pricing was down 13% in Chile and down 16% in Brazil. And in local currency, Chile's pricing is lower by 1% compared with the same quarter in 2014, and Brazil recorded a 3% improvement in pricing. 
Total SG&A costs were $39 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $41 million in the same quarter of 2014. For the quarter, the reduction in SG&A costs is primarily related to legal costs incurred in 2014 associated with the aborted Ainsworth transaction. We recorded $2 million of foreign exchange loss in the quarter compared to $4 million loss in the same quarter of last year. And net interest expense was flat between quarters. 
Please refer to Slide 9 of the presentation. As of March 31, 2015, we have cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash of $483 million, working capital of $742 million, net cash of $114 million, and in addition to the $483 million of cash on our balance sheet, we have $200 million availability on our credit facility. March year-to-date capital expenditures were $15 million. We do expect capital expenditures for 2015 to be in the range of $120 million to $130 million, with over half of this amount related to the Swan Valley mill conversion. We did not repurchase any shares of LP's stock during the quarter, but we do continue to evaluate opportunities to repurchase shares, along with other uses of the company's capital. Now I will turn the call over to Curt for his comments."

Good morning to all of you and thanks for joining us on the call. Let me start with LP's safety performance. Last week, the APA announced the results of their safety and health awards program for 2014. I'm pleased that LP was named the Safest Large Company in our industry for the year. This is the fifth time we have been so recognized in the last 7 years. We also had 10 facilities included in the Incident Free Honor Society. I'm very proud of all of our employees who recognize the value of being safe and act accordingly. 
In addition to the obvious savings in Worker's Compensation costs, LP believes that our safety culture gives us the competitive edge in the hiring and retention of our employees. 
This morning I'll provide a few comments on the results of the first quarter, talk about the state of the housing market and give you my views for the next several quarters. After that, I'll turn the call back to Sallie for questions. 
With 2 notable exceptions that negatively affected our results, OSB pricing and the write-off of the wood license, LP actually had a pretty good quarter. Let me just start with quick review of the 2 negative items. OSB pricing has fallen below analyst's projections for the last 6 quarters, and Random Lengths, North Central was 12%, an already low 2014 pricing level. The easy scapegoat in Q1 is always the weather. While I know this did have an impact, the primary driver of lower pricing was more available supply than demand. As a result, we had to take significant downtime in our mills in the quarter. 
In Q2, we continue to evaluate and take market-related downtime as the recovery in new residential demand has been short of economists projections. Further, while we are meeting our commitments to our customers, they're also aggressively exploring other applications beyond single-family new construction. These areas include repair and remodeling, industrial, transportation and modest exports. 
Let me give you some background to Chambord wood license. We indefinitely curtailed production at the Chambord, Québec mill in 2008 as the great recession whacked housing. Over the intervening years, we have been a regular contact with Québec government and we've met all of our mutually agreed upon obligations to retain the license. Over the last year, there's been increasing pressure to use the wood to create jobs in the area. Unfortunately, the government decided that they would now wait for LP to restart the mill and informed us quarter that they had canceled our wood license. They will be setting up a project office to review alternative proposals for the wood. We'll be a part of this process and believe that the LP mill is still the best alternative to use the wood in the area. We do have other options for these assets, who are also being exploring. As to the write-off, the accounting rules dictated that we take a noncash charge for the carrying value of the wood license. 
On the positive side, as Sallie mentioned, our Siding business had a record quarter, SmartSide shipments, revenue and EBITDA. We did enjoy lower resin costs in Q1 and the lower Canadian dollar made our operations north of the border more competitive. Efforts to fully convert our Swan Valley to SmartSide production are underway, with initial production expected in Q4 of this year. 
Next, let me just share some views on the housing market. As you know, there are mountains of data on the future of the housing market that are confusing, sometimes conflicting and definitely frustrating. My bottom line housing is improving, but not at the pace forecast by most economists. Here are some numbers on expected housing starts. The consensus forecast for this year is 1.153 million, which would represent a 15% increase over 2014. Consensus forecast for 2016 stands at 1.36 million, which is a further 18% increase on the forecast for this year. At LP, as I mentioned last quarter, we forecast 1.1 million housing starts for 2015 and I believe that still works like a reasonable number. In 2016, we expect a 10% to 15% improvement in starts. 
Other positive housing-related news, household formations accelerated in Q4 to 1.7 million and all that up was about 1.5 million in Q1 of this year. This is much better than the anemic 400,000 to 500,000 pace of the last several years. And when the household is formed, it's usually means that a home is occupied, which is good news for the industry. A Deutsche Bank economist just published following tidbit which might be of interest. The number of people per household returns to the 2000 to 2003 level, this would lead to 4 million new households, a very positive for housing looking forward. 
Mortgage rates remain below 4%, the inventory of new and existing homes for sale is shrinking and most of the big boulders who have reported first quarter results have mentioned a strong spring selling season. Repair/remodel expenditures are expected to be strong and the rental vacancy rate is at the lowest level in 20 years. 
So what does this all mean for LP in the next several quarters? With spring finally happening in most of the country and positive momentum in the housing sector, we should see increased demand in North America. Obviously, we would like to see improvement in OSB pricing as well. With high channel inventories and ready wood in the market, we didn't see an increase in pricing or demand in April. We have taken steps to adjust our production levels to take this into consideration as we focus on meeting our customer commitments while limiting the sale of unprofitable open market wood. Before I turn back to Sallie, let me make a few comments on South America. We continue to see high demand in Chile due to increased spending by the government on housing. And with the terrible floods in Northern Chile, 24,000 homes were destroyed and we are helping with emergency shelters. We are supplying this demand currently from Brazil. And as you know, we are working on a project to add a third mill into Chile to eliminate the costly freight coming from Brazil. With that, let me turn it back over to Sallie for questions."

One, Siding is not solely tied to single-family new construction. We have a big repair/remodel portion of that. And we also have at least 2 SKUs in every Home Depot, Lowe's and the Nordstrom, North America. So we've been exploring those other markets and satisfying the needs there. In the first quarter, a little bit of an anomaly is in the repair/remodel business. They need to pre-finish, we have a series of pre-finishers that are our customers that then sell directly into the market. Those pre-finishers don't have the capability of finishing enough product to meet the annual demand unless they do it in first quarter. So there is a little bit of a channel fill for the repair/remodel part of that, and we enjoyed those volumes that went into that market. As far as the sustainability going forward, for the next 2 quarters -- actually, the next 3 quarters will be constrained until Swan Valley comes online. As Sallie said, we didn't produce any OSB in our siding mills. We ran them basically at capacity, but we also pulled down our inventories in the first quarter.

So we utilized the increased capacity at Tomahawk plus the conversion of the OSB we're running to Siding. So that allowed us to sell more product. And we are gaining traction in the market, there's no question about that. We are seeing single-family new construction is coming back a little bit, we do have presence in the multifamily with that product. And then repair/remodel and the nonresidential structures have really been the bulk of the growth over the last year."

I am Sallie Bailey, LP's Chief Financial Officer, and with me today are Curt Stevens, LP's Chief Executive Officer; as well as Mike Kinney; and Becky Barckley, our primary Investor Relations contact.
I will begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the first quarter of 2015. This will be followed by some comments on the performance of the individual segments and selected balance sheet items. After I finish my remarks, Curt will discuss the general market environment in which LP has been operating, provide his perspective on our operating results and give some thoughts on the outlook. As we have done in the past, we have opened up this call to the public and are doing a webcast. And that webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. 
Additionally, to help with the discussion, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I will be referencing these slides in my comments this morning. We have filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information as well as our Form 10-Q. I want to remind all the participants about the forward-looking statements comments on Slide 2 of the presentation. Please also be aware of the discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. The appendix attached to the presentation have some of the necessary reconciliations that has been supplemented by the Form 8-K filing we made this morning. Rather than reading these 2 statements, I incorporate them with this reference.
The housing market was still in recovery mode for the first quarter during 2015. The results in our OSB segment reflect the lower pricing environment, down 13% from last year and impacted the company's financial results for the quarter. The reduction in OSB pricing accounted for approximately $29 million of the change in our operating loss and adjusted EBITDA relative to the first quarter of 2014. The stronger dollar, lower raw material costs, better plant operating performance and a record-setting quarter on our Siding segment offset the impact of the decline in OSB price. 
With that let me go into the details. Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of the first quarter 2015 consolidated results. We are reporting net sales of $472 million for the first quarter of 2015, a 6% increase from the net sales of $445 million reported in the first quarter of 2014. In the first quarter, we recorded a net loss of $35 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.24 as compared to a net loss for the first 3 months of 2014 of $14 million or a loss of $0.10 per diluted share. 
Included in our GAAP results for the quarter is $11.6 million write-off of the timber licenses associated with our indefinitely idle Chambord, Québec facility. Given our ongoing losses in Canada, this write-off provides no immediate tax benefit to LP due to our valuation reserves. The Québec Ministry of Forestry terminated our license in the first quarter of 2015, and Curt will discuss this a bit more in more detail in a few minutes. The adjusted loss for the quarter was $19 million or a loss of $0.13 per diluted share, based upon the normalized tax rate of 35% compared to adjusted loss of $7 million or a loss of $0.05 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2014. 
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $6 million in the quarter compared to $23 million in the first quarter of 2014. 
I'll move to Slide 5, a review of our segment results. Beginning with OSB. OSB recorded an operating loss of $28 million on $190 million of sales in the quarter compared to an operating loss of $2 million on $195 million of sales in the first quarter of 2014. For the quarter, we are reporting negative adjusted EBITDA of $13 million compared to positive EBITDA of $12 million in the first quarter of 2014. We have a 14% increase in sales volume and a 4% increase in the OSB segment's production. Pricing for OSB was down 13% over the first quarter of 2014. The decrease in pricing resulted in lower operating results by about $29 million. The OSB segment took 127 down days or the equivalent of just under 200 million square feet of reduced production during the quarter. 
Despite the significant number of down days, our cost of sales per MSF improved relative to the first quarter of 2014, as well as the fourth quarter of 2014, due to the impact of the weaker Canadian dollar, lower raw material costs and improved operating performance at our Clarke County facility. 
Slide 6 reports the results of the Siding segment. This segment includes our SmartSide and CanExel siding products. The first quarter of 2015 was a record quarter for the Siding segment for sales, operating income and adjusted EBITDA. The Siding segment reported sales of $174 million in the first quarter of 2015, an increase of 21% from $144 million reported in the first quarter of 2014. The Siding segment reported operating income of $33 million compared to $19 million in the first quarter of 2014, and adjusted EBITDA of $38 million as compared to $24 million in the same quarter of 2014. For the second quarter in a row, the Siding segment did not produce any OSB. 
Consistent with the past several quarters, the Siding segment continued to experience higher wood costs. However, we were able to acquire logs, run our facility as planned and took no downtime in the quarter related to log shortages. The higher wood costs in the first quarter of 2015 were partially offset by lower resin costs and improved absorption in our manufacturing facility. The results for the quarter were also positively impacted by improved product mix and higher sales volume. 
For the quarter, SmartSide average sale prices were up 8% and volumes increased 19%. Volumes increased in our SmartSide siding line due to continued penetration in several key focus markets, including retail, repair and remodel and markets and sheds. CanExel prices were flat in U.S. dollars, however prices were up 12% in Canadian dollars, which is CanExel's primary market. Volumes were down 18% in the quarter, due to decreases in Canadian and international demand. 
Please turn to Slide 7 of the presentation, which shows the results for our Engineered Wood Products segment. This segment includes I-Joist, Laminated Strand Lumber, Laminated Veneer Lumber plus other related products. This segment also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi joint venture are under our sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. 
The EWP segment did produce 10 million square feet of OSB in the first quarter of 2015 under the Houlton, Maine facility. 
The Engineered Wood Products segment recorded sales of $65 million in the first quarter of 2015, up from $62 million in the first quarter of 2014. The segment's operating loss in the first quarter of 2015 was $4 million as compared to a loss of $3 million in the first quarter of 2014. 
For the first quarter of 2015, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations declined to a negative $400,000 as compared to a positive adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2014. Volumes of I-Joist were down 12%, primarily due to lower volumes in Western Canada. While volumes of LVL and LSL were up 16% compared to the same quarter last year, as we focused more on exports and industrial markets. 
Pricing was up 6% in I-Joist and down 3% in LVL and LSL. The increase in I-Joist reflects price increases introduced to offset rising raw material costs during 2014. The decline in LVL and LSL reflects changes in mix through a higher percentage of industrial uses, which are sold at a lower price. 
Turning to Slide 8 of the presentation. For the quarter, our South American segment recorded sales of $36 million as compared to $37 million in the first quarter of 2014. Operating income was $2 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $4 million in the first quarter of 2014. South America's adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $5 million for the first quarter of 2014 as compared to $7 million in the first quarter of 2014. 
Volumes in the quarter were up 31% and lower by 18% in Brazil compared to the same quarter last year. The sales volume increase in Chile was primarily due to improved housing demand. In Brazil, the reduction in sales volume was due to the economic recession, which led to loss of demand. Pricing was down 13% in Chile and down 16% in Brazil. And in local currency, Chile's pricing was lower by 1% compared with the same quarter in 2014, and Brazil recorded a 3% improvement in pricing. 
Total SG&A costs were $39 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $41 million in the same quarter of 2014. For the quarter, the reduction in SG&A costs is primarily related to legal costs incurred in 2014 associated with the aborted Ainsworth transaction. We recorded $2 million of foreign exchange loss in the quarter compared to $4 million loss in the same quarter of last year. And net interest expense was flat between quarters. 
Please refer to Slide 9 of the presentation. As of March 31, 2015, we have cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash of $483 million, working capital of $742 million, net cash of $114 million, and in addition to the $483 million of cash on our balance sheet, we have $200 million availability on our credit facility. March year-to-date capital expenditures were $15 million. We do expect capital expenditures for 2015 to be in the range of $120 million to $130 million, with over half of this amount related to the Swan Valley mill conversion. We did not repurchase any shares of LP's stock during the quarter, but we do continue to evaluate opportunities to repurchase shares, along with other uses of the company's capital. Now I will turn the call over to Curt for his comments."

Good morning to all of you and thanks for joining us on the call. Let me start with LP's safety performance. Last week, the APA announced the results of their safety and health awards program for 2014. I'm pleased that LP was named the Safest Large Company in our industry for the year. This is the fifth time we have been so recognized in the last 7 years. We also had 10 facilities included in the Incident Free Honor Society. I'm very proud of all of our employees who recognize the value of being safe and act accordingly. 
In addition to the obvious savings in Worker's Compensation costs, LP believes that our safety culture gives us a competitive edge in the hiring and retention of our employees. 
This morning I'll provide a few comments on the results of the first quarter, talk about the state of the housing market and give you my views for the next several quarters. After that, I'll turn the call back to Sallie for questions. 
With 2 notable exceptions that negatively affected our results, OSB pricing and the write-off of the wood license, LP actually had a pretty good quarter. Let me just start with a quick review of the 2 negative items. OSB pricing has fallen below analysts’ projections for the last 6 quarters, and Random Lengths, North Central was 12%, an already low 2014 pricing level. The easy scapegoat in Q1 is always the weather. While I know this did have an impact, the primary driver of lower pricing was more available supply than demand. As a result, we had to take significant downtime in our mills in the quarter. 
In Q2, we continue to evaluate and take market-related downtime as the recovery in new residential demand has been short of economists’ projections. Further, while we are meeting our commitments to our customers, they're also aggressively exploring other applications beyond single-family new construction. These areas include repair and remodeling, industrial, transportation and modest exports. 
Let me give you some background to the Chambord wood license. We indefinitely curtailed production at the Chambord, Québec mill in 2008 as the great recession whacked housing. Over the intervening years, we have been a regular contact with the Québec government and we've met all of our mutually agreed upon obligations to retain the license. Over the last year, there's been increasing pressure to use the wood to create jobs in the area. Unfortunately, the government decided that they would not wait for LP to restart the mill and informed us last quarter that they had canceled our wood license. They will be setting up a project office to review alternative proposals for the wood. We'll be a part of this process and believe that the LP mill is still the best alternative to use the wood in the area. We do have other options for these assets we will also be exploring. As to the write-off, the accounting rules dictated that we take a noncash charge for the carrying value of the wood license. 
On the positive side, as Sallie mentioned, our Siding business had a record quarter, SmartSide shipments, revenue and EBITDA. We did enjoy lower resin costs in Q1 and the lower Canadian dollar made our operations north of the border more competitive. Efforts to fully convert our Swan Valley mill to SmartSide production are underway, with initial production expected in Q4 of this year. 
Next, let me just share some views on the housing market. As you know, there are mountains of data on the future of the housing market that are confusing, sometimes conflicting and definitely frustrating. My bottom line is that housing is improving, but not at the pace forecast by most economists. Here are some numbers on expected housing starts. The consensus forecast for this year is 1.153 million, which would represent a 15% increase over 2014. Consensus forecast for 2016 stands at 1.36 million, which is a further 18% increase on the forecast for this year. At LP, as I mentioned last quarter, we forecast 1.1 million housing starts for 2015 and I believe that still looks like a reasonable number. In 2016, we expect a 10% to 15% improvement in starts. 
Other positive housing-related news, household formations accelerated in Q4 to 1.7 million and all that up was about 1.5 million in Q1 of this year. This is much better than the anemic 400,000 to 500,000 pace of the last several years. And when a household is formed, this usually means that a home is occupied, which is good news for our industry. A Deutsche Bank economist just published the following tidbit, which might be of interest. The number of people per household returns to the 2000 to 2003 level, this would lead to 4 million new households, a very positive for housing looking forward. 
Mortgage rates remain below 4%, the inventory of new and existing homes for sale is shrinking and most of the big builders who have reported first quarter results have mentioned a strong spring selling season. Repair/remodel expenditures are expected to be strong and the rental vacancy rate is at the lowest level in 20 years. 
So what does this all mean for LP in the next several quarters? With spring finally happening in most of the country and positive momentum in the housing sector, we should see increased demand in North America. Obviously, we would like to see improvement in OSB pricing as well. With high channel inventories and ready wood in the market, we didn't see an increase in pricing or demand in April. We have taken steps to adjust our production levels to take this into consideration as we focus on meeting our customer commitments while limiting the sale of unprofitable open market wood. 
Before I turn back to Sallie, let me make a few comments on South America. We continue to see high demand in Chile due to increased spending by the government on housing. And with the terrible floods in Northern Chile, 24,000 homes were destroyed and we are helping with emergency shelters. We are supplying this demand currently from Brazil. And as you know, we are working on a project to add a third mill into Chile to eliminate the costly freight coming from Brazil. With that, let me turn it back over to Sallie for questions."

One, Siding is not solely tied to single-family new construction. We have a big repair/remodel portion of that. And we also have at least 2 SKUs in every Home Depot, Lowe's and yard [ph] store in North America. So we've been exploring those other markets and satisfying the needs there. In the first quarter, and a little bit of an anomaly, is in the repair/remodel business. They need to pre-finish, we have a series of pre-finishers that are our customers that then sell directly into the market. Those pre-finishers don't have the capability of finishing enough product to meet the annual demand unless they do it in the first quarter. So there is a little bit of a channel fill for the repair/remodel part of that, and we enjoyed those volumes that went into that market. As far as the sustainability going forward, for the next 2 quarters -- actually, the next 3 quarters will be constrained until Swan Valley comes online. As Sallie said, we didn't produce any OSB in our siding mills. We ran them basically at capacity, but we also pulled down our inventories in the first quarter.

And the third is, we have shown an ability to relocate the physical assets in other parts of the world. We would look at Chambord as another opportunity to do that. So that would be the third option."

I'm Sallie Bailey, LP's Chief Financial Officer, and with me today are Curt Stevens, LPs Chief Executive Officer; as well as Mike Kinney; and Becky Barckley, our primary Investor Relations contact. I will begin the discussion with a review the financial results for the second quarter of 2015 and this will be followed by some comments on the performance of the individual segments and selected balance sheet items. 
After I finish my comments, Curt will discuss the general market environment, in which LP has been operating, provide his perspective on our results and give some thoughts on the outlook. As we have done in the past, we have opened up this call to the public in the doing a webcast. The webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. And additionally to help with the discussion, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I will be referencing these slides in my comments this morning. We have filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information as well as our Form 10-Q. I want to remind all the participants about the forward-looking statements comment on Slide 2 of the presentation. Please also be aware of the discussion of our new use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. The appendix attached to the presentation have some of the necessary reconciliations that has been supplemented by the Form 8-K filing we made this morning. And rather than reading these 2 statements, I incorporate them with this with respect. 
For the second quarter of 2015 as compared to the second quarter of 2014, OSB prices were lower by 15%, which have negative impact on LP's financial results of $39 million. For the first 6 months period, OSB prices were 40% lower, which had negative impact on LP's financial results of $68 million. Now obviously our second quarter and as well as year-to-date performance to be lower than the same period in 2014. This decrease is in OSB prices occurred in a market where actual housing starts were 15% higher quarter-over-quarter and 10% higher for the first half of this year as compared to the first 6 months of 2014. However, the negative impact of the lower 2015 OSB price environment was offset in our results by another strong quarter and 6 months from the Siding segment. And with that, let me go into the detail. 
Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of the second quarter 2015 and first half consolidated results. We are reporting net sales of $493 million for the first quarter of 2015, a 5% decrease from the net sales of $590 million reported in the second quarter of 2014. In the second quarter, we recorded a net loss of $20 million, a loss of $0.14 per diluted share compared to net income for the second quarter of 2014 of $2 million or penny per diluted share. Adjusted loss for the quarter was $12 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.08 based upon a normalized tax rate of 35% compared to a loss of $4 million or loss per diluted share of $0.03 for the second quarter of 2014. 
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $16 million in the quarter compared to $26 million in the second quarter of 2014. In the first 6 months of 2015, we recorded a net loss of $54 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.38 compared to a net loss for the second quarter of 2014 of $12 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.09. The adjusted loss for the 6 months period was $31 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.22 based upon the normalized tax rate of 35% compared to a loss of $11 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.08 for the first 6 months of 2014.  Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $22 million in the first 6 months of 2015 compared to $49 million in the 2014 comparable period. 
Moving now on to Slide 5 and a review of our business segment results. Starting with OSB. OSB recorded an operating loss of $18 million on sales of $211 million compared to a loss of $6 million on $224 million of sales in the second quarter of 2014. For the quarter, we reported negative adjusted EBITDA of $4 million compared to positive EBITDA of $8 million in the second quarter of 2014. We have an 11% increase in sales volume and a 2% increase in production. We reduced our finished goods inventory in the second quarter and we checked 110 basis down time or the equivalent of 179 million square feet. 
Pricing for OSB was lower by 15% over the second quarter of 2014. And the decrease in pricing resulted in lower operating results by $38 million. For the first 6 months of 2015, OSB recorded an operating loss of $47 million on sales of $401 million compared to a loss of $7 million on $419 million of sales in the first 6 months of 2014. For the first 6 months, we reported negative adjusted EBITDA of $17 million compared to positive adjusted EBITDA of $20 million in the first 6 months of 2014. Sales were higher by 12% and production was 3% higher. Year-to-date, we have taken 237 days of downtime or the equivalent of 375 million square feet. Sales prices were lower by 40% and the impact of the lower sales price on OSB operations was $67 million for the first 6 months of 2015 compared to the prior year. 
Offsetting the reduction sales price for both the quarter and the 6 months period with a reduction of material costs related to petroleum-based raw material as well as a positive impact of the Canadian currency exchange rate on the cost and Canadian operations as compared to the same periods in the prior year. 
Moving to Slide 6, which reports the results of our Sliding business. The segment includes our SmartSide and CanExel Siding products. The Siding segment reported sales of $164 million in the second quarter of 2015. Operating income of $29 million and adjusted EBITDA of $35 million as compared to $170 million of sales, operating income of $26 million and adjusted EBITDA of $30 million reported in the second quarter of 2014. 
For the quarter, SmartSide average sales prices were 4% and volumes decreased 6%. Volumes decreased on our SmartSide volume relative to the second quarter of 2014 as well as the first quarter of 2015 as our customers were rebalancing their inventories as sales into Texas and Oklahoma in particular were impacted by the very wet weather. 
The conversion on the Swan Valley OSB mill into mill is well underway again. The beginning in the third quarter, the results associated with the Swan mill won't be included in the Siding segment rather than as part of the OSB segment. 
Curt will provide more details on the status of the conversion in his comments. Our CanExcel product line recorded price decreases of 7% in US dollars and price increases of 11% in Canadian dollars. Volumes were up 14% in the quarter, due to increases in Canadian demand, Canada is CanExel's primary market. 
The Siding segment reported $337 million for the first 6 months of 2015, an increase of 8% from $313 million reported in the first 6 months of 2014. The Siding segment reported operating income of $62 million compared to $45 million and adjusted EBITDA of $73 million with compared to $54 million in the same period of 2014. 
SmartSide sales prices and volumes were both up 6% for the first 6 months of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The increase in our volume was due to continued penetration and several key focus markets, including retail, repair and remodel and markets and outsource building products, including shuts. CanExcel prices were down 3% in US dollars, however, they were up 16% in Canadian dollars. Sales volumes decreased 5% due to decreased in demand primarily from Europe due to discontinuation of certain prefinished colored siding products. 
Please turn to Slide 7 of the presentation, which shows the results for our Engineered Wood Products segment. This segment includes I-Joist, Laminated Strand Lumber, Laminated Veneer Lumber, OSB produces main facility plus other related products. This segment also includes the sales of I-Joist and LBL products produced by the Abitibi joint venture or under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. The Engineered Wood Products segment record sales of $72 million on the second quarter of 2015, down from $76 million from the second quarter of 2014. The segment operating loss in the second quarter of 2015 was $2 million as compared to $5 million in the second quarter of 2014. For the second quarter of 2015, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations improved to a positive $600,000 as compared to a negative $1 million in the second quarter of 2014. 
Volumes of I-Joist were down 10%, while volumes of LDL and LSL were down 2% compared to the same quarter last year. Pricing was down 1% in I-Joist and down 3% in LBL and LSL. And during the quarter and the first 6 months of 2015, we changing the mix of OSB products that are holding operations to produce more value-added products. The impact of this change resulted in improved operating results by $800,000 in the quarter and $1.2 million for the first 6 months. 
For the first 6 months, sales were $137 million, essentially flat with the first 6 months of 2014. The segment operating loss in the first 6 months was $6 million as compared to $8 million in the first half of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA for the first 6 months of 2015 was also essentially flat with the first 6 months of 2014. 
Moving on to Slide 8 of the presentation. For the quarter, our South America segment recorded sales of $39 million as compared to sales of $42 million in the second quarter of 2014. Operating income was $2 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $4 million in the second quarter of 2014. South America's adjusted EBITDA was $4 million for the second quarter of 2015 as compared to $7 million in the second quarter of 2014. 
Sales volumes in Chile were up 16% and lower by 21% in Brazil compared to the same quarter last year. The sales volume increased in Chile was primarily due to improved housing demand. In Brazil, reported sales volumes were lower due to economic recession as well as lower exports to China, but this decrease in demand was offset by higher exports to Chile. 
Sales of Brazilian products, which are sold in Chile are reflected in the Chilean sales volume. On a stand-alone basis, Brazil sales volumes were equal to the second quarter of 2014. 
Pricing was down 7% in Chile and down 24% in Brazil in US dollars. In local currency, Chile's prices was 4% higher than the same quarter in 2014 and Brazil's pricing was about flat with the prior year. For the first 6 months, our South America segment reported sales of $75 million as compared to $79 million in the first quarter of 2014. 
Operating income was $4 million compared to $8 million in the first 6 months of 2014, and adjusted EBITDA declined to $9 million from $13 million from the same period in 2014. 
Total selling, general and administrative expenses were $38 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $36 million in the same quarter in 2014. For the quarter, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily related to the higher information technology costs and increased sales and marketing related expenses. 
For the 6 months period, our selling, general and administrative expenses were flat at $77 million. The lower legal cost associated with the 2014 Ainsworth acquisition were offset by the increase in information and technology comps and the higher sales and marketing expenses. 
Turning now to Slide 9 of the presentation. As of June 30, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash of $501 million. Working capital of $717 million, net cash of $132 million. And in addition to the $497 million of cash on our balance sheet, we have $200 million of availability on our credit facility. Capital expenditures through June 30, 2015, were $34 million. 
We generated $42 million of cash from operating activities in the quarter and LP's cash balance increased $13 million in the quarter. Decreases in the inventory and receivables were key drivers of the cash flow generation and operating activity. 
Capital expenditures for 2015 are expected to be between $120 million and $130 million with about 2/3 related to growth projects. And we did not repurchase any stock in the quarter under our authorized stock repurchase plan. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Curt for his comments"

Good morning to all of you and thanks for joining us on the call. Let me start with LP safety performance. For the quarter, we slipped a bit in our rolling 12-month total incident rate at the end June, it was at 0.41. Our performance of the first half of this year as a reminder that we can never let of our attention waver as the importance of safety. As an example, we had 2 injuries at the plant that went 7 years with no recordables and 3 injuries at another plant that hadn't had an injury in over 800,000 hours. Rest assure that we remain focused on the safety of our employees and contractors. As I typically do on these calls, I'll provide a few comments on the results of the second quarter, discuss the housing market and give you my views on the next several quarters and the midterm. After that, I'll turn the call back to Sally to take your questions. 
LSP pricing in continues to be below the industry forecasters projections, FBA, analysts and others. Random Lengths north-central was 14%, below an already low Q2 2014 pricing level. This was coupled with the wettest May on record for much of the middle of the country, including Texas. As we did in Q1, we took significant downtime in our OSB and EWP businesses in the quarter and also reduced our inventories. 
Our Siding business had another very strong quarter with $35 million in adjusted EBITDA. We did see a slight sleep in shipments compared to last year, as we believe the wet weather delayed the pace of reorders. Conversion of our Swan Valley OSB mill to SmartSide production is going well. We reported most of the foundations began, making the building modifications and are expecting equipment at the mill on a daily basis. We are on track to have initial Siding production in the Swan Valley in Q4 of this year. 
At our board meeting last week, we did present and the board approved our project to add FlameBlock coding capacity of one of our own OSB mills in Alabama. This will allow us to expand the production in sale of fire-resistant OSB panels for using multifamily and single-family construction. It's about $15 million project and should be complete around the middle of next year. This is very consistent with our strategy to increase the percentage of value-added OSB and our sales mix. 
Next let me share my views of the housing market. Based on the most recent numbers, demand for our products should be much better than we are seeing. This is quite frustrating. Let me give you some facts and figures. For June, housing starts came in at $1.174 million, a 10% higher than May. This puts the second quarter run rate at $1.14 million, 17% higher than Q1. Permits were even stronger at $1.343 million. Multifamily continues to be a big part of the growth in both starts and permits. Coupled with existing home sales at the highest rate in over 8 years, this certainly points to an accelerating market. The forecast for future activity are just slightly lower than last quarter as e-commerce appears to be exercising some caution as the strong June housing report numbers are not fully reflected. 
Here are the numbers, the consensus forecast for 2016 is now 1.122 million, which is a 12% increase over 2014. And the consensus forecast for 2016 stands at 1.315 million, a 17% increase over the 2015 forecast. As I reported in the last 2 quarters, our forecast going into this year was 1.1 million housing starts and that looks to be achievable. We are just putting together budget assumptions for next year and we haven't yet landed on number for starts, but I think it's fair to say, we'll be somewhere between the current 2015 and 2016 consensus forecast. 
Other positive housing-related news, household formations continue to exceed, make 400,000 to 500,000 pace last several years. And it does appear that the Millennials are moving out. ENAHB homebuilder confidence index reached the highest level over 8 years, which bodes well for our future activity. Thirty-year fixed mortgage rates are right about the 4% level. The inventory of new and existing homes for sale is shrinking. Most of the rig builders have reported second quarter results were optimistic for demand and cautious as to available labor. 
With higher sales of existing homes, there is good news for repair modeling expenditures as well. Well rates are increasing and vacancy rates are declining making homeownership a more attractive alternative in many markets. In the first half this year, we did see increasing demand for our products, but the very cold weather in the first quarter and the wet weather in the second quarter dampened the demand based on increase in housing starts. 
As I look at the second quarter with hindsight -- second half of the year with hindsight of the June housing numbers, certainly my believe that actual housing activity will accelerate in the second half of the year. Based on our discussions with with our customers, it is also my belief that Channel inventories on a relative balance, which means higher housing related demand should convert to orders, which should benefit all of our product lines. However, if I'm wrong, we'll have no choice but to take steps to adjust production levels as we have been in the past to focus on meeting our customer commitments while limiting the sale of unprofitable open-market wood. 
As I look at the next few years, I'm very confident we'll contain to see growth in housing starts as the U.S. has the fundamental shortage of housing units simply based on demographics. The recovery has not been at a pace was anticipated and there are still some headwinds. However, I believe if the labor issues faced by the builders will easy, banks will get back into the business of making loans and millennials will start getting married and having kids. All this is good news for our shareholders as LP is well positioned to capitalize on the continued recovery in housing, repair and remodeling activities. With that, let me turn it back to Sally for Q&A."

We were disadvantaged in logistics for last couple of years, primarily with the service we were getting from Canadian railroads, at which caused us to put reloads and locations that worked very cost effective for us. In the last 6 months, both our Siding business and our OSB businesses spend a lot more time looking at that. The railroad performance improved this year and we're also seeing more availability of trucks in the U.S. So I do think it's an opportunity to bring down logistics cost. And as Sally mentioned, we did bring our inventories down pretty significant to the second quarter across all the businesses, and a big piece of that was taken them out the reloads to make it more efficient for us. As far as sales to Asia, from the U.S., we look at that very opportunistically. Most of what we ship from the U.S. or from Canada, into Asia has been going into Korea. There is some activity in China, but that's really kind of its infancy for us. The big exports side of the North America we're going into Russia and since the sanctions were put in place, that business has basically been eliminated. We don't do much business there at all. On South America, we did have a decorative OSB product that was going into China and that demand has been sporadic. In the last couple of quarters, we haven't shipped much of the product at all."

In the prodealer channel, I think they did have more inventory going into Q2, and I think they came out of Q2 with a little more inventory than they expected. With the July, it's usually July slowdown from a building standpoint. We are seeing increased activity the end of July and going into August. So I think we're in a pretty good shape and I don't think there's a lot of inventory in the channel that's excess at this point."

Thank you, LaToya, and good morning. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss LP's financial results for the second quarter of 2015.

Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss LP's financial results for the second quarter of 2015. I am Sallie Bailey, LP's Chief Financial Officer; and with me today are Curt Stevens, LP's Chief Executive Officer; as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barckley, our primary Investor Relations contact. 
I will begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the second quarter of 2015, and this will be followed by some comments on the performance of individual segments and selected balance sheet items. 
After I finish my comments, Curt will discuss the general market environment in which LP has been operating, provide his perspective on our results and give some thoughts on the outlook. 
As we have done in the past, we have opened up this call to the public and are doing a webcast. The webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. And additionally, to help with the discussion, we've provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I will be referencing these slides in my comments this morning. We have filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information as well as our Form 10-Q. 
I want to remind all the participants about the forward-looking statements comment on Slide 2 of the presentation. Please also be aware of the discussion of our new use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. The appendix attached to the presentation has some of the necessary reconciliations that has been supplemented by the Form 8-K filing we made this morning. And rather than reading these 2 statements, I incorporate them with this reference. 
For the second quarter of 2015 as compared to the second quarter of 2014, OSB prices were lower by 15%, which had negative impact on LP's financial results of $39 million. For the first 6-month period, OSB prices were 14% lower, which had negative impact on LP's financial results of $68 million. Now obviously, this caused our second quarter as well as our year-to-date performance to be lower than the same periods in 2014. This decreases in OSB prices occurred in a market where actual housing starts were 50% -- 15% higher quarter-over-quarter and 10% higher for the first half of this year as compared to the first 6 months of 2014. However, the negative impact of the lower 2015 OSB price environment was offset in our results by another strong quarter and 6 months from the Siding segment. 
And with that, let me go into the details. Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of the second quarter 2015 and first half consolidated results. We are reporting net sales of $493 million for the first quarter of 2015, a 5% decrease from the net sales of $519 million reported in the second quarter of 2014. In the second quarter, we recorded a net loss of $20 million, a loss of $0.14 per diluted share compared to net income for the second quarter of 2014 of $2 million or $0.01 per diluted share. The adjusted loss for the quarter was $12 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.08 based upon a normalized tax rate of 35% compared to a loss of $4 million or loss per diluted share of $0.03 for the second quarter of 2014. 
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $16 million in the quarter compared to $26 million in the second quarter of 2014. In the first 6 months of 2015, we recorded a net loss of $54 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.38 compared to a net loss for the second quarter of 2014 of $12 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.09. The adjusted loss for the 6-month period was $31 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.22 based upon the normalized tax rate of 35% compared to a loss of $11 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.08 for the first 6 months of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $22 million in the first 6 months of 2015 compared to $49 million in the 2014 comparable period. 
Moving now on to Slide 5 and a review of our business segment results. Starting with OSB. OSB recorded an operating loss of $18 million on sales of $211 million compared to a loss of $6 million on $224 million of sales in the second quarter of 2014. For the quarter, we reported negative adjusted EBITDA of $4 million compared to positive adjusted EBITDA of $8 million in the second quarter of 2014. We have an 11% increase in sales volume and a 2% increase in production. We reduced our finished goods inventory in the second quarter, and we checked 110 days of downtime or the equivalent of 179 million square feet. Pricing for OSB was lower by 15% over the second quarter of 2014, and the decrease in pricing resulted in lower operating results by $38 million. 
For the first 6 months of 2015, OSB recorded an operating loss of $47 million on sales of $401 million compared to a loss of $7 million on $419 million of sales in the first 6 months of 2014. For the first 6 months, we reported negative adjusted EBITDA of $17 million compared to positive adjusted EBITDA of $20 million in the first 6 months of 2014. Sales were higher by 12%, and production was 3% higher. Year-to-date, we have taken 237 days of downtime or the equivalent of 375 million square feet. Sales prices were lower by 14%, and the impact of the lower sales price on OSB operations was $67 million for the first 6 months of 2015 compared to the prior year.  
Offsetting the reduction in sales price for both the quarter and the 6-month period was a reduction of raw material costs related to petroleum-based raw material as well as a positive impact of the Canadian currency exchange rate on the costs incurred in our Canadian operations as compared to the same periods in the prior year. 
Moving to Slide 6, which reports the results of our Siding business. This segment includes our SmartSide and CanExel siding products. The Siding segment reported sales of $164 million in the second quarter of 2015, operating income of $29 million and adjusted EBITDA of $35 million as compared to $170 million of sales, operating income of $26 million and adjusted EBITDA of $30 million reported in the second quarter of 2014. 
For the quarter, SmartSide average sales prices were up 4% and volumes decreased 6%. Volumes decreased in our SmartSide siding line relative to the second quarter of 2014 as well as the first quarter of 2015 as our customers were rebalancing their inventories as sales into Texas and Oklahoma, in particular, were impacted by the very wet weather. 
The conversion of the Swan Valley OSB mill into a siding mill is well underway. Beginning in the third quarter, the results associated with the Swan mill will be included in the Siding segment rather than as part of OSB segment. Curt will provide more details on the status of the conversion in his comments. Our CanExel product line recorded price decreases of 7% in U.S. dollars and price increases of 11% in Canadian dollars. Volumes were up 14% in the quarter due to increases in Canadian demand. Canada is CanExel's primary market. 
The Siding segment reported $337 million for the first 6 months of 2015, an increase of 8% from $313 million reported in the first 6 months of 2014. The Siding segment reported operating income of $62 million compared to $45 million and adjusted EBITDA of $73 million as compared to $54 million in the same period of 2014. SmartSide sales prices and volumes were both up 6% for the first 6 months of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The increase in our volume was due to continued penetration in several key focus markets, including retail, repair and remodel markets and outdoor building products, including shuts. CanExel prices were down 3% in U.S. dollars. However, they were up 16% in Canadian dollars. Sales volumes decreased 5% due to decreased demand primarily from Europe due to discontinuation of certain pre-finished colored siding products. 
Please turn to Slide 7 of the presentation, which shows the results from our Engineered Wood Products segment. This segment includes I-Joist, Laminated Strand Lumber, Laminated Veneer Lumber, OSB produced at our Houlton, Maine facility plus other related products. This segment also includes the sales of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi joint venture or under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. The Engineered Wood Products segment recorded sales of $72 million in the second quarter of 2015, down from $76 million in the second quarter of 2014. The segment operating loss in the second quarter of 2015 was $2 million as compared to $5 million in the second quarter of 2014. For the second quarter of 2015, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations improved to a positive $600,000 as compared to a negative $1 million in the second quarter of 2014. 
Volumes of I-Joist were down 10% while volumes of LVL and LSL were down 2% compared to the same quarter last year. Pricing was down 1% in I-Joist and down 3% in LVL and LSL. And during the quarter and the first 6 months of 2015, we changed the mix of OSB products at our Houlton operations to produce more value-added products. The impact of this change resulted in improved operating results by $800,000 in the quarter and $1.2 million for the first 6 months. 
For the first 6 months, sales were $137 million, essentially flat with the first 6 months of 2014. The segment operating loss in the first 6 months was $6 million as compared to $8 million in the first half of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA for the first 6 months of 2015 was also essentially flat with the first 6 months of 2014. 
Moving on to Slide 8 of the presentation. For the quarter, our South America segment recorded sales of $39 million as compared to sales of $42 million in the second quarter of 2014. Operating income was $2 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $4 million in the second quarter of 2014. South America's adjusted EBITDA was $4 million for the second quarter of 2015 as compared to $7 million in the second quarter of 2014. 
Sales volumes in Chile were up 16% and lower by 21% in Brazil compared to the same quarter last year. The sales volume increase in Chile was primarily due to improved housing demand. In Brazil, reported sales volumes were lower due to the economic recession as well as lower exports to China, but this decrease in demand was offset by higher exports to Chile. Sales of Brazilian products which are sold in Chile are reflected in the Chilean sales volume. On a stand-alone basis, Brazil sales volumes were equal to the second quarter of 2014. Pricing was down 7% in Chile and down 24% in Brazil in U.S. dollars. In local currency, Chile's prices was 4% higher than the same quarter in 2014, and Brazil's pricing was about flat with the prior year. 
For the first 6 months, our South America segment reported sales of $75 million as compared to $79 million in the first quarter of 2014. 
Operating income was $4 million compared to $8 million in the first 6 months of 2014, and adjusted EBITDA declined to $9 million from $13 million from the same period in 2014. 
Total selling, general and administrative expenses were $38 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $36 million in the same quarter in 2014. For the quarter, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily relate to the higher information technology costs and increased sales and marketing-related expenses. For the 6-month period, our selling, general and administrative expenses are flat at $77 million. The lower legal costs associated with the 2014 Ainsworth acquisition were offset by the increase in information technology costs and the higher sales and marketing expenses. 
Turning now to Slide 9 of the presentation. As of June 30, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash of $501 million, working capital of $717 million, net cash of $132 million. And in addition to the $497 million of cash on our balance sheet, we have $200 million of availability on our credit facility. Capital expenditures through June 30, 2015, were $34 million. We generated $42 million of cash from operating activities in the quarter, and LP's cash balance increased $13 million in the quarter. Decreases in inventory and receivables were key drivers of the cash flow generation and operating activity. Capital expenditures for 2015 are expected to be between $120 million and $130 million, with about 2/3 related to growth projects. And we did not repurchase any stock in the quarter under our authorized stock repurchase plan. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Curt for his comments"

Good morning to all of you, and thanks for joining us on the call. Let me start with LP's safety performance. For the quarter, we slipped a bit in our rolling 12-month total incident rate at the end June. It was at 0.41. Our performance for the first half of this year is a reminder that we can never let our attention waver as to the importance of safety. As an example, we had 2 injuries at a plant that went 7 years with no recordables and 3 injuries at another plant that hadn't had an injury in over 800,000 hours. Rest assured that we remain focused on the safety of our employees and contractors. 
As I typically do on these calls, I'll provide a few comments on our results for the second quarter, discuss the housing market and give you my views on the next several quarters and the midterm. After that, I'll turn the call back over to Sallie to take your questions. 
OSB pricing continues to be below the industry forecasters' projections. I'm talking about FEA, RISI, analysts and others. Random Lengths North Central was 14% below an already low Q2 2014 pricing level. This was coupled with the wettest May on record for much of the middle of the country, including Texas. As we did in Q1, we took significant downtime in our OSB and EWP businesses in the quarter and also reduced our inventories. 
Our Siding business had another very strong quarter with $35 million in adjusted EBITDA. We did see a slight slip in shipments compared to last year as we believe the wet weather delayed the pace of reorders. Conversion of our Swan Valley OSB mill to SmartSide production is going well. We have floored most of the foundations, began making the building modifications and are expecting equipment at the mill on a daily basis. We are on track to have initial siding production in Swan Valley in Q4 of this year. 
At our board meeting last week, we did present and the board approved our project to add FlameBlock coating capacity at one of our OSB mills in Alabama. This will allow us to expand the production and sale of fire-resistant OSB panels for use in multifamily and single-family construction. It's about a $15 million project and should be complete around the middle of next year. This is very consistent with our strategy to increase the percentage of value-added OSB in our sales mix. 
Next, let me share my views of the housing market. Based on the most recent numbers, demand for our products should be much better than we are seeing. This is quite frustrating. Let me give you some facts and figures. For June, housing starts came in at 1.174 million, almost 10% higher than May. This puts the second quarter run rate at 1.14 million, 17% higher than Q1. Permits were even stronger at 1.343 million. Multifamily continues to be a big part of the growth in both starts and permits. Coupled with existing home sales at the highest rate in over 8 years, this certainly points to an accelerating market. The forecast for future activity are just slightly lower than last quarter as the economists appear to be exercising some caution as the strong June housing report numbers are not fully reflected. 
But here are the numbers. The consensus forecast for 2015 is now 1.122 million, which is a 12% increase over 2014, and the consensus forecast for 2016 stands at 1.315 million, a 17% increase over the 2015 forecast. As I've reported the last 2 quarters, our forecast going into this year was 1.1 million housing starts, and that looks to be achievable. We're just putting together budget assumptions for next year, and we haven't yet landed on a number for starts, but I think it's fair to say we'll be somewhere between the current 2015 and 2016 consensus forecast. 
Other positive housing-related news. Household formations continue to exceed the anemic 400,000 to 500,000 pace the last several years, and it does appear the millennials are moving out. The NAHB homebuilder confidence index reached the highest level over 8 years, which bodes well for future activity. 30-year fixed mortgage rates are right about the 4% level. The inventory of new and existing homes for sale is shrinking. Most of the big builders who've reported second quarter results were optimistic for demand and cautious as to available labor. With higher sales of existing homes, this is good news for repair/remodeling expenditures as well. Rental rates are increasing, and vacancy rates are declining, making homeownership a more attractive alternative in many markets. 
In the first half of this year, we did see increasing demand for our products, but the very cold weather in the first quarter and the wet weather in the second quarter dampened the demand based on increase in housing starts. As I look at the second quarter with hindsight -- second half of the year with hindsight of the June housing numbers, it's certainly my belief that actual housing activity will accelerate in the second half of the year. Based on our discussions with our customers, it is also my belief that channel inventories are on relative balance, which means higher housing-related demand should convert to orders, which should benefit all of our product lines. However, if I'm wrong, we'll have no choice but to take steps to adjust our production levels, as we have done in the past, to focus on meeting our customer commitments while limiting the sale of unprofitable open-market wood. 
As I look at the next few years, I'm very confident we'll continue to see growth in housing starts as the U.S. has the fundamental shortage of housing units simply based on demographics. The recovery has not been at a pace any of us anticipated, and there are still some headwinds. However, I believe that the labor issues faced by the builders will ease, banks will get back into the business of making loans and millennials will start getting married and having kids. All of this is good news for our shareholders as LP is well positioned to capitalize on the continued recovery in housing, repair and remodeling activities. 
With that, let me turn it back to Sallie for Q&A."

We were disadvantaged in logistics for the last couple of years, primarily with the service we were getting from the Canadian railroads, which caused us to put reloads in locations that weren't very cost-effective for us. In the last 6 months, both our Siding business and our OSB business has spent a lot more time looking at that. The railroad performance improved this year, and we're also seeing more availability of trucks in the U.S. So I do think there's an opportunity to bring down our logistics cost. And as Sallie mentioned, we did bring our inventories down pretty significant in the second quarter across all the businesses, and a big piece of that was taking them out of the reloads to make it more efficient for us. As far as sales to Asia, from the U.S., we look at that very opportunistically. Most of what we ship from the U.S. or from Canada into Asia has been going into Korea. There is some activity in China, but that's really kind of in its infancy for us. The big exports out of North America were going into Russia. And since the sanctions were put in place, that business has basically been eliminated. We don't do much business there at all. On South America, we did have a decorative OSB product that was going into China, and that demand has been sporadic. In the last couple of quarters, we haven't shipped much of that product at all."

Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss LP's financial results for the second quarter of 2015. I am Sallie Bailey, LP's Chief Financial Officer; and with me today are Curt Stevens, LP's Chief Executive Officer; as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barckley, our primary Investor Relations contact. 
I will begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the second quarter of 2015, and this will be followed by some comments on the performance of individual segments and selected balance sheet items. 
After I finish my comments, Curt will discuss the general market environment in which LP has been operating, provide his perspective on our results and give some thoughts on the outlook. 
As we have done in the past, we have opened up this call to the public and are doing a webcast. The webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. And additionally, to help with the discussion, we've provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I will be referencing these slides in my comments this morning. We have filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information as well as our Form 10-Q. 
I want to remind all the participants about the forward-looking statements comment on Slide 2 of the presentation. Please also be aware of the discussion of our new use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. The appendix attached to the presentation has some of the necessary reconciliations that has been supplemented by the Form 8-K filing we made this morning. And rather than reading these 2 statements, I incorporate them with this reference. 
For the second quarter of 2015 as compared to the second quarter of 2014, OSB prices were lower by 15%, which had negative impact on LP's financial results of $39 million. For the first 6-month period, OSB prices were 14% lower, which had negative impact on LP's financial results of $68 million. Now obviously, this caused our second quarter as well as our year-to-date performance to be lower than the same periods in 2014. This decreases in OSB prices occurred in a market where actual housing starts were 50% -- 15% higher quarter-over-quarter and 10% higher for the first half of this year as compared to the first 6 months of 2014. However, the negative impact of the lower 2015 OSB price environment was offset in our results by another strong quarter and 6 months from the Siding segment. 
And with that, let me go into the details. Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of the second quarter 2015 and first half consolidated results. We are reporting net sales of $493 million for the first quarter of 2015, a 5% decrease from the net sales of $519 million reported in the second quarter of 2014. In the second quarter, we recorded a net loss of $20 million, a loss of $0.14 per diluted share compared to net income for the second quarter of 2014 of $2 million or $0.01 per diluted share. The adjusted loss for the quarter was $12 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.08 based upon a normalized tax rate of 35% compared to a loss of $4 million or loss per diluted share of $0.03 for the second quarter of 2014. 
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $16 million in the quarter compared to $26 million in the second quarter of 2014. In the first 6 months of 2015, we recorded a net loss of $54 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.38 compared to a net loss for the second quarter of 2014 of $12 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.09. The adjusted loss for the 6-month period was $31 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.22 based upon the normalized tax rate of 35% compared to a loss of $11 million or a loss per diluted share of $0.08 for the first 6 months of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $22 million in the first 6 months of 2015 compared to $49 million in the 2014 comparable period. 
Moving now on to Slide 5 and a review of our business segment results. Starting with OSB. OSB recorded an operating loss of $18 million on sales of $211 million compared to a loss of $6 million on $224 million of sales in the second quarter of 2014. For the quarter, we reported negative adjusted EBITDA of $4 million compared to positive adjusted EBITDA of $8 million in the second quarter of 2014. We have an 11% increase in sales volume and a 2% increase in production. We reduced our finished goods inventory in the second quarter, and we took 110 days of downtime or the equivalent of 179 million square feet. Pricing for OSB was lower by 15% over the second quarter of 2014, and the decrease in pricing resulted in lower operating results by $38 million. 
For the first 6 months of 2015, OSB recorded an operating loss of $47 million on sales of $401 million compared to a loss of $7 million on $419 million of sales in the first 6 months of 2014. For the first 6 months, we reported negative adjusted EBITDA of $17 million compared to positive adjusted EBITDA of $20 million in the first 6 months of 2014. Sales were higher by 12%, and production was 3% higher. Year-to-date, we have taken 237 days of downtime or the equivalent of 375 million square feet. Sales prices were lower by 14%, and the impact of the lower sales price on OSB operations was $67 million for the first 6 months of 2015 compared to the prior year.  
Offsetting the reduction in sales price for both the quarter and the 6-month period was a reduction of raw material costs related to petroleum-based raw material as well as the positive impact of the Canadian currency exchange rate on the costs incurred in our Canadian operations as compared to the same periods in the prior year. 
Moving to Slide 6, which reports the results of our Siding business. This segment includes our SmartSide and CanExel siding products. The Siding segment reported sales of $164 million in the second quarter of 2015, operating income of $29 million and adjusted EBITDA of $35 million as compared to $170 million of sales, operating income of $26 million and adjusted EBITDA of $30 million reported in the second quarter of 2014. 
For the quarter, SmartSide average sales prices were up 4% and volumes decreased 6%. Volumes decreased in our SmartSide siding line relative to the second quarter of 2014 as well as the first quarter of 2015 as our customers were rebalancing their inventories as sales into Texas and Oklahoma, in particular, were impacted by the very wet weather. 
The conversion of the Swan Valley OSB mill into a siding mill is well underway. Beginning in the third quarter, the results associated with the Swan mill will be included in the Siding segment rather than as part of the OSB segment. Curt will provide more details on the status of the conversion in his comments. Our CanExel product line recorded price decreases of 7% in U.S. dollars and price increases of 11% in Canadian dollars. Volumes were up 14% in the quarter due to increases in Canadian demand. Canada is CanExel's primary market. 
The Siding segment reported $337 million for the first 6 months of 2015, an increase of 8% from $313 million reported in the first 6 months of 2014. The Siding segment reported operating income of $62 million compared to $45 million and adjusted EBITDA of $73 million as compared to $54 million in the same period of 2014. SmartSide sales prices and volumes were both up 6% for the first 6 months of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The increase in our volume was due to continued penetration in several key focus markets, including retail, repair and remodel markets and outdoor building products, including sheds. CanExel prices were down 3% in U.S. dollars. However, they were up 16% in Canadian dollars. Sales volumes decreased 5% due to decreased demand primarily from Europe due to the discontinuation of certain pre-finished colored siding products. 
Please turn to Slide 7 of the presentation, which shows the results from our Engineered Wood Products segment. This segment includes I-Joist, Laminated Strand Lumber, Laminated Veneer Lumber, OSB produced at our Houlton, Maine facility plus other related products. This segment also includes the sales of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi joint venture or under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. The Engineered Wood Products segment recorded sales of $72 million in the second quarter of 2015, down from $76 million in the second quarter of 2014. The segment operating loss in the second quarter of 2015 was $2 million as compared to $5 million in the second quarter of 2014. For the second quarter of 2015, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations improved to a positive $600,000 as compared to a negative $1 million in the second quarter of 2014. 
Volumes of I-Joist were down 10% while volumes of LVL and LSL were down 2% compared to the same quarter last year. Pricing was down 1% in I-Joist and down 3% in LVL and LSL. And during the quarter and the first 6 months of 2015, we changed the mix of OSB products at our Houlton operations to produce more value-added products. The impact of this change resulted in improved operating results by $800,000 in the quarter and $1.2 million for the first 6 months. 
For the first 6 months, sales were $137 million, essentially flat with the first 6 months of 2014. The segment operating loss in the first 6 months was $6 million as compared to $8 million in the first half of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA for the first 6 months of 2015 was also essentially flat with the first 6 months of 2014. 
Moving on to Slide 8 of the presentation. For the quarter, our South America segment recorded sales of $39 million as compared to sales of $42 million in the second quarter of 2014. Operating income was $2 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $4 million in the second quarter of 2014. South America's adjusted EBITDA was $4 million for the second quarter of 2015 as compared to $7 million in the second quarter of 2014. 
Sales volumes in Chile were up 16% and lower by 21% in Brazil compared to the same quarter last year. The sales volume increase in Chile was primarily due to improved housing demand. In Brazil, reported sales volumes were lower due to the economic recession as well as lower exports to China, but this decrease in demand was offset by higher exports to Chile. Sales of Brazilian products which are sold in Chile are reflected in the Chilean sales volume. On a stand-alone basis, Brazil sales volumes were equal to the second quarter of 2014. Pricing was down 7% in Chile and down 24% in Brazil in U.S. dollars. In local currency, Chile's prices was 4% higher than the same quarter in 2014, and Brazil's pricing was about flat with the prior year. 
For the first 6 months, our South America segment reported sales of $75 million as compared to $79 million in the first quarter of 2014. 
Operating income was $4 million compared to $8 million in the first 6 months of 2014, and adjusted EBITDA declined to $9 million from $13 million from the same period in 2014. 
Total selling, general and administrative expenses were $38 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $36 million in the same quarter in 2014. For the quarter, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily relate to the higher information technology costs and increased sales and marketing-related expenses. For the 6-month period, our selling, general and administrative expenses are flat at $77 million. The lower legal costs associated with the 2014 Ainsworth acquisition were offset by the increase in information technology costs and the higher sales and marketing expenses. 
Turning now to Slide 9 of the presentation. As of June 30, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash of $501 million, working capital of $717 million, net cash of $132 million. And in addition to the $497 million of cash on our balance sheet, we have $200 million of availability on our credit facility. Capital expenditures through June 30, 2015, were $34 million. We generated $42 million of cash from operating activities in the quarter, and LP's cash balance increased $13 million in the quarter. Decreases in inventory and receivables were key drivers of the cash flow generation and operating activity. Capital expenditures for 2015 are expected to be between $120 million and $130 million, with about 2/3 related to growth projects. And we did not repurchase any stock in the quarter under our authorized stock repurchase plan. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Curt for his comments"

Good morning to all of you, and thanks for joining us on the call. Let me start with LP's safety performance. For the quarter, we slipped a bit in our rolling 12-month total incident rate at the end June. It was at 0.41. Ou",1052,"Thanks for that review, Sallie. Good morning to all of you, and thanks for joining us on the call. Let me start with LP's safety performance. For the quarter, we slipped a bit in our rolling 12-month total incident rate at the end June. It was at 0.41. Our performance the first half of this year is a reminder that we can never let our attention waver as to the importance of safety. As an example, we had 2 injuries at a plant that went 7 years with no recordables and 3 injuries at another plant that hadn't had an injury in over 800,000 hours. Rest assured that we remain focused on the safety of our employees and contractors. 
As I typically do on these calls, I'll provide a few comments on our results for the second quarter, discuss the housing market and give you my views on the next several quarters and the midterm. After that, I'll turn the call back over to Sallie to take your questions. 
OSB pricing continues to be below the industry forecasters' projections. I'm talking about FEA, RISI, analysts and others. Random Lengths North Central was 14% below an already low Q2 2014 pricing level. This was coupled with the wettest May on record for much of the middle of the country, including Texas. As we did in Q1, we took significant downtime in our OSB and EWP businesses in the quarter and also reduced our inventories. 
Our Siding business had another very strong quarter with $35 million in adjusted EBITDA. We did see a slight slip in shipments compared to last year as we believe the wet weather delayed the pace of reorders. Conversion of our Swan Valley OSB mill to SmartSide production is going well. We have poured most of the foundations, begun making the building modifications and are accepting equipment at the mill on a daily basis. We are on track to have initial siding production in Swan Valley in Q4 of this year. 
At our board meeting last week, we did present and the board approved our project to add FlameBlock coating capacity at one of our OSB mills in Alabama. This will allow us to expand the production and sale of fire-resistant OSB panels for use in multifamily and single-family construction. It's about a $15 million project and should be complete around the middle of next year. This is very consistent with our strategy to increase the percentage of value-added OSB in our sales mix. 
Next, let me share my views of the housing market. Based on the most recent numbers, demand for our products should be much better than we are seeing. This is quite frustrating. Let me give you some facts and figures. For June, housing starts came in at 1.174 million, almost 10% higher than May. This puts the second quarter run rate at 1.14 million, 17% higher than Q1. Permits were even stronger at 1.343 million. Multifamily continues to be a big part of the growth in both starts and permits. Coupled with existing home sales at the highest rate in over 8 years, this certainly points to an accelerating market. The forecast for future activity are just slightly lower than last quarter as the economists appear to be exercising some caution as the strong June housing report numbers are not fully reflected. 
But here are the numbers. The consensus forecast for 2015 is now 1.122 million, which is a 12% increase over 2014, and the consensus forecast for 2016 stands at 1.315 million, a 17% increase over the 2015 forecast. As I've reported the last 2 quarters, our forecast going into this year was 1.1 million housing starts, and that looks to be achievable. We're just putting together budget assumptions for next year, and we haven't yet landed on a number for starts, but I think it's fair to say we'll be somewhere between the current 2015 and 2016 consensus forecast. 
Other positive housing-related news. Household formations continue to exceed the anemic 400,000 to 500,000 pace the last several years, and it does appear the millennials are moving out. The NAHB homebuilder confidence index reached the highest level over 8 years, which bodes well for future activity. 30-year fixed mortgage rates are right about the 4% level. The inventory of new and existing homes for sale is shrinking. Most of the big builders who've reported second quarter results were optimistic for demand and cautious as to available labor. With higher sales of existing homes, this is good news for repair/remodeling expenditures as well. Rental rates are increasing, and vacancy rates are declining, making homeownership a more attractive alternative in many markets. 
In the first half of this year, we did see increasing demand for our products, but the very cold weather in the first quarter and the wet weather in the second quarter dampened the demand based on increase in housing starts. As I look at the second quarter with hindsight -- second half of the year with hindsight of the June housing numbers, it's certainly my belief that actual housing activity will accelerate in the second half of the year. Based on our discussions with our customers, it is also my belief that channel inventories are on relative balance, which means higher housing-related demand should convert to orders, which should benefit all of our product lines. However, if I'm wrong, we'll have no choice but to take steps to adjust our production levels, as we have done in the past, to focus on meeting our customer commitments while limiting the sale of unprofitable open-market wood. 
As I look at the next few years, I'm very confident we'll continue to see growth in housing starts as the U.S. has a fundamental shortage of housing units simply based on demographics. The recovery has not been at a pace any of us anticipated and there are still some headwinds. However, I believe that the labor issues faced by the builders will ease, banks will get back into the business of making loans and millennials will start getting married and having kids. All of this is good news for our shareholders as LP is well positioned to capitalize on the continued recovery in housing, repair and remodeling activities. 
With that, let me turn it back to Sallie for Q&A."

We were disadvantaged in logistics for the last couple of years, primarily with the service we were getting from the Canadian railroads, which caused us to put reloads in locations that weren't very cost-effective for us. In the last 6 months, both our Siding business and our OSB business has spent a lot more time looking at that. The railroad performance improved this year, and we're also seeing more availability of trucks in the U.S. So I do think there's an opportunity to bring down our logistics cost. And as Sallie mentioned, we did bring our inventories down pretty significantly in the second quarter across all the businesses, and a big piece of that was taking them out of the reloads to make it more efficient for us. As far as sales to Asia, from the U.S., we look at that very opportunistically. Most of what we ship from the U.S. or from Canada into Asia has been going into Korea. There is some activity in China, but that's really kind of in its infancy for us. The big exports out of North America were going into Russia. And since the sanctions were put in place, that business has basically been eliminated. We don't do much business there at all. On South America, we did have a decorative OSB product that was going into China, and that demand has been sporadic. In the last couple of quarters, we haven't shipped much of that product at all."

However, even in this environment, all 4 business segments reported positive adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter and we're affording a comparable level of adjusted EBITDA and $53 million less than sales for the third quarter of 2015, as compared to the third quarter of 2014.  While also observing $4.5 million of estimated expense associated with the Swan conversion to a Siding mail and $4 million of foreign exchange loss. With that, let me go into the detail. 
Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation for discussion of the third quarter 2015 and first 9 months of 2015 consolidated results. We're reporting net sales of $465 million for the third quarter of 2015, a 10% decrease from the net sales of $518 million reported in the third quarter of 2014. In the third quarter, we recorded a net loss of $27 million compared to a net loss for the third quarter 2014 of $20 million. The adjusted loss from continuing operations for the same quarter was $60 million based upon a normalized tax rate of 35%, which is comparable to the same period in 2014. 
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $11 million in the quarter was $1 million less than third quarter of 2014. In the first 9 months of 2015, we recorded a net loss of $81 million compared to a net loss for the third quarter of 2014 of $33 million. Adjusted loss for the 9 months period was $47 million based upon normalized tax rate of 35% compared to $28 million for the first 9 months of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $33 million for the first 9 months of 2015 compared to $61 million in the same period of 2014. 
Moving on to Slide 5 of the -- and the review of our segment results beginning with OSB. OSB recorded an operating loss of $11 million on sales of $200 million compared to a loss of $60 million on $233 million of sales in the third quarter of 2014. For the quarter, we reported adjusted EBITDA of $4 million compared to negative adjusted EBITDA of $1 million for the third quarter of 2014. We had a 9% decrease in sales volume, primarily due to the transfer of our Swan Valley facility to the Siding segment. Overall, the company's OAB shipment, including shipments from our Swan, Hayward, and Houlton facilities in the third quarter were 4% below the third quarter of 2014. 
Pricing for OSB was low by 7% compared to the third quarter of 2014. This decrease in pricing resulted in lower operating results by $50 million. For the first 9 months of 2015, OSB recorded an operating loss of $58 million and net sales of $601 million compared to a loss of $24 million on $652 million of sales in the first 9 months of 2014. For the first 9 months, we reported negative adjusted EBITDA of $30 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of a $90 million in the first 9 months of 2014. 
Sales volumes were higher by 4% and sales prices were lower by 12%. The impact to the lower sales price on OSB operations was $81 million for the first 9 months of 2015 compared to the prior year. Offsetting the reduction in sales prices for both the quarter and the 9-month period with a reduction in the raw material costs related to petroleum, based on material as well as the positive impact of the Canadian currency exchange rate. 
Slide 6 reports the results of our Siding business. This segment includes our SmartSide and CanExel Siding products as well as small amounts of OSB. The Siding segment reported net sales of $158 million in the third quarter of 2015, a decrease of 3% from $163 million reported in third quarter of 2014. Siding segment reported operating income of $17 million compared to $21 million in the third quarter of 2014, and adjusted EBITDA of $22 million as compared to $26 million in the same quarter of 2014. 
For the quarter, SmartSide average sales prices were up 6% and volumes decreased 14%. We believe that the volume decreased in our SmartSide Siding line with our customers, especially refinish us, rebalanced our inventory, became of allocation as well as due to the continued impact of the wet weather in the second quarter of 2015. 
During the third quarter of 2015, we started the conversion of our Swan Valley OSB mill to a SmartSide now. During the majority of the quarter, this mill was not operation. We estimated the expenses incurred at Swan Valley facility during the third quarter related to the conversion were approximately $4.5 million. We produced ancillary $57 million OSB in the segment during the third quarter of 2015. CanExel prices were down 12% U.S. dollars, but up 11% Canadian Dollar. Canada is CanExel's primary market, volumes were down 14% in the quarter due to decrease primarily in Europe, due to discontinuation of certain pre-centers color Siding product. 
The Siding segment reported sales of $495 million for the first 9 months of 2015, an increase of 4% from $476 million reported in the first 9 months of 2014. Siding segment reported operating income of $79 million and adjusted EBITDA of $95 million for the first 9 months of 2015, as compared to $66 million of operating income and $79 million of adjusted EBITDA in the same period of 2014. 
SmartSide sales prices were up 6% and volumes were down 1% for the 9 months of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. CanExel sales prices were down 6% U.S. dollars, however, up 12% Canadian dollar. Sales volume decreased 8%. 
Please turn to Slide 7 of the presentation, which shows the results of our Engineered Wood Products segment. This segment includes I-Joist, Laminated Strand Lumber, Laminated Veneer Lumber, OSB produced at our Houlton, Maine facility plus other related products. This segment also includes the sales of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi joint venture under sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. 
The Engineered Wood Products segment recorded sales of $74 million in the third quarter of 2015, down from $77 million in the third quarter of 2014. The segment's operating loss in the third quarter of 2015 was $1 million as compared to breakeven in the third quarter of 2014. For the third quarter of 2015, adjusted EBITDA from continued operations declined by $1 million from the third quarter of 2014. Volumes of I-Joist were up 5%, while volumes of LVL and LSL were down 3% in the same quarter of last year. 
Pricing was down 1% in both I-Joist, LVL and LSL. During the quarter and the first 9 months of 2015, we changed the mix of OSB products at our Houlton operations to manufacture primarily value-added foreign product. The impact of this change improved operating results by $500,000 in the quarter and $2.1 million for the first 9 months of 2015. 
For the first 9 months, sales were $211 million, down slightly from the same period in 2014. This segment's operating loss in the first 9 months was $7 million as compared to $9 million in the same period for 2014. Adjusted EBITDA declined by $1 million for the first 9 months of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. 
Turning to Slide 8 of the presentation. For the quarter, our South American segment recorded $27 million -- recorded sales of $27 million as compared to $36 million in the third quarter of 2014. Operating income was $2 million in the third quarter of 2015 compared to breakeven in the third quarter of 2014. South America's adjusted EBITDA was $4 million for the third quarter of 2015, was $2 million higher than same period in 2014. Volumes in Chile were up 13% and lower by 4% in Brazil compared to the same quarter last year. The sales volume increase in Chile was primarily due to improved housing demand. In Brazil, the reduction in sales volume was due to reduced industry demand associated with the economic recession. Pricing was down 15% in Chile and down 23% in Brazil. In local currency, Chile's pricing was flat with the same quarter in 2014; and Brazil's pricing showed an increase of 21%, primarily due to increased export. For the first 9 months, our South American segment recorded sales of $101 million as compared to $150 million in the first 9 months of 2014. 
Operating income was $7 million compared to $9 million in the first 9 months of 2014. And adjusted EBITDA declined to $30 million from $50 million from the same period in 2014. Total selling, general and administrative expenses were $38 million in the quarter of 2015 compared to $32 million in the same quarter of 2014. And $150 million for the first 9 months as compared to $109 million for the same period in 2014. 
For the quarter and the 9-month period, the increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses was primarily related to higher sales of marketing expenses, associated with our corporate initiatives and compensation expense. 
We recorded a $4 million foreign exchange loss in the quarter compared to $1 million in the same quarter last year. For the first 9 months, we recorded a loss of $6 million compared to a $2 million loss in 2014. This loss was primarily driven by the devaluation with the Brazilian real and the devaluation's impact on the dollar denominator. These foreign exchange losses are deductions to our adjusted EBITDA. Interest expense net was flat between the quarters. 
Please refer to Slide 9 of the presentation. As of September 30, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents investments and restricted cash of $468 million. Working capital of $674 million, net cash of $101 million. In addition to the $468 million of cash on our balance sheet, we have $200 million of availability on our credit facility. Capital expenditures through September 30, 2015, were $67 million. Capital spending for 2015 is expected to be in the range of $120 million to $130 million. We're still completing 2016 budget, but we expect capital spending for 2016 to be around $100 million for our North American business, we continue to invest in our selling business. We also find in western or South American business of our first Chilean mill. We anticipated that Jillian mill will be funded by cash on hand in Chile as well as local board. With that, I'll turn the call over to Curt for his comments."

Good morning, and thanks for joining us on the call. Let me first start with LP's safety performance. Year-to-date, our total incident rate for recordable injuries was 0.49 and a rolling 12-month PIR in the September was at 0.43. Signif",1094,"Thank you, Sallie. Good morning, and thanks for joining us on the call. Let me first start with LP's safety performance. Year-to-date, our total incident rate for recordable injuries was 0.49 and a rolling 12-month PIR in the September was at 0.43. Significant milestones in the quarter included 3 years recordable at our Chile, 2 years injury free in Park County Alabama and 3 mills have celebrated 1 year without a recordable injury. 
As I typically do on these calls, I will provide a few comments on our results and the accomplishments in the quarter, discuss the housing market and give you my views on the rest of 2015 into next year. After that, we'll turn it over to Chanel, to take questions. OSB pricing continues to be below the projections from industry experts like FEA, RISI analysts and others. Random North Central was 7% below and already low Q3 2014 pricing level. The good news is that we have seen OSB prices as reported by Random Lengths move from about $184 million, North Central at the end of July to the $253 last Friday, 13 straight weeks of increases that accumulated to 38% better pricing. Our Siding business had a reasonable quarter with $22 million in adjusted EBITDA, despite the negative impact of the inventory drawdowns, particularly, at our pre-finishing customers and the cost associated with the Swan Valley conversion. 
Speaking about the conversion in our Swan Valley OSB mill, the SmartSide production, I'm please to report that we produced our first Siding board last Friday and the project is on-time and on budget. As you know, this will be critical to the ongoing growth if there's some important business segment. One other note is we completed that project injury free both for our employees as well as the many contractors that we had on-site. 
EWP was once again a positive EBITDA on the quarter with volumes that are consistent -- volume changes that were consistent with the industry, as reported by the APA. In South America, our results were nearly doubled the same quarter last year, despite ongoing political and economic turmoil in Brazil and much weaker currencies in both Brazil and in Chile. 
In early October, what was taken among the various governmental agencies to improve the environmental permit for our third mill in Chile and the result is positive. We're in the mandatory waiting period provided by statute for any further concerns to be raised. This period will end in late November and assuming nothing is filed, we will be in a position to begin this work in earnest. 
For the changing government and additional regulations, this process has taken longer and been more complicated than we've experienced in the past. On the housing market, there was mostly good news in the U.S. Census Bureau released on housing on October 20. For September, housing starts came in at a little over $1.2 million, while permits were a bit lower at 1.1 billion. This is the 6-month in a row with housing starts over 1 million with the average over this period of time being 1.161. Another positive housing at news, household formations continue to significantly exceed the endemic pace for last several years. In Q1 of this year, also formations were 1.5 million. And Q2, that pace increased to 2.1 million according to Census Bureau data. Over the last few years, there's been a lot of concern about the participation on the millennial generation in the housing recovery. So here's a piece of good news. The 2015 National Association of realtors, home buyers and seller generational trend report, that's a multiple, says millennial is now comprised the largest category of home buyers, 32% with 68% of those being first-time homebuyers. The NAHB homebuilder confidence index in September reached the highest level in over 10 years, which also bodes well for more activity. On the financing side, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate for the weakening October '16 was at 3.82, which interesting is below the rate that was a year ago. For the higher sales of existing homes, it's also good news, remodeling expenditures. So the forecast for future housing activity now stand at the consensus for 2015 is 1.125 at 12% increase over last year. And the consensus forecast for 2016 is 1.307 million or 16% increase over the forecast for 2015. 
For LP, we're using a budget assumption of 1.2  to 1.25  for 2016 housing starts. In the first half this year, we did see somewhat weaker demand for our products, probably driven by very cold weather in the first quarter and wet weather in the second quarter. This led to a drawdown of inventories early in the third quarter with a pickup in activity in August and September. This increased demand was reflected in the increasing OSB pricing during the last 2 months of the quarter and into October. Furthermore, miles filed, so far, we're continuing to see demand at higher levels, which should carry over into 2016. Based on discussions with customers, there was a strong belief that 2016 will have a higher level of activity than this year in all areas, new home construction, repair remodel, light commercial and industrial. This is good for LP, as we focus on these broader segments with value proposition to each. 
And I lookout beyond next year, I believe that we'll have several more years of housing growth in front of us based on demographics and the slow rate of recovery, so far. Major constraining factors to more immediate, robust, housing recovery remain labor at all levels, available lots and access to credit for the first-time homebuyers. I believe that the labor issues faced by the builders will ease either through increased employment or changing construction practices that will reduce the need for labor. The lot shortage is a result of a multitude of factors that may take longer to address. Regulation, shortage of manpower and planning departments, funding for infrastructure and Ireland pricing. On the financing side, we now know there will be no significant changes for Fannie and Freddie, until after the 2016 elections. And looks like the Fed is going to delay the action until raising rates. And banks should get into the practice of making loans again. This is good for our stakeholders as LP is well-positioned to capitalize on the continued growth and housing, repair and remodeling activities with our product portfolio and focus on growth and innovation to meet our customers need. With that, let me turn it over to Shannon for questions."

That's my conclusion, George. if you look at it by segment, our retail business is pretty good all the way through. Our repair modeling business, is largely where the finished product goes, so repair modeling has been off. And then with new home construction, we have seen a tremendous change in the cycle time. We're building a house going from 90 to 100 days, 170 days to 180 days, and the Siding is the last thing that goes off from the structure.

Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss LP's financial results for the third quarter of 2015. I am Sallie Bailey, LP's Chief Financial Officer; and with me today are Curt Stevens, LP's Chief Executive Officer; as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barckley, our primary Investor Relations contact.
I'll begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2015. It will be followed by some comments on the performance of the individual segments and selected balance sheet items. And after I finish my remarks, Curt will discuss the general market environment in which LP has been operating, provide his perspective on our operative results and give some thoughts on the outlook. As we have done in the past, we have opened up this call to the public and are doing a webcast. And that webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. 
Additionally, to help with the discussions, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I will be referencing these slides in my comments this morning. We filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information as well as our Form 10-Q. I want to remind all the participants about the forward-looking statements comment on Slide 2 of the presentation. Please also be aware of the discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. The appendix attached to the presentation has some of the necessary reconciliations that have been supplemented by the Form 8-K filing we made this morning. Rather than reading these 2 statements, I incorporate them with this reference. 
LP's OSB price in the third quarter was 7% below the third quarter of 2014. This level of OSB pricing continued to negatively impact our financial results. However, even in this environment, all 4 business segments reported positive adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, and we're reporting a comparable level of adjusted EBITDA and $53 million less in sales for the third quarter of 2015 as compared to the third quarter of 2014, while also absorbing $4.5 million of estimated expense associated with the Swan conversion to a Siding mill and $4 million of foreign exchange loss. And with that, let me go into the details. 
Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of the third quarter 2015 and first 9 months of 2015 consolidated results. We are reporting net sales of $465 million for the third quarter of 2015, a 10% decrease from the net sales of $518 million reported in the third quarter of 2014. In the third quarter, we recorded a net loss of $27 million compared to a net loss for the third quarter of 2014 of $20 million. The adjusted loss from continuing operations for the same quarter was $16 million based upon a normalized tax rate of 35%, which is comparable to the same period in 2014. 
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $11 million in the quarter was $1 million less than the third quarter of 2014. In the first 9 months of 2015, we recorded a net loss of $81 million compared to a net loss for the third quarter of 2014 of $33 million. The adjusted loss for the 9-month period was $47 million based upon normalized tax rate of 35% compared to $28 million for the first 9 months of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $33 million for the first 9 months of 2015 compared to $61 million in the same period of 2014. 
Moving on to Slide 5 of the -- and a review of our segment results, beginning with OSB. OSB recorded an operating loss of $11 million on sales of $200 million compared to a loss of $16 million on $233 million of sales in the third quarter of 2014. For the quarter, we reported adjusted EBITDA of $4 million compared to negative adjusted EBITDA of $1 million for the third quarter of 2014. We had a 9% decrease in sales volume, primarily due to the transfer of our Swan Valley facility to the Siding segment. Overall, the company's OSB shipments, including shipments from our Swan, Hayward and Houlton facilities in the third quarter, were 4% below the third quarter of 2014. 
Pricing for OSB was lower by 7% compared to the third quarter of 2014. This decrease in pricing resulted in lower operating results by $16 million. For the first 9 months of 2015, OSB recorded an operating loss of $58 million and net sales of $601 million compared to a loss of $24 million on $652 million of sales in the first 9 months of 2014. For the first 9 months, we reported negative adjusted EBITDA of $13 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $19 million in the first 9 months of 2014. 
Sales volumes were higher by 4%, and sales prices were lower by 12%. The impact of the lower sales price on OSB operations was $81 million for the first 9 months of 2015 compared to the prior year. Offsetting the reduction in sales prices for both the quarter and the 9-month period was the reduction in the raw material costs related to petroleum, base raw materials as well as the positive impact of the Canadian currency exchange rate. 
Slide 6 reports the results of our Siding business. This segment includes our SmartSide and CanExel siding products as well as small amounts of OSB. The Siding segment reported net sales of $158 million in the third quarter of 2015, a decrease of 3% from $163 million reported in third quarter of 2014. The Siding segment reported operating income of $17 million compared to $21 million in the third quarter of 2014 and adjusted EBITDA of $22 million as compared to $26 million in the same quarter of 2014. 
For the quarter, SmartSide average sales prices were up 6% and volumes decreased 14%. We believe that the volume decrease in our SmartSide siding line with our customers, especially refinishers, rebalanced our inventories as we came off allocation as well as due to the continued impact of the wet weather in the second quarter of 2015. 
During the third quarter of 2015, we started the conversion of our Swan Valley OSB mill to a SmartSide mill. During the majority of the quarter, this mill was not operational. We estimated that the expenses incurred at the Swan Valley facility during the third quarter related to the conversion were approximately $4.5 million. We produced and sold 57 million square feet of OSB in this segment during the third quarter of 2015. CanExel prices were down 12% U.S. dollars, but up 11% in Canadian dollars. Canada is CanExel's primary market. Volumes were down 14% in the quarter due to decreased demand, primarily in Europe, due to discontinuation of certain pre-finished color Siding products. 
The Siding segment reported sales of $495 million for the first 9 months of 2015, an increase of 4% from $476 million reported in the first 9 months of 2014. Siding segment reported operating income of $79 million and adjusted EBITDA of $95 million for the first 9 months of 2015 as compared to $66 million of operating income and $79 million of adjusted EBITDA in the same period of 2014. 
SmartSide sales prices were up 6% and volumes were down 1% for the 9 months of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. CanExel sales prices were down 6% in U.S. dollars, however, up 12% in Canadian dollar. Sales volume decreased 8%. 
Please turn to Slide 7 of the presentation, which shows the results of our Engineered Wood Products segment. This segment includes I-Joist, the Laminated Strand Lumber, Laminated Veneer Lumber, OSB produced at our Houlton, Maine facility plus other related products. This segment also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi joint venture under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. 
The Engineered Wood Products segment recorded sales of $74 million in the third quarter of 2015, down from $77 million in the third quarter of 2014. The segment's operating loss in the third quarter of 2015 was $1 million as compared to breakeven in the third quarter of 2014. For the third quarter of 2015, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations declined by $1 million from the third quarter of 2014 to $3 million. Volumes of I-Joist were up 5%, while volumes of LVL and LSL were down 3% to the same quarter of last year. Pricing was down 1% in both I-Joist, LVL and LSL.
During the quarter and the first 9 months of 2015, we changed the mix of OSB products at our Houlton operations to manufacture primarily value-added foreign products. The impact of this change improved operating results by $500,000 in the quarter and $2.1 million for the first 9 months of 2015. 
For the first 9 months, sales were $211 million, down slightly from the same period in 2014. The segment's operating loss in the first 9 months was $7 million as compared to $9 million in the same period of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA declined by $1 million for the first 9 months of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. 
Turning to Slide 8 of the presentation. For the quarter, our South American segment recorded $27 million -- recorded sales of $27 million as compared to $36 million in the third quarter of 2014. Operating income was $2 million in the third quarter of 2015 compared to breakeven in the third quarter of 2014. South America's adjusted EBITDA of $4 million for the third quarter of 2015 was $2 million higher than the same period in 2014. Volumes in Chile were up 13% and lower by 4% in Brazil compared to the same quarter last year. The sales volume increase in Chile was primarily due to improved housing demand. In Brazil, the reduction in sales volume was due to reduced industrial demand associated with the economic recession. Pricing was down 15% in Chile and down 23% in Brazil. In local currency, Chile's pricing was flat with the same quarter in 2014, and Brazil's pricing showed an increase of 21%, primarily due to increased exports. For the first 9 months, our South American segment recorded sales of $101 million as compared to $115 million in the first 9 months of 2014. 
Operating income was $7 million compared to $9 million in the first 9 months of 2014. And adjusted EBITDA declined to $13 million from $15 million from the same period in 2014. Total selling, general and administrative expenses were $38 million in the quarter of 2015 compared to $32 million in the same quarter of 2014, and $115 million for the first 9 months as compared to $109 million for the same period in 2014. 
For the quarter and the 9-month period, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily related to higher sales and marketing expenses associated with our corporate initiatives and compensation expense. 
We recorded a $4 million foreign exchange loss in the quarter compared to a $1 million loss in the same quarter last year. For the first 9 months, we recorded a loss of $6 million compared to a $2 million loss in 2014. This loss was primarily driven by the devaluation of the Brazilian real and the devaluation's impact on the dollar-denominated loan. These foreign exchange losses are deductions to our adjusted EBITDA. Interest expense net was flat between the quarters. 
Please refer to Slide 9 of the presentation. As of September 30, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash of $468 million; working capital of $674 million; net cash of $101 million. In addition to the $468 million of cash on our balance sheet, we have $200 million of availability on our credit facility. Capital expenditures through September 30, 2015, were $67 million. Capital spending for 2015 is expected to be in the range of $120 million to $130 million. We are still completing our 2016 budget, but we expect capital spending for 2016 to be around $100 million for our North American business. We continue to invest in our Siding business. We also plan to invest in our South American business with our third Chilean mill, and we anticipated that the third Chilean mill will be funded by cash on hand in Chile as well as local borrowing.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Curt for his comments."

Good morning, and thanks for joining us on the call. Let me first start with LP's safety performance. Year-to-date, our total incident rate for recordable injuries was 0.49 and the rolling 12-month PIR at the end of September was at 0.4",1117,"Thank you, Sallie. Good morning, and thanks for joining us on the call. Let me first start with LP's safety performance. Year-to-date, our total incident rate for recordable injuries was 0.49 and the rolling 12-month PIR at the end of September was at 0.43. Significant milestones in the quarter included 3 years recordable-free at our Panguipulli mill in Chile, 2 years injury-free in Park County Alabama and 3 mills have celebrated 1 year without a recordable injury. 
As I typically do on these calls, I will provide a few comments on our results and the accomplishments in the quarter, discuss the housing market and give you my views on the rest of 2015 and into next year. After that, we'll turn it over to Chanel to take questions. OSB pricing continues to be below the projections from industry experts like FEA, RISI, analysts and others. Random Lengths North Central was 7% below and already low Q3 2014 pricing level. The good news is that we have seen the OSB prices as recorded by Random Lengths' move from about $184 per MSF 3/8 North Central at the end of July to $253 last Friday, 13 straight weeks of increases that accumulated to 38% better pricing. Our Siding business had a reasonable quarter with $22 million in adjusted EBITDA, despite the negative impact of the inventory drawdowns, particularly at our pre-finishing customers and the costs associated with the Swan Valley conversion. 
Speaking about the conversion in the Swan Valley OSB mill to SmartSide production, I'm pleased to report that we produced our first Siding board last Friday and the project is on-time and on budget. As you know, this will be critical to the ongoing growth of this important business segment. One other note is we completed that project injury-free both for our employees as well as the many contractors that we had on-site. 
EWP was once again a positive EBITDA in the quarter with volumes that were consistent -- volume changes that were consistent with the industry as reported by the APA. In South America, our results were nearly doubled the same quarter last year, despite ongoing political and economic turmoil in Brazil and much weaker currencies in both Brazil and in Chile. 
In early October, a vote was taken among the various governmental agencies to approve the environmental permit for our third mill in Chile and the result was positive. We are in the mandatory waiting period provided by statute for any further concerns to be raised. This period will end in late November, and assuming nothing is filed, we will be in a position to begin this work in earnest. 
With a changing government and additional regulations, this process has taken longer and been more complicated than we've experienced in the past. On the housing market, there was mostly good news in the U.S. Census Bureau released on housing on October 20. For September, housing starts came in at a little over 1.2 million, while permits were a bit lower at 1.1 million. This is the sixth month in a row with housing starts over 1 million with the average over this period of time being 1.161. Another positive housing news, household formations continue to significantly exceed the anemic pace of the last several years. In Q1 of this year, household formations were 1.5 million. In Q2, that pace increased to 2.1 million, according to Census Bureau data. Over the last few years, there's been a lot of concern about the participation of the millennial generation in the housing recovery. So here's a piece of good news. The 2015 National Association of Realtors, Home Buyers and Seller Generational Trend Report, that's a mouthful, says millennials now comprise the largest category of home buyers, 32%, with 68% of those being first-time homebuyers. The NAHB homebuilder confidence index in September reached the highest level in over 10 years, which also bodes well for more activity. On the financing side, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate for the weakening October 16 was at 3.82%, which, interesting, is below the rate it was a year ago. With higher sales of existing homes, this is also good news for repair and remodeling expenditures. So the forecast for future housing activity now stand at the consensus for 2015 is 1.125 million, a 12% increase over last year. And the consensus forecast for 2016 is 1.307 million or 16% increase over the forecast for 2015. 
For LP, we are using a budget assumption of 1.2 million to 1.25 million for 2016 housing starts. In the first half this year, we did see somewhat weaker demand for our products, probably driven by very cold weather in the first quarter and wet weather in the second quarter. This led to a drawdown of inventories early in the third quarter with a pickup in activity in August and September. This increased demand was reflected in the increasing OSB pricing during the last 2 months of the quarter and into October. With a more mild fall so far, we are continuing to see demand at higher levels, which should carry over into 2016. Based on discussions with customers, there was a strong belief that 2016 will have a higher level of activity than this year in all areas: new home construction, repair/remodel, light commercial and industrial. This is good for LP as we focus on these broader segments with value propositions to each. 
As I look out beyond next year, I believe that we'll have several more years of housing growth in front of us based on demographics and the slow rate of recovery so far. The major constraining factors to a more immediate, robust housing recovery remain labor at all levels, available lots and access to credit for the first-time homebuyer. I believe that the labor issues faced by the builders will ease either through increased employment or changing construction practices that will reduce the need for labor. The lot shortage is a result of a multitude of factors that may take longer to address. Regulation, shortage of manpower and planning departments, funding for infrastructure and higher land pricing. On the financing side, we now know there will be no significant changes for Fannie and Freddie until after the 2016 elections. It looks like the Fed is going to delay action until December on raising rates, and banks should get into the practice of making loans again. This is good for our stakeholders as LP is well positioned to capitalize on the continued growth and housing, repair and remodeling activities with our product portfolio and focus on growth and innovation to meet our customers' needs.
With that, let me turn it over to Chanel for questions."

And then with the wet weather we had in Q2, they didn't have the offtakes in Q2, so they didn't reorder in Q3. But it really is tied to those pre-finishers now. Our salespeople have talked to them.

Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss LP's financial results for the third quarter of 2015. I am Sallie Bailey, LP's Chief Financial Officer; and with me today are Curt Stevens, LP's Chief Executive Officer; as well as Mike Kinney and Becky Barckley, our primary Investor Relations contact.
I'll begin the discussion with a review of the financial results for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2015. It will be followed by some comments on the performance of the individual segments and selected balance sheet items. And after I finish my remarks, Curt will discuss the general market environment in which LP has been operating, provide his perspective on our operative results and give some thoughts on the outlook. As we have done in the past, we have opened up this call to the public and are doing a webcast. And that webcast can be accessed at www.lpcorp.com. 
Additionally, to help with the discussions, we have provided a presentation with supplemental information that should be reviewed in conjunction with the earnings release. I will be referencing these slides in my comments this morning. We filed an 8-K this morning with some supplemental information as well as our Form 10-Q. I want to remind all the participants about the forward-looking statements comment on Slide 2 of the presentation. Please also be aware of the discussion of our use of non-GAAP financial information included on Slide 3 of the presentation. The appendix attached to the presentation has some of the necessary reconciliations that have been supplemented by the Form 8-K filing we made this morning. Rather than reading these 2 statements, I incorporate them with this reference. 
LP's OSB price in the third quarter was 7% below the third quarter of 2014. This level of OSB pricing continued to negatively impact our financial results. However, even in this environment, all 4 business segments reported positive adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, and we're reporting a comparable level of adjusted EBITDA and $53 million less in sales for the third quarter of 2015 as compared to the third quarter of 2014, while also absorbing $4.5 million of estimated expense associated with the Swan conversion to a Siding mill and $4 million of foreign exchange loss. And with that, let me go into the details. 
Moving to Slide 4 of the presentation for a discussion of the third quarter 2015 and first 9 months of 2015 consolidated results. We are reporting net sales of $465 million for the third quarter of 2015, a 10% decrease from the net sales of $518 million reported in the third quarter of 2014. In the third quarter, we recorded a net loss of $27 million compared to a net loss for the third quarter of 2014 of $20 million. The adjusted loss from continuing operations for the same quarter was $16 million based upon a normalized tax rate of 35%, which is comparable to the same period in 2014. 
Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $11 million in the quarter was $1 million less than the third quarter of 2014. In the first 9 months of 2015, we recorded a net loss of $81 million compared to a net loss for the third quarter of 2014 of $33 million. The adjusted loss for the 9-month period was $47 million based upon a normalized tax rate of 35% compared to $28 million for the first 9 months of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $33 million for the first 9 months of 2015 compared to $61 million in the same period of 2014. 
Moving on to Slide 5 of the -- and a review of our segment results, beginning with OSB. OSB recorded an operating loss of $11 million on sales of $200 million compared to a loss of $16 million on $233 million of sales in the third quarter of 2014. For the quarter, we reported adjusted EBITDA of $4 million compared to negative adjusted EBITDA of $1 million for the third quarter of 2014. We had a 9% decrease in sales volume, primarily due to the transfer of our Swan Valley facility to the Siding segment. Overall, the company's OSB shipments, including shipments from our Swan, Hayward and Houlton facilities in the third quarter, were 4% below the third quarter of 2014. 
Pricing for OSB was lower by 7% compared to the third quarter of 2014. This decrease in pricing resulted in lower operating results by $16 million. For the first 9 months of 2015, OSB recorded an operating loss of $58 million on net sales of $601 million compared to a loss of $24 million on $652 million of sales in the first 9 months of 2014. For the first 9 months, we reported negative adjusted EBITDA of $13 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $19 million in the first 9 months of 2014. 
Sales volumes were higher by 4%, and sales prices were lower by 12%. The impact of the lower sales price on OSB operations was $81 million for the first 9 months of 2015 compared to the prior year. Offsetting the reduction in sales prices for both the quarter and the 9-month period was the reduction in the raw material costs related to petroleum based raw materials as well as the positive impact of the Canadian currency exchange rate. 
Slide 6 reports the results of our Siding business. This segment includes our SmartSide and CanExel siding products as well as small amounts of OSB. The Siding segment reported net sales of $158 million in the third quarter of 2015, a decrease of 3% from $163 million reported in third quarter of 2014. The Siding segment reported operating income of $17 million compared to $21 million in the third quarter of 2014 and adjusted EBITDA of $22 million as compared to $26 million in the same quarter of 2014. 
For the quarter, SmartSide average sales prices were up 6% and volumes decreased 14%. We believe that the volume decrease in our SmartSide siding line with our customers, especially refinishers, rebalanced our inventories as we came off allocation as well as due to the continued impact of the wet weather in the second quarter of 2015. 
During the third quarter of 2015, we started the conversion of our Swan Valley OSB mill to a SmartSide mill. During the majority of the quarter, this mill was not operational. We estimated that the expenses incurred at the Swan Valley facility during the third quarter related to the conversion were approximately $4.5 million. We produced and sold 57 million square feet of OSB in this segment during the third quarter of 2015. CanExel prices were down 12% U.S. dollars, but up 11% in Canadian dollars. Canada is CanExel's primary market. Volumes were down 14% in the quarter due to decreased demand, primarily in Europe, due to discontinuation of certain pre-finished color Siding products. 
The Siding segment reported sales of $495 million for the first 9 months of 2015, an increase of 4% from $476 million reported in the first 9 months of 2014. Siding segment reported operating income of $79 million and adjusted EBITDA of $95 million for the first 9 months of 2015 as compared to $66 million of operating income and $79 million of adjusted EBITDA in the same period of 2014. 
SmartSide sales prices were up 6% and volumes were down 1% for the 9 months of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. CanExel sales prices were down 6% in U.S. dollars, however, up 12% in Canadian dollars. Sales volume decreased 8%. 
Please turn to Slide 7 of the presentation, which shows the results of our Engineered Wood Products segment. This segment includes I-Joist, the Laminated Strand Lumber, Laminated Veneer Lumber, OSB produced at our Houlton, Maine facility plus other related products. This segment also includes the sale of I-Joist and LVL products produced by the Abitibi joint venture under a sales arrangement with Murphy Plywood. 
The Engineered Wood Products segment recorded sales of $74 million in the third quarter of 2015, down from $77 million in the third quarter of 2014. The segment's operating loss in the third quarter of 2015 was $1 million as compared to breakeven in the third quarter of 2014. For the third quarter of 2015, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations declined by $1 million from the third quarter of 2014 to $3 million. Volumes of I-Joist were up 5%, while volumes of LVL and LSL were down 3% to the same quarter of last year. Pricing was down 1% in both I-Joist, LVL and LSL.
During the quarter and the first 9 months of 2015, we changed the mix of OSB products at our Houlton operations to manufacture primarily value-added flooring products. The impact of this change improved operating results by $500,000 in the quarter and $2.1 million for the first 9 months of 2015. 
For the first 9 months, sales were $211 million, down slightly from the same period in 2014. The segment's operating loss in the first 9 months was $7 million as compared to $9 million in the same period of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA declined by $1 million for the first 9 months of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. 
Turning to Slide 8 of the presentation. For the quarter, our South American segment recorded $27 million -- recorded sales of $27 million as compared to $36 million in the third quarter of 2014. Operating income was $2 million in the third quarter of 2015 compared to breakeven in the third quarter of 2014. South America's adjusted EBITDA of $4 million for the third quarter of 2015 was $2 million higher than the same period in 2014. Volumes in Chile were up 13% and lower by 4% in Brazil compared to the same quarter last year. The sales volume increase in Chile was primarily due to improved housing demand. In Brazil, the reduction in sales volume was due to reduced industrial demand associated with the economic recession. Pricing was down 15% in Chile and down 23% in Brazil. In local currency, Chile's pricing was flat with the same quarter in 2014, and Brazil's pricing showed an increase of 21%, primarily due to increased exports. For the first 9 months, our South American segment recorded sales of $101 million as compared to $115 million in the first 9 months of 2014. 
Operating income was $7 million compared to $9 million in the first 9 months of 2014. And adjusted EBITDA declined to $13 million from $15 million from the same period in 2014. Total selling, general and administrative expenses were $38 million in the quarter of 2015 compared to $32 million in the same quarter of 2014, and $115 million for the first 9 months as compared to $109 million for the same period in 2014. 
For the quarter and the 9-month period, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily related to higher sales and marketing expenses associated with our corporate initiatives and compensation expense. 
We recorded a $4 million foreign exchange loss in the quarter compared to a $1 million loss in the same quarter last year. For the first 9 months, we recorded a loss of $6 million compared to a $2 million loss in 2014. This loss was primarily driven by the devaluation of the Brazilian real and the devaluation's impact on the dollar-denominated loan. These foreign exchange losses are deductions to our adjusted EBITDA. Interest expense net was flat between the quarters. 
Please refer to Slide 9 of the presentation. As of September 30, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash of $468 million; working capital of $674 million; net cash of $101 million. In addition to the $468 million of cash on our balance sheet, we have $200 million of availability on our credit facility. Capital expenditures through September 30, 2015, were $67 million. Capital spending for 2015 is expected to be in the range of $120 million to $130 million. We are still completing our 2016 budget, but we expect capital spending for 2016 to be around $100 million for our North American business. We continue to invest in our Siding business. We also plan to invest in our South American business with our third Chilean mill, and we anticipated that the third Chilean mill will be funded by cash on hand in Chile as well as local borrowing.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Curt for his comments."
286119,313871621,890938,"Louisiana-Pacific Corp., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2015",2015-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Louisiana-Pacific Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Sallie. Good morning, and thanks for joining us on the call. Let me first start with LP's safety performance. Year-to-date, our total incident rate for recordable injuries was 0.49 and the rolling 12-month TIR at the end of September was at 0.4",1120,"Thank you, Sallie. Good morning, and thanks for joining us on the call. Let me first start with LP's safety performance. Year-to-date, our total incident rate for recordable injuries was 0.49 and the rolling 12-month TIR at the end of September was at 0.43. Significant milestones in the quarter included 3 years recordable-free at our Panguipulli mill in Chile, 2 years injury-free in Clarke County Alabama and 3 mills that celebrated 1 year without a recordable injury. 
As I typically do on these calls, I will provide a few comments on our results and the accomplishments in the quarter, discuss the housing market and give you my views on the rest of 2015 and into next year. After that, we'll turn it over to Chanel to take questions. OSB pricing continues to be below the projections from industry experts like FEA, RISI, analysts and others. Random Lengths North Central was 7% below an already low Q3 2014 pricing level. The good news is that we have seen the OSB prices as recorded by Random Lengths' move from about $184 per MSF 3/8 North Central at the end of July to $253 last Friday, 13 straight weeks of increases that accumulated to 38% better pricing. Our Siding business had a reasonable quarter with $22 million in adjusted EBITDA, despite the negative impact of the inventory drawdowns, particularly at our pre-finishing customers and the costs associated with the Swan Valley conversion. 
Speaking about the conversion in the Swan Valley OSB mill to SmartSide production, I'm pleased to report that we produced our first Siding board last Friday and the project is on-time and on budget. As you know, this will be critical to the ongoing growth of this important business segment. One other note is we completed that project injury-free both for our employees as well as the many contractors that we had on-site. 
EWP was once again a positive EBITDA in the quarter with volumes that were consistent -- volume changes that were consistent with the industry as reported by the APA. In South America, our results were nearly double the same quarter last year, despite ongoing political and economic turmoil in Brazil and much weaker currencies in both Brazil and in Chile. 
In early October, a vote was taken among the various governmental agencies to approve the environmental permit for our third mill in Chile and the result was positive. We are in the mandatory waiting period provided by statute for any further concerns to be raised. This period will end in late November, and assuming nothing is filed, we will be in a position to begin this work in earnest.  With a change in government and additional regulations, this process has taken longer and been more complicated than we've experienced in the past. 
On the housing market, there was mostly good news in the U.S. Census Bureau release on housing on October 20. For September, housing starts came in at a little over 1.2 million, while permits were a bit lower at 1.1 million. This is the sixth month in a row with housing starts over 1 million with the average over this period of time being 1.161 million. Another positive housing news, household formations continue to significantly exceed the anemic pace of the last several years. In Q1 of this year, household formations were 1.5 million. In Q2, that pace increased to 2.1 million, according to Census Bureau data. Over the last few years, there's been a lot of concern about the participation of the millennial generation in the housing recovery. So here's a piece of good news. The 2015 National Association of Realtors, Home Buyers and Seller Generational Trend Report, that's a mouthful, says millennials now comprise the largest category of home buyers, 32%, with 68% of those being first-time homebuyers. The NAHB homebuilder confidence index in September reached the highest level in over 10 years, which also bodes well for more activity. On the financing side, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate for the week ending October 16 was at 3.82%, which, interesting, is below the rate it was a year ago. With higher sales of existing homes, this is also good news for repair and remodeling expenditures. So the forecast for future housing activity now stand at the consensus for 2015 is 1.125 million, a 12% increase over last year. And the consensus forecast for 2016 is 1.307 million or 16% increase over the forecast for 2015. 
For LP, we are using a budget assumption of 1.2 million to 1.25 million for 2016 housing starts. In the first half this year, we did see somewhat weaker demand for our products, probably driven by very cold weather in the first quarter and wet weather in the second quarter. This led to a drawdown of inventories early in the third quarter with a pickup in activity in August and September. This increased demand was reflected in the increasing OSB pricing during the last 2 months of the quarter and into October. With a more mild fall so far, we are continuing to see demand at higher levels, which should carry over into 2016. Based on discussions with customers, there was a strong belief that 2016 will have a higher level of activity than this year in all areas: new home construction, repair/remodel, light commercial and industrial. This is good for LP as we focus on these broader segments with value propositions to each. 
As I look out beyond next year, I believe that we'll have several more years of housing growth in front of us based on demographics and the slow rate of recovery so far. The major constraining factors to a more immediate, robust housing recovery remain labor at all levels, available lots and access to credit for the first-time homebuyer. I believe that the labor issues faced by the builders will ease either through increased employment or changing construction practices that will reduce the need for labor. The lot shortage is a result of a multitude of factors that may take longer to address. Regulation, shortage of manpower in planning departments, funding for infrastructure and higher land pricing. On the financing side, we now know there will be no significant changes to Fannie and Freddie until after the 2016 elections. It looks like the Fed is going to delay action until December on raising rates, and banks should get into the practice of making loans again. This is good for our stakeholders as LP is well positioned to capitalize on the continued growth in housing, repair and remodeling activities with our product portfolio and focus on growth and innovation to meet our customers' needs.
With that, let me turn it over to Chanel for questions."

And then with the wet weather we had in Q2, they didn't have the offtakes in Q2, so they didn't reorder in Q3. But it really is tied to those pre-finishers now. Our salespeople have talked to them.

We also spend a lot of time talking about student debt.
