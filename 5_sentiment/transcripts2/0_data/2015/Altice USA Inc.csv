Cablevision delivered strong financial results in 2014, while continuing to transform the Optimum experience. We developed higher-quality customer relationships by offering products and services that provide superior value, provided expanded connectivity inside and outside the home, and enhancing the performance of our network. Our full year 2014 financial results reflect our progress. 
Total company net revenue increased nearly 4% and AOCF increased by 9% compared with 2013. Our capital expenditures were $892 million, 6% lower than 2013. Full year 2014 free cash flow was $487 million, and we declared a $0.15 per share quarterly dividend on February 24. Our fourth quarter net customer results compared favorably with the third quarter. We added data customers, despite significant competitive discounting and economic pressures in portions of our footprint. We also significantly reduced the loss of our customer relationships, even in our most competitive areas. Our results reflect a decrease in move and nonpay related churn versus the third quarter. 
During the fourth quarter, we continue to deliver strong year-over-year growth in revenue per customer. Disciplined approaches to pricing, promotional eligibility and customer credit policies are key elements of our strategy. While these policies reduced the number of our available sales opportunities, we believe they contribute to a stronger base of customers over time. We plan to continue these policies in 2015, while differentiating the value of Optimum in the marketplace. 
During 2014, we introduced several new products and enhancements. Let me mention some of them of the more notable initiatives. We introduced 2 new Optimum Online speed tiers, we enhanced our TV to GO video experience by integrating more than 50 networks into the Optimum app, we improved our Multi-Room DVR by increasing simultaneous recording to 15 shows, we also signed our first advertising clients to our new data and analytics service. In addition to these product enhancements, we continue to improve our customer service activity. 2014 total customer service phone calls declined by nearly 16%.
Trouble cost truck rolls declined 21% each as compared with 2013. These achievements reflect the contributions of our nearly 15,000 employees. In 2014, we continue to invest in our people in the transform our culture to one that is more performance base. We did this through new recognition, training and development programs, as well as a new nonexecutive performance bonus plan. 
And finally, let's discuss our WiFi initiatives.
In 2014, we launched our newest WiFi smart router. We also surpassed our goal of reaching more than 1 million Optimum WiFi access points within our service area. We continue to see remarkable growth in Optimum WiFi usage. During the fourth quarter, our customers used more than 4x the amount of data than during the fourth quarter of 2013. 
WiFi is a critical part of our product strategy and one of our most important strategic assets. As I've noted before, we plan to continue to innovate in this area, which brings me to Freewheel, our most recent effort to monetize our investment in WiFi. Freewheel is the first all WiFi device from a cable provider. It is available nationwide and delivers unlimited data talk and text. It works anywhere in the world where you are connected to WiFi. Freewheel is backed by our carrier-grade Optimum WiFi network with 1.1 million hotspots in the tri-state area. 
Today, Optimum WiFi customers pass an average of more than 6 gigabytes of data per month, that is really 3x more data than the most commonly purchased data plans from cellular providers. Against this backdrop, we believe Freewheel will be the beginning of a disruptive force to the cellular industry. 
As a company, we are solidifying our position as our customers prefer connectivity company. Freewheel is a natural progression of this strategy. This the first in a series of new products and services, which we intend to launch in order to better serve our customers. 
For 3 years, we have been improving our relationships with our customers. Today, service quality has become a key differentiator of the Optimum experience, and we remain committed to being the best service provider in the industry. In 2015, as we continue this important work, we expect to introduce additional innovative products and repackage certain of our current offerings. Our goal is to meet and exceed the rapidly evolving demands of our customers. 
With that, we'll now turn the call over to Gregg Seibert."

Total company fourth quarter net revenue increased 3% and AOCF declined by 3.4%, as compared with the prior year period. Capital expenditures were $262 million compared with $211 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Fou",946,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Total company fourth quarter net revenue increased 3% and AOCF declined by 3.4%, as compared with the prior year period. Capital expenditures were $262 million compared with $211 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Fourth quarter free cash flow was $88 million. 
During the quarter, we gained nearly 4,000 net high-speed data customers. Customer relationships and voice customers both decreased by 11,000 and video customers declined by 34,000. 
Fourth quarter average monthly revenue per customer increased by nearly $8 to $155.20 as compared with the prior year period. This increase is consistent with our pricing strategies and principally reflects recent rate initiatives, our disciplined approach to promotional eligibility and higher advertising revenue.
Fourth quarter total cable revenue increased by 3.1%, reflecting the increase in revenue per customer, which was partially offset by fewer customer relationships. 
As compared with 2013, fourth quarter cable advertising revenue increased by 9%, driven primarily by increased political and issue-related spending. This growth was offset in part by lower banking and leisure spending. Our audience data and addressable advertising campaigns contributed to this growth, and we are successfully attracting new national advertisers our advanced advertising and capabilities. 
Cable AOCF declined 4.6% in the fourth quarter, as compared with the prior year period. This primarily reflects the impact of fewer customers and higher programming, employee-related and marketing costs, as well as higher legal expenses and other fees. This was partially offset by revenue growth and lower cost associated with the decline in trouble call related truck rolls and customer service calls. 
Cable's fourth quarter AOCF margin was 30.3%. Full year 2014 AOCF margin was 31.7%, slightly higher than the prior year period comparable margin of 31.2%. Cable capital spending in the fourth quarter was $222 million, a $46 million increase from the same period in 2013. This increase reflects the timing of CPE purchases and higher spending on WiFi and support capital. 
Total cable capital spending for 2014 was approximately 8% lower than the comparable 2013 level. AOCF and capital expenditures for the fourth quarter reflect modest prelaunch investments in Freewheel. 
Lifepath fourth quarter revenue increased 6.2% and AOCF increased 10% over the prior year period. These increases reflect revenue growth in Ethernet-based services, partially offset by the continuing decline in legacy TDM-based services. 
During 2014, Lightpath network expanded to approximately 7,400 buildings, an increase of 600 connections. Lightpath also 100 gigabit optical transport services and managed videoconferencing to its suite of products. Lightpath's expanding product portfolio and nearly ubiquitous footprint continue to present us with a great opportunity to grow into the mid- and large enterprises base. 
In our other segment, fourth quarter revenue was essentially flat and the AOCF deficit improved by 4.5%. These results principally reflect higher advertising revenue at News 12, partially offset by lower advertising revenue at Newsday. AOCF also reflects reduced expenditures of certain other businesses.
We continue to focus on transforming the Optimum experience and strengthening our position as the market's premier connectivity company by investing in our network, products and employees, while continuing to respond to the evolving marketplace with innovative products, such as Freewheel. 
Looking forward to 2015, we currently anticipate that total company AOCF and CapEx, including incremental expenditures for Freewheel, will be substantially similar to our 2014 results. However, this is a dynamic business, and we anticipate updating our guidance as the year progresses. 
Now turning to the company's financial position. The company's fourth quarter consolidated cash position was $850 million and net debt was $7.9 billion. We had a -- we had $1.43 billion undrawn and available under the $1.5 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings as of the end of 2014. 
During 2014, we executed a number of successful financing transactions, which extended our maturities, strengthened our balance sheet and improved our strong liquidity position, while funding our quarterly dividend. We plan to apply our 2015 free cash flow in a similar manner.
In May, we issued $750 million of 5.25% senior notes due 2024 at par, which was the lowest the bond issuance coupon in the company's history. The net proceeds and a portion of our cash on hand were used to repay $750 million of our Term Loan B credit facility. 
Later in the year, CSC Holdings made a $200 million voluntary repayment of its Term Loan B facility. This transaction results in cash interest savings over the remaining term of the facility, as well as improving our debt maturity profile by reducing our 2020 debt maturities. We also use of cash on hand to opportunistically repurchase approximately $37 million of Cablevision's senior notes. This was executed at an average price below par and will generate cash interest savings over the term of the notes. 
At December 31, the company's consolidated net leverage ratio was 4.5x. The CSC Holdings Restricted Group bank leverage ratio was 3.1x. 
In calculating our total company leverage ratio, AOCF is determined using latest quarter annualized AOCF. As a result, our leverage ratios are more sensitive to changes in quarterly AOCF than they would be if our leverage was measured based on trailing 12 month AOCF. 
We did not repurchase shares of Cablevision stock during 2014. We have approximately $450 million of remaining stock repurchase authorization. 
Finally, in June, Charter Communications reached a settlement with the Montana Department of Revenue related to a property tax dispute that was originally litigated during our ownership of communications. As a result, during the fourth quarter, we received substantially all of the approximately $6.6 million in cash that we expect to receive from Charter as a result of this settlement.

And while we have nothing to announce today, we're trying to do is provide guidance [indiscernible] thoughtful guidance. We were -- last year, we had a tiny bit of criticism for the fact that we were conservative in our guidance. I'm not saying that we're conservative in the guidance for 2015 but again, rather thoughtful. As we look at AOCF percentage changes, the 1 percentage point change in AOCF is roughly $18 million. That's a relatively small amount when you're talking about the numbers, the magnitude that this business generates. So from our perspective, we're optimistic about 2015, but we are going to update the guidance as we go through the year, and we're comfortable looking at AOCF and capital being substantially similar to where they came in, in 2014."

In terms of the capital side of the equation, Mike, you call out the CPU number, and we had an increase in CPE in the fourth quarter, but a lot of what happens with CBE, as you know, is timing of expenditures, and we ended up with additional purchases of boxes, of managed routers, some remotes in the fourth quarter, but it's not necessarily CPE that will keep capital expenditures sort of roughly these levels. We continue to invest in WiFi. We continue to across the board invest in our network, and we're going to continue those efforts. As you'll recall from a few years ago, there was a period where we didn't feel the plant was up to the capability it needed to be up to, that's not going as we said many times, that's not going to happen again.

So you would normally expect to more of the margin improvement under that type of scenario, but we had $10 million of severance in the quarter. Severance in the fourth quarter of 2013 was below the AOCF line item because of the fact that we had a formal restructuring. This year, it's not, so that's a $10 million delta. And advertising expense was up by $13 million year-over-year. Some of that was related to the Freewheel launch and those 2 items and some additional fees associated with the launch of Freewheel and impact on the quarter. So those were sort of the bigger items. There was some increase in compensation costs, but that's something that happens fairly frequently in the fourth quarter as we true-up the ultimate incentive programs to the actual results for the year."

I didn't see one thing, by the way, being connected by the way by a cellular device. The -- what all of this tells us that connectivity, particularly on a wireless this is going to become more and more important to our consumer. We want to be the company that provides that connectivity. We want to be the company that's seen as being the best at providing that connectivity. Now, we think that that's sort of the first part of the wave. The second part is that there are products and services that will go along with that strategic position. The first of which you've just seen, which is Freewheel. But there will be others. And we feel that we will be poised and ready to take advantage of the strategic position that we've created by investing in WiFi in order to do that. Other than that, from the company point of view, I would say that the other thing that we see, which is really very closely related is that connectivity has surpassed video as the primary product for a company like ours. And we need to continue to strategize our product offerings to reflect with different packaging, et cetera, which is something I think we will do in 2015."

One of the way -- when I first started working closely with David who runs Lightpath a couple of years ago, one of the key attributes of the business at that point in time we were spending roughly $0.35 in capital for every dollar of revenue that we were generating. And I think that we had very high AOCF margin in that business, which was a great, but when you're putting so much back into capital, the free cash flow profile of the business is not as attractive as the free cash flow profile is in cable. And one of the things that we were doing was we were lighting a lot of additional buildings and not getting the same type of sell-through or at least, sort of targeted type of sell-through for additional tenants in already wired buildings. So I think, what Dave and his team are doing now is they're selectively lighting new buildings when they have a new anchor tenant, but one of the reasons the margins has been expanding, particularly the cash flow margin in that business has been the fact that we are doing a better job of making sure that we're marketing through secondary tenants in those buildings. We don't have to light a new building in the Lightpath business in order to generate incremental revenue. The cash flow characteristics of that account becomes substantially better. I'd argue lots of growth opportunity for Lightpath people imagine some of the new managed services they're providing and lots of room in the footprint. It's still a very fragmented business of which we have a minority share and my expectations is that we're going to keep building that share."

Cablevision delivered strong financial results in 2014, while continuing to transform the Optimum experience. We developed higher-quality customer relationships by offering products and services that provide superior value, provide expanded connectivity inside and outside the home and enhancing the performance of our network. Our full year 2014 financial results reflect our progress.
Total company net revenue increased nearly 4% and AOCF increased by 9% compared with 2013. Our capital expenditures were $892 million, 6% lower than 2013. Full year 2014 free cash flow was $487 million, and we declared a $0.15 per share quarterly dividend on February 24. Our fourth quarter net customer results compared favorably with the third quarter. We added data customers, despite significant competitive discounting and economic pressures in portions of our footprint. We also significantly reduced the loss of our customer relationships, even in our most competitive areas. Our results reflect a decrease in move and nonpay-related churn versus the third quarter.
During the fourth quarter, we continue to deliver strong year-over-year growth in revenue per customer. Disciplined approaches to pricing, promotional eligibility and customer credit policies are key elements of our strategy. While these policies reduced the number of our available sales opportunities, we believe they contribute to a stronger base of customers over time. We plan to continue these policies in 2015, while differentiating the value of Optimum in the marketplace.
During 2014, we introduced several new products and enhancements. Let me mention some of them -- of the more notable initiatives: We introduced 2 new Optimum Online speed tiers. We enhanced our TV to GO video experience by integrating more than 50 networks into the Optimum app. We improved our Multi-Room DVR by increasing simultaneous recordings to 15 shows. We also signed our first advertising clients to our new data and analytics service. In addition to these product enhancements, we continued to improve our customer service activity. 2014 total customer service phone calls declined by nearly 16%.
Trouble call and truck rolls declined 21% each as compared with 2013. These achievements reflect the contributions of our nearly 15,000 employees. In 2014, we continued to invest in our people and transform our culture to one that is more performance based. We did this through new recognition training and development programs as well as a new nonexecutive performance bonus plan.
And finally, let's discuss our WiFi initiatives.
In 2014, we launched our newest WiFi smart router. We also surpassed our goal of reaching more than 1 million Optimum WiFi access points within our service area. We continue to see remarkable growth in Optimum WiFi usage. During the fourth quarter, our customers used more than 4x the amount of data than during the fourth quarter of 2013.
WiFi is a critical part of our product strategy and one of our most important strategic assets. As I have noted before, we plan to continue to innovate in this area, which brings me to Freewheel, our most recent effort to monetize our investment in WiFi. Freewheel is the first all-WiFi device from a cable provider. It is available nationwide and delivers unlimited data talk and text. It works anywhere in the world where you are connected to WiFi. Freewheel is backed by our carrier-grade Optimum WiFi network, with 1.1 million hotspots in the tri-state area. 
Today, Optimum WiFi customers pass an average of more than 6 gigabytes of data per month. That is nearly 3x more data than the most commonly purchased data plans from cellular providers. Against this backdrop, we believe Freewheel will be the beginning of a disruptive force to the cellular industry.
As a company, we are solidifying our position as our customers prefer connectivity company. Freewheel is a natural progression of this strategy. This the first in a series of new products and services, which we intend to launch in order to better serve our customers' needs. 
For 3 years, we have been improving our relationships with our customers. Today, service quality has become the key differentiator of the Optimum experience, and we remain committed to being the best service provider in the industry. In 2015, as we continue this important work, we expect to introduce additional innovative products and repack certain of our current offerings. Our goal is to meet and exceed the rapidly evolving demands of our customers.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Gregg Seibert."
25933,282790864,769869,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2015",2015-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Total company fourth quarter net revenue increased 3% and AOCF declined by 3.4% as compared with the prior year period. Capital expenditures were $262 million compared with $211 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Four",945,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Total company fourth quarter net revenue increased 3% and AOCF declined by 3.4% as compared with the prior year period. Capital expenditures were $262 million compared with $211 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Fourth quarter free cash flow was $88 million.
During the quarter, we gained nearly 4,000 net high-speed data customers. Customer relationships and voice customers both decreased by 11,000 and video customers declined by 34,000.
Fourth quarter average monthly revenue per customer increased by nearly $8 to $155.20 as compared with the prior year period. This increase is consistent with our pricing strategies and principally reflects recent rate initiatives, our disciplined approach to promotional eligibility and higher advertising revenue.
Fourth quarter total cable revenue increased by 3.1%, reflecting the increase in revenue per customer, which was partially offset by fewer customer relationships.
As compared with 2013, fourth quarter cable advertising revenue increased by 9%, driven primarily by increased political- and issue-related spending. This growth was offset in part by lower banking and leisure spending. Our audience data and addressable advertising campaigns contributed to this growth, and we are successfully attracting new national advertisers for advanced advertising and measurement capabilities.
Cable AOCF declined 4.6% in the fourth quarter as compared with the prior year period. This primarily reflects the impact of fewer customers and higher programming, employee-related and marketing costs as well as higher legal expenses and other fees. This was partially offset by revenue growth and lower costs associated with the decline in trouble call-related truck rolls and customer service calls.
Cable's fourth quarter AOCF margin was 30.3%. Full year 2014 AOCF margin was 31.7%, slightly higher than the prior year period comparable margin of 31.2%. Cable capital spending in the fourth quarter was $222 million, a $46 million increase from the same period in 2013. This increase reflects the timing of CPE purchases and higher spending on WiFi and support capital.
Total cable capital spending for 2014 was approximately 8% lower than the comparable 2013 level. AOCF and capital expenditures for the fourth quarter reflect modest prelaunch investments in Freewheel.
Lightpath's fourth quarter revenue increased 6.2% and AOCF increased 10% over the prior year period. These increases reflect revenue growth in Ethernet-based services, partially offset by the continuing decline in legacy TDM-based services.
During 2014, Lightpath's network expanded to approximately 7,400 buildings, an increase of 600 connections. Lightpath also added 100 Gigabit Optical Transport Services and managed video conferencing to its suite of products. Lightpath's expanding product portfolio and nearly ubiquitous footprint continue to present us with a great opportunity to grow into the mid- and large-enterprise base. 
In our other segment, fourth quarter revenue was essentially flat and the AOCF deficit improved by 4.5%. These results principally reflect higher advertising revenue at News 12, partially offset by lower advertising revenue at Newsday. AOCF also reflects reduced expenditures of certain other businesses.
We continue to focus on transforming the Optimum experience and strengthening our position as the market's premier connectivity company by investing in our network, products and employees, while continuing to respond to the evolving marketplace with innovative products, such as Freewheel.
Looking forward to 2015, we currently anticipate that total company AOCF and CapEx, including incremental expenditures for Freewheel, will be substantially similar to our 2014 results. However, this is a dynamic business, and we anticipate updating our guidance as the year progresses.
Now turning to the company's financial position. The company's fourth quarter consolidated cash position was $850 million and net debt was $7.9 billion. We had a -- we had $1.43 billion undrawn and available under the $1.5 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings as of the end of 2014.
During 2014, we executed a number of successful financing transactions, which extended our maturities, strengthened our balance sheet and improved our strong liquidity position, while funding our quarterly dividend. We plan to apply our 2015 free cash flow in a similar manner.
In May, we issued $750 million of 5.25% senior notes due 2024 at par, which was the lowest bond issuance coupon in the company's history. The net proceeds and a portion of our cash on hand were used to repay $750 million of our Term Loan B credit facility.
Later in the year, CSC Holdings made a $200 million voluntary repayment of its Term Loan B facility. This transaction results in cash interest savings over the remaining term of the facility as well as improving our debt maturity profile by reducing our 2020 debt maturities. We also use cash on hand to opportunistically repurchase approximately $37 million of Cablevision's senior notes. This was executed at an average price below par and will generate cash interest savings over the term of the notes.
At December 31, the company's consolidated net leverage ratio was 4.5x. The CSC Holdings Restricted Group bank leverage ratio was 3.1x.
In calculating our total company leverage ratio, AOCF is determined using latest quarter annualized AOCF. As a result, our leverage ratios are more sensitive to changes in quarterly AOCF than they would be if our leverage was measured based on trailing 12-month AOCF.
We did not repurchase shares of Cablevision stock during 2014. We have approximately $450 million of remaining stock repurchase authorization.
Finally, in June, Charter Communications reached a settlement with the Montana Department of Revenue related to a property tax dispute that was originally litigated during our ownership of Bresnan Communications. As a result, during the fourth quarter, we received substantially all of the approximately $6.6 million in cash that we expect to receive from Charter as a result of this settlement.

We were -- last year, we had a tiny bit of criticism for the fact that we were conservative in our guidance. I'm not saying that we're conservative in the guidance for 2015 but, again, rather thoughtful. As we look at AOCF percentage changes, a 1 percentage point change in AOCF is roughly $18 million. That's a relatively small amount when you're talking about that number, so the magnitude that this business generates. So from our perspective, we're optimistic about 2015. But we are going to update the guidance as we go through the year, and we're comfortable looking at AOCF and capital being substantially similar to where they came in, in 2014."

In terms of the capital side of the equation, Mike, you call out the CPE number, and we had an increase in CPE in the fourth quarter. But a lot of what happens with CPE, as you know, is timing of expenditures. We ended up with additional purchases of boxes, of managed routers, some remotes in the fourth quarter, but it's not necessarily CPE that will keep capital expenditures sort of roughly at these levels. We continue to invest in WiFi. We continue across the board to invest in our network, and we're going to continue those efforts. As you'll recall from a few years ago, there was a period where we didn't feel the plant was up to the capability it needed to be up to. So that's not going to -- as we've said many times, that's not going to happen again.

Because, for example, our cable recurring revenue was up $40 million in the quarter. Our programming costs were up $25 million. So you would normally expect more of a margin improvement under that type of scenario, but we had $10 million of severance in the quarter. Severance in the fourth quarter of 2013 was below the AOCF line item because of the fact that we had a formal restructuring. This year, it's not. So that's a $10 million delta. And advertising expense was up by $13 million year-over-year. Some of that was related to the Freewheel launch.

And the -- I mean, WiFi is connectivity and connectivity on a wireless basis. And what we're seeing in the marketplace and what we believe is the, for a lack of a better term, the wave of the future is more and more and more reliance on WiFi by our customers because their use of data is going up. But also, for instance, if you went to the Consumer Electronics Show this year, they -- I don't think there was hardly anything on the floor that wasn't connected using a WiFi device. I didn't see one thing, by the way, being connected using a cellular device. The -- what all of this tells us is that connectivity, particularly on a wireless basis, is going to become more and more important to our consumers. We want to be the company that provides that connectivity. We want to be the company that's seen as being the best at providing that connectivity. Now we think that, that's sort of the first part of the wave. The second part is that there are products and services that will go along with that strategic position. The first of which you've just seen, which is Freewheel. But there will be others. And we feel that we will be poised and ready to take advantage of the strategic position that we've created by investing in WiFi in order to do that. So other than that, from the company point of view, I would say that the other thing that we see, which is really very closely related, is that connectivity has surpassed video as the primary product for a company like ours. And the -- and we need to continue to strategize our product offerings to reflect that with different packaging, et cetera, which is something, I think, we will do in 2015."

One of the -- when I first started working closely with Dave Pistacchio who runs Lightpath a couple of years ago, one of the key attributes of the business at that point in time was that we were spending roughly $0.35 in capital for every $1 of revenue that we were generating. And I think that we had a very high AOCF margin in that business, which was great. But when you're putting so much back into capital, the free cash flow profile of the business is not as attractive as the free cash flow profile is in cable. And one of the things that we were doing was we were lighting a lot of additional buildings and not getting the same type of sell-through or at least a sort of targeted type of sell-through for additional tenants in already wired buildings. So I think what Dave and his team are doing now is they're selectively lighting new buildings when they have a new anchor tenant. But one of the reasons the margins have been expanding, particularly the cash flow margin, in that business has been the fact that we're doing a better job of making sure that we're marketing through secondary tenants in those buildings. We don't have to light a new building in the Lightpath business in order to generate incremental revenue. The cash flow characteristics of that account becomes substantially better. I'd argue lots of growth opportunity for Lightpath. We mention some of the new managed services they are providing, and lots of room in the footprint. It's still a very fragmented business of which we have a minority share, and my expectations is that we're going to keep building that share."

But we're very upfront with that with the product, and I think pretty much everybody knows that about WiFi. And our anticipation is that the technology will continue to develop. And I think that at some point, even that will be included in the product set. But I think the bigger indication, the one cellular companies have to truly worry about is the one I talked about before: nobody's building connectivity using cellular. Nobody. Everybody is using WiFi. Now -- and the -- so why is that? The -- I think the answer to that is obvious, right? WiFi is a much more efficient, effective method of delivering data between a device, a network and a server. And the -- and so we can listen to the people who already invested their $40 billion and defend why they invested their $40 billion. But technology is technology, science is science, and this is what it is. And I think that, in my opinion, the die is cast here. So..."

Cablevision delivered strong financial results in 2014, while continuing to transform the Optimum experience. We developed higher-quality customer relationships by offering products and services that provide superior value, provide expanded connectivity inside and outside the home and enhancing the performance of our network. Our full year 2014 financial results reflect our progress.
Total company net revenue increased nearly 4% and AOCF increased by 9% compared with 2013. Our capital expenditures were $892 million, 6% lower than 2013. Full year 2014 free cash flow was $487 million, and we declared a $0.15 per share quarterly dividend on February 24. Our fourth quarter net customer results compared favorably with the third quarter. We added data customers despite significant competitive discounting and economic pressures in portions of our footprint. We also significantly reduced the loss of our customer relationships, even in our most competitive areas. Our results reflect a decrease in move and non-pay-related churn versus the third quarter.
During the fourth quarter, we continued to deliver strong year-over-year growth in revenue per customer. Disciplined approaches to pricing, promotional eligibility and customer credit policies are key elements of our strategy. While these policies reduced the number of our available sales opportunities, we believe they contribute to a stronger base of customers over time. We plan to continue these policies in 2015 while differentiating the value of Optimum in the marketplace.
During 2014, we introduced several new products and enhancements. Let me mention some of them -- of the more notable initiatives: We introduced 2 new Optimum Online speed tiers. We enhanced our TV to GO video experience by integrating more than 50 networks into the Optimum app. We improved our Multi-Room DVR by increasing simultaneous recordings to 15 shows. We also signed our first advertising clients to our new data and analytics service. In addition to these product enhancements, we continued to improve our customer service activity. 2014 total customer service phone calls declined by nearly 16%.
Trouble call truck rolls declined 21% each as compared with 2013. These achievements reflect the contributions of our nearly 15,000 employees. In 2014, we continued to invest in our people and transform our culture to one that is more performance-based. We did this through new recognition training and development programs as well as a new nonexecutive performance bonus plan.
And finally, let's discuss our WiFi initiatives.
In 2014, we launched our newest WiFi Smart Router. We also surpassed our goal of reaching more than 1 million Optimum WiFi access points within our service area. We continue to see remarkable growth in Optimum WiFi usage. During the fourth quarter, our customers used more than 4x the amount of data than during the fourth quarter of 2013.
WiFi is a critical part of our product strategy and one of our most important strategic assets. As I have noted before, we plan to continue to innovate in this area, which brings me to Freewheel, our most recent effort to monetize our investment in WiFi. Freewheel is the first all-WiFi device from a cable provider. It is available nationwide and delivers unlimited data, talk and text. It works anywhere in the world where you are connected to WiFi. Freewheel is backed by our carrier-grade Optimum WiFi network, with 1.1 million hotspots in the tri-state area. 
Today, Optimum WiFi customers pass an average of more than 6 gigabytes of data per month. That is nearly 3x more data than the most commonly purchased data plans from cellular providers. Against this backdrop, we believe Freewheel will be the beginning of a disruptive force to the cellular industry.
As a company, we are solidifying our position as our customers' preferred connectivity company. Freewheel is a natural progression of this strategy. This is the first in a series of new products and services which we intend to launch in order to better serve our customers' needs. 
For 3 years, we have been improving our relationships with our customers. Today, service quality has become a key differentiator of the Optimum experience, and we remain committed to being the best service provider in the industry. In 2015, as we continue this important work, we expect to introduce additional innovative products and repack a certain of our current offerings. Our goal is to meet and exceed the rapidly evolving demands of our customers.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Gregg Seibert."
25933,282790864,770000,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2015",2015-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Total company fourth quarter net revenue increased 3% and AOCF declined by 3.4% as compared with the prior year period. Capital expenditures were $262 million, compared with $211 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Fou",946,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Total company fourth quarter net revenue increased 3% and AOCF declined by 3.4% as compared with the prior year period. Capital expenditures were $262 million, compared with $211 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Fourth quarter free cash flow was $88 million.
During the quarter, we gained nearly 4,000 net high-speed data customers. Customer relationships and voice customers both decreased by 11,000 and video customers declined by 34,000.
Fourth quarter average monthly revenue per customer increased by nearly $8 to $155.20 as compared with the prior year period. This increase is consistent with our pricing strategies and principally reflects recent rate initiatives, our disciplined approach to promotional eligibility and higher advertising revenue.
Fourth quarter total cable revenue increased by 3.1%, reflecting the increase in revenue per customer, which was partially offset by fewer customer relationships.
As compared with 2013, fourth quarter cable advertising revenue increased by 9%, driven primarily by increased political- and issue-related spending. This growth was offset in part by lower banking and leisure spending. Our audience data and addressable advertising campaigns contributed to this growth, and we are successfully attracting new national advertisers for our advanced advertising and measurement capabilities.
Cable AOCF declined 4.6% in the fourth quarter as compared with the prior year period. This primarily reflects the impact of fewer customers and higher programming, employee-related and marketing costs, as well as higher legal expenses and other fees. This was partially offset by revenue growth and lower costs associated with the decline in trouble call-related truck rolls and customer service calls.
Cable's fourth quarter AOCF margin was 30.3%. Full year 2014 AOCF margin was 31.7%, slightly higher than the prior year period comparable margin of 31.2%. Cable capital spending in the fourth quarter was $222 million, a $46 million increase from the same period in 2013. This increase reflects the timing of CPE purchases and higher spending on WiFi and support capital.
Total cable capital spending for 2014 was approximately 8% lower than the comparable 2013 level. AOCF and capital expenditures for the fourth quarter reflect modest prelaunch investments in Freewheel.
Lightpath's fourth quarter revenue increased 6.2% and AOCF increased 10% over the prior year period. These increases reflect revenue growth in Ethernet-based services, partially offset by the continuing decline in legacy TDM-based services.
During 2014, Lightpath's network expanded to approximately 7,400 buildings, an increase of 600 connections. Lightpath also added 100 Gigabit Optical Transport Services and managed video conferencing to its suite of products. Lightpath's expanding product portfolio and nearly ubiquitous footprint continue to present us with a great opportunity to grow into the mid- and large-enterprise space. 
In our other segment, fourth quarter revenue was essentially flat and the AOCF deficit improved by 4.5%. These results principally reflect higher advertising revenue at News 12, partially offset by lower advertising revenue at Newsday. AOCF also reflects reduced expenditures at certain other businesses.
We continue to focus on transforming the Optimum experience and strengthening our position as the market's premier connectivity company by investing in our network, products and employees, while continuing to respond to the evolving marketplace with innovative products such as Freewheel.
Looking forward to 2015, we currently anticipate that total company AOCF and CapEx, including incremental expenditures for Freewheel, will be substantially similar to our 2014 results. However, this is a dynamic business, and we anticipate updating our guidance as the year progresses.
Now turning to the company's financial position. The company's fourth quarter consolidated cash position was $850 million and net debt was $7.9 billion. We had a -- we had $1.43 billion undrawn and available under the $1.5 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings as of the end of 2014.
During 2014, we executed a number of successful financing transactions, which extended our maturities, strengthened our balance sheet and improved our strong liquidity position, while funding our quarterly dividend. We plan to apply our 2015 free cash flow in a similar manner.
In May, we issued $750 million of 5.25% senior notes due 2024 at par, which was the lowest bond issuance coupon in the company's history. The net proceeds and a portion of our cash on hand were used to repay $750 million of our Term Loan B credit facility.
Later in the year, CSC Holdings made a $200 million voluntary repayment of its Term Loan B facility. This transaction results in cash interest savings over the remaining term of the facility, as well as improving our debt maturity profile by reducing our 2020 debt maturities. We also used cash on hand to opportunistically repurchase approximately $37 million of Cablevision senior notes. This was executed at an average price below par and will generate cash interest savings over the term of the notes.
At December 31, the company's consolidated net leverage ratio was 4.5x. The CSC Holdings Restricted Group bank leverage ratio was 3.1x.
In calculating our total company leverage ratio, AOCF is determined using latest quarter annualized AOCF. As a result, our leverage ratios are more sensitive to changes in quarterly AOCF than they would be if our leverage was measured based on trailing 12-month AOCF.
We did not repurchase shares of Cablevision stock during 2014. We have approximately $450 million of remaining stock repurchase authorization.
Finally, in June, Charter Communications reached a settlement with the Montana Department of Revenue related to a property tax dispute that was originally litigated during our ownership of Bresnan Communications.

And while we have nothing to announce today, what we're trying to do is provide guidance that, that I would call very thoughtful guidance. We were -- last year, we had a tiny bit of criticism for the fact that we were conservative in our guidance. I'm not saying that we're conservative in the guidance for 2015, but again, rather thoughtful. As we look at AOCF percentage changes, a 1 percentage point change in AOCF is roughly $18 million. That's a relatively small amount when you're talking about numbers in the magnitude that this business generates. So from our perspective, we're optimistic about 2015. But we are going to update the guidance as we go through the year, and we're comfortable looking at AOCF and capital being substantially similar to where they came in, in 2014."

So you would normally expect more of a margin improvement under that type of scenario, but we had $10 million of severance in the quarter. Severance in the fourth quarter of 2013 was a below-the-AOCF line item because of the fact that we had a formal restructuring. This year, it's not. So that's a $10 million delta. And advertising expense was up by $13 million year-over-year. Some of that was related to the Freewheel launch. And those 2 items and some additional fees associated with the launch of Freewheel had an impact on the quarter. So those were sort of the bigger items.

And what we're seeing in the marketplace and what we believe is the, for lack of a better term, the wave of the future, is more and more and more reliance on WiFi by our customers because their use of data is going up. But also, for instance, if you went to the Consumer Electronics Show this year, the -- I don't think there was hardly anything on the floor that wasn't connected using a WiFi device. I didn't see one thing, by the way, being connected using a cellular device. The -- what all of this tells us is that connectivity, particularly on a wireless basis, is going to become more and more important to our consumers. We want to be the company that provides that connectivity. We want to be the company that's seen as being the best at providing that connectivity. Now we think that, that's sort of the first part of the wave. The second part is, is that there are products and services that will go along with that strategic position, the first of which you've just seen, which is Freewheel. But there will be others. And we feel that we will be poised and ready to take advantage of the strategic position that we've created by investing in WiFi in order to do that. So other than that, from the company point of view, I would say that the other thing that we see, which is really very closely related, is that connectivity has surpassed video as the primary product for a company like ours. And the -- and we need to continue to strategize our product offerings to reflect that, with different packaging, et cetera, which is something I think we will do in 2015."

One of the -- when I first started working closely with Dave Pistacchio, who runs Lightpath, a couple of years ago, one of the key attributes of the business at that point in time was that we were spending roughly $0.35 in capital for every $1 of revenue that we were generating. And I think that we had a very high AOCF margin in that business, which was great. But when you're putting so much back into capital, the free cash flow profile of the business is not as attractive as the free cash flow profile is in cable. And one of the things that we were doing was we were lighting a lot of additional buildings and not getting the same type of sell-through, or at least the sort of targeted type of sell-through, for additional tenants in already wired buildings. So I think what Dave and his team are doing now is they're selectively lighting new buildings when they have a new anchor tenant. But one of the reasons the margins have been expanding, particularly the cash flow margin, in that business has been the fact that we're doing a better job of making sure that we're marketing through secondary tenants in those buildings. When you don't have to light a new building in the Lightpath business in order to generate incremental revenue, the cash flow characteristics of that account becomes substantially better. I'd argue lots of growth opportunity for Lightpath. We mentioned some of the new managed services they are providing, and lots of room in the footprint. It's still a very fragmented business of which we have a minority share, and my expectation is that we're going to keep building that share."

And I think if you take a look at our performance over the last 18 months, we've done exactly that. Now the -- now as we transition from being what is a traditional cable company to a connectivity company, we anticipate that our ability to reduce expenses will continue to increase, except in the area of programming. The area of programming, there's very little that a cable company can do to reduce its exposure in terms of increasing programming costs, and there's no real way to continue to pass that on to the customer in a competitive environment. Now the -- so I expect on the video side, we will expect to see reducing margins, primarily due to programming expense, that the -- on the other side, I expect that we will see increasing margins from the data side. The good news is with that is that the consumer values the connectivity product more than they do the video product at this point. And so that's roughly how we look at them.

Our capital expenditures were $167 million, free cash flow was $4",375,"Thank you, Cindi, and good morning. Cablevision is off to a solid start in 2015. Consolidated revenue grew more than 2% and AOCF increased nearly 5% compared with the first quarter of 2014. Our capital expenditures were $167 million, free cash flow was $49 million and we declared a $0.15 per share dividend on May 1.
Turning to our strategic. We remain focused on advancing our position as New York's premier connectivity company. Today's digital consumer expects to be connected all the time on all devices wherever they are. And cablevision's path for continued success is to stay ahead of these changes and we are determined to do just that. 
To achieve this on the product side, we have been advancing connectivity to a broader set of consumers and providing innovative products and service options. We are taking bold steps to connect the customers in new ways. For example, in February, we launched Freewheel, this is our new WiFi-only phone service with unlimited data talk and text, free from the high cost and data limits imposed by cellular providers. Freewheel leverages the power of our robust WiFi network. It also helps monetize our investment in WiFi. 
In March, we announced agreement to make HBO Now available through the Internet to our high-speed data customers. Cablevision is currently the only cable provider to offer the full suite of HBO products. Just last week, we were the first cable or satellite operator to announce plans to distribute Hulu to our customers. We also recently launched Core Carter packages that target a new generation of consumers. These offers provide alternatives for those who prefer to access video content through the Internet. Packages are available at different price ranges and all include a digital antenna at no charge for over-the-air TV. This allows customers to bypass the big bundle and still watch broadcast television as well as over-the-top content. 
In summary, the company is changing and these new initiatives are few examples of our evolution. Going forward, you will see more products and services that focus on flexibility as we reimagine Cablevision and its place in the market. 
With that, let me now turn the call over to Kristin Dolan, for an personal product -- operational and products review."

First quarter net customer results generally compared favorably with the third and fourth quarters of 2014. We added data customers, despite significant competitive discounting and economic pressures in portions of our footprint. Our disciplined approach to pricing, promotional eligibility and customer credit policies has not wavered. We're targeting a stronger base of customers, while differentiating the value of Optimum in the marketplace. To this end, during the first quarter, we continue to deliver strong year-over-year growth and revenue per customer.
In addition to the new product offerings that Jim mentioned, let me share some other highlights. We signed several new clients for our data and analytics service. We're also working with other to provide combined insights from set-top boxes tuning data. We expanded the availability of our 51 data [ph] services known as Internet basics. This service, which we initially introduced in Newark is now available across our entire footprint.
On the office and the data spectrum, Optimum was the first cable company to introduce 1 gigabyte residential service in the tri-state area. The service launched in a new multi-tenant building in Hawken, New Jersey [ph]. This offering showcases the strength and versatility of the Optimum network. We also continue to identify ways to expand the breadth of our WiFi coverage as well as optimize speed and performance. 
As we look ahead, our 2015 WiFi growth plan includes deploying access points in high data usage areas. Additionally, ongoing investments in our WiFi network will continue to enhance the value of our Freewheel service.
We continue to be service and reliability key differentiators of the Optimum experience. First quarter total customer service phone calls declined by 12% and trouble call truck rolls decreased 21%, each as compared with the prior year period. We're pleased with our progress in the first quarter and we'll remain highly focused on delivering superior service and enhancing our customer relationship. 
With that, let me turn to Brian Sweeney, to review our financial results."

Customer relationships, video and voice customers declined by 6,000, 28,",553,"Thank you, Kristin. Jim provided an overview of total company results, so now let's review our business segments. 
During the quarter, we gained 7,000 net high-speed data customers. Customer relationships, video and voice customers declined by 6,000, 28,000 and 14,000, respectively. First quarter average monthly revenue per customer increased by more than $7 to $155.34, as compared with the prior year period. This increase is consistent with our pricing strategies and principally reflects recent rate initiatives and our disciplined approach to promotional eligibility and retention policies. 
First quarter total cable revenue increased by 2.4%, reflecting the increase in revenue per customer, which was partially offset by fewer customers. As compared with 2014, first quarter cable advertising revenue decreased by 3%, primarily due to lower gaming and spending. These declines were offset in part by higher auto and consumer spending, which benefited from addressable advertising campaign.
Cable AOCF increased 0.8% in the first quarter, as compared with the prior year period. This primarily reflects the impact of revenue growth and lower employee and customer service-related costs. This was partially offset by fewer customers and higher programming, product development and marketing costs.
Cable capital spending in the first quarter was $134 million, a $12 million decrease from the same period in 2014. This primarily reflects lower CPE spending due to the timing of set-top box and modem purchases, partially offset by continued deployment of our smart routers and further investment in our network to support our new data offering and WiFi expansion. 
Lightpath's first quarter revenue increased 5% and AOCF grew nearly 13%, as compared with the prior year period. These increases reflect revenue growth in the Internet-based services, partially offset by continuing decline in legacy TDM-based services.
Lightpath has been expanding beyond its traditional bowl voice data and Internet service offerings also provide managed services with a lineup that is grown to include audio and web conferencing, backup, hosted voice and other services. Additionally, Lightpath has increased its focused on medium-size businesses. Lightpath's growing product portfolio and increasing presence in these markets provides us with an attractive opportunity to grow in the mid to large enterprise space.
In our other segment, first quarter revenue was essentially flat and the AOCF deficit improved by nearly 24%. These results principally reflect higher advertising revenue at News 12, partially offset by lower advertising revenue at Newsday. AOCF also reflects a reduction in expenses at Newsday due to lower operating costs and the termination of a distribution agreement, along with reduced expenses at corporate and certain other businesses. News 12's award-winning hyper-local programming and Newsday's strong editorial presence continue to resonate with our customers and provide a valuable retention tool for the company.
Before I turn it over to Gregg, I would note that our first quarter results were favorably impacted by the timing of several expense items, including marketing and employee-related costs as well as the timing of capital spending. We continue to anticipate that 2015 total company AOCF and CapEx, including incremental expenditures for Freewheel and our other product initiatives will be substantially similar to our 2014 results. However, as we've said before, this is a dynamic business and we anticipate updating our guidance as the year progresses. 
I'll now hand the call over to Gregg Seibert to discuss our capital position and capital allocation strategy."

The company's first quarter consolidated cash position was $884 million and net debt was $7.8 billion. We have $1.43 billion undrawn and available under the $1.5 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings at the end of the first quarter. 
At March 31, the company's consolidated net leverage ratio was 4.3x. The CSC Holdings Restricted group bank leverage ratio was 2.9x. We did not repurchase shares of Cablevision stock during 2015. We have approximately $450 million of remaining stock repurchase authorization.
Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to touch on the topic of capital allocation as we're frequently how we approach this. We plan to apply our 2015 free cash flow in a similar manner to 2014. Our current priority is to continue to invest in the business. We'll strive to provide the best possible for service to our customers and we are focused on investing in our network, including WiFi. We'll continue to invest in opportunities that will help us realize our ambition of being the premier connectivity company in our market. 
The second priority is to ensure that our balance sheet continues to afford us the ability to dynamically manage the business and apply our excess capital. I think it's likely that you'll see a portion of our excess cash applied to our effort to continue to delever.
Consistent with this approach, in April, we made a voluntary repayment of our CSC Holdings Term Loan B facility in the amount of $200 million. This repayment will result in cash interest savings over the term of the facility. Number three in our hierarchy is our dividend, which is our primary method of returning capital to shareholders.
Finally, as always, we will remain highly disciplined as we evaluate any other potential acquisitions and in customer opportunities. 
Operator, with that, we'd now like to open the call for questions."

We had a number of rate increases on January 1 of this year related to cable box, an increase in our sports and TVs surcharge, as well as the pass-through of these to certain of our customers. In addition, RPC benefited from rate increases that were implemented in the second quarter of 2014 and the implementation of pass-through on voice taxes last summer, so the combination of all that led to the increase."

Our users are making and receiving more than 20 calls a week and sending and receiving more than 70 text messages. And users per subscriber continues to grow. So we're very again, continue to be really bullish about WiFi and about Freewheel. On the broadband revenue question, Freewheel, as we've said all along, is really designed to improve customers understanding and their value perception associated with our WiFi network. So Freewheel is really an extension of that. I'm not sure that there's a direct correlation between broadband revenues other than improve retention on broadband through the use of Freewheel."

And our philosophy with this is essentially that we think that video is akin to the eggs and the milk in a convenience store. You have to have it, but you don't make a lot of money on it.

Cablevision is off to a solid start in 2015. Consolidated revenue grew more than 2% and AOCF increased nearly 5% compared with the first quarter of 2014. Our capital expenditures were $167 million. Free cash flow was $49 million. And we declared a $0.15 per share dividend on May 1.
Turning to our strategy. We remain focused on advancing our position as New York's premier connectivity company. Today's digital consumer expects to be connected all the time on all devices wherever they are. And Cablevision's path for continued success is to stay ahead of these changes, and we are determined to do just that.
To achieve this on the product sides, we have been advancing connectivity to a broader set of consumers and providing innovative products and service options. We are taking bold steps to connect the customers in new ways. For example, in February, we launched Freewheel. This is our new WiFi-only phone service with unlimited data and talk and text, free from the high costs and data limits imposed by cellular providers. Freewheel leverages the power of our robust WiFi network. It also helps monetize our investment in WiFi.
In March, we announced an agreement to make HBO Now available through the Internet to our high-speed data customers. Cablevision is currently the only cable provider to offer the full suite of HBO products. Just last week, we were the first cable or satellite operator to announce plans to distribute Hulu to our customers. We also recently launched cord-cutter packages that target a new generation of consumers. These offers provide alternatives for those who prefer to access video content through the Internet. Packages are available at different price ranges and all include a digital antenna at no charge for over-the-air TV. This allows customers to bypass the big bundle and still watch broadcast television as well as over-the-top content.
In summary, the company is changing, and these new initiatives are a few examples of our evolution. Going forward, you will see more products and services that focus on flexibility as we reimagine Cablevision and its place in the market.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Kristin Dolan for an operational product -- operational and products overview."

First quarter net customer results generally compared favorably with the third and fourth quarters of 2014. We added data customers despite significant competitive discounting and economic pressures in portions of our footprint. Our disciplined approach to pricing, promotional eligibility and customer credit policies has not wavered. We're targeting a stronger base of customers while differentiating the value of Optimum in the marketplace. To this end, during the first quarter, we continued to deliver strong year-over-year growth in revenue per customer.
In addition to the new product offerings that Jim mentioned, let me share some other highlights.
We signed several new clients for our data and analytics service. We're also working with other MSOs to provide combined insights from set-top-box tuning data. We expanded the availability of our 5/1 data service known as Internet Basics. This service, which we initially introduced in Bronx and Newark, is now available across our entire footprint.
On the office end of the data spectrum, Optimum was the first cable company to introduce 1-gigabyte residential service in the tri-state area. The service launched in a new multi-tenant building in Weehawken, New Jersey. This offering showcases the strength and versatility of the Optimum network. We also continued to identify ways to expand the breadth of our WiFi coverage as well as optimize speed and performance.
As we look ahead, our 2015 WiFi growth plan includes deploying access points in high-data-usage areas. Additionally, ongoing investments in our WiFi network will continue to enhance the value of our Freewheel service.
We continue to make service and reliability key differentiators of the Optimum experience. First quarter total customer service phone calls declined by 12% and troubled call truck rolls decreased 21%, each as compared with the prior year period. We're pleased with our progress in the first quarter, and we'll remain highly focused on delivering superior service and enhancing our customer relationships.
With that, let me turn to Brian Sweeney to review our financial results."
25933,291311242,802639,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 04, 2015",2015-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kristin.Jim provided an overview of total company results, so now let's review our business segments.During the quarter, we gained 7,000 net high-speed data customers.

Jim provided an overview of total company results, so now let's review our business segments.
During the quarter, we gained 7,000 net high-speed data customers. Customer relationships, video and voice customers declined by 6,000, 28,000 and 14,000, respectively. First quarter average monthly revenue per customer increased by more than $7 to $155.34, as compared with the prior year period. This increase is consistent with our pricing strategies and principally reflects recent rate initiatives and our disciplined approach to promotional eligibility and retention policies.
First quarter total cable revenue increased by 2.4%, reflecting the increase in revenue per customer, which was partially offset by fewer customers. As compared with 2014, first quarter cable advertising revenue decreased by 3%, primarily due to lower gaming and banking spending. These declines were offset in part by higher auto and consumer spending, which benefited from addressable advertising campaigns.
Cable AOCF increased 0.8% in the first quarter, as compared with the prior year period. This primarily reflects the impact of revenue growth and lower employee and customer service-related costs. This was partially offset by fewer customers and higher programming, product development and marketing costs.
Cable capital spending in the first quarter was $134 million, a $12 million decrease from the same period in 2014. This primarily reflects lower CPE spending due to the timing of set-top box and modem purchases, partially offset by continued deployment of our smart routers and further investment in our network to support our new data offering and WiFi expansion.
Lightpath's first quarter revenue increased 5%, and AOCF grew nearly 13%, as compared with the prior year period. These increases reflect revenue growth in Ethernet-based services, partially offset by a continuing decline in legacy TDM-based services.
Lightpath has been expanding beyond its traditional voice data and Internet service offerings to also provide managed services with a lineup that has grown to include audio and Web conferencing, backup, hosted voice and other services. Additionally, Lightpath has increased its focused on medium-size businesses. Lightpath's growing product portfolio and increasing presence in these markets provides us with an attractive opportunity to grow in the mid- to large enterprise space.
In our other segment, first quarter revenue was essentially flat, and the AOCF deficit improved by nearly 24%. These results principally reflect higher advertising revenue at News 12, partially offset by lower advertising revenue at Newsday. AOCF also reflects a reduction in expenses at Newsday due to lower operating costs and the termination of a distribution agreement, along with reduced expenses at corporate and certain other businesses. News 12's award-winning hyper-local programming and Newsday's strong editorial presence continue to resonate with our customers and provide a valuable retention tool for the company.
Before I turn it over to Gregg, I would note that our first quarter results were favorably impacted by the timing of several expense items, including marketing and employee-related costs, as well as the timing of capital spending. We continue to anticipate that 2015 total company AOCF and CapEx, including incremental expenditures for Freewheel and our other new product initiatives, will be substantially similar to our 2014 results. However, we -- as we've said before, this is a dynamic business and we anticipate updating our guidance as the year progresses.
I'll now hand the call over to Gregg Seibert to discuss our capital position and capital allocation strategy."

The company's first quarter consolidated cash position was $884 million, and net debt was $7.8 billion. We had $1.43 billion undrawn and available under the $1.5 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings at the end of the first quarter.
At March 31, the company's consolidated net leverage ratio was 4.3x. The CSC Holdings restricted group bank leverage ratio was 2.9x. We did not repurchase shares of Cablevision stock during 2015. We have approximately $450 million of remaining stock repurchase authorization.
Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to touch on the topic of capital allocation, as we are frequently asked how we approach this.
We plan to apply our 2015 free cash flow in a similar manner to 2014. Our current priority is to continue to invest in the business. We will strive to provide the best possible service to our customers, and we are focused on investing in our network, including WiFi. We'll continue to invest in opportunities that will help us realize our ambition of being the premier connectivity company in our market.
The second priority is to ensure that our balance sheet continues to afford us the ability to dynamically manage the business and apply our excess capital. I think it's likely that you'll see a portion of our excess cash applied to our effort to continue to delever. Consistent with this approach, in April, we made a voluntary prepayment of our CSC Holdings term loan B facility in the amount of $200 million. This repayment will result in cash interest savings over the term of the facility.
Number three in our hierarchy is our dividend, which is our primary method of returning capital to shareholders. Finally, as always, we will remain highly disciplined as we evaluate any other potential acquisitions and investment opportunities.
Operator, with that, we'd now like to open the call for questions."

The ability to develop on more open platforms; the work that Dibble and Wilt are doing on customer capabilities within the homes so that we can troubleshoot from over the phone, as opposed to rolling a truck through the smart routers and the genius routers; and then a broadband product just is much less complex, so the opportunity to reduce not only trouble calls but also phone calls into the call center make that, the broadband products, more attractive on an overall basis for us, although like Jim says, we'll be selling video our lifetimes and beyond."

And we get really positive feedback on people taking the phone outside of the U.S., the Caribbean places, like that, so there may be opportunity there. On the overall WiFi investment, I think Jim or Brian can speak to this too, but WiFi is just it is the technology for the future. WiFi was built for data. Data consumption increases massively. So we're now seeing, average megabits per session on the plan in the first quarter were almost 24. We're seeing 6 megabits of data being consumed per month for our broadband customers over WiFi. So it's the way of the future. You see cars with WiFi, everywhere you go, airplanes with WiFi. As Jim said, when you went to CES, you didn't see anybody talking about cellular. All the new products, it just assumes a prevalence of WiFi across -- really across the country. And so we're enthusiastic that our cable brethren are continuing to support WiFi.

Cablevision is off to a solid start in 2015. Consolidated revenue grew more than 2% and AOCF increased nearly 5% compared with the first quarter of 2014. Our capital expenditures were $167 million. Free cash flow was $49 million. And we declared a $0.15 per share dividend on May 1.
Turning to our strategy. We remain focused on advancing our position as New York's premier connectivity company. Today's digital consumer expects to be connected all the time on all devices wherever they are. And Cablevision's path for continued success is to stay ahead of these changes, and we are determined to do just that.
To achieve this on the product side, we have been advancing connectivity to a broader set of consumers and providing innovative products and service options. We are taking bold steps to connect the customers in new ways. For example, in February, we launched Freewheel. This is our new WiFi-only phone service with unlimited data, talk and text, free from the high costs and data limits imposed by cellular providers. Freewheel leverages the power of our robust WiFi network. It also helps monetize our investment in WiFi.
In March, we announced an agreement to make HBO Now available through the Internet to our high-speed data customers. Cablevision is currently the only cable provider to offer the full suite of HBO products. Just last week, we were the first cable or satellite operator to announce plans to distribute Hulu to our customers. We also recently launched cord-cutter packages that target a new generation of consumers. These offers provide alternatives for those who prefer to access video content through the Internet. Packages are available at different price ranges and all include a digital antenna at no charge for over-the-air TV. This allows customers to bypass the big bundle and still watch broadcast television as well as over-the-top content.
In summary, the company is changing, and these new initiatives are a few examples of our evolution. Going forward, you will see more products and services that focus on flexibility as we reimagine Cablevision and its place in the market.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Kristin Dolan for an operational product -- operational and product overview."

First quarter net customer results generally compared favorably with the third and fourth quarters of 2014. We added data customers despite significant competitive discounting and economic pressures in portions of our footprint. Our disciplined approach to pricing, promotional eligibility and customer credit policies has not wavered. We're targeting a stronger base of customers while differentiating the value of Optimum in the marketplace. To this end, during the first quarter, we continued to deliver strong year-over-year growth in revenue per customer.
In addition to the new product offerings that Jim mentioned, let me share some other highlights.
We signed several new clients for our data and analytics service. We're also working with other MSOs to provide combined insights from set-top-box tuning data. We expanded the availability of our 5/1 data service known as Internet Basics. This service, which we initially introduced in Bronx and Newark, is now available across our entire footprint.
On the office end of the data spectrum, Optimum was the first cable company to introduce 1-gigabyte residential service in the tri-state area. The service launched in a new multi-tenant building in Weehawken, New Jersey. This offering showcases the strength and versatility of the Optimum network. We also continued to identify ways to expand the breadth of our WiFi coverage as well as optimize speed and performance.
As we look ahead, our 2015 WiFi growth plan includes deploying access points in high-data-usage areas. Additionally, ongoing investments in our WiFi network will continue to enhance the value of our Freewheel service.
We continue to make service and reliability key differentiators of the Optimum experience. First quarter total customer service phone calls declined by 12% and trouble call truck rolls decreased 21%, each as compared with the prior year period. We're pleased with our progress in the first quarter, and we'll remain highly focused on delivering superior service and enhancing our customer relationships.
With that, let me turn to Brian Sweeney to review our financial results."
25933,291311242,802738,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 04, 2015",2015-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kristin.Jim provided an overview of total company results, so now let's review our business segments.During the quarter, we gained 7,000 net high-speed data customers. Customer relationships, video and voice customers declined by 6,000, 28,",553,"Thank you, Kristin.
Jim provided an overview of total company results, so now let's review our business segments.
During the quarter, we gained 7,000 net high-speed data customers. Customer relationships, video and voice customers declined by 6,000, 28,000 and 14,000, respectively. First quarter average monthly revenue per customer increased by more than $7 to $155.34, as compared with the prior year period. This increase is consistent with our pricing strategies and principally reflects recent rate initiatives and our disciplined approach to promotional eligibility and retention policies.
First quarter total cable revenue increased by 2.4%, reflecting the increase in revenue per customer, which was partially offset by fewer customers. As compared with 2014, first quarter cable advertising revenue decreased by 3%, primarily due to lower gaming and banking spending. These declines were offset in part by higher auto and consumer spending, which benefited from addressable advertising campaigns.
Cable AOCF increased 0.8% in the first quarter, as compared with the prior year period. This primarily reflects the impact of revenue growth and lower employee and customer-service-related costs. This was partially offset by fewer customers and higher programming, product development and marketing costs.
Cable capital spending in the first quarter was $134 million, a $12 million decrease from the same period in 2014. This primarily reflects lower CPE spending due to the timing of set-top box and modem purchases, partially offset by continued deployment of our smart routers and further investment in our network to support our new data offering and WiFi expansion.
Lightpath's first quarter revenue increased 5%, and AOCF grew nearly 13%, as compared with the prior year period. These increases reflect revenue growth in Ethernet-based services, partially offset by continuing decline in legacy TDM-based services.
Lightpath has been expanding beyond its traditional voice, data and Internet service offerings to also provide managed services, with a lineup that has grown to include audio and Web conferencing, backup, hosted voice and other services. Additionally, Lightpath has increased its focused on medium-size businesses. Lightpath's growing product portfolio and increasing presence in these markets provides us with an attractive opportunity to grow in the mid-to-large enterprise space.
In our other segment, first quarter revenue was essentially flat, and the AOCF deficit improved by nearly 24%. These results principally reflect higher advertising revenue at News 12, partially offset by lower advertising revenue at Newsday. AOCF also reflects a reduction in expenses at Newsday due to lower operating costs and the termination of a distribution agreement, along with reduced expenses at corporate and certain other businesses. News 12's award-winning hyper-local programming and Newsday's strong editorial presence continue to resonate with our customers and provide a valuable retention tool for the company.
Before I turn it over to Gregg, I would note that our first quarter results were favorably impacted by the timing of several expense items, including marketing and employee-related costs, as well as the timing of capital spending. We've continued to anticipate that 2015 total company AOCF and CapEx, including incremental expenditures for Freewheel and our other new product initiatives, will be substantially similar to our 2014 results.

Good morning.The company's first quarter consolidated cash position was $884 million, and net debt was $7.8 billion.

The company's first quarter consolidated cash position was $884 million, and net debt was $7.8 billion. We had $1.43 billion undrawn and available under the $1.5 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings at the end of the first quarter.
At March 31, the company's consolidated net leverage ratio was 4.3x. The CSC Holdings restricted group bank leverage ratio was 2.9x. We did not repurchase shares of Cablevision stock during 2015. We have approximately $450 million of remaining stock repurchase authorization.
Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to touch on the topic of capital allocation, as we are frequently asked how we approach this.
We plan to apply our 2015 free cash flow in a similar manner to 2014. Our current priority is to continue to invest in the business. We will strive to provide the best possible service to our customers, and we are focused on investing in our network, including WiFi. We'll continue to invest in opportunities that will help us realize our ambition of being the premier connectivity company in our market.
The second priority is to ensure that our balance sheet continues to afford us the ability to dynamically manage the business and apply our excess capital. I think it's likely that you'll see a portion of our excess cash applied to our effort to continue to delever. Consistent with this approach, in April, we made a voluntary prepayment of our CSC Holdings term loan B facility in the amount of $200 million. This repayment will result in cash interest savings over the term of the facility.
Number three in our hierarchy is our dividend, which is our primary method of returning capital to shareholders. Finally, as always, we will remain highly disciplined as we evaluate any other potential acquisitions and investment opportunities.
Operator, with that, we'd now like to open the call for questions."

The main drivers of our increased revenue per customer came from a combination of rate increases but also lower proportion of subscribers on promotion. We have a -- we had a number of rate increases on January 1 of this year related to cable box fees, an increase in our sports and broadcast TV surcharge, as well as the pass-through of PEG fees to certain of our customers. In addition, RPC benefited from rate increases that were implemented in the second quarter of 2014 and the implementation of a pass-through on voice taxes last summer. So the combination of all of that led to the increase."

Or ""He went for the router, so that's just data,"" right? The -- but I do think that directionally you're seeing that the video product begins -- they lose margin and not just amongst the little operators like us but even some of the big operators. The -- and our philosophy with this is essentially that we think that video is akin to the eggs and the milk in a convenience store. You have to have it, but you don't make a lot of money on it. Now connectivity is a whole another basket. It's more like the soda and chips aisle. And the -- if you provide great connectivity because it provides great value to the consumer, you can differentiate yourself and you can charge more, and the margins are good on it. So that's the thought process."

On the overall WiFi investment, I think Jim or Brian can speak to this too, but WiFi is just -- it is the technology for the future. WiFi was built for data. Data consumption increases massively. So we're now seeing, average megabits per session on the plan in the first quarter were almost 24. We're seeing 6 megabits of data being consumed per month for our broadband customers over WiFi. So it's the way of the future. You see cars with WiFi, everywhere you go, airplanes with WiFi. As Jim said, when you went to CES, you didn't see anybody talking about cellular.

Cablevision is off to a solid start in 2015. Consolidated revenue grew more than 2% and AOCF increased nearly 5% compared with the first quarter of 2014. Our capital expenditures were $167 million. Free cash flow was $49 million. And we declared a $0.15 per share dividend on May 1.
Turning to our strategy. We remain focused on advancing our position as New York's premier connectivity company. Today's digital consumer expects to be connected all the time on all devices wherever they are. And Cablevision's path for continued success is to stay ahead of these changes, and we are determined to do just that.
To achieve this on the product side, we have been advancing connectivity to a broader set of consumers and providing innovative products and service options. We are taking bold steps to connect the customers in new ways. For example, in February, we launched Freewheel. This is our new WiFi-only phone service with unlimited data, talk and text, free from the high costs and data limits imposed by cellular providers. Freewheel leverages the power of our robust WiFi network. It also helps monetize our investment in WiFi.
In March, we announced an agreement to make HBO Now available through the Internet to our high-speed data customers. Cablevision is currently the only cable provider to offer the full suite of HBO products. Just last week, we were the first cable or satellite operator to announce plans to distribute Hulu to our customers. We also recently launched cord-cutter packages that target a new generation of consumers. These offers provide alternatives for those who prefer to access video content through the Internet. Packages are available at different price ranges and all include a digital antenna at no charge for over-the-air TV. This allows customers to bypass the big bundle and still watch broadcast television as well as over-the-top content.
In summary, the company is changing, and these new initiatives are a few examples of our evolution. Going forward, you will see more products and services that focus on flexibility as we reimagine Cablevision and its place in the market.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Kristin Dolan for an operational product -- operational and product overview."

First quarter net customer results generally compared favorably with the third and fourth quarters of 2014. We added data customers despite significant competitive discounting and economic pressures in portions of our footprint. Our disciplined approach to pricing, promotional eligibility and customer credit policies has not wavered. We're targeting a stronger base of customers while differentiating the value of Optimum in the marketplace. To this end, during the first quarter, we continued to deliver strong year-over-year growth in revenue per customer.
In addition to the new product offerings that Jim mentioned, let me share some other highlights.
We signed several new clients for our data and analytics service. We're also working with other MSOs to provide combined insights from set-top-box tuning data. We expanded the availability of our 5/1 data service known as Internet Basics. This service, which we initially introduced in Bronx and Newark, is now available across our entire footprint.
On the office end of the data spectrum, Optimum was the first cable company to introduce 1-gigabyte residential service in the tri-state area. The service launched in a new multi-tenant building in Weehawken, New Jersey. This offering showcases the strength and versatility of the Optimum network. We also continued to identify ways to expand the breadth of our WiFi coverage as well as optimize speed and performance.
As we look ahead, our 2015 WiFi growth plan includes deploying access points in high-data-usage areas. Additionally, ongoing investments in our WiFi network will continue to enhance the value of our Freewheel service.
We continue to make service and reliability key differentiators of the Optimum experience. First quarter total customer service phone calls declined by 12% and trouble call truck rolls decreased 21%, each as compared with the prior year period. We're pleased with our progress in the first quarter, and we'll remain highly focused on delivering superior service and enhancing our customer relationships.
With that, let me turn to Brian Sweeney to review our financial results."

Jim provided an overview of total company results, so now let's review our business segments.
During the quarter, we gained 7,000 net high-speed data customers. Customer relationships, video and voice customers declined by 6,000, 28,000 and 14,000, respectively. First quarter average monthly revenue per customer increased by more than $7 to $155.34, as compared with the prior year period. This increase is consistent with our pricing strategies and principally reflects recent rate initiatives and our disciplined approach to promotional eligibility and retention policies.
First quarter total cable revenue increased by 2.4%, reflecting the increase in revenue per customer, which was partially offset by fewer customers. As compared with 2014, first quarter cable advertising revenue decreased by 3%, primarily due to lower gaming and banking spending. These declines were offset in part by higher auto and consumer spending, which benefited from addressable advertising campaigns.
Cable AOCF increased 0.8% in the first quarter, as compared with the prior year period. This primarily reflects the impact of revenue growth and lower employee and customer-service-related costs. This was partially offset by fewer customers and higher programming, product development and marketing costs.
Cable capital spending in the first quarter was $134 million, a $12 million decrease from the same period in 2014. This primarily reflects lower CPE spending due to the timing of set-top box and modem purchases, partially offset by continued deployment of our smart routers and further investment in our network to support our new data offering and WiFi expansion.
Lightpath's first quarter revenue increased 5%, and AOCF grew nearly 13%, as compared with the prior year period. These increases reflect revenue growth in Ethernet-based services, partially offset by continuing decline in legacy TDM-based services.
Lightpath has been expanding beyond its traditional voice, data and Internet service offerings to also provide managed services, with a lineup that has grown to include audio and Web conferencing, backup, hosted voice and other services. Additionally, Lightpath has increased its focused on medium-size businesses. Lightpath's growing product portfolio and increasing presence in these markets provides us with an attractive opportunity to grow in the mid-to-large enterprise space.
In our other segment, first quarter revenue was essentially flat, and the AOCF deficit improved by nearly 24%. These results principally reflect higher advertising revenue at News 12, partially offset by lower advertising revenue at Newsday. AOCF also reflects a reduction in expenses at Newsday due to lower operating costs and the termination of a distribution agreement, along with reduced expenses at corporate and certain other businesses. News 12's award-winning hyper-local programming and Newsday's strong editorial presence continue to resonate with our customers and provide a valuable retention tool for the company.
Before I turn it over to Gregg, I would note that our first quarter results were favorably impacted by the timing of several expense items, including marketing and employee-related costs, as well as the timing of capital spending. We've continued to anticipate that 2015 total company AOCF and CapEx, including incremental expenditures for Freewheel and our other new product initiatives, will be substantially similar to our 2014 results. However, we -- as we've said before, this is a dynamic business and we anticipate updating our guidance as the year progresses.
I'll now hand the call over to Gregg Seibert to discuss our capital position and capital allocation strategy."

The company's first quarter consolidated cash position was $884 million, and net debt was $7.8 billion. We had $1.43 billion undrawn and available under the $1.5 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings at the end of the first quarter.
At March 31, the company's consolidated net leverage ratio was 4.3x. The CSC Holdings restricted group bank leverage ratio was 2.9x. We did not repurchase shares of Cablevision stock during 2015. We have approximately $450 million of remaining stock repurchase authorization.
Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to touch on the topic of capital allocation, as we are frequently asked how we approach this.
We plan to apply our 2015 free cash flow in a similar manner to 2014. Our current priority is to continue to invest in the business. We will strive to provide the best possible service to our customers, and we are focused on investing in our network, including WiFi. We'll continue to invest in opportunities that will help us realize our ambition of being the premier connectivity company in our market.
The second priority is to ensure that our balance sheet continues to afford us the ability to dynamically manage the business and apply our excess capital. I think it's likely that you'll see a portion of our excess cash applied to our effort to continue to delever. Consistent with this approach, in April, we made a voluntary prepayment of our CSC Holdings term loan B facility in the amount of $200 million. This repayment will result in cash interest savings over the term of the facility.
Number three in our hierarchy is our dividend, which is our primary method of returning capital to shareholders. Finally, as always, we will remain highly disciplined as we evaluate any other potential acquisitions and investment opportunities.
Operator, with that, we'd now like to open the call for questions."

We have a -- we had a number of rate increases on January 1 of this year related to cable box fees, an increase in our sports and broadcast TV surcharge, as well as the pass-through of PEG fees to certain of our customers. In addition, RPC benefited from rate increases that were implemented in the second quarter of 2014 and the implementation of a pass-through on voice taxes last summer. So the combination of all of that led to the increase."

The -- but I do think that directionally you're seeing that the video product begins -- they lose margin and not just amongst the little operators like us but even some of the big operators. The -- and our philosophy with this is essentially that we think that video is akin to the eggs and the milk in a convenience store. You have to have it, but you don't make a lot of money on it.

We're -- I think we're very good at knowing exactly what's going on with our customers, and that's where you see the impetus for a lot of these changes. As far as things like the CapEx goes, I mean, look, the margins are decreasing on the video product, right? The CapEx is not going -- necessarily going down on the video product. You still got boxes in the homes, right? You still got X amount of calls that you're making, et cetera. So it's an unfortunate dynamic in the business because the -- your expenses are either, in the case of, like, programming, going up. In terms of capital on a per-subscriber base, they're not going down, right? The -- and you have -- you're in a competitive marketplace, so there is some ceiling on the level of pricing that you can change -- you can charge. This is squeezing the margin out of the product. And so our -- so I think that our long-term plan is to continue to offer the product, the -- and still try to make it the best product we can, much like the milk and the eggs in the convenience store, right?

And when you look at your question about OpEx or CapEx, our infrastructure costs, over time, to deliver broadband are not as aggressive or wouldn't be as aggressive as video product. The ability to develop on more open platforms; the work that Dibble and Wilt are doing on customer capabilities within the homes so that we can troubleshoot from over the phone, as opposed to rolling a truck through the smart routers and the genius routers; and then a broadband product just is much less complex, so the opportunity to reduce not only trouble calls but also phone calls into the call center make that, the broadband products, more attractive on an overall basis for us, although, like Jim says, we'll be selling video our lifetimes and beyond."

And we get really positive feedback on people taking the phone outside of the U.S., the Caribbean, places like that, so there may be opportunity there. On the overall WiFi investment, I think Jim or Brian can speak to this too, but WiFi is just -- it is the technology for the future. WiFi was built for data. Data consumption increases massively. So we're now seeing, average megabits per session on the plan in the first quarter were almost 24. We're seeing 6 megabits of data being consumed per month for our broadband customers over WiFi. So it's the way of the future. You see cars with WiFi, everywhere you go, airplanes with WiFi. As Jim said, when you went to CES, you didn't see anybody talking about cellular. All the new products, it just assumes a prevalence of WiFi across -- really across the country. And so we're enthusiastic that our cable brethren are continuing to support WiFi. We hope that they will continue do more."

Consolidated revenue grew 2% and AOCF decreased 3% compared to the prior year period. Year-to-date, AOCF is in line with our 2015 outlook. Our capital expenditures during the quarter were $215 million. Free cash flow was $158 million. And we continued to return capital to shareholders with a dividend of $0.15 per share declared in August 6.  Overall, we're satisfied with our results.
Turning to operations. The metric we are most enthusiastic about is customer relationships. We gained 5,000 total customers, marking the first quarter of growth in more than 2 years. New technologies and consumer behaviors continue to challenge the big bundle. It's clear that this dynamic with the customer is changing, which is why today, the overall customer relationship number is more relevant than individual product metrics.
As a leading service provider in the most sophisticated markets in the country, we saw these trends coming. And that is why earlier this year, we were the first and only provider to introduce cord-cutter packages. We recognized that the traditional video bundle does not work for all consumers, so we are offering flexibility, choice and new products to meet their evolving connectivity needs.
We have been positioning the company to address this changing market for several years. Beginning in 2012, Cablevision embarked on a new strategic path to become the premier connectivity company in the New York market. We made substantial investments in technology, tools and people to provide the best experience to our customers. Most importantly, we focused on the reliability and performance of our networks. As a result, we more than doubled our broadband capacity, optimized the density and quality of our WiFi experience, enabled the more innovative product set with flexible service offerings and improved our ability to monitor network performance and address issues proactively.
These investments have also made our operations more efficient. We have reduced trouble call truck rolls in half and customer calls by nearly 30% compared to the 2012 levels. This has led to lower costs and improved customer satisfaction. At the same time, we chose to compete on value, not solely on price, by taking a more disciplined approach to promotional eligibility and customer credit policies. The changes to the way we do business has resulted in a stronger base of customers who are more satisfied. That has helped decreased our voluntary competitive churn to a nearly 6-year low in the second quarter.
On the product side, we continue to innovate with our over-the-top offerings and witnessed speedy increase in our core data service. We have also changed the Cablevision employee experience by investing in the development of our people. As a result, we have created a performance-based culture throughout all levels of the company.
I'm going to close my portion of the call with some remarks about Verizon. Our first direct competition with them was in the landline phone business. From a standing start, we took more than 2 million of their residential phone customers, and Cablevision became the dominant phone provider in our market. Verizon has invested billions of dollars in FiOS in the tri-state area. Today, Cablevision serves more than 3.1 million customers, down from 3.3 million customers at our peak in 2008. This is despite FiOS' heavily bundled overbuild and deeply discounted pricing as well as the economy and other competitive forces. The impact of FiOS on Cablevision has been minimal. To the extent that we have lost customers to FiOS, we believe that they are usually promotional shoppers in search of the lowest price services. FiOS has almost certainly performed better against the satellite companies than it has against Cablevision. We believe that the Verizon FiOS is an unprofitable business today, and we doubt that they will ever be profitable.
Our strategic plan and investments during the past 3 years have helped to transform Cablevision. Our focus on price discipline has allowed us to grow revenue per customer. Our voluntary churn is down, and we have retained our highest-value customers. In addition today, Cablevision operates the nation's most robust WiFi network, while Verizon has no public WiFi. 
Cablevision has changed its culture. We no longer think like a monopoly, and instead, we are strategic, effective and competitive. Our approach to connectivity as a new frontier is gaining traction. This is reflected by our growth in customer relationships this quarter.
The Verizon FiOS effect, if there was ever -- if there ever was one, in our opinion, is over. Our business is healthy, and I'm confident that we'll get even stronger as we move forward.
With that, let me turn the call over to Kristin Dolan for an operational and product update."
25933,306644153,852346,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2015",2015-08-07,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. The actions we've taken over the last 3 years to reimagine Cablevision have resulted in a faster, more reliable network that excelled at delivering new and sophisticated products and services. on June's update the improvements we've made h",644,"Thank you, Jim. The actions we've taken over the last 3 years to reimagine Cablevision have resulted in a faster, more reliable network that excelled at delivering new and sophisticated products and services. on June's update the improvements we've made have enhanced the customer experience and have reduced costly service-related transactions.  
For example, through proactive monitoring of the network, we're able to identify risk points and intervene before the customer is affected. We triage every trouble call before we roll a truck, identifying the source of the issue and eliminating unnecessary truck rolls. And we've armed our technicians with advanced tools that enable faster repair times and facilitate the goal of first call resolution, solving the problem in our first visit to the home. These initiatives are resonating with our customers and leading to superior service experience. Accordingly, second quarter trouble call truck rolls decreased 19% as compared with the prior year period. We also experienced a 13% reduction in calls to customer service over the same period.
We implemented a voice of the customer dashboard earlier this year to capture real-time customer feedback and measure Net Promoter Score, a tool widely used by many leading companies to obtain feedback from customers. Responses to this new approach has been strong. We'll harness the insights from these surveys to further improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiencies.
We also continue to innovate in the product area. In the second quarter, we introduced our cord-cutter packages to serve a new generation that prefers connection to video content through the Internet. The cord cutter offerings provide access to different levels of Internet service at varying price points. They all include a digital antenna at no charge for over the year TV. This allows customers to bypass the big bundle and still watch broadcast television as well as over-the-top content. These packages are attracting new interest. They have also allowed us to engage differently with consumers who are looking for options to fit their individual connectivity needs and budgets.
Changes in our acquisition and retention practices helped improve customer activities during the quarter, with fewer disconnects and an overall net gain of 5,000 total customers as Jim mentioned. We also experienced the largest quarterly data net additions since the first quarter of 2015.
Turning to our network. Our investments in this area have transformed our high-speed data service into the premier broadband offerings in the New York marketplace.  Let me share a few specifics. 
During the last 2 years, average daily usage per customer has increased by 190%. Today, 90% of customer relationships include broadband service. In addition, nearly half of Optimum Online customers currently subscribe to premium speed tiers, and more than half of data customers use 50 gigabits or more per month.
Now let's turn to WiFi. Over the last 3 years, WiFi access and usage has grown exponentially across all metrics. For example, Optimum WiFi access points have increased from less than 50,000 to more than 1.3 million. We rolled out 1 million in home smart routers at no incremental cost to our customers. And monthly WiFi data usage per customer increased from less than 1 gigabyte to more than 6 gigabytes over the same 3-year period. We will continue to make investments in our WiFi networks through the deployment of additional WiFi access points in high-data-usage areas.
Moving on. Other highlights for the quarter include offering HBO Now and Hulu as an over-the-top offerings to our broadband customers, entering into a long-term agreement with ESPN Disney for our data and analytics service, and continuing to work with other MSOs to provide combined insights for set-top box tuning data.
We're pleased with the progress in the first half of 2015, and we'll remain focused on delivering superior service and enhancing our customer relationships.
With that, let me turn to Brian Sweeney to review our financial results."

During the quarter, total customers increased by 5,000 and high-speed data customers increased by 14,000. Video and voice customers declined by 16,000 and 7,000 respectively. We're seeing more favorable customer trend",726,"Thank you, Kristin, and good morning. During the quarter, total customers increased by 5,000 and high-speed data customers increased by 14,000. Video and voice customers declined by 16,000 and 7,000 respectively. We're seeing more favorable customer trends over the last few quarters as a direct result of the numerous actions taken to increase broadband capacity, improve network reliability and enhance customer service. We have also built a stronger customer base with reduced churn and lower voluntary disconnects. Average monthly revenue per customer in the second quarter increased by nearly $6 to $158.52 as compared with the prior year period. This performance was principally driven by recent initiatives and our disciplined approach to promotional eligibility and retention policies as well as increased transactional revenue from a pay-per-view event during the quarter.
Second quarter total cable revenue increased by 1.8%, reflecting the increase in revenue per customer, which was partially offset by fewer customers compared to the prior year period and lower advertising.
Cable AOCF decreased 3.4% in the second quarter as compared to the prior year period. This primarily reflects higher programming costs, legal fees and product development and marketing costs, partially offset by the impact of revenue growth and lower customer service-related costs. 
I want to provide a little more color on our advertising revenue. As compared with 2014, second quarter cable advertising revenue decreased by 11% primarily due to reduced spending with fewer candidate campaigns this year, along with lower spending in the financial, gaming and cable programming sectors. The declines in certain categories of our advertising revenue were offset in part by higher local recreational and consumer spending. Notably, the number of addressable advertising campaigns doubled compared to the prior year period, and we are seeing pronounced interest in impression-based sales.
Moving on to CapEx. Cable capital spending in the second quarter was $186 million, a $21 million decrease from same period in 2014. This primarily reflects a lower year-over-year spending on set-top box and modem purchases as well as the timing of certain video-related projects. These declines were partially offset by higher project spending to support broadband and WiFi expansion. We expect increased CapEx spending in the back half of 2015 as we continue to invest in the evolution of our product offerings and ensure a quality service experience.
Moving on to our other business segments. Lightpath second quarter revenue increased 3% and AOCF grew nearly 12% as compared to the prior year period. The revenue increase reflects growth in Ethernet-based services, partially offset by the continuing decline in legacy TDM-based services. AOCF growth was also driven by lower expenses.
In our other segment, second quarter revenue decreased 3.7% and the AOCF deficit increased by 4%. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to lower advertising revenue at Newsday, partially offset by higher advertising revenue at News 12. The decline in AOCF reflects lower overall net revenues and higher employee-related costs at corporate, partially offset by a reduction in operating expenses at Newsday.
Now turning to the company financial position. The company's second quarter consolidated cash position was $797 million, and net debt was $7.7 billion. We had $1.43 billion of undrawn and available under the $1.5 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings as of the end of the second quarter.  As previously mentioned on our May earnings call, during the second quarter, we made a voluntary repayment of our CSC Holdings term loan B facility in the amount of $200 million. This repayment will result in cash interest savings over the term of the facility. 
We remain focused on identifying opportunities to reduce leverage, strengthen our balance sheet and improve our liquidity position.  At June 30, the company's consolidated net leverage ratio was 4.1x. The CSC Holdings restricted group bank leverage ratio was 2.7x. 
We have not repurchased shares of Cablevision stock during 2015, and we have approximately $450 million of remaining stock repurchase authorization.
We continue to anticipate that 2015 total company AOCF and CapEx, including incremental expenditures for product initiatives, will be substantially similar to our 2014 results.
Before we move to Q&A, we know the topic of M&A continues to be in all of your minds, but this call is to discuss our second quarter results. We will not be entertaining questions today relating to industry consolidation.
Operator, we would now like to open the call for questions."

But I do think eventually though that there will be enough of -- enough programming for over-the-top to be competitive with the traditional video bundle. But this is not something that I think is going to happen over a very short period of time. The consumers have become very, very comfortable with the amount of choice that cable offers. And if you want to have a very, very wide variety of choice that the bundle actually is somehow still efficient, that the -- it's essentially buying the entire magazine stand even though you're going to -- because you want the choice of every magazine in there, but you'll only look at maybe several a day or whatever. But you don't want to give up your access to the whole magazine stand. The consumers have gotten very used to that, but it's pricey. And so as you continue to see that price push up, which inevitably you will because the programmers are raising their rates on obviously on a regular basis, particularly the broadcasters, who see it as a bit of a pot of gold. That will drive the people who are more price-sensitive into alternatives. And Internet is obviously, ip over-the-top is starting to become a real alternative. And then with -- that is why we introduced the cord-cutter package with digital antenna. Because the digital antenna actually takes the programming bundle up to the point where it is somewhat competitive with traditional bundle and at a price that's affordable. So I think it's right for you to watch what happens with that, but I don't think that we're going to see a landslide of consumers move from one to the other. And my own prediction is that it will be at least 5 years for 10% of the market to move and 10 years for 30% of the market to move. How's that for an answer?"

I really see Cablevision having, over the last 3 years, focused very heavily on our culture and our attitude here about how we do business. The -- And we saw ourselves back 3 or 4 years ago as really being a sort of operating in the form of a classic cable company, which is really a monopoly. I know that some in the industry don't like to call themselves that, but if you're the only provider, that sort of makes you the monopoly. We're clearly not the only provider in our marketplace, and it was time for us to recognize that. But just recognizing it didn't -- doesn't change overnight. It's taken us a good 3.5 years to get ourselves in a position where we are truly effective competitors and we address the realities of the marketplace. What I said today is a reflection of Cablevision's strength, and the numbers are up quite nicely, and I expect that we can get only stronger as a competitor. So that's really the basis of my comments on that. Other than that, I think we do find it at least a little annoying over here that Verizon continues to tag its FiOS product as being successful when we know very well that, that is definitely not the case, at least in our footprint. And they refuse to break out their numbers, so they just sit there and beat their chests saying ""Yes, I am. Yes, I am,"" and everything that we see says, no, they aren't. So there's a little bit of in there. The second part of your question was on the bundle and erosion of the bundle, and the -- I do see our ability actually to make up from loss of video customers. But you should understand that video customers actually are not the most valuable customers. By far and away, data customers are the most valuable customers at a ratio here of close to 7:1 that they -- and so as we continue to improve our ability to offer connectivity to our customers, I do expect that our suite of offerings of them will increase, that there'll be more revenue opportunities in there for specialized use as well as expanded use. And use by the way, continues to grow exponential -- exponentially. And so the outlook for data is very strong. And with video, their margins continue to decrease. And our intention is to ultimately be able to offer to our customers not only our video package, but other videos packages versus an IP connection and further reduce our costs, but improve the profitability of the company that way."

Our capital expenditu",789,"Thank you, Cindi, and good morning. Our second quarter financial results met our expectations. Consolidated revenue grew 2% and AOCF decreased 3% compared to the prior year period. Year-to-date, AOCF is in line with our 2015 outlook. Our capital expenditures during the quarter were $215 million. Free cash flow was $158 million. And we continued to return capital to shareholders with a dividend of $0.15 per share declared in August 6.  Overall, we're satisfied with our results.
Turning to operations. The metric we are most enthusiastic about is customer relationships. We gained 5,000 total customers, marking the first quarter of growth in more than 2 years. New technologies and consumer behaviors continue to challenge the big bundle. It's clear that this dynamic with the customer is changing, which is why today, the overall customer relationship number is more relevant than individual product metrics.
As a leading service provider in the most sophisticated markets in the country, we saw these trends coming. And that is why earlier this year, we were the first and only provider to introduce cord-cutter packages. We recognized that the traditional video bundle does not work for all consumers, so we are offering flexibility, choice and new products to meet their evolving connectivity needs.
We have been positioning the company to address this changing market for several years. Beginning in 2012, Cablevision embarked on a new strategic path to become the premier connectivity company in the New York market. We made substantial investments in technology, tools and people to provide the best experience to our customers. Most importantly, we focused on the reliability and performance of our network. As a result, we more than doubled our broadband capacity, optimized the density and quality of our WiFi experience, enabled the more innovative product set with flexible service offerings and improved our ability to monitor network performance and address issues proactively.
These investments have also made our operations more efficient. We have reduced trouble call truck rolls in half and customer calls by nearly 30% compared to the 2012 levels. This has led to lower costs and improved customer satisfaction. At the same time, we chose to complete -- compete on value, not solely on price by taking a more disciplined approach to promotional eligibility and customer credit policies. The changes to the way we do business has resulted in a stronger base of customers who are more satisfied. That has helped decreased our voluntary competitive churn to a nearly 6-year low in the second quarter.
On the product side, we've continue to innovate with our over-the-top offerings and recent speedy increase in our core data service. We've also changed the Cablevision employee experience by investing in the development of our people. As a result, we have created a performance-based culture throughout all levels of the company.
I'm going to close my portion of the call with some remarks about Verizon. Our first direct competition with them was in the landline phone business. From a standing start, we took more than 2 million of their residential phone customers, and Cablevision became the dominant phone provider in our market. Verizon has invested billions of dollars in FiOS in the tri-state area. Today, Cablevision serves more than 3.1 million customers, down from 3.3 million customers at our peak in 2008. This is despite FiOS' heavily bundled overbuild and deeply discounted pricing as well as the economy and other competitive forces. The impact of FiOS on Cablevision has been minimal. To the extent that we have lost customers to FiOS, we believe that they are usually promotional shoppers in search of the lowest price services. FiOS has almost certainly performed better against the satellite companies than it has against Cablevision. We believe that the Verizon FiOS is an unprofitable business today, and we doubt that they will ever be profitable.
Our strategic plan and investments during the past 3 years have helped to transform Cablevision. Our focus on price discipline has allowed us to grow revenue per customer. Our voluntary churn is down, and we have retained our highest-value customers. In addition today, Cablevision operates the nation's most robust WiFi network, while Verizon has no public WiFi. 
Cablevision has changed its culture. We no longer think like a monopoly, and instead, we are strategic, effective and competitive. Our approach to connectivity as a new frontier is gaining traction. This is reflected by our growth in customer relationships this quarter.
The Verizon FiOS effect, if there was ever -- if there ever was one, in our opinion, is over. Our business is healthy, and I'm confident that we'll get even stronger as we move forward.
With that, let me turn the call over to Kristin Dolan for an operational and product update."

The actions we've taken over the last 3 years to reimagine Cablevision have resulted in a faster, more reliable network that excelled at delivering new and sophisticated products and services. Expanding on Jim's update, the improvements we have made have enhanced the customer experience and have reduced costly service-related transactions.  
For example, through proactive monitoring of the network, we're able to identify risk points and intervene before the customer is affected. We triage every trouble call before we roll a truck, identifying the source of the issue and eliminating unnecessary truck rolls. And we've armed our technicians with advanced tools that enable faster repair times and facilitate the goal of first call resolution, solving the problem in our first visit to the home. These initiatives are resonating with our customers and leading to a superior service experience. Accordingly, second quarter trouble call truck rolls decreased 19% as compared with the prior year period. We also experienced a 13% reduction in calls to customer service over the same period.
We implemented a voice of the customer dashboard earlier this year to capture real-time customer feedback and measure net promoter score, a tool widely used by many leading companies to obtain feedback from customers. Responses to this new approach have been strong. We'll harness the insights from these surveys to further improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiencies.
We've also continued to innovate in the product area. In the second quarter, we introduced our cord-cutter packages to serve a new generation that prefers to access video content through the Internet. The cord cutter offerings provide access to different levels of Internet service at varying price points. They all include a digital antenna at no charge for over-the-year TV. This allows customers to bypass the big bundle and still watch broadcast television as well as over-the-top content. These packages are attracting new interests. They have also allowed us to engage differently with consumers who are looking for options to fit their individual connectivity needs and budgets.
Changes in our acquisition and retention practices helped improve customer activities during the quarter, with fewer disconnects and an overall net gain of 5,000 total customers as Jim mentioned. We also experienced the largest quarterly data net additions since the first quarter of 2013.
Turning to our network. Our investments in this area have transformed our high-speed data service into the premier broadband offerings in the New York marketplace.  Let me share a few specifics. 
During the last 2 years, average daily usage per customer has increased by 190%. Today, 90% of customer relationships include broadband service. In addition, nearly half of Optimum Online customers currently subscribe to premium speed tiers, and more than half of data customers use 50 gigabits or more per month.
Now let's turn to WiFi. Over the last 3 years, WiFi access and usage has grown exponentially across all metrics. For example, Optimum WiFi access points have increased from less than 50,000 to more than 1.3 million. We rolled out 1 million in home smart routers at no incremental cost to our customers. And monthly WiFi data usage per customer increased from less than 1 gigabyte to more than 6 gigabytes over the same 3-year period. We will continue to make investments in our WiFi networks through the deployment of additional WiFi access points in high-data-usage areas.
Moving on. Other highlights for the quarter include offering HBO Now and Hulu as over-the-top alternatives to our broadband customers, entering into a long-term agreement with ESPN Disney for our data and analytics service, and continuing to work with other MSOs to provide combined insights for set-top box tuning data.
We're pleased with the progress in the first half of 2015, and we'll remain focused on delivering superior service and enhancing our customer relationships.
With that, let me turn to Brian Sweeney to review our financial results."

During the quarter, total customers increased by 5,000 and high-speed data customers increased by 14,000. Video and voice customers declined by 16,000 and 7,000 respectively. We're seeing more favorable customer trend",726,"Thank you, Kristin, and good morning. During the quarter, total customers increased by 5,000 and high-speed data customers increased by 14,000. Video and voice customers declined by 16,000 and 7,000 respectively. We're seeing more favorable customer trends over the last few quarters as a direct result of the numerous actions taken to increase broadband capacity, improve network reliability and enhance customer service. We have also built a stronger customer base with reduced churn and lower voluntary disconnects. Average monthly revenue per customer in the second quarter increased by nearly $6 to $158.52 as compared with the prior year period. This performance was principally driven by recent rate initiatives and our disciplined approach to promotional eligibility and retention policies, as well as increased transactional revenue from a pay-per-view event during the quarter.
Second quarter total cable revenue increased by 1.8%, reflecting the increase in revenue per customer, which was partially offset by fewer customers compared to the prior year period and lower advertising.
Cable AOCF decreased 3.4% in the second quarter as compared to the prior year period. This primarily reflects higher programming cost, legal fees, and product development and marketing costs, partially offset by the impact of revenue growth and lower customer service-related costs.
I want to provide a little more color on our advertising book. As compared with 2014, second quarter cable advertising revenue decreased by 11%, primarily due to reduced spending with fewer candidate campaigns this year, along with lower spending in the financial, gaming and cable programming sectors. The declines in certain categories of our advertising revenue were offset in part by higher local recreational and consumer spending. Notably, the number of addressable advertising campaigns doubled compared to the prior year period, and we are seeing pronounced interest in impression-based sales.
Moving on to CapEx. Cable capital spending in the second quarter was $186 million, a $21 million decrease from same period in 2014. This primarily reflects lower year-over-year spending on set-top box and modem purchases, as well as the timing of certain video-related projects. These declines were partially offset by higher project spending to support broadband and WiFi expansion. We expect increased CapEx spending in the back half of 2015 as we continue to invest in the evolution of our product offerings and ensure a quality service experience.
Moving on to our other business segments. Lightpath second quarter revenue increased 3% and AOCF grew nearly 12% as compared with the prior year period. The revenue increase reflects growth in Ethernet-based services, partially offset by the continuing decline in legacy TDM-based services. AOCF growth was also driven by lower expenses.
In our other segment, second quarter revenue decreased 3.7% and the AOCF deficit increased by 4%. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to lower advertising revenue at Newsday, partially offset by higher advertising revenue at News 12. The decline in AOCF reflects lower overall net revenues and higher employee-related cost to corporate, partially offset by a reduction in operating expenses at Newsday.
Now turning to the company's financial position. The company's second quarter consolidated cash position was $797 million, and net debt was $7.7 billion. We had $1.43 billion undrawn and available under the $1.5 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings as of the end of the second quarter.  As previously mentioned on our May earnings call, during the second quarter, we made a voluntary repayment of our CSC Holdings term loan B facility in the amount of $200 million. This repayment will result in cash interest savings over the term of the facility. 
We remain focused on identifying opportunities to reduce leverage, strengthen our balance sheet and improve our liquidity position.  At June 30, the company's consolidated net leverage ratio was 4.1x. The CSC Holdings restricted group bank leverage ratio was 2.7x. 
We have not repurchased shares of Cablevision stock during 2015, and we have approximately $450 million of remaining stock repurchase authorization.
We continue to anticipate that 2015 total company AOCF and CapEx, including incremental expenditures for the product initiatives, will be substantially similar to our 2014 results.
Before we move to Q&A, we know the topic of M&A continues to be on all of your minds, but this call is to discuss our second quarter results. We will not be entertaining questions today relating to industry consolidation.

Hi Jessica. The -- I don't think the sky is falling quite yet. And I think that there's not enough programming weight yet in the Internet, right, and then in the over-the-top services that are out there to really entice a mainstream video customer. That the innovators, et cetera, some of the -- I don't call it fringe, but some of the -- not mainstream video watchers start to adopt the over-the-top. But the -- I do think eventually though that there will be enough of -- enough programming for over-the-top to be competitive with the traditional video bundle. The -- but this is not something that I think is going to happen over a very short period of time. The consumers have become very, very comfortable with the amount of choice that cable offers. And if you want to have a very, very wide variety of choice, that the bundle actually is somewhat still efficient, that the -- it's essentially buying the entire magazine stand even though you're going to -- because you want the choice of every magazine in there, but you only look at maybe several a day or whatever. But you don't want to give up your access to the whole magazine stand. The consumers have gotten very used to that, but it's pricey. And so the -- as you continue to see that price push up, which inevitably you will because the programmers are raising their rates on -- obviously, on a regular basis, particularly the broadcasters who see it as a bit of a pot of gold, that will drive the people who are more price-sensitive into alternatives. And Internet is obviously, IP over-the-top is starting to become a real alternative. And then with -- that is why we introduced the cord-cutter package with digital antenna. Because the digital antenna essentially takes the programming bundle up to the point where it is somewhat competitive with a traditional bundle and at a price that's affordable. So I think it's right for you to watch what happens with that, but I don't think that we're going to see a landslide of consumers move from one to the other. And my own prediction is that it will be at least 5 years for 10% of the market to move and 10 years for 30% of the market to move. How's that for an answer?"

The -- I really see Cablevision having, over the last 3 years, focused very heavily on our culture and our attitude here about how we do business. And the -- we saw ourselves back 3 or 4 years ago as really being a sort of operating in the form of a classic cable company, which is really a monopoly. I know that some in the industry don't like to call themselves that, but if you're the only provider, that sort of makes you the monopoly. We're clearly not the only provider in our marketplace, and it was time for us to recognize that. But just recognizing it didn't -- doesn't change overnight. It's taken us a good 3.5 years to get ourselves in a position where we are truly effective competitors and we address the realities of the marketplace. What I said today is a reflection of Cablevision's strength, and the numbers bare that out quite nicely, that they -- and I expect that we will get only stronger as a competitor. And so that's really the basis of my comments on that. Other than that, I think we do find it at least a little annoying over here that Verizon continues to tout its FiOS product as being successful when we know very well that, that is definitely not the case, at least in our footprint. And they refuse to break out their numbers, so they just sit there and beat their chests saying ""Yes, I am. Yes, I am,"" and everything that we see says, no, they aren't. So there's a little bit of that in there. The second part of your question was on the bundle and the erosion of the bundle, and the -- I do see our ability actually to make up for loss of video customers. But you should understand that video customers actually are not the most valuable customers. By far and away, data customers are the most valuable customers at a ratio here of close to 7:1, that they -- and so as we continue to improve our ability to offer connectivity to our customers, I do expect that our suite of offerings to them will increase, that there'll be more revenue opportunities in there for specialized use as well as expanded use. And use, by the way, continues to grow exponential -- exponentially. And so the outlook for data is very strong. And with video, their margins continue to decrease. And our intention is to, ultimately, be able to offer to our customers not only our video package, but others' videos packages versus an IP connection and further reduce our costs and -- but improve the profitability of the company that way."

Our capital expenditu",789,"Thank you, Cindi, and good morning. Our second quarter financial results met our expectations. Consolidated revenue grew 2% and AOCF decreased 3% compared to the prior year period. Year-to-date, AOCF is in line with our 2015 outlook. Our capital expenditures during the quarter were $215 million. Free cash flow was $158 million. And we continued to return capital to shareholders with a dividend of $0.15 per share declared on August 6. Overall, we're satisfied with our results.
Turning to operations. The metric we are most enthusiastic about is customer relationships. We gained 5,000 total customers, marking the first quarter of growth in more than 2 years. New technologies and consumer behaviors continue to challenge the big bundle. It's clear that this dynamic with the customer is changing, which is why, today, the overall customer relationship number is more relevant than individual product metrics.
As a leading service provider in the most sophisticated markets in the country, we saw these trends coming. And that is why earlier this year, we were the first and only provider to introduce cord-cutter packages. We recognize that the traditional video bundle does not work for all consumers, so we are offering flexibility, choice and new products to meet their evolving connectivity needs.
We have been positioning the company to address this changing market for several years. Beginning in 2012, Cablevision embarked on a new strategic path to become the premier connectivity company in the New York market. We made substantial investments in technology, tools and people to provide the best experience to our customers. Most importantly, we focused on the reliability and performance of our network. As a result, we more than doubled our broadband capacity, optimized the density and quality of our WiFi experience, enabled a more innovative product set with flexible service offerings and improved our ability to monitor network performance and address issues proactively.
These investments have also made our operations more efficient. We have reduced trouble call truck rolls in half and customer calls by nearly 30% compared to the 2012 levels. This has led to lower costs and improved customer satisfaction. At the same time, we chose to complete -- compete on value not solely on price by taking a more disciplined approach to promotional eligibility and customer credit policies. The changes to the way we do business have resulted in a stronger base of customers who are more satisfied. That has helped decreased our voluntary competitive churn to a nearly 6-year low in the second quarter.
On the product side, we've continue to innovate with our over-the-top offerings and recent speed increase in our core data service. We've also changed the Cablevision employee experience by investing in the development of our people. As a result, we have created a performance-based culture throughout all levels of the company.
I'm going to close my portion of the call with some remarks about Verizon. Our first direct competition with them was in the landline phone business. From a standing start, we took more than 2 million of their residential phone customers, and Cablevision became the dominant phone provider in our market. Verizon has invested billions of dollars in FiOS in the tri-state area. Today, Cablevision serves more than 3.1 million customers, down from 3.3 million customers at our peak in 2008. This is despite FiOS' heavily funded overbuild and deeply discounted pricing as well as the economy and other competitive forces. The impact of FiOS on Cablevision has been minimal. To the extent that we have lost customers to FiOS, we believe that they are usually promotional shoppers in search of the lowest price services. FiOS has almost certainly performed better against the satellite companies than it has against Cablevision. We believe that the Verizon FiOS is an unprofitable business today, and we doubt that they will ever be profitable.
Our strategic plan and investments during the past 3 years have helped to transform Cablevision. Our focus on price discipline has allowed us to grow revenue per customer. Our voluntary churn is down, and we have retained our highest-value customers. In addition today, Cablevision operates the nation's most robust WiFi network while Verizon has no public WiFi. 
Cablevision has changed its culture. We no longer think like a monopoly, and instead, we are strategic, effective and competitive. Our approach to connectivity as the new frontier is gaining traction. This is reflected by our growth in customer relationships this quarter.
The Verizon FiOS effect, if there was ever -- if there ever was one, in our opinion, is over. Our business is healthy, and I'm confident that we'll get even stronger as we move forward.
With that, let me turn the call over to Kristin Dolan for an operational and product update."

The actions we've taken over the last 3 years to reimagine Cablevision have resulted in a faster, more reliable network that excelled at delivering new and sophisticated products and services. Expanding on Jim's update, the improvements we have made have enhanced the customer experience and have reduced costly service-related transactions.  
For example, through proactive monitoring of the network, we're able to identify risk points and intervene before the customer is affected. We triage every trouble call before we roll a truck, identifying the source of the issue and eliminating unnecessary truck rolls. And we've armed our technicians with advanced tools that enable faster repair times and facilitate the goal of first call resolution, solving the problem in our first visit to the home. These initiatives are resonating with our customers and leading to a superior service experience. Accordingly, second quarter trouble call truck rolls decreased 19% as compared with the prior year period. We also experienced a 13% reduction in calls to customer service over the same period.
We implemented a voice of the customer dashboard earlier this year to capture realtime customer feedback and measure net promoter score, a tool widely used by many leading companies to obtain feedback from customers. Responses to this new approach have been strong. We'll harness the insights from these surveys to further improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiencies.
We've also continued to innovate in the product area. In the second quarter, we introduced our cord-cutter packages to serve a new generation that prefers to access video content through the Internet. The cord-cutter offerings provide access to different levels of Internet service at varying price points. They all include a digital antenna at no charge for over-the-air TV. This allows customers to bypass the big bundle and still watch broadcast television as well as over-the-top content. These packages are attracting new interest. They have also allowed us to engage differently with consumers who are looking for options to fit their individual connectivity needs and budgets.
Changes in our acquisition and retention practices helped improve customer activities during the quarter with fewer disconnects and an overall net gain of 5,000 total customers as Jim mentioned. We also experienced the largest quarterly data net additions since the first quarter of 2013.
Turning to our network. Our investments in this area have transformed our high-speed data service into the premier broadband offerings in the New York marketplace. Let me share a few specifics. 
During the last 2 years, average daily usage per customer has increased by 190%. Today, 90% of customer relationships include broadband service. In addition, nearly half of Optimum Online customers currently subscribe to premium speed tiers, and more than half of data customers use 50 gigabits or more per month.
Now let's turn to WiFi. Over the last 3 years, WiFi access and usage has grown exponentially across all metrics. For example, Optimum WiFi access points have increased from less than 50,000 to more than 1.3 million. We rolled out 1 million in home smart routers at no incremental cost to our customers. And monthly WiFi data usage per customer increased from less than 1 gigabyte to more than 6 gigabytes over the same 3-year period. We will continue to make investments in our WiFi networks through the deployment of additional WiFi access points in high-data-usage areas.
Moving on. Other highlights for the quarter include offering HBO Now and Hulu as over-the-top alternatives to our broadband customers, entering into a long-term agreement with ESPN Disney for our data and analytics service, and continuing to work with other MSOs to provide combined insights for set-top box tuning data.
We're pleased with the progress in the first half of 2015, and we'll remain focused on delivering superior service and enhancing our customer relationships.
With that, let me turn to Brian Sweeney to review our financial results."

Video and voice customers declined by 16,000 and 7,000 respectively. We're seeing more favorable customer trends over the last few quarters as a direct result of the numerous actions taken to increase broadband capacity, improve network reliability and enhance customer service. We have also built a stronger customer base with reduced churn and lower voluntary disconnects. Average monthly revenue per customer in the second quarter increased by nearly $6 to $158.52 as compared with the prior year period. This performance was principally driven by recent rate initiatives and our disciplined approach to promotional eligibility and retention policies as well as increased transactional revenue from a pay-per-view event during the quarter.
Second quarter total cable revenue increased by 1.8%, reflecting the increase in revenue per customer, which was partially offset by fewer customers compared to the prior year period and lower advertising.
Cable AOCF decreased 3.4% in the second quarter as compared with the prior year period. This primarily reflects higher programming costs, legal fees, and product development and marketing costs partially offset by the impact of revenue growth and lower customer service-related costs.
I want to provide a little more color on our advertising book [ph]. As compared with 2014, second quarter cable advertising revenue decreased by 11% primarily due to reduced spending with fewer candidate campaigns this year along with lower spending in the financial, gaming and cable programming sectors. The declines in certain categories of our advertising revenue were offset in part by higher local recreational and consumer spending. Notably, the number of addressable advertising campaigns doubled compared to the prior year period, and we are seeing pronounced interest in impression-based sales.
Moving on to CapEx. Cable capital spending in the second quarter was $186 million, a $21 million decrease from the same period in 2014. This primarily reflects lower year-over-year spending on set-top box and modem purchases as well as the timing of certain video-related projects. These declines were partially offset by higher project spending to support broadband and WiFi expansion. We expect increased CapEx spending in the back half of 2015 as we continue to invest in the evolution of our product offerings and ensure a quality service experience.
Moving on to our other business segments. Lightpath second quarter revenue increased 3% and AOCF grew nearly 12% as compared with the prior year period. The revenue increase reflects growth in Ethernet-based services partially offset by the continuing decline in legacy TDM-based services. AOCF growth was also driven by lower expenses.
In our other segment, second quarter revenue decreased 3.7% and the AOCF deficit increased by 4%. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to lower advertising revenue at Newsday partially offset by higher advertising revenue at News 12. The decline in AOCF reflects lower overall net revenues and higher employee-related costs at corporate partially offset by a reduction in operating expenses at Newsday.
Now turning to the company's financial position. The company's second quarter consolidated cash position was $797 million, and net debt was $7.7 billion. We had $1.43 billion undrawn and available under the $1.5 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings as of the end of the second quarter.  As previously mentioned on our May earnings call, during the second quarter, we made a voluntary repayment of our CSC Holdings term loan B facility in the amount of $200 million. This repayment will result in cash interest savings over the term of the facility. 
We remain focused on identifying opportunities to reduce leverage, strengthen our balance sheet and improve our liquidity position. At June 30, the company's consolidated net leverage ratio was 4.1x. The CSC Holdings restricted group bank leverage ratio was 2.7x. 
We have not repurchased shares of Cablevision stock during 2015, and we have approximately $450 million of remaining stock repurchase authorization.
We continue to anticipate that 2015 total company AOCF and CapEx, including incremental expenditures for new product initiatives, will be substantially similar to our 2014 results.

Hi, Jessica. The -- I don't think the sky is falling quite yet. And I think that there's not enough programming weight yet in the Internet, right, and in the over-the-top services that are out there to really entice a mainstream video customer. Right. You're going to see innovators, et cetera, some of the -- I won't call it fringe, but some of the -- not mainstream video watchers start to adopt the over-the-top. But the -- I do think eventually though that there will be enough of -- enough programming for over-the-top to be competitive with the traditional video bundle. The -- but this is not something that I think is going to happen over a very short period of time. The consumers have become very, very comfortable with the amount of choice that cable offers. And if you want to have a very, very wide variety of choice, so the bundle actually is somewhat still efficient, that the -- it's essentially buying the entire magazine stand even though you're going to -- because you want the choice of every magazine in there, but you only look at maybe several a day or whatever. But you don't want to give up your access to the whole magazine stand. The consumers have gotten very used to that, but it's pricey. And so the -- as you continue to see that price push up, which inevitably you will because the programmers are raising their rates on -- obviously, on a regular basis, particularly the broadcasters who see it as a bit of a pot of gold. That will drive the people who are more price-sensitive into alternatives. And Internet is obviously -- IP over-the-top is starting to become a real alternative. And then with -- that is why we introduced the cord-cutter package with the digital antenna because the digital antenna essentially takes the programming bundle up to the point where it is somewhat competitive with a traditional bundle and at a price that's affordable. So I think it's right for you to watch what happens with that, but I don't think that we're going to see a landslide of consumers move from one to the other. And my own prediction is that it will be at least 5 years for 10% of the market to move and 10 years for 30% of the market to move. How's that for an answer?"

The -- I really see Cablevision having, over the last 3 years, focused very heavily on our culture and our attitude here about how we do business. And the -- we saw ourselves back 3, 4 years ago as really being a sort of operating in the form of a classic cable company, which is really a monopoly. I know that some in the industry don't like to call themselves that, but if you're the only provider, that sort of makes you the monopoly. We're clearly not the only provider in our marketplace, and it was time for us to recognize that. But just recognizing it didn't -- doesn't change you overnight. It's taken us a good 3.5 years to get ourselves in a position where we are truly effective competitors and we addressed the realities of the marketplace. What I said today is a reflection of Cablevision's strength, and I think the numbers bear that out quite nicely, that the -- and I expect that we will get only stronger as a competitor. And so that's really the basis of my comments on that. Other than that, I think we do find it at least a little annoying over here that Verizon continues to tout its FiOS product as being successful when we know very well that, that is definitely not the case, at least in our footprint. And they refuse to break out their numbers, so they just sit there and beat their chests saying, yes, I am. Yes, I am, and everything that we see says, no, they aren't. So there's a little bit of that in there. The second part of your question was on the bundle and the erosion of the bundle, and the -- I do see our ability actually to make up for loss of video customers. But you should understand that video customers actually are not the most valuable customers. By far and away, data customers are the most valuable customers at a ratio here of close to 7:1, that they -- and so as we continue to improve our ability to offer connectivity to our customers, I do expect that our suite of offerings to them will increase, that there'll be more revenue opportunities in there for specialized use as well as expanded use. And use, by the way, continues to grow exponentially. And so the outlook for data is very strong. And with video, their margins continue to decrease. And our intention is to, ultimately, be able to offer to our customers not only our video package, but others' videos packages versus an IP connection and further reduce our costs and -- but improve the profitability of the company that way."

But remember, if you heard earlier, I mean, the video product itself is -- our biggest concern is that the customer have available to them a video product that they like at a price that they can afford. And so whether they get that through our big bundle or whether they get that through our cord-cutter package, which allows them to get, for instance, CBS for free, to us, what's most important is that they're satisfied.

But other than that, I don't really -- we don't have a problem with it because it's not -- for us, it's not about the -- capturing the video customer. It's about connectivity.

Consolidated revenue grew 2% and AOCF decreased 3% compared to the prior year period. Year-to-date, AOCF is in line with our 2015 outlook. Our capital expenditures during the quarter were $215 million. Free cash flow was $158 million. And we continued to return capital to shareholders with a dividend of $0.15 per share declared on August 6. Overall, we're satisfied with our results.
Turning to operations. The metric we are most enthusiastic about is customer relationships. We gained 5,000 total customers, marking the first quarter of growth in more than 2 years. New technologies and consumer behaviors continue to challenge the big bundle. It's clear that this dynamic with the customer is changing, which is why, today, the overall customer relationship number is more relevant than individual product metrics.
As a leading service provider in the most sophisticated markets in the country, we saw these trends coming. And that is why earlier this year, we were the first and only provider to introduce cord-cutter packages. We recognize that the traditional video bundle does not work for all consumers, so we are offering flexibility, choice and new products to meet their evolving connectivity needs.
We have been positioning the company to address this changing market for several years. Beginning in 2012, Cablevision embarked on a new strategic path to become the premier connectivity company in the New York market. We made substantial investments in technology, tools and people to provide the best experience to our customers. Most importantly, we focused on the reliability and performance of our network. As a result, we more than doubled our broadband capacity, optimized the density and quality of our WiFi experience, enabled a more innovative product set with flexible service offerings and improved our ability to monitor network performance and address issues proactively.
These investments have also made our operations more efficient. We have reduced trouble call truck rolls in half and customer calls by nearly 30% compared to the 2012 levels. This has led to lower costs and improved customer satisfaction. At the same time, we chose to complete -- compete on value not solely on price by taking a more disciplined approach to promotional eligibility and customer credit policies. The changes to the way we do business have resulted in a stronger base of customers who are more satisfied. That has helped decrease our voluntary competitive churn to a nearly 6-year low in the second quarter.
On the product side, we've continue to innovate with our over-the-top offerings and recent speed increase in our core data service. We've also changed the Cablevision employee experience by investing in the development of our people. As a result, we have created a performance-based culture throughout all levels of the company.
I'm going to close my portion of the call with some remarks about Verizon. Our first direct competition with them was in the landline phone business. From a standing start, we took more than 2 million of their residential phone customers, and Cablevision became the dominant phone provider in our market. Verizon has invested billions of dollars in FiOS in the tri-state area. Today, Cablevision serves more than 3.1 million customers, down from 3.3 million customers at our peak in 2008. This is despite FiOS' heavily funded overbuild and deeply discounted pricing as well as the economy and other competitive forces. The impact of FiOS on Cablevision has been minimal. To the extent that we have lost customers to FiOS, we believe that they are usually promotional shoppers in search of the lowest price services. FiOS has almost certainly performed better against the satellite companies than it has against Cablevision. We believe that the Verizon FiOS is an unprofitable business today, and we doubt that they will ever be profitable.
Our strategic plan and investments during the past 3 years have helped to transform Cablevision. Our focus on price discipline has allowed us to grow revenue per customer. Our voluntary churn is down, and we have retained our highest-value customers. In addition today, Cablevision operates the nation's most robust WiFi network while Verizon has no public WiFi. 
Cablevision has changed its culture. We no longer think like a monopoly, and instead, we are strategic, effective and competitive. Our approach to connectivity as the new frontier is gaining traction. This is reflected by our growth in customer relationships this quarter.
The Verizon FiOS effect, if there was ever -- if there ever was one, in our opinion, is over. Our business is healthy, and I'm confident that we'll get even stronger as we move forward.
With that, let me turn the call over to Kristin Dolan for an operational and product update."
25933,306644153,861859,"Cablevision Systems Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2015",2015-08-07,"Earnings Calls","Altice USA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. The actions we've taken over the last 3 years to reimagine Cablevision have resulted in a faster, more reliable network that excels at delivering new and sophisticated products and services.

The actions we've taken over the last 3 years to reimagine Cablevision have resulted in a faster, more reliable network that excels at delivering new and sophisticated products and services. Expanding on Jim's update, the improvements we have made have enhanced the customer experience and have reduced costly service-related transactions.  
For example, through proactive monitoring of the network, we're able to identify risk points and intervene before the customer is affected. We triage every trouble call before we roll a truck, identifying the source of the issue and eliminating unnecessary truck rolls. And we've armed our technicians with advanced tools that enable faster repair times and facilitate the goal of first call resolution, solving the problem in our first visit to the home. These initiatives are resonating with our customers and leading to a superior service experience. Accordingly, second quarter trouble call truck rolls decreased 19% as compared with the prior year period. We also experienced a 13% reduction in calls to customer service over the same period.
We implemented a voice of the customer dashboard earlier this year to capture realtime customer feedback and measure net promoter score, a tool widely used by many leading companies to obtain feedback from customers. Responses to this new approach have been strong. We'll harness the insights from these surveys to further improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiencies.
We've also continued to innovate in the product area. In the second quarter, we introduced our cord-cutter packages to serve a new generation that prefers to access video content through the Internet. The cord-cutter offerings provide access to different levels of Internet service at varying price points. They all include a digital antenna at no charge for over-the-air TV. This allows customers to bypass the big bundle and still watch broadcast television as well as over-the-top content. These packages are attracting new interest. They have also allowed us to engage differently with consumers who are looking for options to fit their individual connectivity needs and budgets.
Changes in our acquisition and retention practices helped improve customer activities during the quarter with fewer disconnects and an overall net gain of 5,000 total customers as Jim mentioned. We also experienced the largest quarterly data net additions since the first quarter of 2013.
Turning to our network. Our investments in this area have transformed our high-speed data service into the premier broadband offerings in the New York marketplace. Let me share a few statistics. 
During the last 2 years, average data usage per customer has increased by 190%. Today, 90% of customer relationships include broadband service. In addition, nearly half of Optimum Online customers currently subscribe to premium speed tiers, and more than half of data customers use 50 gigabits or more per month.
Now let's turn to WiFi. Over the last 3 years, WiFi access and usage has grown exponentially across all metrics. For example, Optimum WiFi access points have increased from less than 50,000 to more than 1.3 million. We rolled out 1 million in home smart routers at no incremental cost to our customers. And monthly WiFi data usage per customer increased from less than 1 gigabyte to more than 6 gigabytes over the same 3-year period. We will continue to make investments in our WiFi networks through the deployment of additional WiFi access points in high-data-usage areas.
Moving on. Other highlights for the quarter include offering HBO Now and Hulu as over-the-top alternatives to our broadband customers, entering into a long-term agreement with ESPN Disney for our data and analytics service, and continuing to work with other MSOs to provide combined insights from set-top box tuning data.
We're pleased with the progress in the first half of 2015, and we'll remain focused on delivering superior service and enhancing our customer relationships.
With that, let me turn to Brian Sweeney to review our financial results."

Video and voice customers declined by 16,000 and 7,000 respectively. We're seeing more favorable customer trends over the last few quarters as a direct result of the numerous actions taken to increase broadband capacity, improve network reliability and enhance customer service. We have also built a stronger customer base with reduced churn and lower voluntary disconnects. Average monthly revenue per customer in the second quarter increased by nearly $6 to $158.52 as compared with the prior year period. This performance was principally driven by recent rate initiatives and our disciplined approach to promotional eligibility and retention policies as well as increased transactional revenue from a pay-per-view event during the quarter.
Second quarter total cable revenue increased by 1.8%, reflecting the increase in revenue per customer, which was partially offset by fewer customers compared to the prior year period and lower advertising.
Cable AOCF decreased 3.4% in the second quarter as compared with the prior year period. This primarily reflects higher programming costs, legal fees, and product development and marketing costs partially offset by the impact of revenue growth and lower customer service-related costs.
I want to provide a little more color on our advertising book [ph]. As compared with 2014, second quarter cable advertising revenue decreased by 11% primarily due to reduced political spending with fewer candidate campaigns this year along with lower spending in the financial, gaming and cable programming sectors. The declines in certain categories of our advertising revenue were offset in part by higher local recreational and consumer spending. Notably, the number of addressable advertising campaigns doubled compared to the prior year period, and we are seeing pronounced interest in impression-based sales.
Moving on to CapEx. Cable capital spending in the second quarter was $186 million, a $21 million decrease from the same period in 2014. This primarily reflects lower year-over-year spending on set-top box and modem purchases as well as the timing of certain video-related projects. These declines were partially offset by higher project spending to support broadband and WiFi expansion. We expect increased CapEx spending in the back half of 2015 as we continue to invest in the evolution of our product offerings and ensure a quality service experience.
Moving on to our other business segments. Lightpath second quarter revenue increased 3% and AOCF grew nearly 12% as compared with the prior year period. The revenue increase reflects growth in Ethernet-based services partially offset by the continuing decline in legacy TDM-based services. AOCF growth was also driven by lower expenses.
In our other segment, second quarter revenue decreased 3.7% and the AOCF deficit increased by 4%. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to lower advertising revenue at Newsday partially offset by higher advertising revenue at News 12. The decline in AOCF reflects lower overall net revenues and higher employee-related costs at corporate partially offset by a reduction in operating expenses at Newsday.
Now turning to the company's financial position. The company's second quarter consolidated cash position was $797 million, and net debt was $7.7 billion. We had $1.43 billion undrawn and available under the $1.5 billion revolving credit facility at CSC Holdings as of the end of the second quarter.  As previously mentioned on our May earnings call, during the second quarter, we made a voluntary repayment of our CSC Holdings term loan B facility in the amount of $200 million. This repayment will result in cash interest savings over the term of the facility. 
We remain focused on identifying opportunities to reduce leverage, strengthen our balance sheet and improve our liquidity position. At June 30, the company's consolidated net leverage ratio was 4.1x. The CSC Holdings restricted group bank leverage ratio was 2.7x. 
We have not repurchased shares of Cablevision stock during 2015, and we have approximately $450 million of remaining stock repurchase authorization.
We continue to anticipate that 2015 total company AOCF and CapEx, including incremental expenditures for new product initiatives, will be substantially similar to our 2014 results.

Hi, Jessica. The -- I don't think the sky is falling quite yet. And I think that there's not enough programming weight yet in the Internet, right, and in the over-the-top services that are out there to really entice a mainstream video customer. Right. You're going to see innovators, et cetera, some of the -- I won't call it fringe, but some of the -- not mainstream video watchers start to adopt the over-the-top. But the -- I do think eventually though that there will be enough of -- enough programming for over-the-top to be competitive with the traditional video bundle. The -- but this is not something that I think is going to happen over a very short period of time. The consumers have become very, very comfortable with the amount of choice that cable offers. And if you want to have a very, very wide variety of choice, so the bundle actually is somewhat still efficient, that the -- it's essentially buying the entire magazine stand even though you're going to -- because you want the choice of every magazine in there, but you only look at maybe several a day or whatever. But you don't want to give up your access to the whole magazine stand. The consumers have gotten very used to that, but it's pricey. And so the -- as you continue to see that price push up, which inevitably you will because the programmers are raising their rates on -- obviously, on a regular basis, particularly the broadcasters who see it as a bit of a pot of gold. That will drive the people who are more price-sensitive into alternatives. And Internet is obviously -- IP over-the-top is starting to become a real alternative. And then with -- that is why we introduced the cord-cutter package with the digital antenna because the digital antenna essentially takes the programming bundle up to the point where it is somewhat competitive with a traditional bundle and at a price that's affordable. So I think it's right for you to watch what happens with that, but I don't think that we're going to see a landslide of consumers move from one to the other. And my own prediction is that it will be at least 5 years for 10% of the market to move and 10 years for 30% of the market to move. How's that for an answer?"

The -- I really see Cablevision having, over the last 3 years, focused very heavily on our culture and our attitude here about how we do business. And the -- we saw ourselves back 3, 4 years ago as really being a sort of operating in the form of a classic cable company, which is really a monopoly. I know that some in the industry don't like to call themselves that, but if you're the only provider, that sort of makes you the monopoly. We're clearly not the only provider in our marketplace, and it was time for us to recognize that. But just recognizing it didn't -- doesn't change you overnight. It's taken us a good 3.5 years to get ourselves in a position where we are truly effective competitors and we addressed the realities of the marketplace. What I said today is a reflection of Cablevision's strength, and I think the numbers bear that out quite nicely, that the -- and I expect that we will get only stronger as a competitor. And so that's really the basis of my comments on that. Other than that, I think we do find it at least a little annoying over here that Verizon continues to tout its FiOS product as being successful when we know very well that, that is definitely not the case, at least in our footprint. And they refuse to break out their numbers, so they just sit there and beat their chests saying, yes, I am. Yes, I am, and everything that we see says, no, they aren't. So there's a little bit of that in there. The second part of your question was on the bundle and the erosion of the bundle, and the -- I do see our ability actually to make up for loss of video customers. But you should understand that video customers actually are not the most valuable customers. By far and away, data customers are the most valuable customers at a ratio here of close to 7:1, that they -- and so as we continue to improve our ability to offer connectivity to our customers, I do expect that our suite of offerings to them will increase, that there'll be more revenue opportunities in there for specialized use as well as expanded use. And use, by the way, continues to grow exponentially. And so the outlook for data is very strong. And with video, their margins continue to decrease. And our intention is to, ultimately, be able to offer to our customers not only our video package, but others' videos packages versus an IP connection and further reduce our costs and -- but improve the profitability of the company that way."

And we don't believe that our -- anywhere in our task is directing the customer one way or another, that the -- so when CBS comes out with, I don't know, an over-the-top package, et cetera, right, that's more choice for our customer, right. They're still going to use our service to get it. And the -- so we're -- we really don't have that much difficulty with that, and there are plenty of others that are doing over-the-top services, too. But remember, if you heard earlier, I mean, the video product itself is -- our biggest concern is that the customer have available to them a video product that they like at a price that they can afford. And so whether they get that through our big bundle or whether they get that through our cord-cutter package, which allows them to get, for instance, CBS for free, to us, what's most important is that they're satisfied. And we focus on providing the best connectivity to them so they can access all of those products. But we don't see ourselves as trying to stop the flow of over-the-top programming to our customers. That isn't something that we're very interested in doing. And what other part of your -- what was the other part of your question?"

The -- they're more likely -- they're, for sure, going to be a data subscriber because they're going to need the connectivity, especially for that kind of programming, right. And they could very well have the digital antenna, et cetera. And they're still our customer and that's what we want. Remember, it's the -- it's on a per-customer basis that ESPN charges. So the -- if they're -- as long as they're pricing -- if they underprice us and go to the consumer with a lesser price than what they're getting from us -- which by the way, I can't imagine why they would do that the -- because they're just decreasing their overall revenue, right. The -- but if they did that, I could see us possibly going back to them and saying, hey look, we need to at least even up here. But other than that, I don't really -- we don't have a problem with it because it's not -- for us, it's not about the -- capturing the video customer. It's about connectivity. And we ultimately expect that customers will be getting -- a good portion of our customers will be getting their video product from over-the-top. It may take 5 to 10 years, but that is the way things are going to happen. And we think that what we really want the customer to think is that the best way to get that, the very best way to get that is with Cablevision. We're using our connectivity product."
