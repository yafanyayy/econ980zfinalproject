We are very happy to top off a great year with solid fourth quarter financial results and operating metrics. Our strong portfolio fundamentals were led by same-site NOI exceeding 4% for the second straight quarter and reaching our highest portfolio occupancy since early 2008. Small shop occupancy also showed a sharp increase as local stores and small national retailers recover from the recession and proceed with their expansion plans. While retailers, in general, achieved mixed results in 2014, discounters and service-oriented tenants, such as health clubs and restaurants, continued their aggressive growth in the shrinking retail space. As a result, effective rents are climbing in our portfolio and across the entire open-air shopping center sector. Lower gas prices, accelerating household formation and continued limited development activity, all bode well for the shopping center industry fundamentals in 2015. The omni-channel sales approach is increasingly being embraced n by national retailers' success dependent on brick-and-mortar stores, providing market presence, product showrooms and fulfillment capabilities. Amazon and many other Internet retailers will indeed be leasing retail space in the coming years. Glenn and Conor will cover many of the financial and operating specifics in their comments today. But I would like to highlight several prominent successes. 
First, we have now essentially completed our exit from Latin America with favorable cap rates somewhat offset by declining currency exchange rates. Second, after lengthy negotiations, we've reached agreement, and on Monday, closed and acquired the remaining 2/3 ownership of the Kimco Blackstone portfolio of 39 high-quality retail properties. And finally, early last week, Kimco, together with its consortium partners led by Cerberus, completed the acquisition and merger of Safeway with Albertson and various other prominent grocers, including Jewel, ACME and United Supermarkets, comprising more than 2,200 stores. Kimco will hold slightly less than 10% of the merged operating companies and related real estate, approximately 50% of which is owned real estate. 
As outlined in our earnings release, we've also substantially upgraded our U.S. portfolio, the disposition of 91 shopping centers in 2014, while also acquiring 60 high-quality properties during the same period. While our recycling and upgrading strategy is not unique, the scale of our actions in 2014 exceeded our peers, and the resulting improved demographics and rent metrics of our portfolio are substantial, noteworthy and promised to deliver excellent future growth. 
Looking at our Canadian operations and responding to related inquiries, our occupancy remains very strong at 96%, and we are fortunate to have the full guarantee of Target's U.S. parent for all 9 of our Target stores in Canada. Canadian Tire, Costco, Walmart, Home Depot and Metro grocery stores have all expressed interest in some of our Target locations, and it is quite possible that we will end up with stronger tenants and a significant financial settlement from Target U.S.A. Separately, while the lower Canadian Dollar does impact property level NOI, we estimate $0.02 for 2015 at current levels. Our initial investment in Canada remains hedged through Canadian dollar mortgages on the individual properties and our Canadian dollar-denominated bonds. In addition, our local operating partners continue to do an excellent job leasing and managing the properties. Property values and prices also remain at historic high levels in Canada due to strong demand from pension funds and other institutional investors. During the quarter, as Glenn will know, we monetized one more Canadian preferred equity investment at a substantial gain. Overall and moving forward across our entire portfolio, it is clear that our emphasis will be on investing capital in our own properties through redevelopment and expansions, complemented with several selective new ground-up projects. Conor will discuss in detail these plans, but we are pleased with our progress in growing this pipeline and the associated accretive economics. 
The third-party acquisition market for high-quality properties is heated and very competitive. As a result, wherever possible, we continue to purchase the equity interests of our institutional partners when they choose to monitor their -- monetize their investments. In these situations, we have a distinct advantage due to our knowledge and long-term management of the asset, coupled with the potential savings in terms of transfer taxes, brokerage fees and mortgage assumption costs. Given the portfolio upgrade we have completed to date and improving industry fundamentals, we feel very positive about 2015. Now I'd like to turn to Glenn and Conor with Milton batting clean-up as usual."

Our theme from December 2014 Investor Day was TSR Plus: Transformation, Simplification, Redevelopment and activity from our plus business. We have successfully executed on all these initiatives throughout the year, and we are proud that our TSR plus strategy delivered a TSR shareholder return of 32.4% for 2014. 
Now for some detail on our fourth quarter and full year results and some additional color on our 2015 guidance range. As we reported last night, [indiscernible] NOI and FFO per diluted share, which represents the official definition, was $0.38 for the fourth quarter, which includes $0.03 per share of transactional income related to the monetization of several preferred equity interests in the U.S. and Canada. For the full year, headline FFO per diluted share was $1.45, a 7.4% increase as compared to $1.35 per share from 2013. Our FFO as adjusted or recurring FFO, which excludes nonoperating impairments and transactional income and expense, was $0.35 per diluted share for the fourth quarter, a 6.1% increase compared to last year and brings the full year to $1.40 per share, a 5.3% increase over the 2013 level of $1.33 per share and achieving the high end of our guidance range. It's important to note that we accomplished this despite the $0.05 per share dilutive impact of disposing of higher cap rate assets, including a substantial portion of our assets in Mexico and many nonstrategic U.S. assets. Our strong performance is a direct result of the significant portfolio transformation, which is delivering solid operating metrics, including fourth quarter U.S. same-site NOI growth of 4.3%, bringing the full year U.S. same-site NOI growth to 3.3%. Over 70% of the NOI growth is attributable to a minimum rent increases. Our combined same-site NOI growth, which includes our Canadian operations was 4% for the fourth quarter and 3.3% as well for the full year, excluding the negative impact of currency of 90 basis points and 80 points, respectively. Occupancy is approaching 96%, and our leasing spreads were strong with full year leasing spreads of 19.5% and 6.3% from renewals and options, bring combined leasing spreads to 8.8% for 2014. We continue to execute on the simplification part of our strategy. During the fourth quarter, we acquired 7 assets from our joint venture with Big and sold 8 other properties from this joint venture. We also sold 23 assets in Mexico and 2 assets in Peru for a total of $161 million and have now substantially liquidated our investment in both countries. As previously mentioned, upon substantial liquidation of upon investment in a foreign country, the impact of foreign currency translation is recognized in earnings. As such, we recognize the non-FFO charge of $134.3 million, which was applied against the respective gains and losses on the assets sold. This is substantially offset with non-FFO gains of $107.8 million recognized during the quarter, from the sale of 66 operating properties, so generating total proceeds of approximately $420 million. In addition, as Dave mentioned, we closed this week against the previously announced $925 million transaction to acquire the remaining 2/3 interest of our joint venture with Blackstone. The 39 properties in debenture are now wholly owned.
With regard to our balance sheet. We finished the year with solid debt metrics with net debt to occurring EBITDA of 5.5x and fixed charge coverage of 3.2x. These strong levels, coupled with over $1.7 billion of immediate liquidity from the availability on our credit facility and cash on hand, provided us the capacity to fund the Blackstone JV buyout. Subsequent to year-end, we refinanced our $400 million term loan with a new $650 million term loan priced at LIBOR plus 95 basis points, among the lowest borrowing spread in the REIT industry. This term loan has initial term of 2 years and 3 one-year extension options at our option with a final maturity date in 2020, providing us maximum flexibility. Our debt maturities for 2015 are very manageable with less than $500 million of maturities and a significant portion not due until the latter part of 2015. With an average rate of 5.2% on the maturing debt, we view this as an excellent opportunity to reduce our cost of capital. Now for some more color on the guidance for 2015. As we discussed in our last earnings call, NAREIT has been strongly advocating that all reporting companies provide guidance in accordance with the official Navy FFO definition as part of an effort to have an industry-wide consistency. As such, we are in introducing an initial 2015 FFO per diluted share guidance range of $1.45 to $1.53 in accordance with the NAREIT request. Our initial 2015 FFO as adjusted per share guidance range is $1.42 to $1.44. The level of growth takes into account the dilutive impact of $0.12 associated with the significant capital recycling and joint venture buyout executed during 2014. We view 2015 as a bridge year where we have absorbed the impact of our transpiration all program in order to position the company long-term earnings growth in 2016 and beyond. In addition, the guidance considers the investments made through land parcels for future developments totaling over $100 million and our plus business investment in our SUPERVALU and Safeway positions, which are currently non-earning but should provide excellent growth potential in the future. Several of the underlying assumptions used to develop the guidance range included overall increase in U.S. occupancy of 25 to 50 basis points, U.S. same property NOI growth of 3% to 3.5%, acquisitions of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, which includes the $925 million from the recently closed buyout of Blackstone, and dispositions of $550 million to $750 million. In addition, the guidance range includes a $0.02 per share negative impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on our Canadian-denominated to close. The headline guidance range include net transactional income of $20 million to $38 million, which is excluded from our FFO as adjusted. The net transactional income includes acquisition costs of $6 million. The guidance range is sensitive to timing of acquisition, dispositions, redevelopments coming online, lease-up and financing initiatives. Our 2015 plan strongly supports our recently increased common dividend level of $0.24 per quarter, which equates to an FFO payout ratio in the mid-60s percent range, one of the lowest in the industry. Now I'll turn it over to Conor."

Today, I'll give portfolio metrics, a quick update on acquisitions and distributions and followed by an update on redevelopment. The fourth quarter and full year results reflect our best efforts to reposition the portfolio to a vibrant collection of high-quality, high-growth assets, located in densely Metro market that has the highest growth, population, wages and employment. We are positioned to give our shareholders unmatched safety in terms of tenant and geographic diversity alongside table and recurring growth. The U.S. portfolio achieved an increase in occupancy of 80 basis points provided for the year to end at 95.7%. The occupancy gains were primarily driven by increase in small shop demand as the U.S. small shop occupancy rose 280 basis points from the beginning of the year to finish at 88% pro-rata, an increase of 100 basis points from the prior quarter. Resurges in some small shop leasing continue as this quarter we completed 66% of our small shop deals with local operators. The 3 major categories that make up the bulk of our small shop leasing include personal care services, restaurants and medical offices. Anchor occupancy also came 10 basis points pro-rata over prior quarter to finish at 98.3%. We continue leads spreads continued to show the strong demand for space by resulting combined leasing spreads of 9.4% in the quarter the U.S. same-site NOI is 4.3% for the quarter was a strong result driven by significant rent commencement, contractual rent increases and redevelopment coming online. Competition in our key markets for acquisitions continues to escalate with no end of capital chasing high-quality real estate. Acquisitions for the fourth quarter were geared towards off-market value-added projects where we were able to leverage our strengths. Preowned village of Kroger and an outlet Atlanta suburb has expiring below market Kmart pleased that we believe that significant redevelopment potential. In addition, we have acquired 4 development parcels, replan to build a school with these long-term, strong and assets to create shareholder value. One in the whole field development and Pennsylvania that is now under construction and located on the mainline where we continue to expand our presence, alongside our flagship Suburban Square asset. The Christiana Delaware was purchased from Sears and adjacent to GDP's Christiana Mall where retailers can take advantage of a tax-free environment and a site will take advantage of the significant frontage I-95. In Florida, the beach development site sits adjacent to our dominant Oakwood Plaza. The nearly 3 miles of portage along I-95 that comprise these 2 properties will create a dynamic and signature asset. Finally, we were able to acquire a development parcel in Houston, Texas, the Woodlands and the new Exxon Mobil Campus that fronts the new Grand Parkway. The location of this asset is what we call a whole in the donut for retailers, and they're eager to capture this new popular growth absolutely and highly educated market. Notwithstanding the current wildlife volatility, our project has generated retail interest at an early stage, and we expect to execute lease an average throughout 2015. These 4 projects amounts projected growth cost of $469 million with targeted returns between 7% and 8%, a measured development approach where we can take advantage of our local expertise, we'll enable us to build upon our grow redevelopment pipeline. For 2014 we plan to leverage our industry-leading relationships to continue to source off market transactions. A good example is the recently announced consolidation of the Blackstone JV. In line with our stated strategy to simplify the, business and further transform our portfolio, this transaction will significantly improve the wholly-owned asset base at Kimco and add a few notable redevelopment projects. 
Turning to dispositions. In the fourth quarter, we sold 41 properties, 29 wholly-owned and 12 joint venture for a pro-rata sharing of the sales of $325 million. Pricing for the Tier 2 assets continued to show improved strength as private and public capital chased deals to the very low interest environment. For the year, we completed the sales of 91 U.S. shopping centers for a gross sales price of $1 billion, including $249 million of mortgage debt. The company's pro-rata share from the sales were $710 million and the blended cap rate on our dispositions for the year was 7.5%. We believe we are the sweet spot and are targeting another $600 million for 2015 to effectively complete the transformation of the portfolio by exiting our low growth assets and secondary markets. Our redevelopment program continues to produce significant results. Every asset we own goes through a methodical review process that takes into account all opportunities, including current and future, retail and non-retail, so we leave no stone unturned to help create long-term shareholder value. Our real estate is in demand not only from our normal Rolodex expanding retailers but are also new sources winning specialty grocers, outlet concepts, European retailers and developments of apartments, medical offices and hotels. For the year, we completed 34 projects with a total gross cost of $68 million with an ROI of 13.9%. These projects continue to improve net asset value and contributed 90 basis points to our same-site NOI this year. As you look to 2015, we target gross projects of $200 million with an ROI of 8% to 10%. We have made significant progress this year. But there is still work to be done as we work and positioned ourselves as best-in-class capital. In in this next cycle, it will be imperative for us to focus on the capacity to sustain significant interest growth by the interest-rate environment shift as we near our all-time high in occupancy, we look to out redevelopment and development pipeline to generate significant recurring income growth. The demand for space continues to outpace supply, and as we enter into 2015, we are cautiously optimistic due to the fundamental drivers of our industry employment growth, cheap gas price and consumer confidence, all combined to form a powerful shopping base in the U.S. that is ready to ramp-up consumption and especially for off price and essential goods. Our retailer services grew continues to provide us with invaluable information and recently found this dramatic fall in gas prices has been a boom for our grocery concepts. We completed our strategic initiative of increasing our percentage of ABR from gross rate anchorage properties from 58% to over 65%, and we'll continue to push this initiative in 2015. Our asset class is now completing at a higher level as we have noticed many of our retailers straddle the line between open-air shopping centers and the enclosed mall world have now been outperforming in the open air environment. Combining the favorable supply and demand balance in addition to the safety of U.S. investments, provides a nice runway of growth ahead forward owning well located open-air centers. As we look to 2015, our strategic goals remain focused on completing our transformation, simplification and expanding our redevelopment efforts include strategic ground-up developments. And now, I will turn it over to Milton for his closing remarks"

I also believe that cap rates will continue to decline. The spread between the 10-year treasury rate and cap rates should be narrower. U.S. has the best legal system in the world for property rights. Global investors and pension funds are increasing their allocation to U.S. real estate, which should create further demand and the $1 is getting much more respect. At Kimco over the past year, we've invested in future growth of the company. These investments include the Blackstone purchase, a myriad of redevelopment projects, and a development site in Florida, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Texas.

So we do believe that they're going to the strategy that they're approved by the FTC that will then clarifies what their needs are going forward. But we believe this is a nice opportunity for us to continue to add specialty grocers to our shopping centers where we can increase our percentage of ADRs from a grocery component. And there's plenty of demand from all the TJX concepts, Ross, Bed Bath & Beyond concepts. If you think about it, these are boxes that once you add a dynamic retailer that'll cause more traffic, it should have a trickle-down effect that'll impact and enhance the residual shopping center. So we look at it as a net positive. But at the end of the day, as a landlord, you're always said that the another retailer combined because its one left that is going to be bidding on that space when it becomes available. So even though it's probably necessary for that sector, we do like to think the more retailer, the better for us."

Well, when they titled it August the came to fruition, Sears the did -- no longer wanted to participate in the ground-up development process because of the cash involved.

It's in a perfect location where if you look at the spacing from our all of our retailers, is really positioned nicely to take advantage of only the new parkway that's going to be completed, but it also has the new Exxon Mobil compost coming out of the ground and it's a very affluent, very highly educated population in Houston. And I think we'll really drive significant retail interest, and we've already been seeing more demand, even from retailers that have been dormant for a number of years, are looking at this site as a real opportunity to get a piece of this new development. And then Dany Eisen is an adjacent site next to our 100% beached Oak Ridge Plaza. This is a Fort Lauderdale effort really that we'll own four-port Lauderdale airport all the way down to Hollywood, Florida. So I-95 will be controlled by us really for 3 miles. And we think we have significant synergies by controlling the adjacent parcel and looking at doing complementary uses that we believe will really enhance our existing position and be a signature asset for us going forward. So each of those ground-up developments have a very specific story, and that's why we believe it's a prudent time to step back into the ground-up development process because we we've been very reluctant that paying for signature assets.

And also, given what prior markets just agree with here Sears, I just wonder, Conor, when you look at your Kmart boxes and the possibility for redevelopment, re-tenanting, are you seeing off-price because of this competitive pressure off-price footprints expanding or not? And as you think about the redevelopment let's say a theoretical redevelopment of a Kmart boxes, would be your preference to do a multi-tenant approach in that box? Or would you be more -- would you just be as happy to replace them with a single tenant?"

It really depends on the discount that you're talking about. for example, is going a little bit larger than, say, your closing from They're looking for closer to 30,000 to 40,000 square feet. Now that being said because the competition is so significant to get into certain assets, they're willing to go down to 20,000 to 25,000 square feet. So we still continue to see that range of 20,000 to 30,000 of square feet being the sweet spot for the off-price discounter. TJX has gone a little bit smaller from 25,000 to 22,000. Ross continues to be right around the square footage. But we think that that's really the sweet spot for the discounter today as they try and figure out how to get the most sales out of their box and continue to refine their business model. And as for Kmart redevelopments, it really depends on the asset, where it's located, what's the best use for the surrounding community and what's really going to drive the most sales for that shopping center. If you got a single box Kmart that you're redeveloping, my preference is typically to probably chop it up and do a number of different retailers because then you can really enhance the surrounding retailer. The retail that -- and so if you're adding grocery concepts to it, your small shops and pick up on significant traffic increase. And again, the Junior anchor space today is probably the most active in terms of our industry. And when we look at Kmart boxes, the demand for the juniors are really what's driving the rents and really what's driving the growth there. So for us, it's been a mix. But I would say that going forward, it'll still be drawn by a lot of junior box interest."

But these are generally smaller projects and still just a fraction of the number of shopping centers that were codeveloped. At the peak, we were developing 2,000 shopping centers a year in the United States. And so maybe it's gone from 100 to a couple of hundred or 300 now but it's still a small fraction. And nobody, to my knowledge, is doing these million square-foot lifestyle all-spec centers that take years to get the entitlements. So I think the inventory is going to be limited. But certainly, there has been a turning point, and the economics are now justifying new construction in selected markets."

We are very happy to top off a great year with solid fourth quarter financial results and operating metrics. Our strong portfolio fundamentals were led by same-site NOI growth exceeding 4% for the second straight quarter and reaching our highest portfolio occupancy since early 2008. Small shop occupancy also showed a sharp increase as local stores and small national retailers recover from the recession and proceed with their expansion plans. 
While retailers, in general, achieved mixed results in 2014, discounters and service-oriented tenants, such as health clubs and restaurants, continued their aggressive growth in the face of a shrinking inventory of retail space. As a result, effective rents are climbing in our portfolio and across the entire open-air shopping center sector. 
Lower gas prices, accelerating household formation and continued limited development activity all bode well for the shopping center industry fundamentals in 2015. The omni-channel sales approach is increasingly being embraced by national retailers, with e-commerce success dependent on brick-and-mortar stores providing market presence, product showrooms and fulfillment capabilities. 
Amazon and many other Internet retailers will indeed be leasing retail space in the coming years. Glenn and Conor will cover many of the financial and operating specifics in their comments today. But I would like to highlight several prominent successes. 
First, we have now essentially completed our exit from Latin America with favorable cap rates somewhat offset by declining currency exchange rates. Second, after lengthy negotiations, we've reached agreement, and on Monday, closed and acquired the remaining 2/3 ownership of the Kimco Blackstone portfolio of 39 high-quality retail properties. 
And finally, early last week, Kimco, together with its consortium partners led by Cerberus, completed the acquisition and merger of Safeway with Albertson and various other prominent grocers, including Shaw's, Jewel, ACME and United Supermarkets, comprising more than 2,200 stores. Kimco will hold slightly less than 10% of the merged operating companies and related real estate, approximately 50% of which is owned real estate. 
As outlined in our earnings release, we've also substantially upgraded our U.S. portfolio through the disposition of 91 shopping centers in 2014, while also acquiring 60 high-quality properties during the same period. While our recycling and upgrading strategy is not unique, the scale of our actions in 2014 exceeded our peers, and the resulting improved demographics and rent metrics of our portfolio are substantial, noteworthy and promise to deliver excellent future growth. 
Looking at our Canadian operations and responding to related inquiries, our occupancy remains very strong at 96%, and we are fortunate to have the full guarantee of Target's U.S. parent for all 9 of our Target stores in Canada. Canadian Tire, Costco, Walmart, Home Depot and Metro grocery stores have all expressed interest in some of our Target locations, and it is quite possible that we will end up with stronger tenants and a significant financial settlement from Target U.S.A. 
Separately, while the lower Canadian dollar does impact property level NOI, we estimate $0.02 for 2015 at current levels, our initial investment in Canada remains hedged through Canadian dollar mortgages on the individual properties and our Canadian dollar-denominated bonds. In addition, our local operating partners continue to do an excellent job leasing and managing the properties. Property values and prices also remain at historic high levels in Canada due to strong demand from pension funds and other institutional investors. During the quarter, as Glenn will note, we monetized one more Canadian preferred equity investment at a substantial gain. 
Overall and moving forward across our entire portfolio, it is clear that our emphasis will be on investing capital in our own properties through redevelopment and expansions, complemented with several selective new ground-up projects. Conor will discuss in detail these plans, but we are pleased with our progress in growing this pipeline and the associated accretive economics. 
The third-party acquisition market for high-quality properties is heated and very competitive. As a result, wherever possible, we continue to purchase the equity interest of our institutional partners when they choose to monitor their -- monetize their investments. In these situations, we have a distinct advantage due to our knowledge and long-term management of the assets, coupled with the potential savings in terms of transfer taxes, brokerage fees and mortgage assumption costs. 
Given the portfolio upgrade we have completed to date and improving industry fundamentals, we feel very positive about 2015. 
Now I'd like to turn to Glenn and Conor with Milton batting clean-up as usual."

Our theme from our December 2013 Investor Day was TSR Plus: Transformation, Simplification, Redevelopment and activity from our plus business. We have successfully executed on all these initiatives throughout the year, and we are proud that our TSR plus strategy delivered a TSR, shareholder return, of 32.4% for 2014. 
Now for some detail on our fourth quarter and full year results and some additional color on our 2015 guidance range. As we reported last night, headline FFO per diluted share, which represents the official NAREIT definition, was $0.38 for the fourth quarter, which includes $0.03 per share of transactional income related to the monetization of several preferred equity interests in the U.S. and Canada. 
For the full year, headline FFO per diluted share was $1.45, a 7.4% increase as compared to $1.35 per share for 2013. 
Our FFO as adjusted, or recurring FFO, which excludes nonoperating impairments and transactional income and expense, was $0.35 per diluted share for the fourth quarter, a 6.1% increase compared to last year and brings the full year to $1.40 per share, a 5.3% increase over the 2013 level of $1.33 per share, and achieving the high end of our guidance range. 
It's important to note that we accomplished this despite the $0.05 per share dilutive impact of disposing of higher cap rate assets, including a substantial portion of our assets in Mexico and many nonstrategic U.S. assets. 
Our strong performance is a direct result of the significant portfolio transformation, which is delivering solid operating metrics, including fourth quarter U.S. same-site NOI growth of 4.3%, bringing the full year U.S. same-site NOI growth to 3.3%. Over 70% of the NOI growth is attributable to minimum rent increases. Our combined same-site NOI growth, which includes our Canadian operations, was 4% for the fourth quarter and 3.3% as well for the full year, excluding the negative impact of currency of 90 basis points and 80 basis points, respectively. 
Occupancy is approaching 96%, and our leasing spreads were strong with full year leasing spreads of 19.5% and 6.3% from renewals and options, bringing combined leasing spreads to 8.8% for 2014. 
We continue to execute on the simplification part of our strategy. During the fourth quarter, we acquired 7 assets from our joint venture with BIG and sold 8 other properties from this joint venture. We also sold 23 assets in Mexico and 2 assets in Peru for total proceeds of $161 million and have now substantially liquidated our investment in both countries. 
As previously mentioned, upon substantial liquidation of an investment in a foreign country, the impact of foreign currency translation is recognized in earnings. As such, we recognize the non-FFO charge of $134.3 million, which was applied against the respective gains and losses on the assets sold. This is substantially offset with non-FFO gains, net of impairments, of $107.8 million recognized during the quarter from the sale of 66 operating properties, so generating total proceeds of approximately $420 million. 
In addition, as Dave mentioned, we closed this week on the previously announced $925 million transaction to acquire the remaining 2/3 interest of our joint venture with Blackstone. The 39 properties in the venture are now wholly owned.
With regard to our balance sheet. We finished the year with solid debt metrics, with net debt to occurring EBITDA of 5.5x and fixed charge coverage of 3.2x. These strong levels, coupled with over $1.7 billion of immediate liquidity from availability on our credit facility and cash on hand, provided us the capacity to fund the Blackstone JV buyout. 
Subsequent to year end, we refinanced our $400 million term loan with a new $650 million term loan priced at LIBOR plus 95 basis points, among the lowest borrowing spread in the REIT industry. This term loan has initial term of 2 years and 3 one-year extension options at our option with a final maturity date in 2020, providing us maximum flexibility. 
Our debt maturities for 2015 are very manageable with less than $500 million of maturities and a significant portion not due until the latter part of 2015. With an average rate of 5.2% on the maturing debt, we view this as an excellent opportunity to reduce our cost to capital. 
Now for some more color on the guidance for 2015. As we discussed on our last earnings call, NAREIT has been strongly advocating that all reporting companies provide guidance in accordance with the official NAREIT FFO definition as part of an effort to have an industry-wide consistency. As such, we're introducing an initial 2015 FFO per diluted share guidance range of $1.45 to $1.53 in accordance with the NAREIT request. Our initial 2015 FFO as adjusted per share guidance range is $1.40 to $1.44. The level of growth takes into account the dilutive impact of $0.12 associated with the significant capital recycling and joint venture buyout executed during 2014. 
We view 2015 as a bridge year where we have absorb the impact of our transformation program in order to position the company for superior long-term earnings growth in 2016 and beyond. In addition, the guidance considers the investments made in land parcels for future developments, totaling over $100 million, and our plus business investment in our SUPERVALU and Safeway positions, which are currently non-earning but should provide excellent growth potential in the future. 
Several of the underlying assumptions used to develop the guidance range included overall increase in U.S. occupancy of 25 to 50 basis points; U.S. same-property NOI growth of 3% to 3.5%; acquisitions of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, which includes the $925 million from the recently closed buyout of Blackstone; and dispositions of $550 million to $750 million. In addition, the guidance range includes a $0.02 per share negative impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on our Canadian-denominated close. 
The headline guidance range include net transactional income of $20 million to $38 million, which is excluded from our FFO as adjusted. The net transactional income includes acquisition cost of $6 million. The guidance range is sensitive to timing of acquisition, dispositions, redevelopments coming online, lease-up and financing initiatives. 
Our 2015 plan strongly supports our recently increased common dividend level of $0.24 per quarter, which equates to an FFO payout ratio in the mid-60s percent range, one of the lowest in the industry. 
Now I'll turn it over to Conor."
320371,279092480,757250,"Kimco Realty Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 06, 2015",2015-02-06,"Earnings Calls","Kimco Realty Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Glenn, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll give a brief summary of our portfolio metrics, a quick update on acquisitions and dispositions, followed by an update on redevelopments. The fourth quarter and full year results reflect our best effor",1206,"Thanks, Glenn, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll give a brief summary of our portfolio metrics, a quick update on acquisitions and dispositions, followed by an update on redevelopments. The fourth quarter and full year results reflect our best efforts to reposition the portfolio to a vibrant collection of high-quality, high-growth assets, located in dense key metro markets that have the highest growth in population, wages and employment. We are positioned to give our shareholders unmatched safety in terms of tenant and geographic diversity alongside stable and recurring growth. 
The U.S. portfolio achieved an increase in occupancy of 80 basis points pro rata for the year to end at 95.7%. The occupancy gains were primarily driven by an increase in small shop demand as the U.S. small shop occupancy rose 280 basis points from the beginning of the year to finish at 88% pro rata, an increase of 100 basis points over prior quarter. 
Resurges in some small shop leasing continues, as this quarter, we completed 66% of our small shop deals with local operators. The 3 major category that make up the bulk of our small shop leasing include personal care services, restaurants and medical offices. Anchor occupancy also gained 10 basis points pro rata over prior quarter to finish at 98.3%. 
Leasing spreads continue to show the strong demand for space, resulting in combined leasing spreads of 9.4% for the quarter. 
The U.S. same-site NOI of 4.3% for the quarter is a strong result driven by significant rent commencements, contractual rent increases and redevelopments coming online. 
Competition in our key markets for acquisitions continues to escalate with no end of capital chasing high-quality real estate. Acquisitions for the fourth quarter were geared towards off-market value-add projects where we were able to leverage our strengths. 
Braelinn Village, a Kroger anchor tenor in an outlet Atlanta suburb, has expiring below-market key-market lease that we believe has significant redevelopment potential. In addition, we have acquired 4 development parcels where we plan to build and hold these long-term, strong assets to create shareholder value. One is a Whole Foods development in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania that is now under construction and located on the mainline where we continue to expand our presence alongside our flagship Suburban Square asset. 
The Christiana, Delaware site was purchased from Sears and sits adjacent to GGP's Christiana Mall, where retailers can take advantage of a tax-free environment, and the site will take advantage of the significant frontage along I-95. 
In Florida, the Dania Beach development site sits adjacent to our dominant Oakwood Plaza. The nearly 3 miles of frontage along I-95 that comprise these 2 properties will create a dynamic and signature asset. 
Finally, we have acquired a development parcel in Houston, Texas near the Woodlands and the new Exxon Mobil Campus that fronts the new Grand Parkway. The location of this asset is what we call a hole in the donut for retailers, as they are eager to capture this new popular growth in this affluent and highly educated market. Notwithstanding the current oil price volatility, our project has generated significant retail interest at an early stage, and we expect to execute leases with anchor tenants throughout 2015. 
These 4 projects amount to projected gross cost of $469 million with targeted returns between 7% and 8%. A measured development approach where we can take advantage of our local expertise will enable us to build upon our growing redevelopment pipeline. 
For 2015, we plan to leverage our industry-leading relationships to continue to source off-market transactions. A good example is the recently announced consolidation of the Blackstone JV. In line with our stated strategy to simplify the business and further transform our portfolio, this transaction will significantly improve the wholly-owned asset base at Kimco and add a few notable redevelopment projects. 
Turning to dispositions. In the fourth quarter, we sold 41 properties, 29 wholly-owned and 12 to joint ventures for a pro rata share from the sales of $325 million. Pricing for these Tier 2 assets continue to show improved strength as public and private capital chase deals due to the very low interest environment. 
For the year, we completed the sales of 91 U.S. shopping centers for a gross sales price of $1 billion, including $249 million of mortgage debt. The company's pro rata share from the sales was $710 million, and the blended cap rate on our dispositions for the year was 7.5%. We believe we are in the sweet spot for dispositions and are targeting another $600 million for dispositions in 2015 to effectively complete the transformation of the portfolio by exiting our low-growth assets in secondary markets. 
Our redevelopment program continues to produce significant results. Every asset we own goes through a methodical review process that takes into account all opportunities, including current and future, retail and non-retail, so we leave no stone unturned to help create long-term shareholder value. 
Our real estate is in demand not only from our normal Rolodex of expanding retailers, there are also new sources, including specialty grocers, outlet concepts, European retailers and developers of apartments, medical offices and hotels. 
For the year, we completed 34 projects with a total gross cost of $68 million with an ROI of 13.9%. These projects continue to improve net asset value and contributed 90 basis points to our same-site NOI this year. As you look to 2015, we target gross projects of $200 million with an ROI of 8% to 10%. 
We have made significant progress this year, but there is still work to be done as we continue to evolve and position ourselves as a best-in-class capital allocator and redevelopment operation. In this next cycle, it will be imperative for us to focus on the capacity to sustain significant income growth when the interest rate environment shifts. As we near our all-time high in occupancy, we will look to our redevelopment and development pipeline to generate significant recurring income growth. 
The demand for space continues to outpace supply, and as we enter into 2015, we are cautiously optimistic due to the fundamental drivers of our industry. Employment growth, cheap gas prices and consumer confidence, all combined to form a powerful shopping base in the U.S. that is ready to ramp up consumption, especially for off-prices and essential goods. 
Our retailer services group continues to provide us with invaluable information and recently found that this dramatic fall in gas prices has been a boon for our grocery concepts. We completed our strategic initiative of increasing our percentage of ABR from grocery anchorage properties from 58% to over 65%, and we'll continue to push this initiative in 2015. 
Our asset class is now completing at a higher level. As we have noticed, many of our retailers that straddle the line between open-air shopping centers and the enclosed mall world have been outperforming in the open-air environment. Combining the favorable supply and demand balance in addition to the safety of U.S. investments provides a nice runway of growth ahead for owning well-located open-air centers. 
As we look to 2015, our strategic goals remain focused on completing our transformation, simplification and expanding our redevelopment efforts to include strategic ground-up developments. 
And now I will turn it over to Milton for his closing remarks."

I believe that our retail real estate portfolio is in a particularly sweet spot. The decline in gasoline prices is much, much more important on a relative basis to our retail tenants: The supermarket, the drugstore, the off-price retailers and many other retailers that sell essential goods and service. It's much more important to them than it is to high-end luxury retailers. 
I would also note that the major department stores are opening up more off-price units than ever before. There are 35 new Nordstrom Rack stores planned over the next 2 years. Hudson Bay has stated that the belief in value concepts will capture much of the growth in retail over the next 5 years, and they are accelerating their expansion of their Saks OFF 5th brand. Even Macy's announced they will explore an off-price business in addition to their existing Bloomingdale's outlet concept.
I also believe that cap rates will continue to decline. The spread between the 10-year treasury rate and cap rates should be narrower. The U.S. has the best legal system in the world for property rights. Global investors and pension funds are increasing their allocation to U.S. real estate, which should create further demand, and the dollar is getting much more respect. 
At Kimco over the past year, we've invested in future growth of the company. These investments include the Blackstone purchase, a myriad of redevelopment projects and the development sites in Florida, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Texas. But for me personally, the most stimulating part is the bench strength of the Kimco team. I see passion and creative ability and a fierce energy in creating value. Our team has dozens of new initiatives and programs to increase our operating income and NAV. 
And with that, we're happy to take any questions."

Dave, as you mentioned, the private market for acquisitions is competitive. You've had a lot of success buying out JV partner interests in the last couple of years, but historically, you been a willing public REIT acquirer, even though you haven't in recent years. So I'm wondering what's your view on where the public REITs are trading versus private market values?

And we do think there continues to be a difference between properties on the private market and how us as a public company are valued. We think the implied cap rate of our stock is much too high compared to the high-quality properties that are there being traded out there on the private market. So there certainly is an arbitrage that exists out there. But as you know, M&A in our sector is difficult. Basically, yes, there's a process. You end up paying their bankers, new bankers, their accountants, your accountants. These deals are fully shopped. And yes, we have experienced doing it. We've done 5 over the last, I think, 15 years, and we're proud of those. And we certainly continue to look at opportunities. We are focused, however, on, if we do M&A, on portfolios that will enhance the quality of our own portfolio. So the inventory of public portfolios out there that would attract our interest is narrower than perhaps it would've been in the past when we looked at all kinds of deals. So we'll see what happens over time. And if things become in play, we certainly look. I think it's known that we, together with others, looked at AmREIT, which met that high-quality profile.

But we believe this is a nice opportunity for us to continue to add specialty grocers to our shopping centers where we can increase our percentage of ABRs from a grocery component. And there's plenty of demand from all the TJX concepts, Ross, Bed Bath & Beyond concepts. If you think about it, these are boxes that once you add a dynamic retailer that will cause more traffic, it should have a trickle-down effect that will impact and enhance the residual shopping center. So we look at it as a net positive.

The first one, Wynnewood, Pennsylvania, that was a forward commitment where we actually purchased the property with an executed Whole Foods lease. So it was in essence a ground-up development where we have the Whole Foods lease in place before closing on the land. And it's, again, in an area where he want to continue to control on the mainline. Christiana, Delaware, that site was actually a 6-year labor of love where we were actually working with Sears originally to entitle the project as a JV partner and then codeveloped it going forward. Well, when the entitlements obviously came fruition, Sears did -- no longer wanted to participate in the ground-up development process because of the cash involved. And so we were able to execute a purchase option for us and take them out of it. So now we are going to be owning that 100% and developing it going forward. We have been working that project for a number of years, as I said, and we're very confident in the rental -- the retailer interest going forward. Grand Parkway, that site, again, is along Grand -- the Grand Parkway site in Houston. It's in a perfect location where if you look at the spacing from our all of our retailers, it's really positioned nicely to take advantage of not only the new parkway that's going to be completed, but it also has the new Exxon Mobil campus coming out of the ground. And Woodlands is a very affluent, very highly educated pocket of population in Houston. And I think will really drive significant retailer interest, and we've already been seeing more demand, even from retailers that have been dormant for a number of years are looking at this site as a real opportunity to get a piece of this new development. And then Dania is an adjacent site next to our 100% leased Oakridge Plaza. This is a Fort Lauderdale airport, really a site that we'll from Fort Lauderdale airport all the way down to Hollywood, Florida. So I-95 will be controlled by us, really, for 3 miles. And we think we have significant synergies by controlling the adjacent parcel and looking at doing complementary uses that we believe will really enhance our existing position and be a signature asset for us going forward. So each of those ground-up development have a very specific story, and that's why we believe it's a prudent time to step back into the ground-up development process because we've been very reluctant at paying sub-5 caps for signature assets. And if we can develop to a 7% or 8% in a key market where we know we're going to own long term, we think that we can control the process and feel very comfortable with in '17 and '18 bringing these projects on."

This is really kind of a segue from Milton's comment about expanding demand from the likes of Nordstrom Rack and commentary from some of the department store groups that are looking to want to take on more off-price square feet themselves. And also, given what the prime markets just agreed with Sears, I just wonder, Conor, when you look at your Kmart boxes and the possibility for redevelopment, re-tenanting, are you seeing off-price, because of this competitive pressure, off-price footprints expanding or not? And as you think about the redevelopment, let's say a theoretical redevelopment of a Kmart box, would it be your preference to do a multi-tenant approach in that box? Or would you be more -- would you just be just as happy to replace them with a single tenant?"

Saks OFF 5th, for example, is going a little bit larger than, say, your prototypical TJX or Ross. They're looking for closer to 30,000 to 40,000 square feet. Now that being said, because the competition is so significant, to get into certain assets, they're willing to go down to 20,000 to 25,000 square feet. So we still continue to see that range of 20,000 to 30,000 square feet as being the sweet spot for the off-price discounter. TJX has gone a little bit smaller, from 25,000 to 22,000. Ross continues to be right about the square footage. But we think that, that's really the sweet spot for the discounter today as they try and figure out how to get the most sales out of their box and continue to refine their business model. And as for Kmart redevelopments, it really depends on the asset, where it's located, what's the best use for the surrounding community and what's really going to drive the most sales to that shopping center. If you got a single box Kmart that you're redeveloping, my preference is typically to probably chop it up and do a number of different retailers. Because then, you can really enhance the surrounding retailer. The retailer that -- and so if you can add a grocery concept to it, your small shops then pick up on that significant traffic increase. And again, the junior anchor space today is probably the most active in terms of our industry. And when we look at Kmart boxes, the demand for the juniors are really what's driving the rents and really what's driving the growth there. So for us, it's been a mix. But I would say that going forward, it will still be drawn by a lot of junior box interest."

We just don't see any V-shape to the recovery of development. There were so many difficulties with so many large projects that got caught at the top of the financial crisis that going into large-scale development, much of which is spec, is exceptionally hard. And the economics still aren't there. In many markets, rents still aren't back to the levels they were 6, 7 years ago. So it's very hard to make the numbers work. And construction financing is very limited. It's just much tougher in our sector to get going again in major developments. So I think you'll see a little bit of a U-turn here with development in our sector, and you're beginning to see some of it. But again, we're a long way off, years off, from major, major addition to supply. It's interesting that retail per capita in the U.S. has actually come down. I mean, that's the first time it's happened in a long, long time."

So a lot of the guys that were out there that were really buying either a piece of land or ground leasing a big portion of a site to make it feasible are no longer in the game. So if you take them out, the playing field is really going to be muted for the next few years, and then we'll start to see it tick back up."

And Glenn, you think you talked a little bit on guidance that there's a variety of different financing assumptions in your guidance. I think if you back into the weighted average share count that's embedded in your guidance, it's about an extra 10 million shares. So it would appear as though there's some level of equity issuance, either off the ATM or direct issuance, in the guidance. So I'm wondering, as you think about the big Blackstone deal that you did with the negotiated transaction taking on leverage, being a net acquirer, why not have issued the equity earlier or at least timed it better and not take sort of market risk? And maybe just help us understand how you're thinking about equity as part of that funding source, both within guidance, but more strategically about when to raise it?"

Although we continually evaluate our capital needs in connection with our operating strategy, our debt metrics, our capital plan and where we believe our NAV is. But in terms of being able to have more tools, we are going to establish an ATM program and watch how the rest of our capital plan runs throughout the year. But starting with a net debt-to-EBITDA of 5.5x, it gives us the capacity to watch and figure where we're best positioned to, if we need to issue equity, do it.

And as we're approaching this kind of peak occupancy rate that the company's been able to achieve historically of 96% and change, are you expecting that the redevelopment contribution, which of course you include in same-store NOI, combined with higher spreads, do you expect that to kind of be able to replace the inability to push occupancy any further and sustain same-store NOI at 3% plus?

I think the average house stays on the market there for about 1 week before it's gobbled up. And we continue to see occupancy hit all-time highs in Houston. Our retail occupancy in Houston is higher than our portfolio average, and we think there is huge demand for retailers to continue to expand there. And the Grant Parkway is a new outer loop of Houston. So if you think of where the growth has gone, Woodland is actually outside of the Grand Parkway. So the Grand Parkway is almost like an infill location that has the highest income, and dense area of Woodland's outside of it. So it's actually starting to fill in nicely.

We are very happy to top off a great year with solid fourth quarter financial results and operating metrics. Our strong portfolio fundamentals were led by same-site NOI growth exceeding 4% for the second straight quarter and reaching our highest portfolio occupancy since early 2008. Small shop occupancy also showed a sharp increase as local stores and small national retailers recover from the recession and proceed with their expansion plans. 
While retailers, in general, achieved mixed results in 2014, discounters and service-oriented tenants, such as health clubs and restaurants, continued their aggressive growth in the face of a shrinking inventory of retail space. As a result, effective rents are climbing in our portfolio and across the entire open-air shopping center sector. 
Lower gas prices, accelerating household formation and continued limited development activity all bode well for the shopping center industry fundamentals in 2015. The omni-channel sales approach is increasingly being embraced by national retailers, with e-commerce success dependent on brick-and-mortar stores providing market presence, product showrooms and fulfillment capabilities. 
Amazon and many other Internet retailers will indeed be leasing retail space in the coming years. Glenn and Conor will cover many of the financial and operating specifics in their comments today. But I would like to highlight several prominent successes. 
First, we have now essentially completed our exit from Latin America with favorable cap rates somewhat offset by declining currency exchange rates. Second, after lengthy negotiations, we've reached agreement, and on Monday, closed and acquired the remaining 2/3 ownership of the Kimco Blackstone portfolio of 39 high-quality retail properties. 
And finally, early last week, Kimco, together with its consortium partners led by Cerberus, completed the acquisition and merger of Safeway with Albertson and various other prominent grocers, including Shaw's, Jewel, ACME and United Supermarkets, comprising more than 2,200 stores. Kimco will hold slightly less than 10% of the merged operating companies and related real estate, approximately 50% of which is owned real estate. 
As outlined in our earnings release, we've also substantially upgraded our U.S. portfolio through the disposition of 91 shopping centers in 2014, while also acquiring 60 high-quality properties during the same period. While our recycling and upgrading strategy is not unique, the scale of our actions in 2014 exceeded our peers, and the resulting improved demographics and rent metrics of our portfolio are substantial, noteworthy and promise to deliver excellent future growth. 
Looking at our Canadian operations and responding to related inquiries, our occupancy remains very strong at 96%, and we are fortunate to have the full guarantee of Target's U.S. parent for all 9 of our Target stores in Canada. Canadian Tire, Costco, Walmart, Home Depot and Metro grocery stores have all expressed interest in some of our Target locations, and it is quite possible that we will end up with stronger tenants and a significant financial settlement from Target U.S.A. 
Separately, while the lower Canadian dollar does impact property level NOI, we estimate $0.02 for 2015 at current levels, our initial investment in Canada remains hedged through Canadian dollar mortgages on the individual properties and our Canadian dollar-denominated bonds. In addition, our local operating partners continue to do an excellent job leasing and managing the properties. Property values and prices also remain at historic high levels in Canada due to strong demand from pension funds and other institutional investors. During the quarter, as Glenn will note, we monetized one more Canadian preferred equity investment at a substantial gain. 
Overall and moving forward across our entire portfolio, it is clear that our emphasis will be on investing capital in our own properties through redevelopment and expansions, complemented with several selective new ground-up projects. Conor will discuss in detail these plans, but we are pleased with our progress in growing this pipeline and the associated accretive economics. 
The third-party acquisition market for high-quality properties is heated and very competitive. As a result, wherever possible, we continue to purchase the equity interest of our institutional partners when they choose to monitor their -- monetize their investments. In these situations, we have a distinct advantage due to our knowledge and long-term management of the assets, coupled with the potential savings in terms of transfer taxes, brokerage fees and mortgage assumption costs. 
Given the portfolio upgrade we have completed to date and improving industry fundamentals, we feel very positive about 2015. 
Now I'd like to turn to Glenn and Conor, with Milton batting clean-up as usual."

Our theme from our December 2013 Investor Day was TSR Plus: Transformation, Simplification, Redevelopment and activity from our plus business. We have successfully executed on all these initiatives throughout the year, and we are proud that our TSR plus strategy delivered a TSR, total shareholder return, of 32.4% for 2014. 
Now for some detail on our fourth quarter and full year results and some additional color on our 2015 guidance range. As we reported last night, headline FFO per diluted share, which represents the official NAREIT definition, was $0.38 for the fourth quarter, which includes $0.03 per share of transactional income related to the monetization of several preferred equity interests in the U.S. and Canada. 
For the full year, headline FFO per diluted share was $1.45, a 7.4% increase as compared to $1.35 per share for 2013. 
Our FFO as adjusted, or recurring FFO, which excludes nonoperating impairments and transactional income and expense, was $0.35 per diluted share for the fourth quarter, a 6.1% increase compared to last year and brings the full year to $1.40 per share, a 5.3% increase over the 2013 level of $1.33 per share, and achieving the high end of our guidance range. 
It's important to note that we accomplished this despite the $0.05 per share dilutive impact of disposing of higher cap rate assets, including a substantial portion of our assets in Mexico and many nonstrategic U.S. assets. 
Our strong performance is a direct result of the significant portfolio transformation, which is delivering solid operating metrics, including fourth quarter U.S. same-site NOI growth of 4.3%, bringing the full year U.S. same-site NOI growth to 3.3%. Over 70% of the NOI growth is attributable to minimum rent increases. Our combined same-site NOI growth, which includes our Canadian operations, was 4% for the fourth quarter and 3.3% as well for the full year, excluding the negative impact of currency of 90 basis points and 80 basis points, respectively. 
Occupancy is approaching 96%, and our leasing spreads were strong with full year leasing spreads of 19.5% and 6.3% from renewals and options, bringing combined leasing spreads to 8.8% for 2014. 
We continue to execute on the simplification part of our strategy. During the fourth quarter, we acquired 7 assets from our joint venture with BIG and sold 8 other properties from this joint venture. We also sold 23 assets in Mexico and 2 assets in Peru for total proceeds of $161 million and have now substantially liquidated our investment in both countries. 
As previously mentioned, upon substantial liquidation of an investment in a foreign country, the impact of foreign currency translation is recognized in earnings. As such, we recognize the non-FFO charge of $134.3 million, which was applied against the respective gains and losses on the assets sold. This is substantially offset with non-FFO gains, net of impairments, of $107.8 million recognized during the quarter from the sale of 66 operating properties, so generating total proceeds of approximately $420 million. 
In addition, as Dave mentioned, we closed this week on the previously announced $925 million transaction to acquire the remaining 2/3 interest of our joint venture with Blackstone. The 39 properties in the venture are now wholly owned.
With regard to our balance sheet. We finished the year with solid debt metrics, with net debt to occurring EBITDA of 5.5x and fixed charge coverage of 3.2x. These strong levels, coupled with over $1.7 billion of immediate liquidity from availability on our revolving credit facility and cash on hand, provided us the capacity to fund the Blackstone JV buyout. 
Subsequent to year end, we refinanced our $400 million term loan with a new $650 million term loan priced at LIBOR plus 95 basis points, among the lowest borrowing spread in the REIT industry. This term loan has an initial term of 2 years and 3 one-year extension options at our option with a final maturity date in 2020, providing us maximum flexibility. 
Our debt maturities for 2015 are very manageable with less than $500 million of maturities and a significant portion not due until the latter part of 2015. With an average rate of 5.2% on the maturing debt, we view this as an excellent opportunity to reduce our cost to capital. 
Now for some more color on the guidance for 2015. As we discussed on our last earnings call, NAREIT has been strongly advocating that all reporting companies provide guidance in accordance with the official NAREIT FFO definition as part of an effort to have an industry-wide consistency. As such, we're introducing an initial 2015 FFO per diluted share guidance range of $1.45 to $1.53 in accordance with the NAREIT request. Our initial 2015 FFO as adjusted per share guidance range is $1.40 to $1.44. The level of growth takes into account the dilutive impact of $0.12 associated with the significant capital recycling and joint venture buyout executed during 2014. 
We view 2015 as a bridge year where we absorb the impact of our transformation program in order to position the company for superior long-term earnings growth in 2016 and beyond. In addition, the guidance considers the investments made in land parcels for future developments, totaling over $100 million, and our plus business investment in our SUPERVALU and Safeway positions, which are currently non-earning but should provide excellent growth potential in the future. 
Several of the underlying assumptions used to develop the guidance range included overall increase in U.S. occupancy of 25 to 50 basis points; U.S. same-property NOI growth of 3% to 3.5%; acquisitions of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, which includes the $925 million from the recently closed buyout of Blackstone; and dispositions of $550 million to $750 million. In addition, the guidance range includes a $0.02 per share negative impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on our Canadian-denominated close. 
The headline guidance range include net transactional income of $20 million to $38 million, which is excluded from our FFO as adjusted. The net transactional income includes acquisition cost of $6 million. The guidance range is sensitive to timing of acquisition, dispositions, redevelopments coming online, lease-up and financing initiatives. 
Our 2015 plan strongly supports our recently increased common dividend level of $0.24 per quarter, which equates to an FFO payout ratio in the mid-60s percent range, one of the lowest in the industry. 
Now I'll turn it over to Conor."
320371,279092480,757316,"Kimco Realty Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 06, 2015",2015-02-06,"Earnings Calls","Kimco Realty Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Glenn, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll give a brief summary of our portfolio metrics, a quick update on acquisitions and dispositions, followed by an update on redevelopments.

Today, I'll give a brief summary of our portfolio metrics, a quick update on acquisitions and dispositions, followed by an update on redevelopments. The fourth quarter and full year results reflect our best efforts to reposition the portfolio to a vibrant collection of high-quality, high-growth assets, located in dense key metro markets that have the highest growth in population, wages and employment. We are positioned to give our shareholders unmatched safety in terms of tenant and geographic diversity alongside stable and recurring growth. 
The U.S. portfolio achieved an increase in occupancy of 80 basis points pro rata for the year to end at 95.7%. The occupancy gains were primarily driven by an increase in small shop demand as the U.S. small shop occupancy rose 280 basis points from the beginning of the year to finish at 88% pro rata, an increase of 100 basis points over prior quarter. 
Resurges in small shop leasing continues, as this quarter, we completed 66% of our small shop deals with local operators. The 3 major category that make up the bulk of our small shop leasing include personal care services, restaurants and medical offices. Anchor occupancy also gained 10 basis points pro rata over prior quarter to finish at 98.3%. 
Leasing spreads continue to show the strong demand for space, resulting in combined leasing spreads of 9.4% for the quarter. 
The U.S. same-site NOI of 4.3% for the quarter is a strong result driven by significant rent commencements, contractual rent increases and redevelopments coming online. 
Competition in our key markets for acquisitions continues to escalate with no end of capital chasing high-quality real estate. Acquisitions for the fourth quarter were geared towards off-market value-add projects where we were able to leverage our strengths. 
Braelinn Village, a Kroger anchor tenor in an outlet Atlanta suburb, has expiring below-market key-market lease that we believe has significant redevelopment potential. In addition, we have acquired 4 development parcels where we plan to build and hold these long-term, strong assets to create shareholder value. One is a Whole Foods development in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania that is now under construction and located on the mainline where we continue to expand our presence alongside our flagship Suburban Square asset. 
The Christiana, Delaware site was purchased from Sears and sits adjacent to GGP's Christiana Mall, where retailers can take advantage of a tax-free environment, and the site will take advantage of the significant frontage along I-95. 
In Florida, the Dania Beach development site sits adjacent to our dominant Oakwood Plaza. The nearly 3 miles of frontage along I-95 that comprise these 2 properties will create a dynamic and signature asset. 
Finally, we have acquired a development parcel in Houston, Texas near the Woodlands and the new Exxon Mobil Campus that fronts the new Grand Parkway. The location of this asset is what we call a hole in the donut for retailers, as they are eager to capture this new popular growth in this affluent and highly educated market. Notwithstanding the current oil price volatility, our project has generated significant retail interest at an early stage, and we expect to execute leases with anchor tenants throughout 2015. 
These 4 projects amount to projected gross cost of $469 million with targeted returns between 7% and 8%. A measured development approach where we can take advantage of our local expertise will enable us to build upon our growing redevelopment pipeline. 
For 2015, we plan to leverage our industry-leading relationships to continue to source off-market transactions. A good example is the recently announced consolidation of the Blackstone JV. In line with our stated strategy to simplify the business and further transform our portfolio, this transaction will significantly improve the wholly-owned asset base at Kimco and add a few notable redevelopment projects. 
Turning to dispositions. In the fourth quarter, we sold 41 properties, 29 wholly-owned and 12 to joint ventures for a pro rata share from the sales of $325 million. Pricing for these Tier 2 assets continue to show improved strength as public and private capital chase deals due to the very low interest environment. 
For the year, we completed the sales of 91 U.S. shopping centers for a gross sales price of $1 billion, including $249 million of mortgage debt. The company's pro rata share from these sales was $710 million, and the blended cap rate on our dispositions for the year was 7.5%. We believe we are in the sweet spot for dispositions and are targeting another $600 million for dispositions in 2015 to effectively complete the transformation of the portfolio by exiting our low-growth assets in secondary markets. 
Our redevelopment program continues to produce significant results. Every asset we own goes through a methodical review process that takes into account all opportunities, including current and future, retail and non-retail, so we leave no stone unturned to help create long-term shareholder value. 
Our real estate is in demand not only from our normal Rolodex of expanding retailers, there are also new sources, including specialty grocers, outlet concepts, European retailers and developers of apartments, medical offices and hotels. 
For the year, we completed 34 projects with a total gross cost of $68 million with an ROI of 13.9%. These projects continue to improve net asset value and contributed 90 basis points to our same-site NOI this year. As you look to 2015, we target gross projects of $200 million with an ROI of 8% to 10%. 
We have made significant progress this year, but there is still work to be done as we continue to evolve and position ourselves as a best-in-class capital allocator and redevelopment operation. In this next cycle, it will be imperative for us to focus on the capacity to sustain significant income growth when the interest rate environment shifts. As we near our all-time high in occupancy, we will look to our redevelopment and development pipeline to generate significant recurring income growth. 
The demand for space continues to outpace supply, and as we enter into 2015 we are cautiously optimistic due to the fundamental drivers of our industry. Employment growth, cheap gas prices and consumer confidence all combine to form a powerful shopping base in the U.S. that is ready to ramp up consumption, especially for off-prices and essential goods. 
Our retailer services group continues to provide us with invaluable information and recently found that this dramatic fall in gas prices has been a boon for our grocery concepts. We completed our strategic initiative of increasing our percentage of ABR from grocery anchorage properties from 58% to over 65%, and we'll continue to push this initiative in 2015. 
Our asset class is now competing at a higher level. As we have noticed, many of our retailers that straddle the line between open-air shopping centers and the enclosed mall world have been outperforming in the open-air environment. Combining the favorable supply and demand balance in addition to the safety of U.S. investments provides a nice runway of growth ahead for owning well-located open-air centers. 
As we look to 2015, our strategic goals remain focused on completing our transformation, simplification and expanding our redevelopment efforts to include strategic ground-up developments. 
And now I will turn it over to Milton for his closing remarks."

I believe that our retail real estate portfolio is in a particularly sweet spot. The decline in gasoline prices is much, much more important on a relative basis to our retail tenants: The supermarket, the drugstore, the off-price retailers and many other retailers that sell essential goods and service. It's much more important to them than it is to high-end luxury retailers. 
I would also note that the major department stores are opening up more off-price units than ever before. There are 35 new Nordstrom Rack stores planned over the next 2 years. Hudson Bay has stated they belief the value concepts will capture much of the growth in retail over the next 5 years, and they are accelerating their expansion of their Saks OFF 5th brand. Even Macy's announced they will explore an off-price business in addition to their existing Bloomingdale's outlet concept.
I also believe that cap rates will continue to decline. The spread between the 10-year treasury rate and cap rates should be narrower. The U.S. has the best legal system in the world for property rights. Global investors and pension funds are increasing their allocation to U.S. real estate, which should create further demand, and the dollar is getting much more respect. 
At Kimco over the past year, we've invested in the future growth of the company. These investments include the Blackstone purchase, a myriad of redevelopment projects and the development sites in Florida, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Texas. But for me personally, the most stimulating part is the bench strength of the Kimco team. I see passion and creative ability and a fierce energy in creating value. Our team has dozens of new initiatives and programs to increase our operating income and NAV. 
And with that, we're happy to take any questions."

You've had a lot of success buying out JV partner interests in the last couple of years, but historically, you been a willing public REIT acquirer, even though you haven't in recent years.

And we do think there continues to be a difference between properties on the private market and how us as a public company are valued. We think the implied cap rate of our stock is much too high compared to the high-quality properties that are there being traded out there on the private market. So there certainly is an arbitrage that exists out there. But as you know, M&A in our sector is difficult. Basically, there's a process. You end up paying their bankers, your bankers, their accountants, your accountants. These deals are fully shopped. And yes, we have experience doing it. We've done 5 over the last, I think, 15 years, and we're proud of those. And we certainly continue to look at opportunities. We are focused, however, on, if we do M&A, on portfolios that will enhance the quality of our own portfolio. So the inventory of public portfolios out there that would attract our interest is narrower than perhaps it would've been in the past when we looked at all kinds of deals. So we'll see what happens over time. And if things become in play, we certainly look. I think it's known that we, together with others, looked at AmREIT, which met that high-quality profile.

If you think about it, these are boxes that once you add a dynamic retailer that will cause more traffic, it should have a trickle-down effect that will impact and enhance the residual shopping center. So we look at it as a net positive. But at the end of the day, as a landlord, you're always sad to see another retailer combine because it's one less that is going to be bidding on that space when it comes available. So even though it's probably necessary for that sector, we do like to think the more retailers, the better for us."

The first one, Wynnewood, Pennsylvania, that was a forward commitment where we actually purchased the property with an executed Whole Foods lease. So it was in essence a ground-up development where we have the Whole Foods lease in place before closing on the land. And it's, again, in an area where he want to continue to control on the mainline. Christiana, Delaware, that site was actually a 6-year labor of love where we were actually working with Sears originally to entitle the project as a JV partner and then codeveloped it going forward. Well, when the entitlements obviously came to fruition, Sears did -- no longer wanted to participate in the ground-up development process because of the cash involved. And so we were able to execute a purchase option for us and take them out of it. So now we are going to be owning that 100% and developing it going forward. We have been working that project for a number of years, as I said, and we're very confident in the rental -- the retailer interest going forward. Grand Parkway, that site, again, is along Grand -- the Grand Parkway site in Houston. It's in a perfect location where if you look at the spacing from our all of our retailers, it's really positioned nicely to take advantage of not only the new parkway that's going to be completed, but it also has the new Exxon Mobil campus coming out of the ground. And Woodlands is a very affluent, very highly educated pocket of population in Houston. And I think will really drive significant retailer interest, and we've already been seeing more demand, even from retailers that have been dormant for a number of years are looking at this site as a real opportunity to get a piece of this new development. And then Dania is an adjacent site next to our 100% leased Oakridge Plaza. This is a Fort Lauderdale airport, really a site that we'll own, from Fort Lauderdale airport all the way down to Hollywood, Florida. So I-95 will be controlled by us, really, for 3 miles. And we think we have significant synergies by controlling the adjacent parcel and looking at doing complementary uses that we believe will really enhance our existing position and be a signature asset for us going forward. So each of those ground-up development have a very specific story, and that's why we believe it's a prudent time to step back into the ground-up development process because we've been very reluctant at paying sub-5 caps for signature assets. And if we can develop to a 7% or 8% in a key market where we know we're going to own long term, we think that we can control the process and feel very comfortable with in '17 and '18 bringing these projects on."

This is really kind of a segue from Milton's comment about expanding demand from the likes of Nordstrom Rack and commentary from some of the department store groups that are looking to want to take on more off-price square feet themselves. And also, given what the prime markets just agreed with Sears, I just wonder, Conor, when you look at your Kmart boxes and the possibility for redevelopment, re-tenanting, are you seeing off-price, because of this competitive pressure, off-price footprints expanding or not? And as you think about the redevelopment, let's say a theoretical redevelopment of a Kmart box, would it be your preference to do a multi-tenant approach in that box?

Saks OFF 5th, for example, is going a little bit larger than, say, your prototypical TJX or Ross. They're looking for closer to 30,000 to 40,000 square feet. Now that being said, because the competition is so significant, to get into certain assets, they're willing to go down to 20,000 to 25,000 square feet. So we still continue to see that range of 20,000 to 30,000 square feet as being the sweet spot for the off-price discounter. TJX has gone a little bit smaller, from 25,000 to 22,000. Ross continues to be right about the same square footage. But we think that, that's really the sweet spot for the discounter today as they try and figure out how to get the most sales out of their box and continue to refine their business model. And as for Kmart redevelopments, it really depends on the asset, where it's located, what's the best use for the surrounding community and what's really going to drive the most sales to that shopping center. If you've got a single box Kmart that you're redeveloping, my preference is typically to probably chop it up and do a number of different retailers. Because then you can really enhance the surrounding retailer. The retailer that -- and so if you can add a grocery concept to it, your small shops then pick up on that significant traffic increase. And again, the junior anchor space today is probably the most active in terms of our industry. And when we look at Kmart boxes, the demand for the juniors are really what's driving the rents and really what's driving the growth there. So for us, it's been a mix. But I would say that going forward, it will still be drawn by a lot of junior box interest."

But these are generally smaller, smaller projects and still just a fraction of the number of shopping centers that were developed. At the peak, we were developing 2,000 shopping centers a year in the United States. And so maybe it's gone from 100 to a couple of hundred or 300 now, but it's still a small fraction. And nobody, to my knowledge, is doing these million square-foot lifestyle all-spec centers that take years to get the entitlements. So I think the inventory is going to be limited.

We just don't see any V-shape to the recovery of development. There were so many difficulties with so many large projects that got caught at the top of the financial crisis that going into large-scale development, much of which is spec, is exceptionally hard. And the economics still aren't there. In many markets, rents still aren't back to the levels they were 6, 7 years ago. So it's very hard to make the numbers work. And construction financing is very limited. It's just much tougher in our sector to get going again in major developments. So I think you'll see a little bit of a U-turn here with development in our sector, and you're beginning to see some of it.

These are all highly educated, affluent workers. Woodland is the hottest area in terms of Texas and housing prices. I think the average house stays on the market there for about 1 week before it's gobbled up. And we continue to see occupancy hit all-time highs in Houston. Our retail occupancy in Houston is higher than our portfolio average, and we think there is huge demand for retailers to continue to expand there. And the Grant Parkway is the new outer loop of Houston. So if you think of where the growth has gone, Woodland is actually outside of the Grand Parkway. So the Grand Parkway is almost like an infill location that has the highest income, and dense area of Woodland's outside of it. So it's actually starting to fill in nicely. So all with that, we feel very comfortable with the investment and the spacing of the retailers."

We are very pleased to report strong first quarter financial results and operating metrics. Glenn and Conor will cover the specific details, but the solid fundamentals of our portfolio continued to drive excellent FFO earnings growth and same-site NOI increases. Small shop occupancy improvements are particularly encouraging as the economy continues to recover. While recent retail sales growth has been modest, national retailers are still committed to robust expansion plans, all in the face of a declining inventory of retail space. Discounters and service-oriented tenants, such as theaters, health clubs and restaurants, continue to expand rapidly, helping to increase effective rents and occupancy in our portfolio and across the open air shopping center sector. Lower gas prices are also expected to give a boost to consumer spending and in a good sign for something centers. Rich Moore of RBC continues to point to 5-year high levels of new planned new store openings, while Craig Schmidt of BofA Merrill notes the recovery of retailers focusing on the middle class. The renewed strength of middle-class purchasing power is expected to disproportionately benefit neighborhood and community shopping centers anchored by conventional grocery stores, casual and fast casual dining and discount anchors such as Walmart, Target and Kohl's. Overall, we feel terrific going into 2015 as new supply remains muted, despite population growth, growing household formation and the slow but steady growth of the U.S. economy. 
With respect to our overall strategy, we've essentially completed our exit from Latin America, with pending deals in our last shopping center in Mexico and various land parcels. We also continue to take advantage of a strong market for shopping centers even in secondary markets by selling both our second tier assets as well as those located outside our long-term growth markets. Our U.S. property dispositions, in total, are on track, with all of the identified assets largely sold or targeted to be under contract by year-end, this potential. 
In general, sales proceeds from our dispositions are being recycled into large pipeline of redevelopment projects, selected new developments and purchases of our institutional partners' ownership interest in existing Kimco assets. We believe these activities in general are excellent and accretive investments and superior to the acquisition options of high-quality stabilized shopping centers owned by third parties. Our recent Blackstone purchase, for example, allowed us to fully consolidate 39 high-quality properties we have managed and leased for approximately 10 years. We know these assets and we know these markets very well, and we are excited about their long-term growth potential. 
We have also increased our efforts to purchase out parcels or retail properties adjacent to or within existing high-quality properties we already own. These acquisitions are usually very accretive and increase our scale and leasing leverage in some of our best properties. 
Looking at our Canadian operations. Our occupancy remains strong at approximately 96% and our Target exposure is fully covered by parent company guarantees on all 9 of our Target candidate leases. Interest from other retailers is growing, and we believe at least 8 of our 9 Target stores will find new anchors this year. 
Also, as noted in prior statements, we have begun to selectively sell certain Canadian properties where we can benefit from historic low cap rates and high institutional demand. RioCan our largest Canadian partner, has purchased our 50% interest in 3 of our RioCan joint venture properties, comprising 545,000 square feet while concurrently selling us their 80% interest in their premium joint venture property we originally developed and currently manage in Dallas-Fort Worth. Our RioCan venture is also selling 2 large properties in Québec in areas where we believe growth will be constrained. 
On a separate topic, we continue to be pleased with both our SUPERVALU and Safeway investments. SUPERVALU reported excellent quarterly results and we took the opportunity last week to partially monetize our SUPERVALU stock at large game. In addition, the Safeway Albertsons integration is proceeding well under Bob Miller's direction. While the Safeway investment headlines are PLUS business, it is important to note that over the years we have completed many smaller transactions within the PLUS business, which have led to either individual property sale-leasebacks or acquisitions of retailer-owned real estate. Generally, these investments have been off-market, a direct result of our relationship with retailers, their advisory firms and private equity contacts. 
As a final comment, Glen and our treasury team continue to do a wonderful job in our capital markets. Our first ever 30-year unsecured bond was a particularly noteworthy achievement and help stagger our debt maturities while taking advantage of today's low interest rates. Now I'd like to turn it to Glenn, Conor and Milton for their comments."

Our solid first quarter results are the [indiscernible] of strong execution on all fronts, including leasing acquisitions, dispositions, redevelopments and capital raising. As we reported las",659,"Thanks, David, and good morning. 2015 is off to a strong start. Our solid first quarter results are the [indiscernible] of strong execution on all fronts, including leasing acquisitions, dispositions, redevelopments and capital raising. As we reported last night, headline FFO per share, which represents the official NAREIT [ph] definition was $0.37, up from $0.34 last year, an 8.8% increase and $0.02 higher than first call consensus. Improved performances attributable to higher NOI contribution from the operating portfolio, lower G&A expenses and higher transactional income from our investment in Albertsons, which contributed $6.5 million or $0.015 per share growth year-over-year. FFO as adjusted or recurring FFO, which excludes nonoperating impairments and transactional income and expense, was $0.36 per diluted share for the first quarter, up from $0.34 last year, a 5.9% increase. This level of per share growth was achieved even after a $0.055 per share diluted impact from the significant transformational portfolio, including the substantial liquidation of our shared assets in Mexico totaling $480 million, nonstrategic U.S. asset sales of $850 million and the impact from currency fluctuations. The diluted impact was more than offset by the purchase of 5 quality assets totaling $2.1 billion over the past year, many from our joint venture programs including the King Stone acquisition during the first quarter and by a reduced debt clause from refinancing higher coupon debt. 
Our portfolio operating team kicked off the year with solid results, bringing U.S. same-site NOI growth of 3.2% and combined same-site NOI growth, which includes Canada, 3% before the negative 100 basis point impact on currency. The same-site NOI growth was achieved primarily from top line revenue growth generated from increased occupancy, which is 95.7% from both the U.S. and the combined portfolios. 
Leasing spreads were strong with a 19.1% increase on new leases signed and 8.1% from renewals and options, bringing combined leasing expense to 10.1% from the first quarter. We were very active on the capital raising font. During the quarter, we saw the new $650 million term loan with a final maturity in 2020 priced at LIBOR plus 95 basis points. We used the proceeds to repay a $400 million term loan which was priced at LIBOR plus 1 05 and to partially fund the King Stone purchase. In addition, we issued a $350 million 30-year bond and a coupon of 4.25% yielding 4.31% including the the lowest 30-year coupon in the REIT industry and extending our weighted average maturity profile by 2 years. As a result of the significant acquisition volume in the first quarter, our net debt to recurring EBITDA is 6.6x and 6.4x when you pro forma for the full quarter EBITDA from the King Stone acquisition which was closed in February. We expect to bring net debt to recurring EBITDA back to 6x by the end of the year, consistent with our stated objective of operating in the 5.5x to 6x range. Our liquidity position is in excellent shape, ending the quarter with over $1.6 billion available on our revolving credit facility and as another source of low-cost capital. 
Based on our strong first quarter results and expectations for the balance of the year, we are raising our headline FFO per share guidance range to $1.50 to $1.55 from the previous range of $1.45 to $1.53. The headline FFO guidance range includes $32.4 million or $0.08 per share gain from the partial monetization of our SUPERVALU investment, which was completed during the second quarter. We are also increasing our FFO as adjusted per share guidance range to $1.42 to $1.45 from the initial range of $1.40 to $1.44. We are reaffirming our operating guidance assumptions for occupancy of 25 to 50 basis points and U.S. same size NOI growth of 3% to 3.5% as well as our acquisition and disposition [indiscernible]. Keep in mind the guidance range is sensitive to timing of acquisitions, dispositions and financing initiatives. And with that, I'll turn it over to Conor."

Today, I will start by recapping our progress on acquisitions and dispositions, followed by updates on our development and redevelopment pipeline and finishing with a quick recap of the operating metrics. Overal",1179,"Thanks Glenn, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will start by recapping our progress on acquisitions and dispositions, followed by updates on our development and redevelopment pipeline and finishing with a quick recap of the operating metrics. 
Overall, we had a good start to the year and are pleased with the team effort that showcases how Kimco continues to execute on all fronts. The evolution of the open-air shopping center gives our talented team a tremendous opportunity to enhance net asset value. We continue to execute on our transformation and simplification strategy with the previously announced closing of the King Stone transaction. At the time of closing, the cap rate on the portfolio was approximately 6% and it has since performed above our own internal expectations. 
In addition, we acquired Sprouts anchor center at Houston, also at a fixed cap, which gives us control of 3 corners at the dominant intersection of Highway 6 and Spencer Road. We also acquired 4 adjacent parcels to our Tier 1 portfolio as we look to expand our footprint promote where we see the opportunity for future redevelopment. The acquisitions market remains red-hot and we remain disciplined. We continue to be selective about targets and are focused on unlocking opportunities at strategic locations within our core markets. 
The disposition market has not shown any signs of slowing down, with cap rates continuing to compress for dominant secondary market assets. The definition of core appears to be shifting with numerous buyers going to step out on the risk spectrum for a slightly higher yield. We sold 6 shopping centers this quarter at an average implied cap rate of 7.25% in addition to 37 triple net assets for $10 million gain. We plan to have the final phase of our disposition program complete by the end of the year and then we'll take a fresh look annually on how to continue to improve the portfolio by selling our lowest tranche and mass funding those proceeds into our redevelopment and development activities. 
In the first quarter, we completed 12 redevelopment projects at a cost of $35 million, giving us a return on investment of 11.7% which was 114 basis points higher than our original estimates. Notable completions this quarter include: the Whole Foods at Pompano Beach; the 2-level public center Miller Road asset in Miami; and the opening of Nordstrom Rack at [indiscernible]. The redevelopment pipeline is focused on the emerging trend of adding traditional and specialty grocers to our Tier 1 power centers. This quarter, we completed and have now under construction 12 grocery stores, including 2 Whole Foods, 2 Publix, 2 Safeways, 2 Fresh Thyme Farmers Markets, as 2 [indiscernible] at Harris Teeter, a lucky, and a Trader Joe's. These projects now bring our total percent of ABR from a grocery anchor center to 71.2%, up from 65.8% last quarter. We believe this is the sweet spot for redevelopment as we identify and incentivize our team to execute on creating a grocery opportunity that boost daily traffic and surrounding retailer sales, and ultimately improves NAV. We have made great strides [indiscernible] as a unique way for Kimco to create significant value and have improved from 56.3% in 2010 to over 70% today. 
In addition, this quarter, we broke ground on the mixed-use redevelopment in Columbia, Maryland where we ground leased a portion of the grocery anchored asset to an apartment developer who is now under construction, adding 230 units to complement our retail at Wild Lake. Currently, we have a total of $289 million in asset redevelopment projects, with another $659 million in the design and entitlement phase, and $117 million that is currently under review. For the quarter, redevelopment added 70 basis points to our same-site NOI. 
Moving to development. Our development pipeline remains on track and each development is a special case where we feel the team has sourced an opportunity to either expand upon a successful asset or add an additional Tier 1 asset in our core markets. Whole Foods is under construction and on schedule for a mid-2016 opening. The 3 other development projects are in the early stages of securing entitlements and we will soon be announcing major anchor signings. The [indiscernible] of each project sits along I-95 and adjacent to the Fort Lauderdale airport and our successful Oakwood shopping center. The Christiana, Delaware project also sits along I-95 and is adjacent to GGP's Christiana Mall. And finally, our Grand Parkway project sits along the new Grand Parkway in close proximity to the new Exxon Mobil campus in the [indiscernible] of Houston. 
The lack of supply and strong retailer demand has given us confidence that we will be able to achieve a risk-adjusted return on each of these projects between 200 to 300 basis points above exit [ph] cap rates and provide the company with long term assets and help boost internal growth in major gateway cities. I'm very proud of our leasing team and their achievements for the first quarter, historically the most challenging quarter from an occupancy perspective. For the first time in 5 years, we were able to maintain our U.S. pro rata occupancy from prior quarter. This is no small feat on the portfolio of our size, and the credit goes to all those hardworking deal-makers. 
The small shop occupancy drove the performance with an increase in pro rata occupancy of 88.2%, a 20 basis point increase from prior quarter, a 260 basis point increase from the prior year first quarter. We achieved this in spite of RadioShack's bankruptcy filing which had a negative 20 basis point drag on our small shop occupancy. Our combined leasing spreads were over 10% this quarter, an improvement over the prior year and were boosted by new deals with Whole Foods, Publix and our first Stew Leonard's. We welcome Stew Leonard's to anchor our Airport Plaza in Farmingdale, Long Island. Stew Leonard's, who is also known as the Disneyland of dairy restores, will be the only Stew Leonard's on all Long Island and create a one-of-a-kind signature asset. 
In closing, we continue to see improving fundamentals across the major venture markets in the U.S. and believe the slow recovery will soon take hold of the middle-class that will provide a further boost to our retail sales. the U.S. same-site NOI improved 3.2% due to the positive boost of net absorption, redevelopment and less-than-anticipated tenant follow-up. The ABR portfolio is up 6.2% year-over-year, an increase from $13.18 to $14. Our new leases are being signed at $17.35, 24% above our current average base rent, showcasing the significant embedded value and the mark-to-market opportunity we have here at Kimco. We remain focused on improving net asset value through aggressive early terminations, dynamic redevelopments, adding grocery components, diligent small shop leasing and adding density to unlock value. We are ahead of our internal plan for the year, thanks to our talented team and strengthened portfolio. But as you have heard us say many times, there's more work to do. And with that, I'll turn it over to Milton for his final comments."

We have an open dialogue with Whole Foods. As you've heard in my remarks, we had a number of deals pending with them in different forms of construction. so we do think that it's going to be an added benefit to our portfolio, especially when you look at the size that they're considering because many times when we try and add a grocery component to one of our assets, the size of the box sometimes restricts what kind of retailers we can add. So I think their price point going after the millennials, trying to probably be a little bit more competitive with some of the new specialty grocer concept have done so well in the recent years, I think that's their strategy. And I think it's a good one because I think they have, for a long time, been the highest price point in terms of the grocery sector. And I think if they launched a competitive line of millennial targeted grocery stores, I think it will fit nicely within our portfolio and others."

We are very pleased to report strong first quarter financial results and operating metrics. Glenn and Conor will cover the specific details, but the solid fundamentals of our portfolio continued to drive excellent FFO earnings growth and same-site NOI increases. Small shop occupancy improvements are particularly encouraging as the economy continues to recover. While recent retail sales growth has been modest, national retailers are still committed to robust expansion plans, all in the face of a declining inventory of retail space. Discounters and service-oriented tenants, such as theaters, health clubs and restaurants, continue to expand rapidly, helping to increase effective rents and occupancy in our portfolio and across the open air shopping center sector. Lower gas prices are also expected to give a boost to consumer spending and in a good sign for shopping centers. Rich Moore of RBC continues to point to 5-year high levels of planned new store openings, while Craig Schmidt of BofA Merrill notes the recovery of retailers focusing on the middle class. The renewed strength of middle-class purchasing power is expected to disproportionately benefit neighborhood and community shopping centers anchored by conventional grocery stores, casual and fast-casual dining and discount anchors such as Walmart, Target and Kohl's.
Overall, we feel terrific going into 2015 as new supply remains muted despite population growth, growing household formation and the slow but steady growth of the U.S. economy.
With respect to our overall strategy, we've essentially completed our exit from Latin America, with pending deals on our last shopping center in Mexico and various land parcels. We also continue to take advantage of a strong market for shopping centers, even in secondary markets, by selling both our second tier assets as well as those located outside our long-term growth markets. Our U.S. property dispositions, in total, are on track, with all of the identified assets largely sold or targeted to be under contract by year-end, this potential. 
In general, sales proceeds from our dispositions are being recycled into our large pipeline of redevelopment projects, selected new developments and purchases of our institutional partners' ownership interest in existing Kimco assets. We believe these activities in general are excellent accretive investments and superior to the acquisition auctions of high-quality stabilized shopping centers owned by third parties. Our recent Blackstone purchase, for example, allowed us to fully consolidate 39 high-quality properties we have managed and leased for approximately 10 years. We know these assets and we know these markets very well, and we are excited about their long-term growth potential.
We have also increased our efforts to purchase out parcels or retail properties adjacent to or within existing high-quality properties we already own. These acquisitions are usually very accretive and increase our scale and leasing leverage in some of our very best properties.
Looking at our Canadian operations. Our occupancy remains strong at approximately 96%, and our Target exposure is fully covered by parent company guarantees on all 9 of our Target Canada leases. Interest from other retailers is growing, and we believe at least 8 of our 9 Target stores will find new anchors this year.
Also, as noted in prior statements, we have begun to selectively sell certain Canadian properties where we can benefit from historic low cap rates and high institutional demand. RioCan, our largest Canadian partner, has purchased our 50% interest in 3 of our RioKim joint venture properties, comprising 545,000 square feet while concurrently selling us their 80% interest in a premium joint venture property we originally developed and currently manage in Dallas-Fort Worth.
Our RioCan venture is also selling 2 large properties in Québec in areas where we believe growth will be constrained.
On a separate topic, we continue to be pleased with both our SUPERVALU and Safeway investments. SUPERVALU reported excellent quarterly results, and we took the opportunity last week to partially monetize our SUPERVALU stock at large game. In addition, the Safeway Albertson's integration is proceeding well under Bob Miller's direction. While the Safeway investment headlines are Plus business, it is important to note that over the years, we have completed many smaller transactions within the Plus business, which have led to either individual property sale-leasebacks or acquisitions of retailer-owned real estate. Generally, these investments have been off-market, a direct result of our relationship with retailers, their advisory firms and private equity contacts.
As a final comment, Glen and our treasury team continue to do a wonderful job in the capital markets. Our first ever 30-year unsecured bond was a particularly noteworthy achievement and helped stagger our debt maturities while taking advantage of today's low interest rates. Now I'd like to turn it to Glenn, Conor and Milton for their comments."
320371,288886754,809110,"Kimco Realty Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 07, 2015",2015-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Kimco Realty Corporation","Executives","Thanks, David, and good morning. 2015 is off to a strong start. Our solid first quarter results are the product of strong execution on all fronts, including leasing, acquisitions, dispositions, redevelopments and capital raising. As we reported last night",653,"Thanks, David, and good morning. 2015 is off to a strong start. Our solid first quarter results are the product of strong execution on all fronts, including leasing, acquisitions, dispositions, redevelopments and capital raising. As we reported last night, headline FFO per share, which represents the official NAREIT definition, was $0.37, up from $0.34 last year, an 8.8% increase and $0.02 higher than first call consensus.
Improved performances attributable to higher NOI contribution from the operating portfolio, lower G&A expenses and higher transactional income from our investment in Albertsons, which contributed $6.5 million or $0.015 per share growth year-over-year. FFO as adjusted or recurring FFO, which excludes nonoperating impairments and transactional income and expense, was $0.36 per diluted share for the first quarter, up from $0.34 last year, a 5.9% increase. This level of per share growth was achieved even after a $0.055 per share diluted impact from the significant transformational portfolio, including the substantial liquidation of our shared assets in Mexico totaling $480 million, nonstrategic U.S. asset sales of $850 million and the impact from currency fluctuations. The diluted impact was more than offset by the purchase of 5 quality assets totaling $2.1 billion over the past year, many from our joint venture programs including the Kimstone acquisition during the first quarter and by a reduced debt clause from refinancing higher coupon debt.
Our portfolio operating team kicked off the year with solid results, delivering U.S. same-site NOI growth of 3.2% and combined same-site NOI growth, which includes Canada, of 3% before the negative 100 basis point impact on currency. The same-site NOI growth was achieved primarily from top line revenue growth generated from increased occupancy, which is 95.7% from both the U.S. and the combined portfolios.
Leasing spreads were strong with a 19.1% increase on new leases signed and 8.1% from renewals and options, bringing combined leasing expense to 10.1% in the first quarter.
We were very active on the capital raising font. During the quarter, we saw the new $650 million term loan with a final maturity in 2020 priced at LIBOR plus 95 basis points. We used the proceeds to repay a $400 million term loan, which was priced at LIBOR plus 105 and to partially fund the Kimstone purchase. In addition, we issued a $350 million 30-year bond and a coupon of 4.25% yielding 4.31%, including the lowest 30-year coupon in the REIT industry and extending our weighted average maturity profile by 2 years.
As a result of the significant acquisition volume in the first quarter, our net debt to recurring EBITDA is 6.6x and 6.4x when you pro forma for the full quarter EBITDA from the Kimstone acquisition, which was closed in February. We expect to bring net debt to recurring EBITDA back to 6x by the end of the year, consistent with our stated objective of operating in the 5.5x to 6x range. Our liquidity position is in excellent shape, ending the quarter with over $1.6 billion available on our revolving credit facility and as another source of low-cost capital.
Based on our strong first quarter results and expectations for the balance of the year, we are raising our headline FFO per share guidance range to $1.50 to $1.55 from the previous range of $1.45 to $1.53. The headline FFO guidance range includes $32.4 million or $0.08 per share gain from the partial monetization of our SUPERVALU investment, which was completed during the second quarter. We are also increasing our FFO as adjusted per share guidance range to $1.42 to $1.45 from the initial range of $1.40 to $1.44. We are reaffirming our operating guidance assumptions for occupancy of 25 to 50 basis points and U.S. same-site NOI growth of 3% to 3.5% as well as our acquisition and disposition targets. Keep in mind the guidance range is sensitive to timing of acquisitions, dispositions and financing initiatives. And with that, I'll turn it over to Conor."

Today, I will start by recapping our progress on acquisitions and dispositions, followed by updates on our development and redevelopment pipeline and finishing with a quick recap of the operating metrics. Overal",1181,"Thanks Glenn, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will start by recapping our progress on acquisitions and dispositions, followed by updates on our development and redevelopment pipeline and finishing with a quick recap of the operating metrics. 
Overall, we had a good start to the year and are pleased with the team effort that showcases how Kimco continues to execute on all fronts. The evolution of the open-air shopping center gives our talented team a tremendous opportunity to enhance net asset value. We continue to execute on our transformation and simplification strategy with the previously announced closing of the Kimstone transaction. At the time of closing, the cap rate on the portfolio was approximately 6% and it has since performed above our own internal expectations.
In addition, we acquired Sprouts-anchored center at Houston, also at a fixed cap, which gives us control of 3 corners at the dominant intersection of Highway 6 and Spencer Road. We also acquired 4 adjacent parcels to our Tier 1 portfolio as we look to expand our footprint, where we see the opportunity for future redevelopment. The acquisitions market remains red-hot and we remain disciplined. We continue to be selective about targets and are focused on unlocking opportunities at strategic locations within our core markets.
The disposition market does not shown any signs of slowing down, with cap rates continuing to compress for dominant secondary market assets. The definition of core appears to be shifting with numerous buyers willing to step out on the risk spectrum for a slightly higher yield. We sold 6 shopping centers this quarter at an average implied cap rate of 7.25% in addition to 37 triple net assets for $10 million gain. We plan to have the final phase of our disposition program complete by the end of the year, and then we'll take a fresh look annually on how to continue to improve the portfolio by selling our lowest tranche and mass funding those proceeds into our redevelopment and development activities.
In the first quarter, we completed 12 redevelopment projects at a cost of $35 million, giving us a return on investment of 11.7%, which was 114 basis points higher than our original estimates. Notable completions this quarter include: the Whole Foods at Pompano Beach; the 2-level Publix at our Miller Road asset, Miami; and the opening of Nordstrom Rack at Redfield Promenade.
The redevelopment pipeline is focused on the emerging trend of adding traditional and specialty grocers to our Tier 1 power centers. This quarter, we completed and have under construction 12 grocery stores, including 2 Whole Foods, 2 Publix, 2 Safeways, 2 Fresh Thyme Farmers Markets, a Stew Leonard's, a Harris Teeter, a Lucky, and a Trader Joe's. These projects now bring our total percent of ABR from a grocery-anchored center to 71.2%, up from 65.8% last quarter. We believe this is the sweet spot for our redevelopment as we identify and incentivize our team to execute on creating a grocery opportunity that boost daily traffic and surrounding retailer sales, and ultimately improves NAV. We have made great strides with this initiatives as a unique way for Kimco to create significant value and have improve of 56.3% in 2010 to over 70% today.
In addition, this quarter, we broke ground on the mixed-use redevelopment in Columbia, Maryland, where we ground leased a portion of the grocery-anchored asset to an apartment developer, who is now under construction, adding 230 units to complement our retail at Wild Lake.
Currently, we have a total of $289 million in asset redevelopment projects, with another $659 million in the design and entitlement phase and $117 million that is currently under review. For the quarter, redevelopment added 70 basis points to our same-site NOI.
Moving to development. Our development pipeline remains on track and each development is a special case where we feel the team has sourced an opportunity to either expand upon a successful asset or add an additional Tier 1 asset in our core markets. Whole Foods in Wynnewood is under construction and on schedule for a mid-2016 opening.
The 3 other development projects are in the early stages of securing entitlements, and we will soon be announcing major anchor signings. The Dania Beach project sits along I-95 and adjacent to the Fort Lauderdale airport and our successful Oakwood shopping center. The Christiana, Delaware project also sits along I-95 and is adjacent to GGP's Christiana Mall. And finally, our Grand Parkway project sits along the new Grand Parkway in close proximity to the new Exxon Mobil campus in the Woodlands area of Houston.
The lack of supply and strong retailer demand has given us confidence that we will be able to achieve a risk-adjusted return on each of these projects between 200 to 300 basis points above exit cap rates and provide the company with long-term hold assets and help boost internal growth in major gateway cities.
I am very proud of our leasing team and their achievements for the first quarter, historically the most challenging quarter from an occupancy perspective. For the first time in 5 years, we were able to maintain our U.S. pro rata occupancy from prior quarter. This is no small feat on a portfolio of our size, and the credit goes to all those hardworking deal makers.
The small shop occupancy drove the performance with an increase in pro rata occupancy to 88.2%, a 20 basis point increase from prior quarter, a 260 basis point increase from the prior year first quarter. We achieved this in spite of RadioShack's bankruptcy filing, which had a negative 20 basis point drag on our small shop occupancy.
Our combined leasing spreads were over 10% this quarter, an improvement over the prior year, and were boosted by new deals with Whole Foods, Publix and our first Stew Leonard's. We welcome Stew Leonard's to anchor our Airport Plaza in Farmingdale, Long Island. Stew Leonard's, who is also known as the Disneyland of dairy stores, will be the only Stew Leonard's on all Long Island and create a one-of-a-kind signature asset.
In closing, we continue to see improving fundamentals across the major venture markets in the U.S. and believe the slow recovery will soon take hold of the middle class that will provide a further boost to our retailer sales.
The U.S. same-site NOI improved 3.2% due to the positive boost of net absorption, redevelopment and less-than-anticipated tenant follow-up. The ABR portfolio is up 6.2% year-over-year, an increase from $13.18 to $14.
Our new leases are being signed at $17.35, 24% above our current average base rent, showcasing the significant embedded value and the mark-to-market opportunity we have here at Kimco. We remain focused on improving net asset value through aggressive early terminations, dynamic redevelopments, adding grocery components, diligent small shop leasing and adding density to unlock value. We are ahead of our internal plan for the year, thanks to our talented team and strengthened portfolio. But as you have heard us say many times, there's more work to do.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Milton for his final comments."

Not only is that a staggering figure in and of itself, it is a size that represents an equity market cap that is larger than many of our peers, but it's also reflective of the transformation of our portfolio. The result? Our portfolio is now better located, of high quality, more resilient and offers tremendous growth opportunities for redevelopment.
A transformation, however, is not limited to our portfolio. It extends to our management team as well. And this is what I'm most enthused about. Our transformed management team led by our future CEO, Conor Flynn, is a unique blend of energy, talent and experience. With our new Chief Investment Officer, Ross Cooper; and our new Executive Vice President of Asset Management, David Jameson, who joins Conor, Glenn, Ray Edwards, and our spectacular and pragmatic General Counsel, Bruce Rubenstein, I believe we have several -- an executive dream team at Kimco.
But that's not all. I've often trumpeted our deep bench strength at Kimco. And that phrase sometimes connotes the backup team and nothing could be further from reality. At our headquarters and in our regions, we have many talented leaders, who are moving Kimco forward every day. These include Will Teichman, a senior Director of Strategic Operations; Chris Freeman, our Vice President of Property Management; and Tom Taddeo, our Chief Investment Officer, and there were many others. And I've watched these talented individuals grow over the years, and I'm even more excited to see what they will accomplish in the years to come.

As you've heard in my remarks, we have a number of deals pending with them in different forms of construction. So we do think that it's going to be an added benefit to our portfolio, especially when you look at the size that they're considering because many times when we try and add a grocery component to one of our assets, the size of the box sometimes restricts what kind of retailers we can add. So I think their price point going after the millennials, trying to probably be a little bit more competitive with some of the new specialty grocery concepts that have done so well in the recent years. I think that's their strategy, and I think it's a good one because I think that they have, for a long time, been the highest price point in terms of the grocery sector. And I think if they launched a competitive line of millennial-targeted grocery stores, I think it will fit nicely within our portfolio and others."

As I mentioned, it's 6.4x today when you really pro forma in the full amount of the EBITDA, right? We closed in the beginning of February, so you're missing a full month of EBITDA. So you have to really start at that 6.4x. And then we have multiple options and levers to pull. Selling the SUPERVALU stock is one piece to it, which happened in the second quarter, so that will help bring down leverage. And that's an asset sitting on our books that had no EBITDA, so the cash will go to reduce debt there. We have the balance of our sales that we're working through as well.

We are very pleased to report strong first quarter financial results and operating metrics. Glenn and Conor will cover the specific details, but the solid fundamentals of our portfolio continued to drive excellent FFO earnings growth and same-site NOI increases. Small shop occupancy improvements are particularly encouraging as the economy continues to recover. While recent retail sales growth has been modest, national retailers are still committed to robust expansion plans, all in the face of a declining inventory of retail space. Discounters and service-oriented tenants, such as theaters, health clubs and restaurants, continue to expand rapidly, helping to increase effective rents and occupancy in our portfolio and across the open air shopping center sector. Lower gas prices are also expected to give a boost to consumer spending and in a good sign for shopping centers. Rich Moore of RBC continues to point to 5-year high levels of planned new store openings, while Craig Schmidt of BofA Merrill notes a recovery of retailers focusing on the middle class. The renewed strength of middle-class purchasing power is expected to disproportionately benefit neighborhood and community shopping centers anchored by conventional grocery stores, casual and fast-casual dining and discount anchors such as Walmart, Target and Kohl's.
Overall, we feel terrific going into 2015 as new supply remains muted despite population growth, growing household formation and the slow but steady growth of the U.S. economy.
With respect to our overall strategy, we've essentially completed our exit from Latin America, with pending deals on our last shopping center in Mexico and various land parcels. We also continue to take advantage of a strong market for shopping centers, even in secondary markets, by selling both our second tier assets as well as those located outside our long-term growth markets. Our U.S. property dispositions, in total, are on track, with all of the identified assets largely sold or targeted to be under contract by year-end, this potential. 
In general, sales proceeds from our dispositions are being recycled into our large pipeline of redevelopment projects, selective new developments and purchases of our institutional partners' ownership interest in existing Kimco assets. We believe these activities in general are excellent accretive investments and superior to the acquisition auctions of high-quality stabilized shopping centers owned by third parties. Our recent Blackstone purchase, for example, allowed us to fully consolidate 39 high-quality properties we have managed and leased for approximately 10 years. We know these assets and we know these markets very well, and we are excited about their long-term growth potential.
We have also increased our efforts to purchase out parcels or retail properties adjacent to or within existing high-quality properties we already own. These acquisitions are usually very accretive and increase our scale and leasing leverage in some of our very best properties.
Looking at our Canadian operations. Our occupancy remains strong at approximately 96%, and our Target exposure is fully covered by parent company guarantees on all 9 of our Target Canada leases. Interest from other retailers is growing, and we believe at least 8 of our 9 Target stores will find new anchors this year.
Also, as noted in prior statements, we have begun to selectively sell certain Canadian properties where we can benefit from historic low cap rates and high institutional demand. RioCan, our largest Canadian partner, has purchased our 50% interest in 3 of our RioKim joint venture properties, comprising 545,000 square feet while concurrently selling us their 80% interest in a premium joint venture property we originally developed and currently manage in Dallas-Fort Worth.
Our RioCan venture is also selling 2 large properties in Québec in areas where we believe growth will be constrained.
On a separate topic, we continue to be pleased with both our SUPERVALU and Safeway investments. SUPERVALU reported excellent quarterly results, and we took the opportunity last week to partially monetize our SUPERVALU stock at a large gain. In addition, the Safeway Albertson's integration is proceeding well under Bob Miller's direction. While the Safeway investment headlines are Plus business, it is important to note that over the years, we have completed many smaller transactions within the Plus business, which have led to either individual property sale-leasebacks or acquisitions of retailer-owned real estate. Generally, these investments have been off-market, a direct result of our relationship with retailers, their advisory firms and private equity contacts.
As a final comment, Glen and our treasury team continue to do a wonderful job in the capital markets. Our first ever 30-year unsecured bond was a particularly noteworthy achievement and helped stagger our debt maturities while taking advantage of today's low interest rates. Now I'd like to turn it to Glenn, Conor and Milton for their comments."
320371,288886754,809280,"Kimco Realty Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 07, 2015",2015-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Kimco Realty Corporation","Executives","Thanks, David, and good morning. 2015 is off to a strong start. Our solid first quarter results are the product of strong execution on all fronts, including leasing, acquisitions, dispositions, redevelopments and capital raising. As we reported last night",656,"Thanks, David, and good morning. 2015 is off to a strong start. Our solid first quarter results are the product of strong execution on all fronts, including leasing, acquisitions, dispositions, redevelopments and capital raising. As we reported last night, headline FFO per share, which represents the official NAREIT definition, was $0.37, up from $0.34 last year, an 8.8% increase and $0.02 higher than first call consensus.
The improved performances is attributable to higher NOI contribution from the operating portfolio, lower G&A expenses and higher transactional income from our investment in Albertsons, which contributed $6.5 million or $0.015 per share growth year-over-year. FFO as adjusted or recurring FFO, which excludes nonoperating impairments and transactional income and expense, was $0.36 per diluted share for the first quarter, up from $0.34 last year, a 5.9% increase. This level of per share growth was achieved even after a $0.055 per share diluted impact from the significant transformational portfolio, including the substantial liquidation of our share of assets in Mexico totaling $480 million, nonstrategic U.S. asset sales of $850 million and the impact from currency fluctuations. The diluted impact was more than offset by the purchase of 5 quality assets totaling $2.1 billion over the past year, many from our joint venture programs including the Kimstone acquisition during the first quarter, and by our reduced debt cost from refinancing higher coupon debt.
Our portfolio operating team kicked off the year with solid results, delivering U.S. same-site NOI growth of 3.2% and combined same-site NOI growth, which includes Canada, of 3%, before the negative 100 basis point impact on currency. The same-site NOI growth was achieved primarily from top line revenue growth generated from increased occupancy, which is 95.7% for both the U.S. and the combined portfolios.
Leasing spreads were strong with a 19.1% increase on new leases signed and 8.1% for renewals and options, bringing combined leasing expense to 10.1% for the first quarter.
We were very active on the capital raising front. During the quarter, we sourced a new $650 million term loan with a final maturity in 2020 priced at LIBOR plus 95 basis points. We used the proceeds to repay a $400 million term loan, which was priced at LIBOR plus 105 and to partially fund the Kimstone purchase. In addition, we issued a $350 million 30-year bond and a coupon of 4.25% yielding 4.31%, including the lowest 30-year coupon in the REIT industry and extending our weighted average maturity profile by 2 years.
As a result of the significant acquisition volume in the first quarter, our net debt to recurring EBITDA is 6.6x and 6.4x when you pro forma for the full quarter EBITDA from the Kimstone acquisition, which was closed in February. We expect to bring net debt to recurring EBITDA back to 6x by the end of the year, consistent with our stated objective of operating in a 5.5x to 6x range. Our liquidity position is in excellent shape, ending the quarter with over $1.6 billion available on our revolving credit facility and as another source of low-cost capital.
Based on our strong first quarter results and expectations for the balance of the year, we are raising our headline FFO per share guidance range to $1.50 to $1.55 from the previous range of $1.45 to $1.53. The headline FFO guidance range includes $32.4 million or $0.08 per share gain from the partial monetization of our SUPERVALU investment, which was completed during the second quarter. We are also increasing our FFO as adjusted per share guidance range to $1.42 to $1.45 from the initial range of $1.40 to $1.44. We are reaffirming our operating guidance assumptions for occupancy of 25 to 50 basis points and U.S. same-site NOI growth of 3% to 3.5%, as well as our acquisition and disposition targets. Keep in mind the guidance range is sensitive to timing of acquisitions, dispositions and financing initiatives. And with that, I'll turn it over to Conor."

Today, I will start by recapping our progress on acquisitions and dispositions, followed by updates on our development and redevelopment pipeline and finishing with a quick recap of the operating metrics. Overal",1186,"Thanks Glenn, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will start by recapping our progress on acquisitions and dispositions, followed by updates on our development and redevelopment pipeline and finishing with a quick recap of the operating metrics. 
Overall, we had a good start to the year and are pleased with the team effort that showcases how Kimco continues to execute on all fronts. The evolution of the open-air shopping center gives our talented team a tremendous opportunity to enhance net asset value. We continue to execute on our transformation and simplification strategy with the previously announced closing of the Kimstone transaction. At the time of closing, the cap rate on the portfolio was approximately 6% and it has since performed above our own internal expectations.
In addition, we acquired a Sprouts-anchored center in Houston, also at a 6 cap, which gives us control of 3 corners at the dominant intersection of Highway 6 and Spencer Road. We also acquired 4 adjacent parcels to our Tier 1 portfolio as we look to expand our footprint, where we see the opportunity for future redevelopment. The acquisitions market remains red-hot and we remain disciplined. We continue to be selective about targets and are focused on unlocking opportunities at strategic locations within our core markets.
The disposition market does not shown any signs of slowing down, with cap rates continuing to compress for dominant secondary market assets. The definition of core appears to be shifting with numerous buyers willing to step out on the risk spectrum for a slightly higher yield. We sold 6 shopping centers this quarter at an average implied cap rate of 7.25% in addition to 37 triple net assets for a $10 million gain. We plan to have the final phase of our disposition program complete by the end of the year, and then we'll take a fresh look annually on how to continue to improve the portfolio by selling our lowest tranche and mass funding those proceeds into our redevelopment and development activities.
In the first quarter, we completed 12 redevelopment projects at a cost of $35 million, giving us a return on investment of 11.7%, which was 114 basis points higher than our original estimates. Notable completions this quarter include: the Whole Foods at Pompano Beach; the 2-level Publix at our Miller Road asset, Miami; and the opening of Nordstrom Rack at Redfield Promenade.
The redevelopment pipeline is focused on the emerging trend of a adding traditional and specialty grocers to our Tier 1 power centers. This quarter, we completed and have under construction 12 grocery stores, including 2 Whole Foods, 2 Publix, 2 Safeways, 2 Fresh Thyme Farmers Markets, a Stew Leonard's, a Harris Teeter, a Lucky, and a Trader Joe's. These projects now bring our total percent of ABR from a grocery-anchored center to 71.2%, up from 65.8% last quarter. We believe this is the sweet spot for our redevelopments as we identify and incentivize our team to execute on creating a grocery opportunity that boosts daily traffic and surrounding retailer sales, and ultimately improves NAV. We have made great strides with this initiatives as a unique way for Kimco to create significant value and have improved from 56.3% in 2010 to over 70% today.
In addition, this quarter, we broke ground on the mixed-use redevelopment in Columbia, Maryland, where we ground leased a portion of the grocery-anchored asset to an apartment developer, who is now under construction, adding 230 units to complement our retail at Wild Lake.
Currently, we have a total of $289 million in active redevelopment projects, with another $659 million in the design and entitlement phase and $117 million that is currently under review. For the quarter, redevelopment added 70 basis points to our same-site NOI.
Moving to development. Our development pipeline remains on track and each development is a special case where we feel the team has sourced an opportunity to either expand upon a successful asset or add an additional Tier 1 asset in our core markets. Whole Foods at Wynnewood is under construction and on schedule for a mid-2016 opening.
The 3 other development projects are in the early stages of securing entitlements, and we will soon be announcing major anchor signings. The Dania Beach project sits along I-95 and adjacent to the Fort Lauderdale airport and our successful Oakwood shopping center. The Christiana, Delaware project also sits along I-95 and is adjacent to GGP's Christiana Mall. And finally, our Grand Parkway project sits along the new Grand Parkway in close proximity to the new Exxon Mobil campus in the Woodlands area of Houston.
The lack of supply and strong retailer demand has given us confidence that we will be able to achieve a risk-adjusted return on each of these projects between 200 to 300 basis points above exit cap rates, and provide the company with long-term hold assets and help boost internal growth in major gateway cities.
I am very proud of our leasing team and their achievements for the first quarter, historically the most challenging quarter from an occupancy perspective. For the first time in 5 years, we were able to maintain our U.S. pro rata occupancy from prior quarter. This is no small feat on a portfolio of our size, and the credit goes to all those hardworking deal makers.
The small shop occupancy drove the performance with an increase in pro rata occupancy to 88.2%, a 20 basis point increase from prior quarter, a 260 basis point increase over prior year first quarter. We achieved this in spite of RadioShack's bankruptcy filing, which had a negative 20 basis point drag on our small shop occupancy.
Our combined leasing spreads were over 10% this quarter, an improvement over the prior year, and were boosted by new deals with Whole Foods, Publix and our first Stew Leonard's. We welcome Stew Leonard's to anchor our Airport Plaza in Farmingdale, Long Island. Stew Leonard's, who is also known as the Disneyland of dairy stores, will be the only Stew Leonard's on all of Long Island and create a one-of-a-kind signature asset.
In closing, we continue to see improving fundamentals across the major metro markets in the U.S. and believe the slow recovery will soon take hold of the middle class that will provide a further boost to our retailer sales.
The U.S. same-site NOI improved 3.2% due to the positive boost of net absorption, redevelopment and less-than-anticipated tenant fallout. The ABR of the portfolio is up 6.2% year-over-year, an increase from $13.18 to $14.
Our new leases are being signed at $17.35, 24% above our current average base rent, showcasing the significant embedded value and the mark-to-market opportunity we have here at Kimco. We remain focused on improving net asset value through aggressive early terminations, dynamic redevelopments, adding grocery components, diligent small shop leasing and adding density to unlock value. We are ahead of our internal plan for the year, thanks to our talented team and strengthened portfolio. But as you have heard us say many times, there's more work to do.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Milton for his final comments."

Since the announcement of our transformation strategy at our 2010 Investment Day, we have bought and sold over $5 billion for properties. Think about that for a moment. Not only is that a staggering figure in and of itself, it is a size that represents an equity market cap that is larger than many of our peers, but it's also reflective of the transformation of our portfolio. The result? Our portfolio is now better located, of higher quality, more resilient and offers tremendous growth opportunities for redevelopment.
A transformation, however, is not limited to our portfolio. It extends to our management team as well. And this is what I'm most enthused about. Our transformed management team led by our future CEO, Conor Flynn, is a unique blend of energy, talent and experience. With our new Chief Investment Officer, Ross Cooper; and our new Executive Vice President of Asset Management, David Jamieson, who joins Conor, Glenn, Ray Edwards, and our spectacular and pragmatic General Counsel, Bruce Rubenstein, I believe we have several -- an executive dream team at Kimco.
But that's not all. I've often trumpeted our deep bench strength at Kimco. And that phrase sometimes connotes a backup team and nothing could be further from reality. At our headquarters and in our regions, we have many talented leaders, who are moving Kimco forward every day. These include Will Teichman, our senior Director of Strategic Operations; Chris Freeman, our Vice President of Property Management; and Tom Taddeo, our Chief Investment Officer, and there are many others.

As I mentioned, it's 6.4x today when you really pro forma in the full amount of the EBITDA, right? We closed in the beginning of February, so you're missing a full month of EBITDA. So you have to really start at that 6.4x. And then we have multiple options and levers to pull. Selling the SUPERVALU stock is one piece to it, which happened in the second quarter, so that will help bring down leverage. That's an asset sitting on our books that had no EBITDA, so the cash will go to reduce debt there. We have the balance of our sales that we're working through as well.

We are very pleased to report strong second quarter financial and operating results. As usual, Glenn and Conor will discuss the specific details, while Milton will provide some general thoughts. Over",616,"Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. We are very pleased to report strong second quarter financial and operating results. As usual, Glenn and Conor will discuss the specific details, while Milton will provide some general thoughts. Overall, both our earnings and property fundamentals look terrific as we continued to upgrade our portfolio and sell lower-tier retail assets. Combined with limited new supply and healthy growth of both national discounters and service-oriented retailers, our operating metrics are strong and bode well for future earnings growth. It is particularly encouraging to note another strong quarter of U.S. same-site NOI growth at 3.7%. Despite modest retail sales figures, national retailers continue their expansion plans, which in turn, is fueling higher occupancies, redevelopment projects and some limited ground-up development in certain markets. Effective rents are moving up sharply and property values continue to increase. In fact, the only disappointing current trend is the rising disconnect between private market valuations and the implied cap rates property values of REITs in general. Retail properties of all quality types and in almost all markets are experiencing strong demand with cap rates continuing to drift down. Wherever possible, Kimco is continuing to take advantage of the robust sales market by selling our remaining second tier assets, and redeploying the capital into redeveloping our larger properties and acquiring the equity interest of our institutional partners. In the latter case, we have the advantage of having managed the assets for many years and have, in most cases, a long-term presence in these markets. 
With respect to our overall strategy, we have now sold our remaining retail assets in Mexico, and we have begun to sell certain Canadian properties as we take steps to reduce our leverage levels, which temporarily rose in the first quarter with our purchase of Blackstone's joint venture interest in the former UBS joint venture portfolio. We expect to continue selectively selling Canadian assets, including our remaining Canadian preferred equity investments to help us achieve our year-end debt target without issuing equity. Glen will cover this in more detail during this presentation. Also, with respect to Canada, property prices remain high despite the negative impact of energy prices on the economy, particularly in Alberta. Our partners in Canada are also making excellent progress replacing the 9 target Canadian stores in our portfolio. 5 of the 9 target leases have been purchased by Lowe's and metro grocery stores is taking part of a 6 door. There are substantial interest from other retailers in the remaining spaces, including Marshall's, Bed, Bath and beyond, H&M and Sport Jack and I remind everybody that we have U.S. targets guarantee on all 9 of the leases. 
Switching back to the U.S. I believe most participants on the call today have noted the recent public IPO filing of Safeway Albertsons. We are confident that the future monetization of our 9.8% investment will provide an additional source of capital to fund developments, redevelopments, acquisitions and reduce debt. During the quarter, as reported, we also sold the proxy 80% of our SUPERVALU stock in a large gain. Our Plus business continues us truly be a strong phosphorus. Overall, we feel very positive about the underlying fundamentals of our open-air retail properties and the markets we are focusing. The e-commerce impact on essential goods and services has been modest and most national retailers have emphasized the benefits of brick-and-mortar store locations as an essential part of their integrated omni-channel strategy and very necessary for brand exposure. The proof really isn't the numbers as occupancy, rents, leasing spreads and renewals are all strong across our sector. Now I'd like to turn to Glenn Conor and Milton for their thoughts."

Our second quarter results were strong with solid execution at the property operating level, an additional contribution from our Plus business. As we reported last night, headline FFO per share, which represents the official Navy definition was $0.44 for the second quarter, a 29.4% increase from the $0.34 level last year. Our strong performance is attributable to on NOI increase of $8 million or $0.02 per share from the shopping center portfolio and higher transaction income primarily from the $32.4 million marketable security gain on the cost of sale of our SUPERVALU investments. For the 6 months, headline FFO per share is $0.81, up from the $0.68 per share level for the comparable period last year, a 19.1% increase. FFO as adjusted or recurring FFO, which excludes nonoperating impairments and transactional income and expense was $0.37 for the second quarter, up from $0.35 last year, a 5.7% increase. It's worth noting that this level of growth was achieved even with the impact of $900 million of U.S. assets sold, over $400 million of asset sold in Mexico, Latin America and Canada, and a negative impact from currency fluctuations. This transformational activity has a dilutive impact of $0.06 per share, however, was more than offset with acquisitions of over $2 billion of high-quality shopping centers, many for joint venture programs and reduced debt cost from opportunistic refinances. 
For the 6 months, FFO as adjusted per share is $0.73, up from $0.69 for the comparable period last year, a 5.8% increase. Our portfolio of operating metrics of occupancy, leasing spreads and same-site NOI growth continue to deliver strong levels. A U.S. property -- I'm sorry, our U.S. pro rata occupancy stands at 95.7%, up 70 basis points from the year ago. U.S. leasing spreads continue to increase with new leases up 26%, and renewals and options up 8.7% for combined leasing spreads of 11.9%. The closely watched metric of U.S. same-site NOI growth was 3.7% for the second quarter driven primarily by minimum rent increases and better credit loss results. Included in the U.S. same-site NOI growth is 50 basis points from redevelopments. 
For the 6 months, U.S. same-site NOI growth is 3.4% with 40 basis points coming from redevelopments. We are maintaining our U.S. same-site NOI guidance range of 3% to 3.5% for the full year 2015. Combined same-site NOI growth, including Canada was 3.4% for the second quarter and 3.2% for the 6 months, excluding the negative 110 basis points currency impact. We continue to make progress on our balance sheet metrics with consolidated net debt to recurring EBITDA dropping to 6.3x from the 6.6x level at the end of the first quarter. We have raised our full year disposition guidance range to $800 million to $1.1 billion, representing an increase of $250 million to $350 million which will provide hte necessary capital to bring our net debt to recurring EBITDA to 6x by year-end without the need for any common equity issuance. 
Based on our strong first half results and expectations for the second half of the year, we are raising our headline FFO per share guidance range to $1.52 to $1.56 from the previous per share range of $1.50 to $1.55. The headline guidance range includes an additional $1 million to $6 million of net transactional income generated during the remainder of the year. We are also increasing our FFO as adjusted per share guidance range to $1.43 to $1.46 from the previous per share guidance range of $1.42 to $1.45. Again, these increase per share guidance levels do not anticipate the need for any company emotions and with that turn it over to our Conor."

Today, I'll start by recapping our major metrics followed by our progress on our acquisitions and dispositions and finished with updates on our strategic development and redevelopment pipeline. Overall, we continued to see the fundamentals of our business improve in this favorable supply and demand environment. Our retention open-air centers, which include all price of goods, specialty grocers, fitness and wellness concepts, casual dresses continue with their aggressive expansion plans. Regardless of interest rates not just waiting disconnect between public and private pricing, we are laser-focused on execution. These core initiatives include the blocking and tackling of leasing, continuous efforts to improve operations with an eye towards sustainability, and finishing off our disposition by taking advantage of the healthy demand for hard assets with a strong yield. 
Turning to our major metrics. The U.S. portfolio maintained occupancy at 95.7% even with the disposition of over 1.2 million square feet of fully occupied space. Due to the disposition, the small shop occupancy took a slight dip to 88%, a 20-basis-point decrease from prior quarter. But we remain confident about the overall improvement in the small shop leasing environment and the ability to grow occupancy throughout the rest of the year. absorption made up the difference is our increase that increase to 90.4% by executing new deals with Walmart, Fresh Thyme Farmers Markets, total line and Planet Fitness to help keep the overall U.S. occupancy flats over prior quarter. Our combined spreads for the second quarter were at 112%, a strong indicator that pricing power exist and our key markets where we see demand outpacing supply. Same-site NOI continues to trend over 3% in the U.S. and the lease-up a small shop vacancies redevelopments and strong leasing spreads will continue to produce solid results. Our retailer watch list continues to be of focus as we have seen a few dark clouds on the horizon with the recent Bankruptcy findings of RadioShack and then ASP. All 3 combined make up less than 1% of our AVR. Our diverse tenant base allows us to think strategically about the long-term goals of our assets that have poor-performing retailers but have great underlying real estate value. The average base rent of the portfolio is up 6.1% year-over-year. Our new leases are being signed at an average over $19, significantly above our current average base rent, showcasing the embedded value in the mark-to-market opportunity we have at Kimco. We continue to execute on our transformation and simplification strategy with the previously announced closing of the tipsters transaction and Montgomery Square and Fort Worth. Both of these transactions further the consolidation of our joint venture properties and give us buying opportunities in a challenging acquisition environment. We Also acquired 7 adjacent parcels to our Tier 1 portfolio as we look to expand our footprint where we see the opportunity for future redevelopment. The acquisitions market remains ultracompetitive and a few recent transaction showcase cap rates continue to fall especially for high-quality open-air centers and dense markets. While we continue to mine for opportunities, we believe the best use of our capital continues to be redevelopment and strategic development. The disposition market continues to remain healthy with cap rates continuing to compress across all quality end-markets. In the second quarter, we sold 13 properties totaling 1.3 million square feet and all were 100% occupied, generating $92 million in Kim share proceeds. Buyers of these assets include public institutions, private REITs and local private buyers. Currently, we have 28 assets under contract for $170 million, 15 accepted offers totaling $136 million and another 18 assets of the market that will complete our transformation by year-end and produce another $500 million of gross proceeds. 
With respect to our redevelopment and development programs, whether it's coding our existing portfolio looking for value-add opportunities, assembling adjacent parcels to create future phases are building a new site from the ground-up. Our team is working overtime to analyze the highest and best use of the real estate. This modus operandi to evaluating real estate investment opportunities is what we call strategic development. That said, city progress continues to be made on our redevelopment development pipelines. 
This quarter, we completed 7 -- 11 redevelopments with gross comp of $34 million. The blended incremental ROI on these project is 15.5%. The projects were completed under budget and above our revenue expectations, representing an increase in ROI of 120 basis points over pro forma. At the same time, 7 projects were promoted to the active status. Included in the category of promotions, our Forest Avenue at Staten Island where we will be redeveloping a formal national wholesale liquidators to make way for a new L.A. Fitness. And that our downtown Farmington center in Farmington Michigan, we will be developing a former Office Depot in Tuesday morning for a new first, farmers market continuing our efforts to add a grocery component to our centers were development. Notable completions this quarter include the transformation of 2 Kmarts in Florida where we added a Whole Foods, TJX and roles among other great retailers. The redevelopment pipeline targets the highest investor use for each asset with a focus on upgrading the quality of the tenant mix, adding grocery component and adding density via mix use to complement the existing retail. The continued expansion of specialty traditional grocery concepts in our core markets in addition to the emergence of a number of new off-price out the concepts bodes well for a redevelopment and strategic development initiatives. These new demand forces are allowing us to unlock below-market rents with higher producing retailers that will benefit the net asset value of the portfolio. Currently, the redevelopment pipeline has a growth -- gross value over just over $1.1 billion, for the total of $268 million in active redevelopment; another $756 million in design and entitlement; and $97 million that is under review. For the quarter, redevelopment adds 50 basis points to our same-site NOI. 
We continue to look for development opportunities that are within our core markets, complement our long-term Tier 1 portfolio and provide compelling returns. Despite higher retailers demand, sourcing new projects that will be accretive remains challenging due to the rising cost of land associated with the Boom in multifamily development. That said, retailer demand for our selective of assessment strong, and we continue to work towards securing a vibrant tenant mix that will create a live, work, play atmosphere that we seek to create to Tier 1 assets. Our 4 development projects remain on track and will start the deliver in the second half of 2016. In closing, at the midpoint of the year, we are pleased with our progress on our strategic initiatives, but understand that the execution of throughout the second half of the year is key to achieving our goals. We have empowered our operations team to make strides to the best-in-class operator open-air shopping centers. And it is nice to see our efforts to be recognized. Commercial property executive named Kimco the #2 Most Effective Property Manager. And Newsday named Kimco, one of the top 3 Greenest REITs in the entire REIT universe and #1 in all of retail. These accomplishments could not have been achieved without the passion and effort of our deep bench of talented individuals that are pushing Kimco to become the next generation REIT. And with that, I'll turn it over to Milton for his final comments."

Ray is just one example of our deepened strength. As I said before, we have great people, great assets and a great future. 
On another topic. The recent Bankruptcy filing of as it relates to our portfolio got me thinking about the off- and site premise that higher rents are a proxy to value and quality. Now with respect to our sites. Full leases with below market rents are being assigned to other grosses generating a profit well 2 other stores with above-market rents will be closing. Now this admittedly is a small sample, but I think it is [indiscernible]. A rent that is at market or below is much more sustainable over the long term as the embedded value represents an upside for both the landlord and the tenant. These win-win scenarios for the owner of the retailer are what creates long-term value. As such, I believe that below-market rents and sometimes we're talking about rents should be accorded lower cap rates. Conversely, while higher rents may be an indicator of a quality assets, they may also reflect more risk if the rents are unsustainable over the long run. When underwriting a potential acquisition, determining of the placement rents for high-paying tenants is critical to the overall valuation of that site. In short, 1 size does not fit all. And now, we'd be happy to take any questions."

We're trying just to focus and see how we can expand that $1.1 billion pipeline by adding more projects and clearly, we are doing a good job in terms of expanding that and also delivering on it. You saw that this quarter we did more than last quarter and we continue to try and scale that. On the development side, we're being very selective on what we try and pick for developments. It really has to be within our key markets. We're trying to develop these long-term Tier 1 assets that have high-growth embedded in them. And it's very difficult to find one that check all those boxes. So we want to try and try to be measured in terms of what we take on in development but we're also making sure that we try and look for those opportunities because right now, where cap rates are headed, we don't see a lot of opportunity to create a tremendous amount of value from the acquisition market. So we're looking from our own portfolio, we're looking at acquiring adjacent parcels that may lend itself to larger redevelopments over time, and we're also looking at the development side of it. So I'd like to see us grow on all fronts. That being said, we don't have a targets in place it's really would like to look at every opportunity and make sure it's the right one for Kimco."

So their expansion plan continue. There pricing point is lower than L.A. Fitness. So in certain demographics, they're the perfect user. They do bringing in a lot of traffic, and we've seen actually from a co-tenanting side of it, a lot of our retailers who are, at first, against the health club have actually come around and see, for example, is one that actually likes the gym that come into the shopping center because it's the whole health-conscious-type customer that they're looking to go after. So you're starting to see that the health clubs become more of an integral part of that live, work, play environment that we're trying to create. And I think Planet Fitness has done a good job in terms of expansion and what they're looking to do going forward. That being said, there in that size where we have so much demand right now, we're now at 98.4% in our spaces over 10,000 square feet, and Planet Fitness will be bidding against a lot of these guys that are looking to come in for that same size box. So I see that as being a headwind for their expansion plan, but they do run a great operation, and we have a number of deals with them. And a number of other more deals in the pipeline. And then on the click of books question. This is something we've been tracking now for probably close to 5 years. And it's a program where we have been targeting pure online retailers to come into the physical shopping center world. The transformation of that e-commerce to the bricks and mortars space has been slow, but you're seeing it start to speed up now with some of the pure online retailers now opening physical stores. It hasn't necessarily been in the open air shopping center sector, it's been more in the high Street corridors. And they're looking to jump into the so host of the road to showcase their brand and have a space to show off their goods. That being said, there is rumors rumors of Amazon developing a store that they're watching closely in California and actually has a drive-through attached to it. So if that comes to fruition, it may open a whole slew of new operators to come into our shopping center that would create even more demands sources for us. So we're watching it closely, we encouraging some of the mom-and-pop online players to come into us and our shopping centers, but it has been material, I believe."

In addition, we've been doing a lot more 1031 exchange of assets that we sold in the U.S. So although we've been reporting a lot of gains in the U.S. from a taxable standpoint, they're actually been deferred. So we have a pretty sizable bucket to be able to deal with the gains that will come."

We are very pleased to report strong second quarter financial and operating results. As usual, Glenn and Conor will discuss the specific details, while Milton will provide some general thoughts.
Overall, both our earnings and property fundamentals look terrific as we continue to upgrade our portfolio and sell lower-tier retail assets. Combined with limited new supply and healthy growth of both national discounters and service-oriented retailers, our operating metrics are strong and bode well for future earnings growth. It is particularly encouraging to note another strong quarter of U.S. same-site NOI growth at 3.7%.
Despite modest retail sales figures, national retailers continue their expansion plans, which, in turn, is fueling higher occupancies, redevelopment projects and some limited ground-up development in certain markets. Effective rents are moving up sharply, and property values continue to increase. In fact, the only disappointing current trend is the rising disconnect between private market valuations and the implied cap rates property values of REITs, in general. Retail properties of all quality types and in almost all markets are experiencing strong demand with cap rates continuing to drift down. Wherever possible, Kimco is continuing to take advantage of the robust sales market by selling our remaining second-tier assets and redeploying the capital into redeveloping our larger properties and acquiring the equity interest of our institutional partners. In the latter case, we have the advantage of having managed the assets for many years and have, in most cases, a long-term presence in these markets.
With respect to our overall strategy, we have now sold our remaining retail assets in Mexico, and we have begun to sell certain Canadian properties as we take steps to reduce our leverage levels, which temporarily rose in the first quarter with our purchase of Blackstone's joint venture interest in the former UBS joint venture portfolio. We expect to continue selectively selling Canadian assets, including our remaining Canadian-preferred equity investments to help us achieve our year-end debt target without issuing new equity. Glenn will cover this in more detail during his presentation.
Also, with respect to Canada, property prices remain high despite the negative impact of energy prices on the economy, particularly in Alberta. Our partners in Canada are also making excellent progress replacing the 9 Target Canadian stores in our portfolio. 5 of the 9 Target leases have been purchased by Lowe's and Metro grocery store is taking part of a 6 door. There is substantial interest from other retailers in the remaining spaces, including Marshalls, Bed Bath & Beyond, H&M and Sport Chek, and I remind everybody that we have U.S. Targets guarantee on all 9 of the leases.
Switching back to the U.S. I believe most participants on the call today have noted the recent public IPO filing of Safeway-Albertsons. We are confident that the future monetization of our 9.8% investment will provide an additional source of capital to fund developments, redevelopments, acquisitions [ph] and reduced debt.
During the quarter, as reported, we also sold approximately 80% of our SUPERVALU stock at a large gain. Our PLUS business continues to truly be a strong plus for us.
Overall, we feel very positive about the underlying fundamentals of our open-air retail properties and the markets we are focusing. The e-commerce impact on essential goods and services has been modest, and most national retailers have emphasized the benefits of brick-and-mortar store locations as an essential part of their integrated omni-channel strategy and very necessary for brand exposure. The proof really is in the numbers as occupancy, rents, leasing spreads and renewals are all strong across our sector.
Now I'd like to turn to Glenn, Conor and Milton for their thoughts."

Our second quarter results were strong with solid execution at the property operating level and additional contribution from our PLUS business. As we reported last night, headline FFO per share, which represents the officia",619,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning. Our second quarter results were strong with solid execution at the property operating level and additional contribution from our PLUS business. As we reported last night, headline FFO per share, which represents the official Navy definition, was $0.44 for the second quarter, a 29.4% increase from the $0.34 level last year. Our strong performance is attributable to an NOI increase of $8 million or $0.02 per share from the shopping center portfolio and higher transaction income primarily from the $32.4 million marketable security gain on the cost of sale of our SUPERVALU investment.
For the 6 months, headline FFO per share is $0.81, up from the $0.68 per share level for the comparable period last year, a 19.1% increase. FFO as adjusted, or recurring FFO, which excludes nonoperating impairments and transactional income and expense, was $0.37 for the second quarter, up from $0.35 last year, a 5.7% increase. It's worth noting that this level of growth was achieved even with the impact of $900 million of U.S. assets sold, over $400 million of assets sold in Mexico, Latin America and Canada and a negative impact from currency fluctuations. This transformational activity had a dilutive impact of $0.06 per share, however, was more than offset with acquisitions of over $2 billion of high-quality shopping centers, many from our joint venture programs and reduced debt cost from opportunistic refinances.
For the 6 months, FFO as adjusted per share is $0.73, up from $0.69 for the comparable period last year, a 5.8% increase. Our portfolio operating metrics of occupancy, leasing spreads and same-site NOI growth continued to deliver strong levels. A U.S. property -- I'm sorry, our U.S. pro rata occupancy stands at 95.7%, up 70 basis points from a year ago. U.S. leasing spreads continue to increase with new leases up 26%, and renewals and options up 8.7% for combined positive leasing spreads of 11.9%.
The closely watched metric of U.S. same-site NOI growth was 3.7% for the second quarter, driven primarily by minimum rent increases and better credit loss results. Included in the U.S. same-site NOI growth is 50 basis points from redevelopments. For the 6 months, U.S. same-site NOI growth is 3.4% with 40 basis points coming from redevelopments. We are maintaining our U.S. same-site NOI guidance range of 3% to 3.5% for the full year 2015. Combined same-site NOI growth, including Canada, was 3.4% for the second quarter and 3.2% for the 6 months, excluding the negative 110 basis point currency impact.
We continue to make progress on our balance sheet metrics with consolidated net debt to recurring EBITDA dropping to 6.3x from the 6.6x level at the end of the first quarter. We have raised our full year disposition guidance range to $800 million to $1.1 billion, representing an increase of $250 million to $350 million, which will provide the necessary capital to bring our net debt to recurring EBITDA to 6x by year end without the need for any common equity issuance.
Based on our strong first half results and expectations for the second half of the year, we are raising our headline FFO per share guidance range to $1.52 to $1.56 from the previous per share range of $1.50 to $1.55. The headline guidance range includes an additional $1 million to $6 million of net transactional income generated during the remainder of the year. We are also increasing our FFO as adjusted per share guidance range to $1.43 to $1.46 from the previous per share guidance range of $1.42 to $1.45.
Again, these increases -- these increased per share guidance levels do not anticipate the need for any common equity issuance. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Conor."

Today, I'll start by recapping our major metrics followed by our progress on our acquisitions and dispositions and finish with updates on our strategic development and redevelopment pipeline.
Overall, we continued to see the fundamentals of our business improve in this favorable supply and demand environment. Our retailers and open-air centers, which include off-price of goods, specialty grocers, fitness and wellness concepts and fast casual restaurants, continue with their aggressive expansion plans. Regardless of the interest rate noise that's creating a disconnect between public and private pricing, we are laser-focused on execution. These core initiatives include the blocking and tackling of leasing, continuous efforts to improve operations with an eye towards sustainability and finishing off our disposition by taking advantage of the healthy demand for hard assets with a strong yield.
Turning to our major metrics. The U.S. portfolio maintained occupancy at 95.7% even with the disposition of over 1.2 million square feet of fully occupied space. Due to the disposition, the small shop occupancy took a slight dip to 88%, a 20 basis point decrease from prior quarter. But we remain confident about the overall improvement in the small shop leasing environment and the ability to grow occupancy throughout the rest of the year.
Anchor absorption made up the difference as our increase -- is an increase to 98.4% by executing new deals with Walmart, Fresh Thyme Farmers Market, Totaline and Planet Fitness to help keep the overall U.S. occupancy flat over prior quarter.
Our combined spreads for the second quarter were almost 12%, a strong indicator that pricing power exists in our key markets where we see demand outpacing supply.
Same-site NOI continues to trend over 3% in the U.S., and the lease-up with small shop vacancies, redevelopments and strong re-leasing spreads will help continue to produce solid results.
Our retailer watch list continues to be a focus as we have seen a few dark clouds on the horizon with the recent bankruptcy filings of RadioShack, Anna's Linens and ANP. All 3 combined make up less than 1% of our ABR.
Our diverse tenant base allows us to think strategically about the long-term goals of our assets that have poor-performing retailers but have great underlying real estate value. The average base rent of the portfolio is up 6.1% year-over-year. Our new leases are being signed at an average of over $19, significantly above our current average base rent, showcasing the embedded value in the mark-to-market opportunity we have at Kimco.
We continue to execute on our transformation and simplification strategy with the previously announced closing of the kips [ph] 2 transaction and Montgomery Square in Fort Worth. Both of these transactions further the consolidation of our joint venture properties and give us buying opportunities in a challenging acquisition environment.
We also acquired 7 adjacent parcels to our Tier 1 portfolio as we look to expand our footprint where we see the opportunity for future redevelopment. The acquisitions market remains ultracompetitive, and a few recent transactions showcase cap that rates continue to fall especially for high-quality open-air centers in dense markets.
While we continue to mine for opportunities, we believe the best use of our capital continues to be redevelopment and strategic development. The disposition market continues to remain healthy with cap rates continuing to compress across all quality end markets. In the second quarter, we sold 13 properties totaling 1.3 million square feet, and all were 100% occupied, generating $92 million in KIM share proceeds. Buyers of these assets include public institutions, private REITs and local private buyers. Currently, we have 28 assets under contract for $170 million, 15 accepted offers totaling $136 million and another 18 assets in the market that will complete our transformation by year end and produce another $500 million of gross proceeds.
With respect to our redevelopment and development programs, whether it's cowing our existing portfolio looking for value-add opportunities, assembling adjacent parcels to create future phases or building a new site from the ground up, our team is working overtime to analyze the highest and best use in the real estate. This modus operandi to evaluating real estate investments opportunities is what we call strategic development. That said, city progress continues to be made on our redevelopment development pipelines.
This quarter, we completed 7 -- 11 redevelopments with gross cost of $34 million. The blended incremental ROI on these projects is 15.5%. The projects were completed under budget and above our revenue expectations, representing an increase in ROI of 140 basis points over pro forma. At the same time, 7 projects were promoted to the active status. Included in the category of promotions, our Forest Avenue in Staten Island where we will be redeveloping a former national wholesale liquidators to make way for a new L.A. Fitness. And that our Downtown Farmington Center in Farmington, Michigan, we will be redeveloping a former Office Depot in Tuesday morning for a new Fresh Thyme Farmers Market, continuing our efforts to add a grocery component to our centers few [ph] redevelopment.
Notable completions this quarter include the transformation of 2 Kmarts in Florida where we added Whole Foods, TJX and Ross, among other great retailers.
The redevelopment pipeline targets the highest and best use for each asset with a focus on upgrading the quality of the tenant mix, adding a grocery component and adding density via mix use to complement the existing retail. The continued expansion of specialty and traditional grocery concepts in our core markets, in addition to the emergence of a number of new off-price or outlet concepts, bodes well for a redevelopment and strategic development initiatives. These new demand forces are allowing us to unlock below-market rents with higher-producing retailers that will benefit the net asset value of the portfolio. Currently, the redevelopment pipeline has a growth -- gross value over just over $1.1 billion for the total of $268 million in active redevelopment; another $756 million in design and entitlement; and $97 million that is under review. For the quarter, redevelopment adds 50 basis points to our same-site NOI.
We continue to look for development opportunities that are within our core markets, complement our long-term Tier 1 hold [ph] portfolio and provide compelling returns. Despite high retailers demand, sourcing new projects that will be accretive remains challenging due to the rising cost of land associated with the boom in multifamily development.
That said, retailer demand for our select developments has been strong, and we continue to work towards securing a vibrant tenant mix that will create a live, work and play atmosphere that we seek to create on all of our Tier 1 assets.
Our 4 development projects remain on track and will start the deliver in the second half of 2016.
In closing, at the midpoint of the year, we are pleased with our progress on our strategic initiatives but understand that the execution of throughout the second half of the year is key to achieving our goals. We have empowered our operations team to make strides to become the best-in-class operator of open-air shopping centers, and it is nice to see our efforts being recognized.
Commercial Property Executive magazine named Kimco the #2 most effective property manager. And Newsday named Kimco, one of the top 3 greenest REITs in the entire REIT universe and #1 in all of retail. These accomplishments could not have been achieved without the passion and effort of our deep bench of talented individuals that are pushing Kimco to become the next-generation REIT.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Milton for his final comments."

I would, once again, like to congratulate our team, which is second to none on an excellent quarter. In particular, I would like to thank Ray Edwards who continues to spearhead our PLUS business activities and was instrumental in the outlooks in investment. Ray is just one example of our deepened strength. As I've said before, we have great people, great assets and a great future.
On another topic. The recent bankruptcy filing of AT&T as it relates to our portfolio got me thinking about the often-cited premise that high rents are a proxy to value and quality.
Now with respect to our ANP sites. Full leases with below-market rents are being assigned to other grosses generating a profit to ANP, while 2 other stores with above-market rents will be closing. Now this admittedly is a small sample, but I think it is telling. A rent that is at market or below is much more sustainable over the long term as the embedded value represents an upside for both the landlord and the tenant. These win-win scenarios for the owner and the retailer are what creates long-term value. As such, I believe that below-market rents, and sometimes we're talking about grand rents, should be accorded lower cap rates.
Conversely, while higher rents may be an indicator of a quality assets, they may also reflect more risk if the rents are unsustainable over the long run. When underwriting a potential acquisition, determining of the placement rents with some high-paying tenants is critical to the overall valuation of that site. In short, one size does not fit all.
And now, we'd be happy to take any questions."

So you've got a few more bankruptcies and liquidations of retailers in Canada right now than we're seeing in the U.S. So the fundamentals are definitely a little softer in Canada, but we are coming off of 15 years where Canada, in many respects, was stronger than the U.S. in terms of portfolio occupancy and rents. It was a very solid performer for us. So it has often lately, and the Target bankruptcy doesn't help. But there has been some pretty good demand for the space, and you're going to see more of it now that these leases have been rejected. It opens up more discussions between landlords and end users. As an example, many of these Target leases had food restrictions in them. So the ability for the Walmarts of the world and the grocery stores in Canada to bid for the leases, they just wanted that much demand.

On Planet Fitness, they have been aggressive, actually, over the past, I would call it, 2 to 3 years, so their expansion plan will continue. Their pricing point is lower than L.A. Fitness, so in certain demographics, they're the perfect user. They do bring in a lot of traffic, and we've seen, actually, from a co-tenancy side of it, a lot of our retailers who are at first against the health club kind of actually come around in sprouts. For example, it's one that actually likes the gym to come into the shopping center because it's the whole health-conscious-type customer that they're looking to go after. So you're starting to see that the health clubs become more of an integral part of that live, work, play environment that we're trying to create. And I think Planet Fitness has done a good job in terms of expansion and what they're looking to do going forward. That being said, their in that size where we have so much demand right now. We're at 98.4% in our spaces over 10,000 square feet, and Planet Fitness will be bidding against a lot of these guys that are looking to come in for that same size box. So I see that as being a headwind for their expansion plans, but they do run a great operation, and we have a number of deals with them and a number other -- of more deals in the pipeline. And then on the clicks-to-bricks question, this is something we've been tracking now for probably close to 5 years. And it's a program where we have been targeting pure online retailers to come into the physical shopping center world. The transformation of that e-commerce to the bricks and mortars space has been slow, but you're seeing it start to speed up now with some of the pure online retailers now opening physical stores. It hasn't necessarily been in the open-air shopping center sector. It's been more in the high-street retail corridors. And they are looking to jump into the so-holes [ph] of the world to showcase their brand and to have a space to show off their goods. That being said, there is rumors of Amazon developing a store that we're watching closely in California and actually, has a drive-through attached to it. So if that comes to fruition, it may open a whole slew of new operators to come into our shopping centers that would create even more demand sources for us. So we're watching it closely. We encouraging some of the mom-and-pop online players to come into us and our shopping centers, but it hasn't been material, I believe."

We are very pleased to report strong second quarter financial and operating results. As usual, Glenn and Conor will discuss the specific details, while Milton will provide some general thoughts.
Overall, both our earnings and property fundamentals look terrific as we continue to upgrade our portfolio and sell lower-tier retail assets. Combined with limited new supply and healthy growth of both national discounters and service-oriented retailers, our operating metrics are strong and bode well for future earnings growth. It is particularly encouraging to note another strong quarter of U.S. same-site NOI growth at 3.7%.
Despite modest retail sales figures, national retailers continue their expansion plans, which, in turn, is fueling higher occupancies, redevelopment projects and some limited ground-up development in certain markets. Effective rents are moving up sharply, and property values continue to increase. In fact, the only disappointing current trend is the rising disconnect between private market valuations and the implied cap rates property values of REITs, in general. Retail properties of all quality types and in almost all markets are experiencing strong demand with cap rates continuing to drift down. Wherever possible, Kimco is continuing to take advantage of the robust sales market by selling our remaining second-tier assets and redeploying the capital into redeveloping our larger properties and acquiring the equity interest of our institutional partners. In the latter case, we have the advantage of having managed the assets for many years and have, in most cases, a long-term presence in these markets.
With respect to our overall strategy, we have now sold our remaining retail assets in Mexico, and we have begun to sell certain Canadian properties as we take steps to reduce our leverage levels, which temporarily rose in the first quarter with our purchase of Blackstone's joint venture interest in the former UBS joint venture portfolio. We expect to continue selectively selling Canadian assets, including our remaining Canadian-preferred equity investments to help us achieve our year-end debt target without issuing new equity. Glenn will cover this in more detail during his presentation.
Also, with respect to Canada, property prices remain high despite the negative impact of energy prices on the economy, particularly in Alberta. Our partners in Canada are also making excellent progress replacing the 9 Target Canadian stores in our portfolio. 5 of the 9 Target leases have been purchased by Lowe's and Metro grocery store is taking part of a 6 door. There is substantial interest from other retailers in the remaining spaces, including Marshalls, Bed Bath & Beyond, H&M and Sport Chek, and I remind everybody that we have U.S. Targets guarantee on all 9 of the leases.
Switching back to the U.S. I believe most participants on the call today have noted the recent public IPO filing of Safeway-Albertsons. We are confident that the future monetization of our 9.8% investment will provide an additional source of capital to fund developments, redevelopments, acquisitions [ph] and reduced debt.
During the quarter, as reported, we also sold approximately 80% of our SUPERVALU stock at a large gain. Our PLUS business continues to truly be a strong plus for us.
Overall, we feel very positive about the underlying fundamentals of our open-air retail properties and the markets we are focusing on. The e-commerce impact on essential goods and services has been modest, and most national retailers have emphasized the benefits of brick-and-mortar store locations as an essential part of their integrated omni-channel strategy and very necessary for brand exposure. The proof really is in the numbers as occupancy, rents, leasing spreads and renewals are all strong across our sector.
Now I'd like to turn to Glenn, Conor and Milton for their thoughts."

Our second quarter results were strong with solid execution at the property operating level and additional contribution from our PLUS business. As we reported last night, headline FFO per share, which represents the officia",619,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning. Our second quarter results were strong with solid execution at the property operating level and additional contribution from our PLUS business. As we reported last night, headline FFO per share, which represents the official Navy definition, was $0.44 for the second quarter, a 29.4% increase from the $0.34 level last year. Our strong performance is attributable to an NOI increase of $8 million or $0.02 per share from the shopping center portfolio and higher transaction income primarily from the $32.4 million marketable security gain on the cost of sale of our SUPERVALU investment.
For the 6 months, headline FFO per share is $0.81, up from the $0.68 per share level for the comparable period last year, a 19.1% increase. FFO as adjusted, or recurring FFO, which excludes nonoperating impairments and transactional income and expense, was $0.37 for the second quarter, up from $0.35 last year, a 5.7% increase. It's worth noting that this level of growth was achieved even with the impact of $900 million of U.S. assets sold, over $400 million of assets sold in Mexico, Latin America and Canada and a negative impact from currency fluctuations. This transformational activity had a dilutive impact of $0.06 per share, however, was more than offset with acquisitions of over $2 billion of high-quality shopping centers, many from our joint venture programs and reduced debt cost from opportunistic refinances.
For the 6 months, FFO as adjusted per share is $0.73, up from $0.69 for the comparable period last year, a 5.8% increase. Our portfolio operating metrics of occupancy, leasing spreads and same-site NOI growth continued to deliver strong levels. A U.S. property -- I'm sorry, our U.S. pro rata occupancy stands at 95.7%, up 70 basis points from a year ago. U.S. leasing spreads continue to increase with new leases up 26%, and renewals and options up 8.7% for combined positive leasing spreads of 11.9%.
The closely watched metric of U.S. same-site NOI growth was 3.7% for the second quarter, driven primarily by minimum rent increases and better credit loss results. Included in the U.S. same-site NOI growth is 50 basis points from redevelopments. For the 6 months, U.S. same-site NOI growth is 3.4% with 40 basis points coming from redevelopments. We are maintaining our U.S. same-site NOI guidance range of 3% to 3.5% for the full year 2015. Combined same-site NOI growth, including Canada, was 3.4% for the second quarter and 3.2% for the 6 months, excluding the negative 110 basis point currency impact.
We continue to make progress on our balance sheet metrics with consolidated net debt to recurring EBITDA dropping to 6.3x from the 6.6x level at the end of the first quarter. We have raised our full year disposition guidance range to $800 million to $1.1 billion, representing an increase of $250 million to $350 million, which will provide the necessary capital to bring our net debt to recurring EBITDA to 6x by year end without the need for any common equity issuance.
Based on our strong first half results and expectations for the second half of the year, we are raising our headline FFO per share guidance range to $1.52 to $1.56 from the previous per share range of $1.50 to $1.55. The headline guidance range includes an additional $1 million to $6 million of net transactional income generated during the remainder of the year. We are also increasing our FFO as adjusted per share guidance range to $1.43 to $1.46 from the previous per share guidance range of $1.42 to $1.45.
Again, these increases -- these increased per share guidance levels do not anticipate the need for any common equity issuance. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Conor."

Today, I'll start by recapping our major metrics followed by our progress on our acquisitions and dispositions and finish with updates on our strategic development and redevelopment pipeline.
Overall, we continued to see the fundamentals of our business improve in this favorable supply and demand environment. Our retailers and open-air centers, which include off-price soft goods, specialty grocers, fitness and wellness concepts and fast casual restaurants, continue with their aggressive expansion plans. Regardless of the interest rate noise that's creating a disconnect between public and private pricing, we are laser-focused on execution. These core initiatives include the blocking and tackling of leasing, continuous efforts to improve operations with an eye towards sustainability and finishing off our disposition by taking advantage of the healthy demand for hard assets with a strong yield.
Turning to our major metrics. The U.S. portfolio maintained occupancy at 95.7% even with the disposition of over 1.2 million square feet of fully occupied space. Due to the disposition, the small shop occupancy took a slight dip to 88%, a 20 basis point decrease from prior quarter. But we remain confident about the overall improvement in the small shop leasing environment and the ability to grow occupancy throughout the rest of the year.
Anchor absorption made up the difference as our increase -- is an increase to 98.4% by executing new deals with Walmart, Fresh Thyme Farmers Market, Totaline and Planet Fitness to help keep the overall U.S. occupancy flat over prior quarter.
Our combined spreads for the second quarter were almost 12%, a strong indicator that pricing power exists in our key markets where we see demand outpacing supply.
Same-site NOI continues to trend over 3% in the U.S., and the lease-up with small shop vacancies, redevelopments and strong re-leasing spreads will help continue to produce solid results.
Our retailer watch list continues to be a focus as we have seen a few dark clouds on the horizon with the recent bankruptcy filings of RadioShack, Anna's Linens and A&P. All 3 combined make up less than 1% of our ABR.
Our diverse tenant base allows us to think strategically about the long-term goals of our assets that have poor-performing retailers but have great underlying real estate value. The average base rent of the portfolio is up 6.1% year-over-year. Our new leases are being signed at an average of over $19, significantly above our current average base rent, showcasing the embedded value in the mark-to-market opportunity we have at Kimco.
We continue to execute on our transformation and simplification strategy with the previously announced closing of the kips [ph] 2 transaction and Montgomery Square in Fort Worth. Both of these transactions further the consolidation of our joint venture properties and give us buying opportunities in a challenging acquisition environment.
We also acquired 7 adjacent parcels to our Tier 1 portfolio as we look to expand our footprint where we see the opportunity for future redevelopment. The acquisitions market remains ultracompetitive, and a few recent transactions showcase that cap rates continue to fall especially for high-quality open-air centers in dense markets.
While we continue to mine for opportunities, we believe the best use of our capital continues to be redevelopment and strategic development. The disposition market continues to remain healthy with cap rates continuing to compress across all quality end markets. In the second quarter, we sold 13 properties totaling 1.3 million square feet, and all were 100% occupied, generating $92 million in KIM share proceeds. Buyers of these assets include public institutions, private REITs and local private buyers. Currently, we have 28 assets under contract for $170 million, 15 accepted offers totaling $136 million and another 18 assets in the market that will complete our transformation by year end and produce another $500 million of gross proceeds.
With respect to our redevelopment and development programs, whether it's combing our existing portfolio looking for value-add opportunities, assembling adjacent parcels to create future phases or building a new site from the ground up, our team is working overtime to analyze the highest and best use in the real estate. This modus operandi to evaluating real estate investments opportunities is what we call strategic development. That said, steady progress continues to be made on our redevelopment development pipelines.
This quarter, we completed 7 -- 11 redevelopments with gross cost of $34 million. The blended incremental ROI on these projects is 15.5%. The projects were completed under budget and above our revenue expectations, representing an increase in ROI of 140 basis points over pro forma. At the same time, 7 projects were promoted to the active status. Included in the category of promotions, our Forest Avenue in Staten Island where we will be redeveloping a former national wholesale liquidators to make way for a new L.A. Fitness. And that our Downtown Farmington Center in Farmington, Michigan, we will be redeveloping a former Office Depot and Tuesday Morning for a new Fresh Thyme Farmers Market, continuing our efforts to add a grocery component to our centers via redevelopment.
Notable completions this quarter include the transformation of 2 Kmarts in Florida where we added Whole Foods, TJX and Ross, among other great retailers.
The redevelopment pipeline targets the highest and best use for each asset with a focus on upgrading the quality of the tenant mix, adding a grocery component and adding density via mixed use to complement the existing retail. The continued expansion of specialty and traditional grocery concepts in our core markets, in addition to the emergence of a number of new off-price or outlet concepts, bodes well for our redevelopment and strategic development initiatives. These new demand forces are allowing us to unlock below-market rents with higher-producing retailers that will benefit the net asset value of the portfolio. Currently, the redevelopment pipeline has a growth -- gross value over just over $1.1 billion for the total of $268 million in active redevelopment; another $756 million in design and entitlement; and $97 million that is under review. For the quarter, redevelopment adds 50 basis points to our same-site NOI.
We continue to look for development opportunities that are within our core markets, complement our long-term Tier 1 hold portfolio and provide compelling returns. Despite high retailer demand, sourcing new projects that will be accretive remains challenging due to the rising cost of land associated with the boom in multifamily development.
That said, retailer demand for our select developments has been strong, and we continue to work towards securing a vibrant tenant mix that will create a live, work and play atmosphere that we seek to create on all of our Tier 1 assets.
Our 4 development projects remain on track and will start the deliver in the second half of 2016.
In closing, at the midpoint of the year, we are pleased with our progress on our strategic initiatives but understand that the execution of throughout the second half of the year is key to achieving our goals. We have empowered our operations team to make strides to become the best-in-class operator of open-air shopping centers, and it is nice to see our efforts being recognized.
Commercial Property Executive magazine named Kimco the #2 most effective property manager. And Newsday named Kimco, one of the top 3 greenest REITs in the entire REIT universe and #1 in all of retail. These accomplishments could not have been achieved without the passion and effort of our deep bench of talented individuals that are pushing Kimco to become the next-generation REIT.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Milton for his final comments."

I would, once again, like to congratulate our team, which is second to none on an excellent quarter. In particular, I would like to thank Ray Edwards who continues to spearhead our PLUS business activities and was instrumental in the Albertsons investment. Ray is just one example of our deep bench strength. As I've said before, we have great people, great assets and a great future.
On another topic. The recent bankruptcy filing of A&P as it relates to our portfolio got me thinking about the often-cited premise that high rents are a proxy for value and quality.
Now with respect to our A&P sites. Full leases with below-market rents are being assigned to other grosses generating a profit to A&P, while 2 other stores with above-market rents will be closing. Now this admittedly is a small sample, but I think it is telling. A rent that is at market or below is much more sustainable over the long term as the embedded value represents an upside for both the landlord and the tenant. These win-win scenarios for the owner and the retailer are what creates long-term value. As such, I believe that below-market rents, and sometimes we're talking about grant [ph] rents, should be accorded lower cap rates.
Conversely, while higher rents may be an indicator of a quality assets, they may also reflect more risk if the rents aren't unsustainable over the long run. When underwriting a potential acquisition, determining of the placement rents with some high-paying tenants is critical to the overall valuation of that site. In short, one size does not fit all.
And now, we'd be happy to take any questions."

Secondly, many retailers get their inventory of goods from the U.S. and the strong U.S. dollar, and the quite substantial movement in that U.S. dollar has really hurt retailer margins in many cases, particularly fashion, and that has impacted retail sales, retail margins, retail profitability. So you've got a few more bankruptcies and liquidations of retailers in Canada right now than we're seeing in the U.S. So the fundamentals are definitely a little softer in Canada, but we are coming off of 15 years where Canada, in many respects, was stronger than the U.S. in terms of portfolio occupancy and rents. It was a very solid performer for us. So it has softened lately, and the Target bankruptcy doesn't help. But there has been some pretty good demand for the space, and you're going to see more of it now that these leases have been rejected. It opens up more discussions between landlords and users. As an example, many of these Target leases had food restrictions in them. So the ability for the Walmarts of the world and the grocery stores in Canada to bid for the leases, they just wasn't that much demand.

It's a different animal. We'll -- we have bought from Sears. They had a facility. One of our development deals is a property that we bought from Sears that we closed on last year. So we're selectively looking for deals. I'm not sure we're looking for that headline $100 million, $200 million, $300 million, $500 million deal. I think we're trying to work around the edges and our main business is for Conor and company to run the main business, so."

On Planet Fitness, they have been aggressive, actually, over the past, I would call it, 2 to 3 years, so their expansion plan will continue. Their pricing point is lower than L.A. Fitness, so in certain demographics, they're the perfect user. They do bring in a lot of traffic, and we've seen, actually, from a co-tenancy side of it, a lot of our retailers who are at first against the health club have actually come around and Sprouts, for example, is one that actually likes the gym to come into the shopping center because it's the whole health-conscious-type customer that they're looking to go after. So you're starting to see that the health clubs become more of an integral part of that live, work, play environment that we're trying to create. And I think Planet Fitness has done a good job in terms of expansion and what they're looking to do going forward. That being said, their in that size where we have so much demand right now. We're at 98.4% in our spaces over 10,000 square feet, and Planet Fitness will be bidding against a lot of these guys that are looking to come in for that same size box. So I see that as being a headwind for their expansion plans, but they do run a great operation, and we have a number of deals with them and a number other -- of more deals in the pipeline. And then on the clicks-to-bricks question, this is something we've been tracking now for probably close to 5 years. And it's a program where we have been targeting pure online retailers to come into the physical shopping center world. The transformation of that e-commerce to the bricks and mortars space has been slow, but you're seeing it start to speed up now with some of the pure online retailers now opening physical stores. It hasn't necessarily been in the open-air shopping center sector. It's been more in the high-street retail corridors. As they are looking to jump into the Sohos of the world to showcase their brand and to have a space to show off their goods. That being said, there is rumors of Amazon developing a store that we're watching closely in California and actually, has a drive-through attached to it. So if that comes to fruition, it may open a whole slew of new operators to come into our shopping centers that would create even more demand sources for us. So we're watching it closely. We encouraging some of the mom-and-pop online players to come into us and our shopping centers, but it hasn't been material, I believe."

But in terms of buying out their interest in certain properties, it's probably not going to happen in the near future. RioCan, we have talked about, and I think you'll see the joint venture be reduced over time as we begin to identify certain assets that we both think should be sold as well as certain assets where they have plans to convert more to a mixed-use or redevelop, and those might be opportunities for us to reduce the size of our joint venture. That said, they're been a wonderful partner all the way along. In terms of KIR, we have had some discussions. But at this point, they're inconclusive.

Before we begin, allow me to remind everyone that Kimco's hosting an Investor Day on December 10 in New York city at the Palace Hotel. If you haven't signed up, there's still time to RSVP for this event. Please contact my office and we'll send invitation to you. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Henry for his final prepared remarks as CEO of Kimco. I believe his office furniture is being inventoried as we speak."

But anyway, good morning, and thank you all for calling in today. As I prepared to pass the baton to Colin on January 1st and after 59 earnings calls over the last 15 years, permit me to give you a few personal thoughts. 
First, it has been a sincere pleasure to personally meet and spend time over the years with most of the analysts and investors on the call today. Everyone has been gracious and thoroughly engaging while unabashedly providing me and our team their thoughts and opinions. This has been enormously helpful to me and our company. 
Second, I would like to empathize the strength advantage of Kimco from a very high level as I see them. The firm, founded by Milton and Martin Kimmel, more than 55 years ago, is a retail powerhouse in terms of its size, diversification, balance sheet, dividend safety, national scale, tenant relationships and industry context. We are the retail partner of choice for many private equity and institutional owners of both retail operating companies and retail property assets. 
Our opportunistic culture and investing disciplines have resulted in many wonderfully applicable investments for our shareholders, most recently our shale SUPERVALU stock and the pending Albertson's IPO. 
Third, the investment world sometimes, in my opinion, focuses a little too much on a simple metric as a proxy for the prospects of a REIT for the quality of its portfolio. In our case, it has been and will continue to be a deeper story of corporate financial strength, size, scale and a culture totally focused on creating share value for our shareholders. We have more properties, more local offices, more individual tenants and more retailer relationships than any of our peers. And combined with one of the lowest dividend payout ratios in the industry and our strong BBB+ investment-grade balance sheet, we stand second to none. 
Our portfolio, after more than $5 billion of retail property sales and close to $5 billion of retail property acquisitions over the past 5 years, now consists of a very broad group of very high-quality properties and excellent long-term growth markets with numerous very accretive redevelopment prospects. 
Now stepping down off the soapbox and focusing on our third quarter. We are pleased to report excellent financial results for the quarter. Together with a dividend increase of 6.3% and a guidance increase. As usual, Glenn and Conor will discuss with specific details while Milton will close with some general comments. 
Overall, both our earnings and portfolio fundamentals are solid, helped by the portfolio upgrade accomplished through the sale of our lower tier retail assets and numerous high-quality acquisitions. The open air property sector in general continues to have bright prospects due to limited new supply and the continued expansion of both national discounters and service-oriented retailers.  Most of our top tenants are committed to significant store expansion plans and effective rents and leasing spreads are rising market. 
With respect to our corporate strategy. Our U.S. property dispositions will be largely completed this year, and we have moved quickly in Canada to take advantage of historic low cap rates by selling 19 properties to our RioCan joint venture partner with 26 additional sale properties pending, totaling CAD 774 million. 22 of the additional 26 properties are being sold to either third parties or other Canadian joint venture operating partners. 
Due to today's low cap rates compared to the high cap rates when we entered Canada in 2002, we have substantial gains embedded in our portfolio and we have structured our transactions to reduce the tax effects as much as possible. As such, our exit from Canada will be measured, but we do expect to have largely monetized our Canadian assets during 2016. 
At that point, Kimco will be totally focused on the U.S. and we will self manage virtually all of our properties. 
We continue to feel very positive for at least the next several years about the underlying fundamentals of our open air retail properties and the markets we have chosen to focus on. e-commerce has been effectively incorporated into brick-and-mortar store operations as showrooms, last mile delivery and brand awareness become more and more critical to successful retail businesses. I do hope everyone took note of Amazon's announcement on Tuesday that they have opened their first full brick-and-mortar store in Seattle. 
Amazon has now formally recognized that the omni-channel concept is very successful, and that physical stores are important components of growth even for e-commerce retailers. As a quick update on the Albertsons IPO. The actual IPO S-1 filing remains open to provide future timing flexibility. Store operations also continued to perform well and the integration of Safeway and Albertsons has progressed very smoothly. Now I'd like to turn to Glenn Conor and Milton for their thoughts"

Our third quarter 2015 results were strong with significant progress made on the disposition and simplification promise.

Our third quarter 2015 results were strong with significant progress made on the disposition and simplification promise. Given with some headwinds from the bankruptcies of Amazon and A&P, our overall portfolio operating metrics continue to produce solid results. Headline FFO per share, which represents the official definition and which was used for first call consensus was $0.30 for the quarter, $0.03 above consensus. Included in the headline is the monetization of our SUPERVALU stock investment which provides a gain of $6.1 million, our PLUS business at work, and $7.6 million from profit participation earned from the sales of Canadian preferred equity . For the 9 months, headline FFO per share is $1.21, up from $1.07 for the same period last year, a 13.1% increase. 
FFO as adjusted for share or recurring FFO which excludes transactional income and expense and nonoperating impairments was $0.36 for the third quarter, same level as reported in the third quarter last year. Our results included an increase in recurring consolidated EBITDA $6.3 million, driven primarily by the operating portfolio, which was offset by higher interest expense of $2.5 million related to the debt assumed in connection with the Kimstone acquisition earlier in the year. 
For the 9 months, FFO is adjusted per share as $1.09, up from $1.05 for the comparable period last year, a 3.8% increase. We are pleased that we have successfully continued to grow our earnings while dramatically transforming the portfolio with sales in the U.S., Mexico, Latin America and Canadian asset sales totaling over $1.4 billion over the past 12 months. 
We have mitigated much of the dilutive impact with the acquisition of over $2 billion of U.S. properties in our key markets, many of which were sourced from our joint venture programs and from reduced debt cost with well-timed debt refinances. 
Our portfolio operating metrics remained solid. The U.S. pro-rata occupancy stand at 95.6%, up 10 basis points from a year ago. The bankruptcy of Linens, lift occupancy by 20 basis points this quarter. The team is focused on filling these boxes over the coming months. Breaking it down further, our anchor boxes are 98.3% leased, up 10 basis points from the year ago. And small top occupancy is at 88% of [ph] 100% from a year ago. Our leasing team continues to deliver strong leasing spreads with new leases up 28.6% and renewals and options, up 6.2% for a combined positive leasing spreads of 10.6 for the quarter. 
U.S. same time NOI growth was 2.4% for the third quarter compared to a 4.9% comp last year, bringing our U.S. same-site NOI growth for the 9 months for 3%, in line with our guidance range of 3% to 3.5% for the full year. The key driver of our year-to-date same-site NOI growth has been an increase in minimum rent of 3% and improved our coverage in other revenues which added another 42 basis points. 
Same-site NOI growth was negatively impacted by 46 basis points due to higher credit loss reserves required primarily from the bankruptcies previously mentioned. Combined same-site NOI growth, including Canada but excluding the negative 150 basis point impact of currency, was 2.2% for the third quarter and 2.8% for the 9 months. 
Now for a few comments on the balance sheet and capital market activity. We remain confident that we will reach our goal of 6x of consolidated net debt to recurring EBITDA by year end without the need for any common equity. This will be a swift improvement from the 6.6x level at the end of the first quarter. We ended the third quarter at 6.3x, the same as last quarter. 
We anticipated closing in the first part of the RioCan sale by September 30. But due to regulatory issues, we did not complete the transaction until the beginning of October. Consolidated net debt-to-EBITDA on a pro forma basis, including the sale of RioCan will be 6.1x. 
Subsequent to quarter end, we successfully capped the volatile bond market issuing a 500 million, 7-year bond and a coupon of 3.4% with a spread right on top of our secondaries. Proceeds will be used to repay higher coupon debt. The issuance addresses our remaining maturities in 2015 of $169 million. And more than 1/3 of the maturities due in 2016. In addition, we have immediate liquidity in excess of $1.9 billion as of today with cash on hand and $1.7 billion available on our revolving credit facility. 
We also announced the redemption of our $175 million, 6.9% Class A preferred stock which will occur on November 25. We will record a $5.8 million noncash charge-related to redemption in the fourth quarter which will impact our headline FFO. Proceeds from our anticipated sales mentioned in our press release will be used to fund the redemption. The redemption will result in a reduction of our fixed charges by $12.1 million annually. 
Based on our solid results in the first 9 months and expectations for the remainder of the year, we are raising our headline FFO per share guidance to $1.54 to $1.57, which includes the redemption charge mentioned above and minimal additional transactional income in the fourth quarter. We are also tightening our FFO as adjusted per share by guidance range to $1.44 to $1.46 from the previous guidance range. 
Guidance for 2016 will be provided at our Investor Day in December. Lastly, we're pleased to announce that based on our 2015 performance, our Board of Directors has approved an increase in the cash dividend to $0.255 per quarter, up from $0.24 per quarter, an increase of 6.3% on an annualized basis. Our FFO payout ratio will remain conservative in the mid-60s percent range, among the lowest in our peer group. 
Now before I turn it over to Conor, I want to thank Dave Henry for all of his support and internship and advice over the past 1.5 decade. Dave has fostered a terrific culture at Kimco with the approach of treating everyone with the utmost respect. Dave keeps a saying on his desk which describes him perfectly. It says, it is nice to be important, but it's more important to be nice. Dave is a terrific leader and a truly nice guy. We will miss him. And with that, Conor."

Overall, t",944,"Thanks, Glenn, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll start by recapping progress on our key metrics, followed by an update on acquisitions and dispositions and finish with an overview of our strategic development and redevelopment pipeline. 
Overall, the fundamentals of the open air remain healthy due to the supply and demand balance. While the bankruptcy filing of Anna’s Linens, Higgins and NAP will add to the supply side, the demand for quality real estate continues to far outweigh this factor as evidenced by the amount of bidders during this bankruptcy proceedings. Four of 9 A&Ps were recaptured by Kimco and the remaining 5 were purchased by Acne . These bankruptcies will create some near-term headwinds to occupancy same-site NOI but given our strategy of focusing on great real estate with below market rents, our shareholders will achieve long-term value as we mark-to-market these leases and continue to redevelop our assets. 
Turning to our major metrics. The U.S. portfolio occupancy 10 basis points over the last quarter to 95.6% due to negative net absorption and the disposition of 15 fully stabilized shopping centers. Small shop occupancy remained flat at 88% from last quarter, up 100 basis points from prior year. Anchor occupancy just 10 basis points over the last quarter to 98.3%. The 22 Anna’s Linens boxes recaptured this quarter, provided an extended run way to allow our teams to unlock value and take advantage of the upside due to the 10% to 20% mark-to-market opportunities embedded in these low average base rent leases. 
Our combined leasing spreads for the third quarter continue to trend over 10%, a strong indicator that pricing power is intact in our key markets. 
Same-site NOI of 2.4% in the U.S. was driven primarily by minimum rent increases, higher than expected percentage rent but muted by higher-than-expected credit loss due to the bankruptcies mentioned earlier. 
The majority of retailers in our sector have significant new store opening plans and multiple size prototypes. A few examples of new innovative off-price concepts include Find at Laurie Taylor and Lemon Pop by Charlotte Russe. These retailers are adding to the already-crowded field looking for high-quality space in driving up rents. 
In addition, we welcome new tenant this quarter such Sephora, added a new vibrant retail mix in our open air shopping centers. Small shop leasing show signs of acceleration as we have seen the mom-and-pop retailer return, accounting for nearly half of the small shop leases this quarter. 
We continue to execute on our transformation and simplification with the previously announced closing of the 100% entries in Montgomery Square at Fort Worth, as well as acquisition of our partner's interest in Conroe's marketplace, located in the Houston MFA, subsequent to quarter and. Both of these transactions result further consolidation of our joint venture properties and give us buying opportunities in key strategic markets in a challenging acquisition environment. 
We also acquired 3 parcels adjacent to our top assets as we look to expand our footprint where we see future redevelopment opportunity. The acquisition market remains competitive for high-quality core assets. While we search for value-added opportunities, we continue to be selective. 
The disposition market remains healthy but showing signs of stabilizing with buyers still on the hunt for yield. In the third quarter, we sold 14 AAA [ph] net assets and 15 shopping centers, totaling 1.8 million square feet generating 104 million in Kimco share proceeds at a blended cap rate of 6.9%. Buyers of these assets are taking advantage of the readily available financing of up to 80% loan-to-value with loading interest rates at all-time lows which generate significant cash and cash return. Buyers this quarter include public and private solutions, including REITs and local private buyers. 
Currently in the U.S., we have 17 assets under contract for $208 million, 13 accepted offers, totaling $172 million. And another 22 assets in the market that will complete our transformation by year end and produce another $400 million of gross proceeds. Steady progress continues to be made on our redevelopment and development pipeline. This quarter, we completed $36.5 million of redevelopments with blended incremental ROI of 9.9%. The development activity added 10 basis points to same-site NOI this quarter. 
Our new lease with Safeway, specifically in California, was executed in the third quarter, moving that grocery redevelopment in the Bay Area up to the category. Currently, the redevelopment pipeline has gross value of just over $1.1 billion with a total of $269 million inactive redevelopment, with another $734 million in design and entitlement and $122 million that is under review. In addition to our 4 development projects, due to robust retailer demand at our Grand Parkway project, this quarter, we purchased the adjacent 35-acre land parcel to accommodate Phase II. 
In closing, year-over-year average base rent per square foot is up 6.2% and we continue to push towards unlocking more of the embedded value in our portfolio. In the third quarter, Kimco has adopted into the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. We are proud to be the only retail REIT in the index. And it highlights our ongoing commitment to become a leader in corporate responsibility and sustainability as we evolve into the next-generation REIT. 
Finally, I would like to express how grateful and appreciative I am to have had the opportunity to work with Dave for close of 15 years. He has been a mentor, sounding board, guidepost and a dear friend that I truly value. Thanks to Dave and his leadership, Kimco is well positioned to continue to deliver for our shareholders and become the leader in our industry. And with that, I will turn it over to Milton for his final comments."

So at this point, I examined our portfolio in light of a possible future downturn. And I feel confident that on a relative basis, we are in the sweet spot of retail real estate ownership. 
Our retail real estate is defensive in connection with any downturn but with great opportunity during the up cycles. In tough times, all price retailer should do well. Our portfolio contains many off-price retailers, including TJX, Lawrence to Lawrence and Nordstrom Rack in over 200 locations. There is a full component, 71.4% of last . We are the largest owner of Costco and Home Depot sites with 12 Costco's and 28 Home Depots, credits that are very strong. Our top 5 tenants are TJX, Home Depot, Bed Bath & Beyond, Royal and Walmart. 
Most of our tenants sell low-cost everyday essential items. No retailer will be immune to the downturn but I think we are well positioned. And we have an experience, energetic executive that's passionate about our business and focused on creating and managing value to our portfolio. So I see the future with confidence. 
And I to would like to mention a few words about Dave. Dave has been my partner for the past 14 years. He has a wonderful way about him. He is sensitive and a great people person. And has always had a sense of doing the right thing. You would never ever hear Dave say, ""Well, that's business."" We will listen. We wish him well and we are so pleased that we will have Dave available to us to share his audacity with us. All the best Dave.

And tax, I think we're still working on various tax strategies so Glenn can probably comment better on giving you a rough guess on the tax effect. But we are managing this as best we can to avoid any kind of special dividend. We do have large embedded gains, thanks to the timing of our entry in Canada and the hard work that our operating partners have done out there.

We're continuing to see many of the services as well as the restaurants expand rapidly. Quick service restaurants have been one of the fastest-growing components of our small shops. But you're also seeing in some of the mid-sized soft goods players and some of the dollars stores. 5 below, there's still plenty of opportunity there in addition to Old Navy and others. But we have seen that really the boost is coming from the services. And that's great for us because those tenants are stickier. We're also seeing some impact from the medical care, the urgent care center, the dentist, the optometrist. All those continue to expand. And your question about the small shop velocity for 1 year vacant versus less than 1 year vacant, it really is because we've sold so much of our portfolio, the spaces that have been vacant a long period of time are typically in those sites that we've sold. So the ones that have been vacant for a significant amount of time, we have seen just as much activity on the ones that have just been recently become vacant. Because our centers now are a much higher quality and there's a lot of demand and not much shop space available. So we're confident that we can deliver in terms of our small shop occupancy gains and points about 90% by the end of next year."

As I prepare to pass the baton to Conor on January 1 and after 59 earnings calls over the last 15 years, permit me to give you a few personal thoughts. 
First, it has been a sincere pleasure to personally meet and spend time over the years with most of the analysts and investors on the call today. Everyone has been gracious and thoroughly engaging while unabashedly providing me and our team their thoughts and opinions. This has been enormously helpful to me and our company. 
Second, I would like to emphasize the strengths and advantages of Kimco from a very high level as I see them. The firm, founded by Milton and Martin Kimmel more than 55 years ago, is a retail powerhouse in terms of its size, diversification, balance sheet, dividend safety, national scale, tenant relationships and industry context. We are the retail partner of choice for many private equity and institutional owners of both retail operating companies and retail property assets. 
Our opportunistic culture and investing disciplines have resulted in many wonderfully profitable investments for our shareholders, most recently our sale of SUPERVALU stock and the pending Albertsons IPO. 
Third, the investment world sometimes, in my opinion, focuses a little too much on a simple metric as a proxy for the prospects of a REIT or the quality of its portfolio. In our case, it has been and will continue to be a deeper story of corporate financial strength, size, scale and a culture totally focused on creating value for our shareholders. We have more properties, more local offices, more individual tenants and more retailer relationships than any of our peers. And combined with one of the lowest dividend payout ratios in the industry and our strong BBB+ investment-grade balance sheet, we stand second to none. 
Our portfolio, after more than $5 billion of retail property sales and close to $5 billion of retail property acquisitions over the past 5 years, now consists of a very broad group of very high-quality properties and excellent long-term growth markets with numerous very accretive redevelopment prospects. 
Now stepping down off the soapbox and focusing on our third quarter. We are pleased to report excellent financial results for the quarter. Together with a dividend increase of 6.3% and a guidance increase. As usual, Glenn and Conor will discuss the specific details, while Milton will close with some general thoughts. 
Overall, both our earnings and portfolio fundamentals are solid, helped by the portfolio upgrade accomplished through the sale of our lower-tier retail assets and numerous high-quality acquisitions. The open-air property sector in general continues to have bright prospects due to limited new supply and the continued expansion of both national discounters and service-oriented retailers.  Most of our top tenants are committed to significant store expansion plans and effective rents and leasing spreads are rising markedly. 
With respect to our corporate strategy, our U.S. property dispositions will be largely completed this year. And we have moved quickly in Canada to take advantage of historic low cap rates by selling 19 properties to our RioCan joint venture partner with 26 additional sale properties pending, totaling CAD 774 million. 22 of the additional 26 properties are being sold to either third parties or other Canadian joint venture operating partners. 
Due to today's low cap rates compared to the high cap rates when we entered Canada in 2002, we have substantial gains embedded in our portfolio, and we have structured our transactions to reduce the tax effects as much as possible. As such, our exit from Canada will be measured, but we do expect to have largely monetized our Canadian assets during 2016. 
At that point, Kimco will be totally focused on the U.S., and we will self manage virtually all of our properties. 
We continue to feel very positive for at least the next several years about the underlying fundamentals of our open-air retail properties and the markets we have chosen to focus on. E-commerce has been effectively incorporated into brick-and-mortar store operations as showrooms, last mile delivery and brand awareness become more and more critical to successful retail businesses. I do hope everyone took note of Amazon's announcement on Tuesday that they have opened their first full brick-and-mortar store in Seattle. 
Amazon has now formally recognized that the omni-channel concept is very successful, and that physical stores are important components of growth even for e-commerce retailers. As a quick update on the Albertsons IPO. The actual IPO S-1 filing remains open to provide future timing flexibility. Store operations also continued to perform well, and the integration of Safeway and Albertsons has progressed very smoothly. 
Now I'd like to turn to Glenn, Conor and Milton for their thoughts"
320371,309184503,896218,"Kimco Realty Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2015",2015-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Kimco Realty Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Dave, and good morning.

Our third quarter 2015 results were strong with significant progress made on the disposition and simplification fronts. 
Even with some headwinds from the bankruptcies of Anna's Linens and ANP, our overall portfolio operating metrics continue to produce solid results. Headline FFO per share, which represents the official [indiscernible] definition and was used for first call consensus was $0.40 for the third quarter, $0.03 above consensus. Included in the headline amount is the further monetization of our SUPERVALU stock investment which provided a gain of $6.1 million, our PLUS business at work, and $7.6 million from profit participation earned from the sale of a Canadian preferred equity investment. For the 9 months, headline FFO per share is $1.21, up from $1.07 for the same period last year, a 13.1% increase. 
FFO as adjusted per share or recurring FFO, which excludes transactional income and expense and nonoperating impairments, was $0.36 for the third quarter, same level as reported in the third quarter last year. Our results include an increase in recurring consolidated EBITDA of $6.3 million, driven primarily by the operating portfolio, which was offset by higher interest expense of $2.5 million related to the debt assumed in connection with the Kimstone acquisition earlier in the year. 
For the 9 months, FFO as adjusted per share is $1.09, up from $1.05 for the comparable period last year, a 3.8% increase. We are pleased that we have successfully continued to grow our earnings while dramatically transforming the portfolio with sales in the U.S., Mexico, Latin America and Canadian asset sales totaling over $1.4 billion over the past 12 months. 
We have mitigated much of the dilutive impact with the acquisition of over $2 billion of U.S. properties in our key markets, many of which were sourced from our joint venture programs and from reduced debt cost with well-timed debt refinances. 
Our portfolio operating metrics remained solid. U.S. pro-rata occupancy stands at 95.6%, up 10 basis points from a year ago. The bankruptcy of Anna's Linens, nicked occupancy by 20 basis points this quarter. The team is focused on filling these boxes over the coming months. Breaking it down further, our anchor boxes are 98.3% leased, up 10 basis points from the year ago. And small top occupancy is at 88%, up 100 basis points from the year ago. Our leasing team continues to deliver strong leasing spreads with new leases up 28.6% and renewals and options up 6.2% for combined positive leasing spreads of 10.6 for the quarter. 
U.S. same-site NOI growth was 2.4% for the third quarter compared to a 4.9% comp last year, bringing our U.S. same-site NOI growth for the 9 months to 3%, in line with our guidance range of 3% to 3.5% for the full year. The key driver of our year-to-date same-site NOI growth has been the increase in minimum rent of 3% and improved recoveries and other revenues which added another 42 basis points. 
Same-site NOI growth was negatively impacted by 46 basis points due to higher credit loss reserves required primarily from the bankruptcies previously mentioned. Combined same-site NOI growth, including Canada, but excluding the negative 150 basis point impact of currency, was 2.2% for the third quarter and 2.8% for the 9 months. 
Now for a few comments on balance sheet and capital market activity. We remain confident that we will reach our goal of 6x consolidated net debt to recurring EBITDA by year end without the need for any common equity. This will be a swift improvement from the 6.6x level at the end of the first quarter. We ended the third quarter at 6.3x, the same as last quarter. 
We had anticipated closing the first part of the RioCan sale by September 30. But due to regulatory issues, we did not complete the transaction until the beginning of October. Consolidated net debt-to-EBITDA on a pro forma basis, including the sale of RioCan will be 6.1x. 
Subsequent to quarter end, we successfully capped a volatile bond market issuing a 500 million, 7-year bond and a coupon of 3.4% with a spread right on top of our secondaries. Proceeds will be used to repay higher coupon debt. The issuance addresses our remaining maturities in 2015 of $169 million. And more than 1/3 of the maturities due in 2016. In addition, we have immediate liquidity in excess of $1.9 billion as of today with cash on hand and $1.7 billion available on our revolving credit facility. 
We also announced the redemption of our $175 million, 6.9% Class A preferred stock which will occur on November 25. We will record a $5.8 million noncash charge related to redemption in the fourth quarter which will impact our headline FFO. Proceeds from our anticipated sales mentioned in our press release will be used to fund the redemption. The redemption will result in a reduction of our fixed charges by $12.1 million annually. 
Based on our solid results for the first 9 months and expectations for the remainder of the year, we are raising our headline FFO per share guidance to $1.54 to $1.57, which includes the redemption charge mentioned above and minimal additional transactional income for the fourth quarter. We are also tightening our FFO as adjusted per share guidance range to $1.44 to $1.46 from the previous guidance range.  Guidance for 2016 will be provided at our Investor Day in December. 
Lastly, we're pleased to announce that based on our 2015 performance, our Board of Directors has approved an increase in the cash dividend to $0.255 per quarter, up from $0.24 per quarter, an increase of 6.3% on an annualized basis. Our FFO payout ratio will remain conservative in the mid-60s percent range, among the lowest in our peer group. 
Now before I turn it over to Conor, I want to thank Dave Henry for all his support and mentorship and advice over the past 1.5 decades. Dave has fostered a terrific culture at Kimco with the approach of treating everyone with the utmost respect. Dave keeps a saying on his desk which describes him perfectly. It says, it is nice to be important, but it's more important to be nice. Dave is a terrific leader and a truly nice guy. We will miss him. With that, Conor?"

Today, I'll start by recapping the progress on our key metrics, followed by an update on acquisitions and dispositions and finish with an overview of our strategic development and redevelopment pipeline. Overal",958,"Thanks, Glenn, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll start by recapping the progress on our key metrics, followed by an update on acquisitions and dispositions and finish with an overview of our strategic development and redevelopment pipeline. 
Overall, the fundamentals of the open-air shopping center business remained healthy due to the supply and demand balance. While the bankruptcy filings of Anna’s Linens, Haggen and ANP will add to the supply side, the demand for quality real estate continues to far outweigh this factor as evidenced by the amount of bidders during these bankruptcy proceedings. 4 of our 9 ANPs were recaptured by Kimco, and the remaining 5 were purchased by ACME [ph] and Best Yet. These bankruptcies will create some near-term headwinds to occupancy and same-site NOI. But given our strategy of focusing on great real estate with below-market rents, our shareholders will achieve long-term value as we mark-to-market these leases and continue to redevelop our assets. 
Turning to our major metrics. The U.S. portfolio occupancy dipped 10 basis points over the last quarter to 95.6% due to negative net absorption and the disposition of 15 fully stabilized shopping centers. Small shop occupancy remained flat at 88% from last quarter, up 100 basis points from prior year. Anchor occupancy dipped 10 basis points over the last quarter to 98.3%. The 22 Anna’s Linens boxes recaptured this quarter provide an extended runway to allow our team to unlock value and take advantage of the upside due to the 10% to 20% mark-to-market opportunities embedded in these low-average base rent leases. 
Our combined leasing spreads for the third quarter continue to trend over 10%, a strong indicator that pricing power is intact in our key markets. 
Same-site NOI of 2.4% in the U.S. was driven primarily by minimum rent increases, higher than expected percentage rent but muted by higher-than-expected credit loss due to the bankruptcies mentioned earlier. 
The majority of retailers in our sector has significant new store opening plans and multiple size prototypes. A few examples of new innovative off-price concepts included Find [ph] at Lord and Taylor and LemonPop by Charlotte Russe. These retailers are adding to the already crowded field looking for high-quality space and driving up rents. 
In addition, we welcomed new tenants this quarter such as Sephora, that will add a vibrant retail mix in our open-air shopping centers. Small shop leasing shows signs of acceleration as we have seen the mom-and-pop retailer return, accounting for nearly half of the small shop leases this quarter. 
We continue to execute on our transformation and simplification with the previously announced closing of the 100% entries in Montgomery Square in Fort Worth, as well as the acquisition of our partner's interest in Conroe Marketplace, located in the Houston MSA, subsequent to quarter end. Both of these transactions result in further consolidation of our joint venture properties and give us buying opportunities in key strategic markets in a challenging acquisition environment. 
We also acquired 3 parcels adjacent to our top assets as we look to expand our footprint where we see future redevelopment opportunity. The acquisition market remains competitive for high-quality core assets. While we search for value-add opportunities, we continue to be selective. 
The disposition market remains healthy but showing signs of stabilizing with buyers still on the hunt for yield. In the third quarter, we sold 14 triple net assets and 15 shopping centers, totaling 1.8 million square feet generating 104 million in Kimco share proceeds at a blended cap rate of 6.9%. Buyers of these assets are taking advantage of the readily available financing of up to 80% loan-to-value with floating interest rates at all-time lows, which generate significant cash-on-cash returns. Buyers this quarter include public and private institutions, including REITs and local private buyers. 
Currently in the U.S., we have 17 assets under contract for $208 million, 13 accepted offers, totaling $172 million. And another 22 assets in the market that will complete our transformation by year end and produce another $400 million of gross proceeds. Steady progress continues to be made on our redevelopment and development pipelines. This quarter, we completed $36.5 million of redevelopments with blended incremental ROI of 9.9%. The redevelopment activity added 10 basis points to same-site NOI this quarter. 
Our new lease with Safeway, and specific in California, was executed in the third quarter, moving that grocery redevelopment in the Bay Area up to the active category. Currently, the redevelopment pipeline has a gross value of just over $1.1 billion with a total of $269 million in active redevelopment, with another $734 million in design and entitlement and $122 million that is under review. In addition to our 4 development projects, due to robust retailer demand at our Grand Parkway project, this quarter, we purchased the adjacent 35-acre land parcel to accommodate Phase II. 
In closing, year-over-year average base rent per square foot is up 6.2%, and we continue to push towards unlocking more of the embedded value in our portfolio. In the third quarter, Kimco is inducted into the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. We are proud to be the only retail REIT in the index. And it highlights our ongoing commitment to become a leader in corporate responsibility and sustainability as we evolve into the next-generation REIT. 
Finally, I would like to express how grateful and appreciative I am to have had the opportunity to work with Dave for close to 15 years. He has been a mentor, a sounding board, a guidepost and a dear friend that I truly value. Thanks to Dave and his leadership, Kimco is well positioned to continue to deliver for our shareholders and become the leader in our industry. And with that, I will turn it over to Milton for his final comments."

So at this point, I examined our portfolio in light of a possible future downturn. And I feel confident that on a relative basis, we are in the sweet spot of retail real estate ownership. 
Our retail real estate is defensive in connection with any downturn but with great opportunity during the up cycles. In tough times, off-price retailers should do well. Our portfolio contains many off-price retailers, including TJX, Rolex Stores, Burlington Coat and Nordstrom Rack in over 200 locations. There is a food component, 71.4% of [indiscernible]. We are the largest owner of Costco and Home Depot sites with 12 Costcos and 28 Home Depots, credits that are very strong. Our top 5 tenants are TJX, Home Depot, Bed Bath & Beyond, [indiscernible] and Walmart. 
Most of our tenants sell low-cost everyday essential items. No retailer will be immune from a downturn but I think we are well positioned. And we have an experience, energetic executive team that is passionate about our business and focused on creating and managing value to our portfolio. So I face the future with confidence. 
And I too would like to mention a few words about Dave. Dave has been my partner for the past 14 years. He has a wonderful way about him. He is sensitive, a great people person and has always had a sense of doing the right thing. You would never ever hear Dave say, ""Well, that's business."" We will miss him. We wish him well and we are so pleased that we will have Dave available to us to share his audacity with us. All the best, Dave. And as a final comment and to echo Dave Bujnicki, all of us at Kimco would very much leave -- love to see all of you at our Investor Day in December 10. 
And with that, we are delighted to answer any questions you may have."

And then there's 22 others that will be sold either to third parties or to other joint venture operating partners. The biggest one being Anthem properties. We have more than 20 properties with Anthem. And those properties will all be sold during next year. And the total proceeds will be just under CAD 800 million.

And tax, I think, we're still working on various tax strategies so Glenn can probably comment better on giving you a rough guess on the tax effect. But we are managing this as best we can to avoid any kind of special dividend. We do have large embedded gains, thanks to the timing of our entry in Canada and the hard work that our operating partners have done out there. The market remains very strong for A properties in Canada with cap rates in the 5s for the As. Secondary assets or secondary locations, the cap rates have widened a bit, I'd say, to the higher part of 6s. But the average, I think if you wanted a rough average for us, a 6 would be a good number. And with that, Ross, do you have any other color?"

And your question about the small shop velocity for 1 year vacant versus less than 1 year vacant, it really is because we've sold so much of our portfolio, the spaces that have been vacant a long period of time are typically in those sites that we've sold. So the ones that have been vacant for a significant amount of time, we see just as much activity on the ones that have been -- have just recently become vacant.

As I prepare to pass the baton to Conor on January 1 and after 59 earnings calls over the last 15 years, permit me to give you a few personal thoughts. 
First, it has been a sincere pleasure to personally meet and spend time over the years with most of the analysts and investors on the call today. Everyone has been gracious and thoroughly engaging while unabashedly providing me and our team their thoughts and opinions. This has been enormously helpful to me and our company. 
Second, I would like to emphasize the strengths and advantages of Kimco from a very high level as I see them. The firm, founded by Milton and Martin Kimmel more than 55 years ago, is a retail powerhouse in terms of its size, diversification, balance sheet, dividend safety, national scale, tenant relationships and industry context. We are the retail partner of choice for many private equity and institutional owners of both retail operating companies and retail property assets. 
Our opportunistic culture and investing disciplines have resulted in many wonderfully profitable investments for our shareholders, most recently our sale of SUPERVALU stock and the pending Albertsons IPO. 
Third, the investment world sometimes, in my opinion, focuses a little too much on a simple metric as a proxy for the prospects of a REIT or the quality of its portfolio. In our case, it has been and will continue to be a deeper story of corporate financial strength, size, scale and a culture totally focused on creating value for our shareholders. We have more properties, more local offices, more individual tenants and more retailer relationships than any of our peers. And combined with one of the lowest dividend payout ratios in the industry and our strong BBB+ investment-grade balance sheet, we stand second to none. 
Our portfolio, after more than $5 billion of retail property sales and close to $5 billion of retail property acquisitions over the past 5 years, now consists of a very broad group of very high-quality properties and excellent long-term growth markets with numerous very accretive redevelopment prospects. 
Now stepping down off the soapbox and focusing on our third quarter. We are pleased to report excellent financial results for the quarter. Together with a dividend increase of 6.3% and a guidance increase. As usual, Glenn and Conor will discuss the specific details, while Milton will close with some general thoughts. 
Overall, both our earnings and portfolio fundamentals are solid, helped by the portfolio upgrade accomplished through the sale of our lower-tier retail assets and numerous high-quality acquisitions. The open-air property sector in general continues to have bright prospects due to limited new supply and the continued expansion of both national discounters and service-oriented retailers.  Most of our top tenants are committed to significant store expansion plans and effective rents and leasing spreads are rising markedly. 
With respect to our corporate strategy, our U.S. property dispositions will be largely completed this year. And we have moved quickly in Canada to take advantage of historic low cap rates by selling 19 properties to our RioCan joint venture partner with 26 additional sale properties pending, totaling CAD 774 million. 22 of the additional 26 properties are being sold to either third parties or other Canadian joint venture operating partners. 
Due to today's low cap rates compared to the high cap rates when we entered Canada in 2002, we have substantial gains embedded in our portfolio, and we have structured our transactions to reduce the tax effects as much as possible. As such, our exit from Canada will be measured, but we do expect to have largely monetized our Canadian assets during 2016. 
At that point, Kimco will be totally focused on the U.S., and we will self-manage virtually all of our properties. 
We continue to feel very positive for at least the next several years about the underlying fundamentals of our open-air retail properties and the markets we have chosen to focus on. E-commerce has been effectively incorporated into brick-and-mortar store operations as showrooms, last mile delivery and brand awareness become more and more critical to successful retail businesses. I do hope everyone took note of Amazon's announcement on Tuesday that they have opened their first full brick-and-mortar store in Seattle. 
Amazon has now formally recognized that the omni-channel concept is very successful, and that physical stores are important components of growth even for e-commerce retailers. As a quick update on the Albertsons IPO. The actual IPO S-1 filing remains open to provide future timing flexibility. Store operations also continued to perform well, and the integration of Safeway and Albertsons has progressed very smoothly. 
Now I'd like to turn to Glenn, Conor and Milton for their thoughts"

Our third quarter 2015 results were strong with significant progress made on the disposition and simplification fronts. 
Even with some headwinds from the bankruptcies of Anna's Linens and A&P, our overall portfolio operating metrics continue to produce solid results. Headline FFO per share, which represents the official NAREIT definition and was used for first call consensus was $0.40 for the third quarter, $0.03 above consensus. Included in the headline amount is the further monetization of our SUPERVALU stock investment which provided a gain of $6.1 million, our PLUS business at work, and $7.6 million from profit participation earned from the sale of a Canadian preferred equity investment. For the 9 months, headline FFO per share is $1.21, up from $1.07 for the same period last year, a 13.1% increase. 
FFO as adjusted per share or recurring FFO, which excludes transactional income and expense and nonoperating impairments, was $0.36 for the third quarter, same level as reported in the third quarter last year. Our results include an increase in recurring consolidated EBITDA of $6.3 million, driven primarily by the operating portfolio, which was offset by higher interest expense of $2.5 million related to the debt assumed in connection with the Kimstone acquisition earlier in the year. 
For the 9 months, FFO as adjusted per share is $1.09, up from $1.05 for the comparable period last year, a 3.8% increase. We are pleased that we have successfully continued to grow our earnings while dramatically transforming the portfolio with sales in the U.S., Mexico, Latin America and Canadian asset sales totaling over $1.4 billion over the past 12 months. 
We have mitigated much of the dilutive impact with the acquisition of over $2 billion of U.S. properties in our key markets, many of which were sourced from our joint venture programs and from reduced debt cost with well-timed debt refinances. 
Our portfolio operating metrics remained solid. U.S. pro-rata occupancy stands at 95.6%, up 10 basis points from a year ago. The bankruptcy of Anna's Linens, nicked occupancy by 20 basis points this quarter. The team is focused on filling these boxes over the coming months. Breaking it down further, our anchor boxes are 98.3% leased, up 10 basis points from the year ago. And small shop occupancy is at 88%, up 100 basis points from the year ago. Our leasing team continues to deliver strong leasing spreads with new leases up 28.6% and renewals and options up 6.2% for combined positive leasing spreads of 10.6 for the quarter. 
U.S. same-site NOI growth was 2.4% for the third quarter compared to a 4.9% comp last year, bringing our U.S. same-site NOI growth for the 9 months to 3%, in line with our guidance range of 3% to 3.5% for the full year. The key driver of our year-to-date same-site NOI growth has been the increase in minimum rent of 3% and improved recoveries and other revenues which added another 42 basis points. 
Same-site NOI growth was negatively impacted by 46 basis points due to higher credit loss reserves required primarily from the bankruptcies previously mentioned. Combined same-site NOI growth, including Canada, but excluding the negative 150 basis point impact of currency, was 2.2% for the third quarter and 2.8% for the 9 months. 
Now for a few comments on balance sheet and capital market activity. We remain confident that we will reach our goal of 6x consolidated net debt to recurring EBITDA by year end without the need for any common equity. This will be a swift improvement from the 6.6x level at the end of the first quarter. We ended the third quarter at 6.3x, the same as last quarter. 
We had anticipated closing the first part of the RioCan sale by September 30. But due to regulatory issues, we did not complete the transaction until the beginning of October. Consolidated net debt-to-EBITDA on a pro forma basis, including the sale of RioCan will be 6.1x. 
Subsequent to quarter end, we successfully capped a volatile bond market issuing a 500 million, 7-year bond and a coupon of 3.4% with a spread right on top of our secondaries. Proceeds will be used to repay higher coupon debt. The issuance addresses our remaining maturities in 2015 of $169 million. And more than 1/3 of the maturities due in 2016. In addition, we have immediate liquidity in excess of $1.9 billion as of today with cash on hand and $1.7 billion available on our revolving credit facility. 
We also announced the redemption of our $175 million, 6.9% Class A preferred stock which will occur on November 25. We will record a $5.8 million noncash charge related to redemption in the fourth quarter which will impact our headline FFO. Proceeds from our anticipated sales mentioned in our press release will be used to fund the redemption. The redemption will result in a reduction of our fixed charges by $12.1 million annually. 
Based on our solid results for the first 9 months and expectations for the remainder of the year, we are raising our headline FFO per share guidance to $1.54 to $1.57, which includes the redemption charge mentioned above and minimal additional transactional income for the fourth quarter. We are also tightening our FFO as adjusted per share guidance range to $1.44 to $1.46 from the previous guidance range.  Guidance for 2016 will be provided at our Investor Day in December. 
Lastly, we're pleased to announce that based on our 2015 performance, our Board of Directors has approved an increase in the cash dividend to $0.255 per quarter, up from $0.24 per quarter, an increase of 6.3% on an annualized basis. Our FFO payout ratio will remain conservative in the mid-60s percent range, among the lowest in our peer group. 
Now before I turn it over to Conor, I want to thank Dave Henry for all his support and mentorship and advice over the past 1.5 decades. Dave has fostered a terrific culture at Kimco with the approach of treating everyone with the utmost respect. Dave keeps a saying on his desk which describes him perfectly. It says, ""It is nice to be important, but it's more important to be nice."" Dave is a terrific leader and a truly nice guy. We will miss him. With that, Conor?"

Overal",958,"Thanks, Glenn, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll start by recapping the progress on our key metrics, followed by an update on acquisitions and dispositions and finish with an overview of our strategic development and redevelopment pipeline. 
Overall, the fundamentals of the open-air shopping center business remained healthy due to the supply and demand balance. While the bankruptcy filings of Anna’s Linens, Haggen and A&P will add to the supply side, the demand for quality real estate continues to far outweigh this factor as evidenced by the amount of bidders during these bankruptcy proceedings. 4 of our 9 A&Ps were recaptured by Kimco, and the remaining 5 were purchased by ACME and Best Yet. These bankruptcies will create some near-term headwinds to occupancy and same-site NOI. But given our strategy of focusing on great real estate with below-market rents, our shareholders will achieve long-term value as we mark-to-market these leases and continue to redevelop our assets. 
Turning to our major metrics. The U.S. portfolio occupancy dipped 10 basis points over the last quarter to 95.6% due to negative net absorption and the disposition of 15 fully stabilized shopping centers. Small shop occupancy remained flat at 88% from last quarter, up 100 basis points from prior year. Anchor occupancy dipped 10 basis points over the last quarter to 98.3%. The 22 Anna’s Linens boxes recaptured this quarter provide an extended runway to allow our team to unlock value and take advantage of the upside due to the 10% to 20% mark-to-market opportunities embedded in these low-average base rent leases. 
Our combined leasing spreads for the third quarter continue to trend over 10%, a strong indicator that pricing power is intact in our key markets. 
Same-site NOI of 2.4% in the U.S. was driven primarily by minimum rent increases, higher than expected percentage rent but muted by higher-than-expected credit loss due to the bankruptcies mentioned earlier. 
The majority of retailers in our sector has significant new store opening plans and multiple size prototypes. A few examples of new innovative off-price concepts included Find [ph] at Lord and Taylor and LemonPop by Charlotte Russe. These retailers are adding to the already crowded field looking for high-quality space and driving up rents. 
In addition, we welcomed new tenants this quarter such as Sephora, that will add a vibrant retail mix in our open-air shopping centers. Small shop leasing shows signs of acceleration as we have seen the mom-and-pop retailer return, accounting for nearly half of the small shop leases this quarter. 
We continue to execute on our transformation and simplification with the previously announced closing of the 100% interest in Montgomery Square in Fort Worth, as well as the acquisition of our partner's interest in Conroe Marketplace, located in the Houston MSA, subsequent to quarter end. Both of these transactions result in further consolidation of our joint venture properties and give us buying opportunities in key strategic markets in a challenging acquisition environment. 
We also acquired 3 parcels adjacent to our top assets as we look to expand our footprint where we see future redevelopment opportunity. The acquisition market remains competitive for high-quality core assets. While we search for value-add opportunities, we continue to be selective. 
The disposition market remains healthy but showing signs of stabilizing with buyers still on the hunt for yield. In the third quarter, we sold 14 triple net assets and 15 shopping centers, totaling 1.8 million square feet generating $104 million in Kimco share proceeds at a blended cap rate of 6.9%. Buyers of these assets are taking advantage of the readily available financing of up to 80% loan-to-value with floating interest rates at all-time lows, which generate significant cash-on-cash returns. Buyers this quarter include public and private institutions, including REITs and local private buyers. 
Currently in the U.S., we have 17 assets under contract for $208 million, 13 accepted offers, totaling $172 million. And another 22 assets in the market that will complete our transformation by year end and produce another $400 million of gross proceeds. Steady progress continues to be made on our redevelopment and development pipelines. This quarter, we completed $36.5 million of redevelopments with blended incremental ROI of 9.9%. The redevelopment activity added 10 basis points to same-site NOI this quarter. 
A new lease with Safeway, and specific in California, was executed in the third quarter, moving that grocery redevelopment in the Bay Area up to the active category. Currently, the redevelopment pipeline has a gross value of just over $1.1 billion with a total of $269 million in active redevelopment, with another $734 million in design and entitlement and $122 million that is under review. In addition to our 4 development projects, due to robust retailer demand at our Grand Parkway project, this quarter, we purchased the adjacent 35-acre land parcel to accommodate a Phase II. 
In closing, year-over-year average base rent per square foot is up 6.2%, and we continue to push towards unlocking more of the embedded value in our portfolio. In the third quarter, Kimco was inducted into the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. We are proud to be the only retail REIT in the index. And it highlights our ongoing commitment to become a leader in corporate responsibility and sustainability as we evolve into the next-generation REIT. 
Finally, I would like to express how grateful and appreciative I am to have had the opportunity to work with Dave for close to 15 years. He has been a mentor, a sounding board, a guidepost and a dear friend that I truly value. Thanks to Dave and his leadership, Kimco is well positioned to continue to deliver for our shareholders and become the leader in our industry. And with that, I will turn it over to Milton for his final comments."

So at this point, I examined our portfolio in light of a possible future downturn. And I feel confident that on a relative basis, we are in the sweet spot of retail real estate ownership. 
Our retail real estate is defensive in connection with any downturn but with great opportunity during the up cycles. In tough times, off-price retailers should do well. Our portfolio contains many off-price retailers, including TJX, Ross stores, Burlington Coat and Nordstrom Rack in over 200 locations. There is a food component in 71.4% of our center. We are the largest owner of Costco and Home Depot sites with 12 Costcos and 28 Home Depots, credits that are very strong. Our top 5 tenants are TJX, Home Depot, Bed Bath & Beyond, Royal Ahold and Walmart. 
Most of our tenants sell low-cost everyday essential items. No retailer will be immune from a downturn but I think we are well positioned. And we have an experienced, energetic executive team that is passionate about our business and focused on creating and managing value to our portfolio. So I face the future with confidence. 
And I too would like to mention a few words about Dave. Dave has been my partner for the past 14 years. He has a wonderful way about him. He is sensitive, a great people person and has always had a sense of doing the right thing. You would never ever hear Dave say, ""Well, that's business."" We will miss him.

And then there's 22 others that will be sold either to third parties or to other joint venture operating partners. The biggest one being Anthem properties. We have more than 20 properties with Anthem. And those properties will all be sold during next year. And the total proceeds will be just under CAD 800 million. I think we're going to average about a fixed cap rate before tax. And tax, I think, we're still working on various tax strategies so Glenn can probably comment better on giving you a rough guess on the tax effect. But we are managing this as best we can to avoid any kind of special dividend. We do have large embedded gains, thanks to the timing of our entry in Canada and the hard work that our operating partners have done out there. The market remains very strong for A properties in Canada with cap rates in the 5s for the As. Secondary assets or secondary locations, the cap rates have widened a bit, I'd say, to the higher part of 6s. But the average, I think if you wanted a rough average for us, a 6 would be a good number. And with that, Ross, do you have any other color?"

It won't be certainly an issue for 2015's dividend. There's no requirement for a special dividend or a special distribution. And we feel comfortable as we start to look into 2016 that we can deal with those gains as well. Again, we've done a lot to accelerate tax depreciation.

And you see with the recent bankruptcies, some of these projects we didn't have in our redevelopment pipeline. And so as retail shifts and as the portfolio changes, we look to acquire assets with redevelopment potential. We look at our existing assets where we can acquire adjacent parcels to potentially add future redevelopment projects. So we really want this to be a cornerstone of our strategy and it continues to grow and we think there's opportunity embedded in our portfolio."

So I think that this trend will continue. They've seen the tremendous success of TJX and Ross. They've seen that really today's shopper is really focused on trying to find that deal, trying to take advantage of that treasure hunt. And they've done a good job in terms of merchandising their stores. And we think it's a great plus to our business because they continue to add to the demand."

You're continuing to see many of the services as well as the restaurants expand rapidly. Quick service restaurants have been one of the fastest-growing components of our small shops. But you're also seeing it in some of the mid-sized small soft goods players and some of the dollar stores. Five Below, there's still plenty of opportunity there in addition to Old Navy and others. But we have seen that really the boost is coming from the services. And that's great for us because those tenants are stickier. We're also seeing some impact from the medical players, the urgent care center, the dentist, the optometrist. All those continue to expand. And your question about the small shop velocity for 1 year vacant versus less than 1 year vacant, it really is because we've sold so much of our portfolio, the spaces that have been vacant a long period of time are typically in those sites that we've sold. So the ones that have been vacant for a significant amount of time, we see just as much activity on as the ones that have been -- have just recently become vacant. Because our centers now are much of higher quality in dense areas where there's a lot of demand and not quite as much shop space available. So we're confident that we can deliver in terms of our small shop occupancy gains and points to that 90% by the end of next year."
