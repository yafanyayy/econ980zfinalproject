Joining us today is Dennis Secor, our Chief Financial Officer. We will begin today's call with our prepared remarks and then open the call to answer questions. As we look back on 2014, we are pleased to conclude",1893,"Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining us today is Dennis Secor, our Chief Financial Officer. We will begin today's call with our prepared remarks and then open the call to answer questions. 
As we look back on 2014, we are pleased to conclude another year of solid sales and earnings per share growth for the Fossil Group. The strength of our diverse business model, our team's disciplined execution of our strategies and our strong financial position drove overall results within our expectations.
We return value to our shareholders through the continued execution of our share repurchase program, while navigating unfavorable changes in currency at the end of the year. Importantly, we delivered strong results for the year while continuing to invest in the business to fuel future growth. And we drove efficiencies in our operations that position us to deliver solid returns for our shareholders well into the future. 
2014 included an 8% top line increase to $3.5 billion, an 8% reduction our share base as a result of continued execution of our share repurchase program. And we delivered $7.10 in earnings per share, an 8% increase over last year.
Changes in foreign currency aside, our fourth quarter included increased sales, robust growth internationally, very strong gains in jewelry, operating margin expansion, double-digit increase in earnings per share and was highlighted by continuing strength in our FOSSIL and SKAGEN lifestyle brands. That said, we are not entirely satisfied with our fourth quarter performance, particularly as it relates to our North America business.
We began 2015 intensely focused on taking advantage of the many opportunities available to us to drive future growth, including enhancing our multibrand portfolio to drive growth, investing in strategic initiatives to further grow our own brands and developing new categories that we believe can drive top line growth.
We reflect on this past year one in which we achieve our goal of maximizing the strength of our portfolio brands through our global distribution platform. We believe our portfolio of highly desirable brands, our continuous innovation, disciplined execution and considerable white space opportunity by brand category and geography has us well-positioned to continue our successful growth for many years in the future.
In 2014, we made solid progress on many key objectives that we will build upon in 2015. We grew our own lifestyle brands, FOSSIL and SKAGEN. Our FOSSIL brand grew at 3% for the year with growth in all regions. We leveraged our position as a leader in lifestyle branded watches and drove solid high single-digit growth in the watch category for the brand. The brand's growth was strongest in Asia with strong high teen growth in the region. 
Outside of watches, the year included to successfully position of our leathers business. We improved our performance in the category, particularly women's handbags, where we concentrated efforts to add to our design team and bolster our products to gain broader consumer appeal.
Our elevated assortment is resonating well with customers, particularly in our retail stores, where we have the best opportunity to clearly communicate the brand story and improve presentations through shop-in-shops within U.S. department stores.
We continue to believe FOSSIL jewelry is an opportunity for growth. And having spent this past year repositioning our U.S. distribution, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on synergies that jewelry shared with watches. In fact, the overall jewelry category is benefiting from the influence of lifestyle brands, and our compelling brands and developed distribution correct can facilitate growth in this category.
During the year, we turn our attention to direct investment toward demand creation opportunities that we believe will yield dividends for the brand in the future. We increased investments in our CRM capabilities, and we believe we are taking the right steps to achieve our goal of becoming world-class over time.
We also invested in brand building and demand creation activities, including marketing initiatives for FOSSIL. These are activities that we believe will broaden our customer base and drive increased interest and market share gains for the brand. 
This year, we made solid progress advancing SKAGEN. We achieved a 14% growth with sales accelerating in the back half of the year. The brand saw balanced growth across geographies with watches and jewelry posting solid, double-digit gains. We drove solid growth in jewelry, successful launch handbags and opened 2 new high-profile store locations in Frankfurt and New York that are performing well. These stores, along with our remodeled stores in London, allow us to showcase the full array of SKAGEN's product in an environment that reflects the differentiated and unique position of the brand.
Additionally, we enhanced our customer's digital experience with the brand with the launch of a redesigned SKAGEN website, which includes improved functionality for the customer and incorporates rich brand content designed to bring greater awareness to the brand.
In our portfolio, we continue to leverage our competitive strengths in branding, design, sourcing and distribution to gain increased market share and the growing watch industry. Our multi-brand watch portfolio grew 9% for the year with the strongest gains internationally. Across brands, we saw strength in long-standing brands, as well as newer brands, with Michael Kors, Armani, DIESEL and MARC by MARC all driving growth.
Our launch of the Tory Burch watch collection was highly successful and highlighted our design in Swiss production capabilities. We introduced the distinctive and Swiss watch assortment to a strategically targeted global distribution and expect to build upon the initial success of the line in the spring season. 
In addition to Tory Burch, we advanced our Swiss initiative with the spring launch of Emporio Armani Swiss-made. This Swiss opportunity represents one of the important white space opportunities we see available for lifestyle brand. And given our sourcing and production capability us, we are well-positioned to take advantage of the long-term opportunity with our license brands, as well as the continued execution of FOSSIL Swiss-made.
We also successfully executed 10-year renewals for 2 of our longstanding licenses, EMPORIO ARMANI and Michael Kors, solidifying our position at the national partner for the best global fashion brands. And today, we announced another exciting development with the addition of Kate Spade. This brand is clearly resonating with consumers globally and is positioned for long-term growth. We are excited to leverage our expertise in design, production and global distribution to grow their watch business and expand their brand around the world.
In another white space opportunity, we advanced our position in wearable technology with 2 very important partnerships with Google and Intel. We are partnering with the best in technology to deleverage their knowledge and expertise and enable our portfolio of lifestyle brands to develop fashionable, connected accessories. Our expertise in designing creativity, coupled with our partner's expertise in technology and innovation, will enable us to introduce wearable technology in a fashionable and scalable way. We are working towards integrating technology into our accessories in a manner that gives our focus on our core customer. We believe she prioritizes fashion with desires and improved functionality.
As we look forward to introducing connected accessories later this year, we are working towards a larger objective of leveraging our strength and leadership position and fashion watches to become the point where fashion, design and technology converge. We operate a very diverse business model with many levers of growth. We are globally diverse growth company and we operate in a growing industry. Our results this year continue to highlight this strength.
We achieved growth across each of our region this past year. This includes the Americas, a region that is nearly $2 billion today and includes our most mature market, United States, where we already have nearly 50% of the share of the watch market in the under $1,000 price point. 
In our international markets, as lifestyle brands take share from traditional watch brand, our goal is to replicate the success that we've experienced in the United States.
Europe continues to be strong for us this past year with 13% growth for the year and sales nearing $1.2 billion. This growth was balanced across markets. And we continue to have opportunity across Europe as we increase the number of our brands sold through existing doors, as well as expanding into new markets. 
In Asia, sales grew 15%, approaching $600 million with balanced growth across markets. Outside the United States and particularly in Asia, where we have a much smaller share of the existing watch market, the trend towards lifestyle brands is emerging. As it does, we believe the market dynamics are in our favor. And given the investments we have made in infrastructure in the region, we are poised to capitalize on that trend.
We believe the region, and particularly emerging markets in the region, represent a significant opportunity for us over the long term. As the world becomes increasingly globally branded, our watch portfolio continues to be a powerful tool to gain share in the growing global watch market. As an innovative category leader with world-class supply chain and a global distribution network of more than 30,000 doors, we are uniquely positioned to work with the best lifestyle brands around the world.
Our goal as a company to build a world-class entity of excellence, where creativity and entrepreneurs ship are carefully balance with operational discipline to enable us to deliver solid returns for our shareholders in the near and long-term. As a company, we're focused on using all of our resources to drive shareholder value. Growth and efficiency are key components of that, and you can see from our strategies and results that we are focused on those drivers.
We are also committed to leveraging our strong financial position. Last year, we invested $435 million to repurchase 4.1 million shares. We know that this is an important program for our shareholders, and we're fully committed to its. We are now operating with a share base that is more than 25% lower than it was just 3 years ago. 
Before I hand it over to Dennis, we would like to thank all of our associates for their inspired contributions this past year, as well as our partners and investors for their continuing support. As we reflect on the last year, we are pleased with the results but excited about our ability to improve of the company's performance. As we move ahead to 2015, our priorities will be very focused on the most important initiatives to driving growth.
We will invest to ignite our own brands, FOSSIL and SKAGEN, to increase brand awareness, increase demand and accelerate their growth. We will invest in our digital capabilities to improve the customer experience online and increase our omnichannel capabilities. And we will leverage our new partnerships to advance in the wearable technology space with a goal to launch connected accessories later this year.
We are well-positioned as a leader in a growing industry with a strong global footprint and significant competitive advantages. Our diversification gives us access to multiple sources of growth and supports our goal of predictable earnings and cash flows. Our operating model gives us opportunities for leverage and efficiencies to drive greater profitability. And our strong financial position gives us access to the fuel that we need to drive our business and to deliver solid returns for the shareholders.
Now I will ask Dennis talk us through the results and outlook for 2015."

Fourth quarter net sales increased 3% in constant dollars, and on a reported basis, were flat to last year at $1,065,000,000. Sales for the quarter were below our expectation, as increases in our international businesses and a strong performance in our direct business were offset by a decline in our North American wholesale business.
For the quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $3, a 12% increase over last year. Lower-than-expected sales were offset through expense reductions, which drove operating income growth, virtually all of which was consumed by currency headwinds. We benefited from a nonoperating gain, as well as a reduced share base.
The FOSSIL brand grew 3% in constant dollars and was driven by an increase in watches and leathers, partially offset by a decline in jewelry. We continue to be encouraged by the performance of the FOSSIL leather category, particularly the women's handbag business, which delivered strong comp results in our own stores during the quarter. SKAGEN sales grew 19% in constant dollars with strong double-digit growth in watches, an increase in jewelry, and our handbag assortment continues to do well following its third quarter launch.
Our multi-brand watch portfolio grew 2% in constant dollars with strong performances internationally. In North America wholesale, sales decreased 11% to $356 million and decreased 10% in constant dollar. Our U.S. sales performance accounted for the decline, nearly half of which came from lower off-price and liquidation shipment and the other half from lower shipments to major department stores. Shipments to boutique, a much smaller business, also declined. Our multi-brand watch portfolio saw the greatest volume decline for the quarter followed by leather, which continues to be negatively impacted by a highly promotional environment while jewelry grew over 20%.
While we're disappointed that we didn't maintain our third quarter selling momentum in watches, we believe that the change in sales trajectory was more a function of department store inventories than underlying sellout. The data we received from our U.S. department store partners suggest lower inventory levels have quarter end.
Looking back on the full year, as well as for the fourth quarter, we estimate that our watch business in department stores was modestly down with encouraging trends for many of our brands, including FOSSIL and SKAGEN. 
In leathers, while shipments declined in the quarter, the retail performance at women's leathers, the largest part of that business, was down only slightly, having improved steadily each quarter in 2014. We feel very strongly about our new products, and our goal is to see the same success in wholesale that we are already experiencing in our direct business.
Overall for the full year, our North America Wholesale business was essentially flat. In Europe wholesale, sales increased 3% to $281 million and increased 8% in constant dollars. Our European growth was driven by growth in our multi-brand watch portfolio and jewelry. We posted gains in most of our European markets with the strongest performance in the U.K., Germany and distributor markets, while Italy and Spain decline. For the year, European wholesale sales increased 12% in both consonant and reported dollar. Sales from our Asia wholesale operations increased 5% to $115 million and increased 10% in constant dollars. We posted gains in our own brands, as well as our multi-brand watch portfolio. We drove growth across most of our markets with particular strength in India, Japan and Australia. Our Duty Free business was strong, while our Korean business declined.
China continued to be challenging, both in terms of distribution expansion, as well as softening economic trends. And our business in Hong Kong is not as strong due at least in part to some of the political upheaval there resulting in fewer Chinese tourist. Concession sales increased during the quarter, while concession comps overall were down.
We ended the quarter with 334 concessions in the region. For the year, Asia wholesale sales increased 11% on a reported basis and 13% in constant dollars. In our direct business, fourth quarter sales increased 12% to $313 million and increased 16% in constant dollars. Sales growth was driven by store expansion and an 8% comp increase with all 3 regions delivering positive comps and with increases in jewelry, leathers and watches. We are very pleased with our retail business during the quarter particularly in the U.S. where we took advantage of improving holiday traffic.
With a great customer experience, compelling assortment and very targeted and tested promotions, we drove strong conversion and delivered a solid positive comp, the first positive comp in the United States since 2013. Our performance emboldens us to believe that we are on the right track with the FOSSIL brand. Our goal is to build on this momentum both in our stores and online.
During the quarter, we opened a net 12 stores, primarily outlets, bringing our company-owned store count to 593 at quarter-end. For the full year, direct sales increased 13% on a reported basis and 14% in constant dollars. Comps increased 2% for the year with increases in Europe and Asia Pacific, while North America was flat. For the year, we opened a net 50 new stores, primarily international outlets.
The fourth quarter gross profit decreased to $604 million and gross margin declined 60 basis points to 56.8%. The combination of international growth, a favorable channel mix and lower off-price volumes compared to last year all benefited gross margins in the quarter. These tailwinds were more than offset by changes in foreign currency, higher cost, as well as increased promotional levels, primarily allows us where we drove higher retail sales and profits with some compression in rates.
As we talked about on our last call, we feel we have reached an inflection point in our spending, pivoting away from infrastructure investments and focusing investment on initiatives to drive growth. In the quarter, operating expenses declined 2% to $382 million, with a reduction largely attributable through reversing incentive comp approval. Offsetting that decline was a very modest increase in infrastructure spending, small increase in direct retail expenses as well as increases in advertising royalties and demand creation activities. We leverage the expenses by 80 basis points. Operating income increased slightly to $222 million, including an $18 million unfavorable currency impact, and operating margin increased 30 basis points to 20.9%.
Interest expense increased $1 million to $5 million, given our higher debt levels. Other income for the quarter was $7 million, which primarily relates to a $6 million gain associated with the settlement related to our 2012 SKAGEN acquisition. Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter was 30.4%, compared to 30% last year. 
So overall, fourth quarter net income increased 4% to $154 million, as the declining gross profit was offset by lower operating expenses and a nonoperating gain. During the fourth quarter, we invested $117 million to repurchase 1.1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $101, leaving $1.1 billion remaining our share repurchase authorization.
So now turning to our cash flows and balance sheet. For the full year, we generated operating cash flow of $377 million and drew down a net $122 million on our revolver. We used those funds to invest $435 million in share repurchases and $95 million in CapEx. We ended the year with roughly $276 million in cash compared to $320 million last year, and debt of $630 million compared to $508 million a year ago.
We ended the year with inventory of $597 million, a 5% increase over last year. In constant dollars, the growth rate was roughly 11%.
Now receivable decreased by 5% to $431 million. And wholesale DSOs were in line with the prior year. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $22 million for the quarter and $96 million for the full year.
And now moving to our outlook. As Kosta described earlier, 2015 is clearly a pivot year for us with investments shifting from infrastructure to driving growth. We expect roughly 75% of our new OpEx investments will be focused on building brand awareness, engaging more with our customers, enhancing our digital presence, and developing and launching products in the wearable space.
We believe those investments position us well for growth, both in the near and long-term. We operate in a growing industry, and we believe our design, production and distribution capabilities makes us the best partner for global lifestyle brands. We're excited to add Kate Spade to our portfolio, an existing business that will have an immediate impact on our sales. Combination of their brand and our capabilities can be truly explosive on a global space.
We see opportunities in developing new categories, like wearable tech, and growing existing categories such as branded jewelry and leather. These opportunities do not come without challenges. While notable newcomers can help grow the market by bringing new customers into the category, they might also cause a near-term disruption. Managing the national ebbs and flows of brand lifecycles can also put challenging. However, our portfolio of diversified Brands can help navigate in these challenges.
While our European business has been very strong, China with its enormous potential, is taking long-range development. We expect that the factors that have driven our success in North America will play out in Europe and in Asia over time. We believe that the demographic and Asia are certainly in our favor, love the acceleration in growth may be further in the future, we are well-positioned with our infrastructure largely in place.
In North America, our most developed market, posted its own challenges as we work to protect our position and seek new opportunities for growth. Now specific to 2015, there are several factors that are significant and impactful to our financial results and will tend to obscure the underlying trends in our financial trends: Currencies, last year's extra week and the restructuring charge. To better understand our outlook, our 2015 analyses are done on a constant dollar basis and exclude the structure.
We'll also provide an estimate of the sales impact of last year's extra week. Estimating these factors and their impacts are not precise sciences and are provided to help gauge the overall impact of these factors rather than creating implied non-GAAP measure.
2015, we expect the overall 2014 sales trend to continue with a stronger sales growth coming from our international markets. We continue to expect strong performance from watches and jewelry with both Europe and Asia poised to gain share.
Overall, we're planning for continued growth in the multi-brand watch portfolio with opportunities from new and recently launched brands, as well as category expansion. We're very excited about our prospects in our international markets, particularly given the performance in Europe over the past year.
In the Americas, we're not planning on wholesale growth. We do see category opportunities in the region, particularly as we continue to inventory great success in branded jewelries. In our own retail environment, we've been very pleased with our most recent performance. And as we continue to invest in our own brands, our goal is to continue these trends and drive productivity improvement in our stores.
For the full year, we are planning constant dollar sales growth in the range between 3% and 7%. This excludes the impact of the extra week in 2014 estimated at roughly 1.25 points of growth.
For the first quarter, we are planning constant dollar sales growth in the range between 3.5% and 6%, excluding the impact of the extra week. This also include the impact of lower anticipated off-price sales compared to first quarter of 2014. 
Neutralizing for last year's extra week, the timing of price shipments and currencies, we see the first quarter trending at roughly the full year rate. With respect to 2015 growth margin, we expect strong international growth to benefit gross margins, which had helped offset the impact of higher cost.
We believe pricing can be an opportunity for further margin enhancement and continuously evaluate our pricing strategies to ensure our products are positioned appropriately and competitively. We executed on a very targeted price adjustment in the latter part of 2014 and expect that the competitive environment, particularly in light of currency changes, can create additional opportunities for pricing enhancement. Beyond that, our teams continue to work on initiatives to drive supply chain efficiencies.
Overall for 2015, our goal is to achieve constant dollar growth margin expansion. We expect modest constant dollar gross margin expansion in the first quarter and expect that our margin enhancement initiative to the extent we achieve them will yield improvements weighted towards the second half of the year. With respect to operating expenses, we plan to leverage our infrastructure and reinvest back capacities to drive growth.
We feel that the structure we need to support and grow our business for the foreseeable future is largely in place. Our second half 2014 infrastructure spending grew only slightly, and we expect that trend will continue. As a growth company, we will continue to look for opportunities to redeploy resources as our business evolves, and that can create some variations among quarters. 
Overall for 2015, we are planning nearly flat infrastructure spending with modest growth at the beginning of the year tailing off significantly as we anniversary last year's leveling of infrastructure and realize benefits from our efficiency initiative.
For 2015, we will continue to make significant marketing investments to support the expansion of our portfolio brands and would fund incremental investments to ignite FOSSIL and SKAGEN. Continuing to build out our digital capabilities is critical for our strategy, and we are earmarking funding to enhance those capabilities.
And with a solid partnerships already in place with tech giants like Google and Intel, we are poised invest in connected accessories and support a product launch later in the year. 
2015, in addition to our ongoing marketing investments, we plan to invest up to $35 million or $0.50 per share to support of these critical strategic initiatives. We expect the highest relative increase for our marketing investments will come in the first quarter, as we anniversary a very low level of spending last year and in the fourth quarter, as we invest to support our holiday business. We expect roughly 20% of our expense growth will come from investments in our direct businesses, mainly concessions, which require far less capital than store.
We expect store-related expense growth will be highest in the first quarter, tailing off as we anniversary stores added last year. Our strategy in 2015 is to expand our digital presence and open fewer stores, a net 10 new stores focused on international outlet.
Lastly, as I mentioned in my fourth quarter review, we reduced our incentive comp expense in 2014 as we did not achieve all of last year's goal. Our 2015 expectations include an assumption of success against our 2015 goals, which would then result in an expense headwind in Q4. Inclusive of all these investments, we expect our overall expenses to grow in the high single-digits. We expect the highest growth rates to be in the first quarter, which also include the impact of earlier expenses from Baselworld.
We expect the expense growth will be lowest in the middle 2 quarters, increasing again in the fourth, given our marketing investment and expectations around incentive comp. Taking all of these factors into account, we expect full year constant dollar operating margins to be roughly flat to down 80 basis points. As gross margin expansion and infrastructure leverage offset the impact of growth investment. For the first quarter, we expect constant dollar operating margins in the range between 9.5% and 10.5%.
As we mentioned on our last call, currencies will have a material impact on our financial results for 2015. In November, we estimated the impact in our 2014 results that the then prevailing rates would have been in effect for the full 2014 year. That estimate adjusted for the first 3 quarters of 2014, but anticipated no Q4 headwind should the guidance assumes prevailing rate as of November.
Since then, the U.S. dollar has further strengthened against most currencies that affect us, especially the euro, which is the currency that impacts us most. The euro average in the mid $1.30 in the first 3 quarters in 2014 and was roughly $1.25 when we spoke in November. Since then, the euro depreciation have accelerated, particularly since year-end, reaching roughly $1.14 today. 
Now the impact in the first 3 quarters of 2014 has more than doubled and there is a significant currency headwind in the fourth quarter as well, which is the quarter in which we earned roughly 40% of our operating income.
That much larger 2014 headwind will now expand further as we move into 2015, given most of our earnings growth will come from our international businesses and our gross margins will be further impacted by the rapid strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Based on prevailing exchange rate, we estimate that the net impact on our 2015 result, inclusive of hedging program offset, will be roughly $1.20 per share.
We'll continue to look at pricing as a potential offset, so any pricing opportunities we may pursue would have a delayed impact and will primarily be dependent on the market's competitive environment. At prevailing exchange rates, we estimate the negative impact on our 2015 revenue growth will be roughly 500 basis points as the negative impact in both gross and operating margins will be more than 250 basis points. We expect the quarterly top line headwind of roughly 600 basis points until we reached the fourth quarter, when the headwind will be roughly half that amount.
The absolute EPS headwind should build and intensify as we move through the first 3 quarters and then stabilize in the fourth where the relative currency headwinds will be much smaller so the earnings base should be larger. 
With respect to restructuring investment. While the process of optimizing our operating structure is always ongoing, we feel we are in the later stages of near-term infrastructure investments. In 2015, we plan to invest roughly $25 million or $0.35 per share to refine and optimize our structure, creating greater efficiencies and improving our retail profitability. These initiatives primarily emerged from the detailed strategic planning process that we undertook last year. These investments will include the remainder of the store closures that we announced in 2014 that were not completed by last year-end.
We believe these investments all have compelling near-term paybacks, including some benefits later this year, and just as important, will support our efforts to create a best-in-class operating platform capable of responding quickly to our many growth opportunities.
And we expect the vast majority of these charges will be recorded in the first half of this year with about $10 million or $0.14 per share impacting the first quarter. 
On a reported GAAP basis, including all the factors I mentioned, we anticipate full year revenues in the range between a 1% increase and a 3% decrease. For the first quarter, we expect to report revenues that are down between 5.5% and 7.5%. For the full year, we expect reported operating margins between 12% and 13%. For the first quarter, we expect operating margins in the range between 6% and 7%.
We expect full year GAAP EPS in the range between $5.45 and $6.05 per share, which includes the negative impact of the $1.20 currency headwind, the $0.35 negative impact from the restructuring charge and the $0.50 impact from our strategic investments. These amounts assume that currencies remain roughly at the prevailing rates and include net nonoperating gains associated with currencies both contract and account balances. They also assume a higher level of interest expense, given increased debt, continued investment in our share repurchase program and a tax rate of roughly 31%. 
For the first quarter, we expect GAAP EPS in the range between $0.59 and $0.69 per share, which includes a $0.14 restructuring charge and a $0.17 currency headwind. We are planning CapEx of roughly $120 million. We expect that our capital investments will generally shift away from new store openings to investments to build our digital and CRM capabilities, as well as incremental shop-in-shop.

We also know, as we mentioned, is that the sellout comp percent in our wholesale partners in the United States was not -- it was slightly negative down, but not down as much as our wholesale shipments. So having said all of that, there's a lot of moving parts going on. The market is, I think, in United States, still -- we still think it's a very important category for the stores. Extremely profitable. There's a lot of activity going on. We're launching Tory Burch. We're expanding to more doors. Kate Spade is already in there, but we'll be expanding it. We are hopeful to put some wearable technology in the space. This, in 2015, could spark interest and bring more people to the counter. But as far as the watch trend is concerned overall, Euromonitor says that in the United States and globally, the Watch business still grew at 4% last. They're expecting it to grow 6% the next several years. We think we're in position to continue to gain share in a growing market, and we'll keep pursuing that with as much innovation and branding and ideas that we possibly can."

We talked about the $1.20 headwind. Roughly half of that will come from translation. That means, as we're translating our foreign earnings in the U.S. dollar, each line item on the P&L obviously translates into a lower amount. So in the consolidate of that into U.S. dollars, that all combines to represents half the half of that headwind. So that's the part that we don't hedge. Now the other half, the $1.20, relates to the transaction through our foreign sub buy inventory primarily in U.S. dollars. So as the dollar strengthens, their cost of goods goes up, and obviously, their margins are reduced. Now we do hedge that exposure with foreign contracts based on our order estimates. obviously, with the greatest visibility and the very near term, our program runs roughly over 18 months and we dollar cost average into the rate. So the hedging offset is highest in the near quarter up to roughly 2/3 and then tails off over time, averaging just under about half of a full year offset as we head into 2015. So that's helped offset the impact. Although, remember, the offset is recorded below the line in other income. So that net impact is the other half of the $1.20 headwind. Now in addition to forwards, we've already implement price increases, some last year, with more to come very soon, and we're still working on more later in the year. So obviously, their success depends on market condition. So we can get predict the full impact. However, if you combine our contract hedges, along with the price adjustments we are planning combined, they would virtually offset the full P&L impact. Now at the margin rate, but the contraction will P&L impact of the strong U.S. dollar at those rates. So that's the overall currency environment. Then with respect to the Swiss franc, we fairly automatically or naturally hedged with that. And as much is our Swiss franc expense base roughly in the line with our revenue base."

So FOSSIL and SKAGEN, and they continue to grow nicely last year. One thing I would mention specifically about FOSSIL is that we did start accelerating our expense -- our expenditures on marketing, especially on digital and social last year. And we did see a result, both in our own stores, and that's why the DTC number that you mentioned went up. We actually, in the month of fourth quarter, we actually had the best quarter we've had in some time. And we -- our metric show that a lot of that was due to relatively small amount of money we spent on additional advertising last you. And as we mentioned, we're going to accelerate that this year. We also will have that we're investing a lot in omnichannel and CRM capabilities that will enable us to accelerate those marketing investments. So we think we're in a really good place on the FOSSIL brand. Having said that, we do, in our portfolio, our mission is to have the biggest and the best brands in the world, the ones where investment and store growth is growing so we can continue to grow our share of the watch business. So Kate Spade fits really well in that. And we think it's going to have a significant long-term potential. But that's really our mission is to make sure that we have in our portfolio the best brands in the world had the ones where the most vestment will go behind it."

Joining us today is Dennis Secor, our Chief Financial Officer. We will begin today's call with our prepared remarks and then open the call to answer questions.As we look back on 2014, we are pleased to conclude a",1900,"Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining us today is Dennis Secor, our Chief Financial Officer. We will begin today's call with our prepared remarks and then open the call to answer questions.
As we look back on 2014, we are pleased to conclude another year of solid sales and earnings per share growth for the Fossil Group. The strength of our diverse business model, our team's disciplined execution of our strategies and our strong financial position drove overall results within our expectations.
We returned value to our shareholders through the continued execution of our share repurchase program while navigating unfavorable changes in currency at the end of the year. Importantly, we delivered strong results for the year while continuing to invest in the business to fuel future growth. And we drove efficiencies in our operations that position us to deliver solid returns for our shareholders well into the future.
2014 included an 8% top line increase to $3.5 billion, an 8% reduction in our share base as a result of continued execution of our share repurchase program, and we delivered $7.10 in earnings per share, an 8% increase over last year.  Changes in foreign currency aside, our fourth quarter included increased sales, robust growth internationally, very strong gains in jewelry, operating margin expansion, double-digit increase in earnings per share and was highlighted by continuing strength in our FOSSIL and SKAGEN lifestyle brands. That said, we are not entirely satisfied with our fourth quarter performance, particularly as it relates to our North America business.
We began 2015 intensely focused on taking advantage of the many opportunities available to us to drive future growth, including enhancing our multi-brand portfolio to drive growth, investing in strategic initiatives to further grow our own brands and developing new categories that we believe can drive top line growth. We reflect on this past year as one in which we achieved our goal of maximizing the strength of our portfolio of brands through our global distribution platform. We believe our portfolio of highly desirable brands, our continuous innovation, disciplined execution and considerable white-space opportunity by brand category and geography has us well positioned to continue our successful growth for many years in the future.
In 2014, we made solid progress on many key objectives that we will build upon in 2015. We grew our own lifestyle brands, FOSSIL and SKAGEN. Our FOSSIL brand grew at 3% for the year with growth in all regions. We leveraged our position as a leader in lifestyle branded watches and drove solid high single-digit growth in the watch category for the brand. The brand's growth was strongest in Asia with strong high-teen growth in the region.
Outside of watches, the year included the successful reposition of our leathers business. We improved our performance in the category, particularly women's handbags, where we concentrated efforts to add to our design team and bolstered our product to gain broader consumer appeal. Our elevated assortment is resonating with customers, particularly in our retail stores, where we have the best opportunity to clearly communicate the brand story and in improved presentations through shop in shops within U.S. department stores.
We continue to believe FOSSIL jewelry is an opportunity for growth, and having spent this past year repositioning our U.S. distribution, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on synergies that jewelry shares with watches. In fact, the overall jewelry category is benefiting from the influence of lifestyle brands, and our compelling brands and developed distribution infrastructure can facilitate growth in this category.
During the year, we turned our attention to directing investments toward demand creation opportunities that we believe will yield dividends for the brand in the future. We increased investments in our CRM capabilities, and we believe we are taking the right steps to achieve our goal of becoming world class over time. We also invested in brand building and demand creation activities, including marketing initiatives for FOSSIL. These are activities that we believe will broaden our customer base and drive increased interest and market share gains for the brand.
This year, we made solid progress advancing SKAGEN. We achieved a 14% growth with sales accelerating in the back half of the year. The brand saw balanced growth across geographies with watches and jewelry posting solid, double-digit gains. We drove solid growth in jewelry, successfully launched handbags and opened 2 new high-profile store locations in Frankfurt and New York that are performing well. These stores, along with our remodeled stores in London, allow us to showcase the full array of SKAGEN's products in an environment that reflects the differentiated and unique position of the brand.  Additionally, we enhanced our customers' digital experience with the brand with the launch of a redesigned SKAGEN website, which includes improved functionality for the customer and incorporates rich brand content designed to bring greater awareness to the brand.
In our portfolio, we continue to leverage our competitive strengths in branding, design, sourcing and distribution to gain increased market share in the growing watch industry. Our multi-brand watch portfolio grew 9% for the year with the strongest gains internationally. Across brands, we saw strength in long-standing brands as well as newer brands with Michael Kors, Armani, DIESEL and MARC by MARC all driving growth. Our launch of the Tory Burch watch collection was highly successful and highlighted our design in Swiss production capabilities. We introduced a distinctive Swiss watch assortment to a strategically targeted global distribution and expect to build upon the initial success of the line in the spring season.
In addition to Tory Burch, we advanced our Swiss initiative with the spring launch of Emporio Armani Swiss Made. This Swiss opportunity represents one of the important white-space opportunities we see available for lifestyle brand, and given our sourcing and production capabilities, we are well positioned to take advantage of the long-term opportunity with our license brands as well as the continued execution of Fossil Swiss-Made.
We also successfully executed 10-year renewals for 2 of our long-standing licenses, Emporio Armani and Michael Kors, solidifying our position as the natural partner for the best global fashion brands. And today, we announced another exciting development with the addition of Kate Spade. This brand is clearly resonating with consumers globally and is positioned for long-term growth. We are excited to leverage our expertise in design, production and global distribution to grow their watch business and expand their brand around the world.
In another white-space opportunity, we advanced our position in wearable technology with 2 very important partnerships with Google and Intel. We are partnering with the best in technology to leverage their knowledge and expertise and enable our portfolio of lifestyle brands to develop fashionable, connected accessories. Our expertise in design and creativity, coupled with our partners' expertise in technology and innovation, will enable us to introduce wearable technology in a fashionable and scalable way. We are working towards integrating technology into our accessories in a manner that keeps our focus on our core customer. We believe she prioritizes fashion but desires improved functionality.
As we look forward to introducing connected accessories later this year, we are working towards a larger objective of leveraging our strengths and leadership position in fashion watches to become the point where fashion, design and technology converge. We operate a very diverse business model with many levers of growth. We are a globally diverse growth company, and we operate in a growing industry. Our results this year continue to highlight this strength.
We achieved growth across each of our regions this past year. This includes the Americas, a region that is nearly $2 billion today and includes our most mature market, United States, where we already have nearly 50% of the share of the watch market in the under $1,000 price point.
In our international markets, as lifestyle brands take share from traditional watch brands, our goal is to replicate the success that we've experienced in the United States. Europe continues to be strong for us this past year with 13% growth for the year and sales nearing $1.2 billion. This growth was balanced across markets, and we continue to have opportunity across Europe as we increase the number of our brands sold through existing doors as well as expanding into new markets.
In Asia, sales grew 15%, approaching $600 million with balanced growth across markets. Outside the United States and particularly in Asia, where we have a much smaller share of the existing watch market, the trend towards lifestyle brands is emerging. As it does, we believe the market dynamics are in our favor, and given the investments we have made in infrastructure in the region, we are poised to capitalize on that trend. We believe the region and particularly emerging markets in the region represent a significant opportunity for us over the long term.
As the world becomes increasingly globally branded, our watch portfolio continues to be a powerful tool to gain share in the growing global watch market. As an innovative category leader with world-class supply chain and a global distribution network of more than 30,000 doors, we are uniquely positioned to work with the best lifestyle brands around the world.
Our goal as a company to build a world-class entity of excellence, where creativity and entrepreneurship are carefully balance with operational discipline to enable us to deliver solid returns for our shareholders in the near and long term. As a company, we're focused on using all of our resources to drive shareholder value. Growth and efficiency are key components of that, and you can see from our strategies and results that we're focused on those drivers.
We are also committed to leveraging our strong financial position. Last year, we invested $435 million to repurchase 4.1 million shares. We know that this is an important program for our shareholders, and we're fully committed to it. We are now operating with a share base that is more than 25% lower than it was just 3 years ago.
Before I hand it over to Dennis, we would like to thank all of our associates for their inspired contributions this past year as well as our partners and investors for their continuing support. As we reflect on the last year, we are pleased with our results but excited about our ability to improve on the company's performance. As we move ahead to 2015, our priorities will be very focused on the most important initiatives to driving growth.
We will invest to ignite our own brands, FOSSIL and SKAGEN, to increase brand awareness, increase demand and accelerate their growth. We will invest in our digital capabilities to improve the customer experience online and increase our omni-channel capabilities. And we will leverage our new partnerships to advance in the wearable technology space with a goal to launch connected accessories later this year.
We are well positioned as a leader in a growing industry with a strong global footprint and significant competitive advantages. Our diversification gives us access to multiple sources of growth and supports our goal of predictable earnings and cash flows. Our operating model gives us opportunities for leverage and efficiencies to drive greater profitability, and our strong financial position gives us access to the fuel that we need to drive our business and to deliver solid returns for the shareholders.
Now I will ask Dennis to walk us through our results and the outlook for 2015."

Fourth quarter net sales increased 3% in constant dollars and on a reported basis, were flat to last year at $1,065,000,000. Sales for the quarter were below our expectations, as increases in our international businesses and a strong performance in our direct business were offset by a decline in our North American wholesale business.
For the quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $3, a 12% increase over last year. Lower-than-expected sales were offset through expense reductions, which drove operating income growth. Virtually, all of which was consumed by currency headwinds. We benefited from a nonoperating gain as well as a reduced share base.
The FOSSIL brand grew 3% in constant dollars and was driven by an increase in watches and leathers partially offset by a decline in jewelry. We continue to be encouraged by the performance of the FOSSIL leathers category, particularly the women's handbag business, which delivered strong comp results in our own stores during the quarter. SKAGEN sales grew 19% in constant dollars with strong double-digit growth in watches, an increase in jewelry, and our handbag assortment continues to do well following its third quarter launch. Our multi-brand watch portfolio grew 2% in constant dollars with strong performances internationally.
In North America wholesale, sales decreased 11% to $356 million and decreased 10% in constant dollar. Our U.S. sales performance accounted for the decline. Nearly half of which came from lower off-price and liquidation shipments and the other half from lower shipments to major department stores. Shipments to boutique, a much smaller business, also declined. Our multi-brand watch portfolio saw the greatest volume decline for the quarter followed by leather, which continues to be negatively impacted by a highly promotional environment, while jewelry grew over 20%.
While we're disappointed that we didn't maintain our third quarter selling momentum in watches, we believe that the change in sales trajectory was more a function of department store inventory than underlying sellout. The data we received from our U.S. department store partners suggest lower inventory levels at quarter end. Looking back on the full year as well as for the fourth quarter, we estimate that our watch business in department stores was modestly down with encouraging trends from many of our brands, including FOSSIL and SKAGEN.
In leathers, while shipments declined in the quarter, the retail performance at women's leathers, the largest part of that business, was down only slightly, having improved steadily each quarter in 2014. We feel very strongly about our new products, and our goal is to see the same success in wholesale that we are already experiencing in our direct business.
Overall for the full year, our North America wholesale business was essentially flat. In Europe wholesale, sales increased 3% to $281 million and increased 8% in constant dollars. Our European growth was driven by growth in our multi-brand watch portfolio and jewelry. We posted gains in most of our European markets with the strongest performance in the U.K., Germany and distributor markets, while Italy and Spain declined. For the year, European wholesale sales increased 12% in both constant and reported dollar. Sales from our Asia wholesale operations increased 5% to $115 million and increased 10% in constant dollars. We posted gains in our own brands as well as our multi-brand watch portfolio. We drove growth across most of our markets with particular strength in India, Japan and Australia. Our Duty Free business was strong, while our Korean business declined. China continues to be challenging both in terms of distribution expansion as well as softening economic trends, and our business in Hong Kong has not been strong due at least in part to some of the political upheaval there, resulting in fewer Chinese tourists.
Concession sales increased during the quarter, while concession comps overall were down. We ended the quarter with 334 concessions in the region.
For the year, Asia wholesale sales increased 11% on a reported basis and 13% in constant dollars. In our direct business, fourth quarter sales increased 12% to $313 million and increased 16% in constant dollars. Sales growth was driven by store expansion and an 8% comp increase with all 3 regions delivering positive comps and with increases in jewelry, leathers and watches. We are very pleased with our retail business during the quarter, particularly in the U.S., where we took advantage of improving holiday traffic.
With a great customer experience, compelling assortment and very targeted and tested promotions, we drove strong conversion and delivered a solid positive comp, the first positive comp in the United States since 2013. Our performance emboldens us to believe that we are on the right track with the FOSSIL brand. Our goal is to build on this momentum both in our stores and online.
During the quarter, we opened a net 12 stores, primarily outlets, bringing our company-owned store count to 593 at quarter end. For the full year, direct sales increased 13% on a reported basis and 14% in constant dollars. Comps increased 2% for the year with increases in Europe and Asia Pacific, while North America was flat. For the year, we opened a net 50 new stores, primarily international outlets.
The fourth quarter gross profit decreased $604 million, and gross margin declined 60 basis points to 56.8%. The combination of international growth, a favorable channel mix and lower off-price volumes compared to last year all benefited gross margins in the quarter. These tailwinds were more than offset by changes in foreign currency, higher cost as well as increased promotion levels, primarily in outlets, where we drove higher retail sales and profits with some compression in the rate.
As we talked about on our last call, we feel we have reached an inflection point in our spending, pivoting away from infrastructure investments and focusing investments on initiatives to drive growth. In the quarter, operating expenses declined 2% to $382 million with the reduction largely attributable to reversing incentive comp accrual. Offsetting that decline was a very modest increase in infrastructure spending, a small increase in direct retail expenses as well as increases in advertising royalties and demand creation activities. We leveraged expenses by 80 basis points. Operating income increased slightly to $222 million, including an $18 million unfavorable currency impact, and operating margin increased 30 basis points to 20.9%.
Interest expense increased $1 million to $5 million given our higher debt level. Other income for the quarter was $7 million, which primarily relates to a $6 million gain associated with the settlement related to our 2012 SKAGEN acquisition. Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter was 30.4% compared to 30% last year.
So overall, fourth quarter net income increased 4% to $154 million, as the decline in gross profit was offset by lower operating expenses and a nonoperating gain. During the fourth quarter, we invested $117 million to repurchase 1.1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $101, leaving $1.1 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization.
And now turning to our cash flows and balance sheet. For the full year, we generated operating cash flow of $377 million and drew down a net $122 million on our revolver. We used those funds to invest $435 million in share repurchases and $95 million in CapEx. We ended the year with roughly $276 million in cash compared to $320 million last year and debt of $630 million compared to $508 million a year ago.
We ended the year with inventory of $597 million, a 5% increase over last year. In constant dollars, the growth rate was roughly 11%.
Accounts receivable decreased by 5% to $431 million, and wholesale DSOs were in line with the prior year. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $22 million for the quarter and $96 million for the full year.
And now moving to our outlook. As Kosta described earlier, 2015 is clearly a pivot year for us with investments shifting from infrastructure to driving growth. We expect roughly 75% of our new OpEx investments will be focused on building brand awareness, engaging more with our customers, enhancing our digital presence and developing and launching products in the wearable space.
We believe those investments position us well for growth both in the near and long term. We operate in a growing industry, and we believe our design, production and distribution capabilities make us the best partner for global lifestyle brands. We're excited to add Kate Spade to our portfolio, an existing business that will have an immediate impact on our sales. Combination of their brand and our capabilities can be truly explosive on a global scale.
We see opportunities in developing new categories, like wearable tech and growing existing categories such as branded jewelry and leather. These opportunities do not come without challenges. While notable newcomers can help grow the market by bringing new customers into the category, they might also cause a near-term disruption. Managing the natural ebbs and flows of brand life cycles can also prove challenging. However, our portfolio of diversified brands can help navigate these challenges.
While our European business has been very strong, China, with its enormous potential, was taking longer to development. We expect that the factors that have driven our success in North America will play out in Europe and in Asia over time. We believe that the demographics in Asia are certainly in our favor, and while the acceleration in growth may be further in the future, we are well positioned with our infrastructure largely in place.
North America, our most developed market, poses its own challenges as we work to protect our position and seek new opportunities for growth. Now specific to 2015, there are several factors that are significant and impactful to our financial results and will tend to obscure the underlying trends in our financial play: currencies, last year's extra week and a restructuring charge. To better understand our outlook, our 2015 analyses are done on a constant dollar basis and exclude restructure.  We'll also provide an estimate of the sales impact of last year's extra week. Estimating these factors and their impacts are not precise sciences and are provided to help gauge the overall impact of these factors rather than create implied non-GAAP measures.
2015, we expect the overall 2014 sales trend to continue with the strongest sales growth coming from our international markets. We continue to expect strong performance from watches and jewelry with both Europe and Asia poised to gain share. Overall, we're planning for continued growth in the multi-brand watch portfolio with opportunities from new and recently launched brands as well as category expansion. We're very excited about our prospects in our international markets, particularly given the performance in Europe over the past year.
In the Americas, we are not planning on wholesale growth. We do see category opportunities in the region, particularly as we continue to enjoy great success in branded jewelry. In our own retail environment, we've been very pleased with our most recent performance, and as we continue to invest in our own brands, our goal is to continue these trends and drive productivity improvement in our stores.
For the full year, we are planning constant dollar sales growth in the range between 3% and 7%. This excludes the impact of the extra week in 2014 estimated at roughly 1.25 points of growth.
For the first quarter, we're planning constant dollar sales growth in the range between 3.5% and 6%, excluding the impact of the extra week. This also includes the impact of lower anticipated off-price sales compared to first quarter of 2014.  Neutralizing for last year's extra week, the timing off-price shipments and currencies, we see the first quarter trending at roughly the full year rate.
With respect to 2015 gross margin, we expect strong international growth to benefit gross margins, which has helped offset the impact of higher cost. We believe pricing can be an opportunity for further margin enhancement and continuously evaluate our pricing strategies to ensure that our products are positioned appropriately and competitively. We executed on a very targeted price adjustment in the latter part of 2014 and expect that the competitive environment, particularly in light of currency changes, can create additional opportunities for pricing enhancement. Beyond that, our teams continue to work on initiatives to drive supply chain efficiencies.
Overall for 2015, our goal is to achieve constant dollar gross margin expansion. We expect modest constant dollar gross margin expansion in the first quarter and expect that our margin enhancement initiatives to the extent we achieve them would yield improvements weighted towards the second half of the year.
With respect to operating expenses, we plan to leverage our infrastructure and reinvest back capacities to drive growth. We feel that the structure we need to support and grow our business for the foreseeable future is largely in place. Our second half 2014 infrastructure spending grew only slightly, and we expect that trend will continue. As a growth company, we will continue to look for opportunities to redeploy resources as our business evolves, and that can create some variations among quarters. Overall for 2015, we are planning nearly flat infrastructure spending with modest growth at the beginning of the year, tailing off significantly as we anniversary last year's leveling of infrastructure and realize benefits from our efficiency initiatives.
For 2015, we will continue to make significant marketing investments to support the expansion of our portfolio of brands, while we fund incremental investments to ignite FOSSIL and SKAGEN. Continuing to build out our digital capabilities is critical for our strategy, and we are earmarking funding to enhance those capabilities. And with solid partnerships already in place with tech giants like Google and Intel, we are poised invest in connected accessories and support a product launch later in the year.
2015, in addition to our ongoing marketing investments, we plan to invest up to $35 million or $0.50 per share to support these critical strategic initiatives. We expect the highest relative increase for our marketing investments will come in the first quarter, as we anniversary a very low level of spending last year and in the fourth quarter, as we invest to support our holiday business. We expect roughly 20% of our expense growth will come from investments in our direct businesses, mainly concessions, which require far less capital than store. We expect store-related expense growth will be highest in the first quarter, tailing off as we anniversary stores added last year. Our strategy in 2015 is to expand our digital presence and open fewer stores, a net 10 new stores focused on international outlets.
Lastly, as I mentioned in my fourth quarter review, we reduced our incentive comp expense in 2014 as we did not achieve all of last year's goal. Our 2015 expectations include an assumption of success against our 2015 goals, which would then result in an expense headwind in Q4. Inclusive of all these investments, we expect our overall expenses to grow in the high single digits. We expect the highest growth rates to be in the first quarter, which also include the impact of earlier expenses from Baselworld.
We expect the expense growth will be lowest in the middle 2 quarters, increasing again in the fourth given our marketing investments and expectations around incentive comp. Taking all of these factors into account, we expect full year constant dollar operating margins to be roughly flat to down 80 basis points, as gross margin expansion and infrastructure leverage offset the impact of growth investment. For the first quarter, we expect constant dollar operating margins in the range between 9.5% and 10.5%.
As we mentioned on our last call, currencies will have a material impact on our financial results for 2015. In November, we estimated the impact on our 2014 results if the then prevailing rates would have been in effect for the full 2014 year. That estimate adjusted for the first 3 quarters of 2014 but anticipated no Q4 headwind since the guidance assumes prevailing rate as of November.
Since then, the U.S. dollar has further strengthened against most currencies that affect us, especially the euro, which is the currency that impacts us most. The euro averaged in the mid $1.30 in the first 3 quarters of 2014 and was roughly $1.25 when we spoke in November. Since then, the euro depreciation has accelerated, particularly since year end, reaching roughly $1.14 today.
Now the impact on the first 3 quarters of 2014 has more than doubled, and there is a significant currency headwind in the fourth quarter as well, which is the quarter in which we earned roughly 40% of our operating income. That much larger 2014 headwind will now expand further as we move into 2015 given most of our earnings growth will come from our international businesses, and our gross margins will be further impacted by the rapid strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Based on prevailing exchange rate, we estimate that the net impact on our 2015 result, inclusive of hedging program offset, will be roughly $1.20 per share.
We'll continue to look at pricing as a potential offset, so any pricing opportunities we may pursue would have a delayed impact and will primarily be dependent on the market's competitive environment. At prevailing exchange rates, we estimate the negative impact on our 2015 revenue growth will be roughly 500 basis points, and the negative impact on both gross and operating margins will be more than 250 basis points. We expect a quarterly top line headwind of roughly 600 basis points until we reach the fourth quarter when the headwind will be roughly half that amount. The absolute EPS headwind should build and intensify as we move through the first 3 quarters and then stabilize in the fourth where the relative currency headwind will be much smaller, so the earnings base should be larger.
With respect to restructuring investments, while the process of optimizing our operating structure is always ongoing, we feel we are in the later stages of near-term infrastructure investments. In 2015, we plan to invest roughly $25 million or $0.35 per share to refine and optimize our structure, creating greater efficiencies and improving our retail profitability. These initiatives primarily emerged from the detailed strategic planning process that we undertook last year. These investments will include the remainder of the store closures that we announced in 2014 that were not completed by last year end.
We believe these investments all have compelling near-term paybacks, including some benefits later this year and just as importantly, will support our efforts to create a best-in-class operating platform capable of responding quickly to our many growth opportunities. We expect the vast majority of these charges will be recorded in the first half of this year with about $10 million or $0.14 per share impacting the first quarter.
On a reported GAAP basis, including all the factors I mentioned, we anticipate full year revenues in the range between a 1% increase and a 3% decrease. For the first quarter, we expect to report revenues that are down between 5.5% and 7.5%. For the full year, we expect reported operating margins between 12% and 13%. For the first quarter, we expect operating margins in the range between 6% and 7%.
We expect full year GAAP EPS in the range between $5.45 and $6.05 per share, which includes the negative impact of the $1.20 currency headwind, the $0.35 negative impact from the restructuring charge and the $0.50 impact from our strategic investments. These amounts assume that currencies remain roughly at the prevailing rates and include net nonoperating gains associated with currencies both contract and account balances. They also assume a higher level of interest expense given increased debt, continued investment in our share repurchase program and a tax rate of roughly 31%.
For the first quarter, we expect GAAP EPS in the range between $0.59 and $0.69 per share, which includes the $0.14 restructuring charge and a $0.17 currency headwind. We are planning CapEx of roughly $120 million. We expect that our capital investments will generally shift away from new store openings to investments to build our digital and CRM capabilities as well as incremental shop in shop.

We also know, as we mentioned, is that the sell-out comp percent in our wholesale partners in the United States was not -- it was slightly negative down but not down as much as our wholesale shipments. So having said all that, there's a lot of moving parts going on. The market is, I think, in United States, still -- we still think it's a very important category for the stores. It's very extremely profitable. There's a lot of activity going on. We're launching Tory Burch. We're expanding to more doors. Kate Spade is already in there, but we'll be expanding it. We are hopeful to put some wearable technology in the space. This -- in 2015, it could spark interest and bring more people to the counter. But as far as the watch trend is concerned overall, Euromonitor says that in the United States and globally, the watch business still grew at 4% last year.

We talked about the $1.20 headwind. Roughly half of that will come from translation. That means, as we're translating our foreign earnings into U.S. dollar",349,"So yes, let me just step back and kind of give you a view of the overall currency environment here. We talked about the $1.20 headwind. Roughly half of that will come from translation. That means, as we're translating our foreign earnings into U.S. dollars, each line item on the P&L obviously translates into a lower amount. So when we consolidate all of that into U.S. dollars, that all combines to represents roughly half of that headwind. So that's the part that we don't hedge. Now the other half, the $1.20, relates to the transactions in our foreign subs by inventory primarily in U.S. dollars. So as the dollar strengthens, their cost of goods goes up, and obviously, their margins are reduced. Now we do hedge that exposure with foreign contracts based on our order estimates. Obviously, with the greatest visibility in the very near term, our program runs roughly over 18 months, and we dollar cost average into the rate. So the hedging offset is highest in the near quarter up to roughly 2/3 and then tails off over time, averaging just under about 1/2 of a full year offset as we head into 2015. So that's helped offset the impact. Although, remember, the offset is recorded below the line in other income, so that net impact is the other half of the $1.20 headwind. Now in addition to forward, we've already implemented price increases, some last year with more to come very soon, and we're still working on more later in the year. So obviously, their success will depend on market conditions, so we can't yet predict the full impact. However, if you combine our contract hedges along with the price adjustments we're planning, combined, they would virtually offset the full P&L impact, not the margin rate but the transactional P&L impact of the strong U.S. dollar at those rates. So that's the overall currency environment. Then with respect to the Swiss franc, we're fairly automatically or naturally hedged with that in as much as our Swiss franc expense base roughly in line with our revenue base."

FOSSIL's been on a great trend recently, positive comps coming into the year, improving wholesale trends with wholesale partners. SKAGEN grew double digits, accelerated towards the back half of the year. Branded jewelry, leathers have been trending well for us, new brands. So there's a lot tailwinds in there.

So we're looking at both display items like smart watches but also non-display items, like jewelry and potentially bracelets, et cetera. And we think eventually, it'll probably impact all brands. One way to look at this is if we have a business in wearable technology that involves fashion with some technology, whether it's sensors or communication, theoretically, potentially someday, every watch we make could have some type of technology on it. So I expect, at some point, all our watches will have enhanced technology, whether it's sensors, communication. It could be apps in the community involved as well, and that's really the approach we're taking. So as I said, we'll be shipping something later this year.

We sell at 30,000 points of sale globally. We have a number of brands and access to more, and we have a big share, at least, mind share in the marketplace. And we think we have the capability of bringing convergence of fashion and technology together, so we can make great-looking products that have an emotional attachment to customer that love brands but also have a little extra functionality. And if you look at, from our perspective, the huge amount of spending going on in technology products, so phone, cellphones, iPads, cell services, et cetera, if you look at the huge amount of spending going on in that category -- and the watch business is relatively small -- it's just a small percentage of that spending drops down in the watch business. It could have a dramatic impact on the growth of the category and make it more relevant, and we think we're sitting right in the middle of something that could be much larger. So there's a lot of moving parts. We are very excited to be investing with our partners, both Intel and Google and others, on coming up with new ideas to engage customers, have communication vehicles and really enable customers to make their watch and their wearable technology more relevant to their lives. I think it's -- it puts the -- it makes the watch category much more relevant, especially when you consider the millennials largely had grown up without watches. They have cellphone when they grew up, and they don't necessarily have more watch. But now with the branding and technology coming into play, we think we've got a big opportunity."

We actually -- in the month of fourth quarter, we actually had the best quarter we've had in some time. And we -- our metrics show that a lot of that was due to the relatively small amount of money we spent on additional advertising last year, and as we mentioned, we're going to accelerate that this year. We also will have -- we're investing a lot in omni-channel and CRM capabilities that will enable us to accelerate those marketing investments.

Joining us today is Dennis Secor, our Chief Financial Officer. We will begin today's call with our prepared remarks and then open the call to answer questions.
As we look back on 2014, we are pleased to conclude another year of solid sales and earnings per share growth for the Fossil Group. The strength of our diverse business model, our team's disciplined execution of our strategies and our strong financial position drove overall results within our expectations.
We returned value to our shareholders through the continued execution of our share repurchase program while navigating unfavorable changes in currency at the end of the year. Importantly, we delivered strong results for the year while continuing to invest in the business to fuel future growth. And we drove efficiencies in our operations that position us to deliver solid returns for our shareholders well into the future.
2014 included an 8% top line increase to $3.5 billion, an 8% reduction in our share base as a result of continued execution of our share repurchase program, and we delivered $7.10 in earnings per share, an 8% increase over last year.  Changes in foreign currency aside, our fourth quarter included increased sales, robust growth internationally, very strong gains in jewelry, operating margin expansion, double-digit increase in earnings per share and was highlighted by continuing strength in our FOSSIL and SKAGEN lifestyle brands. That said, we are not entirely satisfied with our fourth quarter performance, particularly as it relates to our North America business.
We began 2015 intensely focused on taking advantage of the many opportunities available to us to drive future growth, including enhancing our multi-brand portfolio to drive growth, investing in strategic initiatives to further grow our own brands and developing new categories that we believe can drive top line growth. We reflect on this past year as one in which we achieved our goal of maximizing the strength of our portfolio of brands through our global distribution platform. We believe our portfolio of highly desirable brands, our continuous innovation, disciplined execution and considerable white-space opportunity by brand category and geography has us well positioned to continue our successful growth for many years in the future.
In 2014, we made solid progress on many key objectives that we will build upon in 2015. We grew our own lifestyle brands, FOSSIL and SKAGEN. Our FOSSIL brand grew at 3% for the year with growth in all regions. We leveraged our position as a leader in lifestyle branded watches and drove solid high single-digit growth in the watch category for the brand. The brand's growth was strongest in Asia with strong high-teen growth in the region.
Outside of watches, the year included the successful reposition of our leathers business. We improved our performance in the category, particularly women's handbags, where we concentrated efforts to add to our design team and bolstered our product to gain broader consumer appeal. Our elevated assortment is resonating with customers, particularly in our retail stores, where we have the best opportunity to clearly communicate the brand story and in improved presentations through shop in shops within U.S. department stores.
We continue to believe FOSSIL jewelry is an opportunity for growth, and having spent this past year repositioning our U.S. distribution, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on synergies that jewelry shares with watches. In fact, the overall jewelry category is benefiting from the influence of lifestyle brands, and our compelling brands and developed distribution infrastructure can facilitate growth in this category.
During the year, we turned our attention to directing investments toward demand creation opportunities that we believe will yield dividends for the brand in the future. We increased investments in our CRM capabilities, and we believe we are taking the right steps to achieve our goal of becoming world class over time. We also invested in brand building and demand creation activities, including marketing initiatives for FOSSIL. These are activities that we believe will broaden our customer base and drive increased interest and market share gains for the brand.
This year, we made solid progress advancing SKAGEN. We achieved a 14% growth with sales accelerating in the back half of the year. The brand saw balanced growth across geographies with watches and jewelry posting solid, double-digit gains. We drove solid growth in jewelry, successfully launched handbags and opened 2 new high-profile store locations in Frankfurt and New York that are performing well. These stores, along with our remodeled stores in London, allow us to showcase the full array of SKAGEN's products in an environment that reflects the differentiated and unique position of the brand.  Additionally, we enhanced our customers' digital experience with the brand with the launch of a redesigned SKAGEN website, which includes improved functionality for the customer and incorporates rich brand content designed to bring greater awareness to the brand.
In our portfolio, we continue to leverage our competitive strengths in branding, design, sourcing and distribution to gain increased market share in the growing watch industry. Our multi-brand watch portfolio grew 9% for the year with the strongest gains internationally. Across brands, we saw strength in long-standing brands as well as newer brands with Michael Kors, Armani, DIESEL and MARC by MARC all driving growth. Our launch of the Tory Burch watch collection was highly successful and highlighted our design and Swiss production capabilities. We introduced a distinctive Swiss watch assortment to a strategically targeted global distribution and expect to build upon the initial success of the line in the spring season.
In addition to Tory Burch, we advanced our Swiss initiative with the spring launch of Emporio Armani Swiss Made. This Swiss opportunity represents one of the important white-space opportunities we see available for lifestyle brands, and given our sourcing and production capabilities, we are well positioned to take advantage of the long-term opportunity with our license brands as well as the continued execution of Fossil Swiss-Made.
We also successfully executed 10-year renewals for 2 of our long-standing licenses, Emporio Armani and Michael Kors, solidifying our position as the natural partner for the best global fashion brands. And today, we announced another exciting development with the addition of Kate Spade. This brand is clearly resonating with consumers globally and is positioned for long-term growth. We are excited to leverage our expertise in design, production and global distribution to grow their watch business and expand their brand around the world.
In another white-space opportunity, we advanced our position in wearable technology with 2 very important partnerships with Google and Intel. We are partnering with the best in technology to leverage their knowledge and expertise and enable our portfolio of lifestyle brands to develop fashionable, connected accessories. Our expertise in design and creativity, coupled with our partners' expertise in technology and innovation, will enable us to introduce wearable technology in a fashionable and scalable way. We are working towards integrating technology into our accessories in a manner that keeps our focus on our core customer. We believe she prioritizes fashion but desires improved functionality.
As we look forward to introducing connected accessories later this year, we are working towards a larger objective of leveraging our strength and leadership position in fashion watches to become the point where fashion, design and technology converge. We operate a very diverse business model with many levers of growth. We are a globally diverse growth company, and we operate in a growing industry. Our results this year continue to highlight this strength.
We achieved growth across each of our regions this past year. This includes the Americas, a region that is nearly $2 billion today and includes our most mature market, the United States, where we already have nearly 50% of the share of the watch market in the under $1,000 price point.
In our international markets, as lifestyle brands take share from traditional watch brands, our goal is to replicate the success that we've experienced in the United States. Europe continues to be strong for us this past year with 13% growth for the year and sales nearing $1.2 billion. This growth was balanced across markets, and we continue to have opportunity across Europe as we increase the number of our brands sold through existing doors as well as expanding into new markets.
In Asia, sales grew 15%, approaching $600 million with balanced growth across markets. Outside the United States and particularly in Asia, where we have a much smaller share of the existing watch market, the trend towards lifestyle brands is emerging. As it does, we believe the market dynamics are in our favor, and given the investments we have made in infrastructure in the region, we are poised to capitalize on that trend. We believe the region and particularly emerging markets in the region represent a significant opportunity for us over the long term.
As the world becomes increasingly globally branded, our watch portfolio continues to be a powerful tool to gain share in the growing global watch market. As an innovative category leader with world-class supply chain and a global distribution network of more than 30,000 doors, we are uniquely positioned to work with the best lifestyle brands around the world.
Our goal as a company to build a world-class entity of excellence, where creativity and entrepreneurship are carefully balanced with operational discipline to enable us to deliver solid returns for our shareholders in the near and long term. As a company, we're focused on using all of our resources to drive shareholder value. Growth and efficiency are key components of that, and you can see from our strategies and results that we're focused on those drivers.
We are also committed to leveraging our strong financial position. Last year, we invested $435 million to repurchase 4.1 million shares. We know that this is an important program for our shareholders, and we're fully committed to it. We are now operating with a share base that is more than 25% lower than it was just 3 years ago.
Before I hand it over to Dennis, we would like to thank all of our associates for their inspired contributions this past year as well as our partners and investors for their continuing support. As we reflect on the last year, we are pleased with our results but excited about our ability to improve on the company's performance. As we move ahead to 2015, our priorities will be very focused on the most important initiatives to driving growth.
We will invest to ignite our own brands, FOSSIL and SKAGEN, to increase brand awareness, increase demand and accelerate their growth. We will invest in our digital capabilities to improve the customer experience online and increase our omni-channel capabilities. And we will leverage our new partnerships to advance in the wearable technology space with a goal to launch connected accessories later this year.
We are well positioned as a leader in a growing industry with a strong global footprint and significant competitive advantages. Our diversification gives us access to multiple sources of growth and supports our goal of predictable earnings and cash flows. Our operating model gives us opportunities for leverage and efficiencies to drive greater profitability, and our strong financial position gives us access to the fuel that we need to drive our business and to deliver solid returns for the shareholders.
Now I will ask Dennis to walk us through our results and the outlook for 2015."

Fourth quarter net sales increased 3% in constant dollars and on a reported basis, were flat to last year at $1,065,000,000. Sales for the quarter were below our expectations, as increases in our international businesses and a strong performance in our direct business were offset by a decline in our North American wholesale business.
For the quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $3, a 12% increase over last year. Lower-than-expected sales were offset through expense reductions, which drove operating income growth. Virtually, all of which was consumed by currency headwinds. We benefited from a nonoperating gain as well as a reduced share base.
The FOSSIL brand grew 3% in constant dollars and was driven by an increase in watches and leathers partially offset by a decline in jewelry. We continue to be encouraged by the performance of the FOSSIL leathers category, particularly the women's handbag business, which delivered strong comp results in our own stores during the quarter. SKAGEN sales grew 19% in constant dollars with strong double-digit growth in watches, an increase in jewelry, and our handbag assortment continues to do well following its third quarter launch. Our multi-brand watch portfolio grew 2% in constant dollars with strong performances internationally.
In North America wholesale, sales decreased 11% to $356 million and decreased 10% in constant dollar. Our U.S. sales performance accounted for the decline. Nearly half of which came from lower off-price and liquidation shipments and the other half from lower shipments to major department stores. Shipments to boutique, a much smaller business, also declined. Our multi-brand watch portfolio saw the greatest volume decline for the quarter followed by leather, which continues to be negatively impacted by a highly promotional environment, while jewelry grew over 20%.
While we're disappointed that we didn't maintain our third quarter selling momentum in watches, we believe that the change in sales trajectory was more a function of department store inventory than underlying sellout. The data we received from our U.S. department store partners suggest lower inventory levels at quarter end. Looking back on the full year as well as for the fourth quarter, we estimate that our watch business in department stores was modestly down with encouraging trends from many of our brands, including FOSSIL and SKAGEN.
In leathers, while shipments declined in the quarter, the retail performance at women's leathers, the largest part of that business, was down only slightly, having improved steadily each quarter in 2014. We feel very strongly about our new products, and our goal is to see the same success in wholesale that we are already experiencing in our direct business.
Overall for the full year, our North America wholesale business was essentially flat. In Europe wholesale, sales increased 3% to $281 million and increased 8% in constant dollars. Our European growth was driven by growth in our multi-brand watch portfolio and jewelry. We posted gains in most of our European markets with the strongest performance in the U.K., Germany and distributor markets, while Italy and Spain declined. For the year, European wholesale sales increased 12% in both constant and reported dollar. Sales from our Asia wholesale operations increased 5% to $115 million and increased 10% in constant dollars. We posted gains in our own brands as well as our multi-brand watch portfolio. We drove growth across most of our markets with particular strength in India, Japan and Australia. Our Duty Free business was strong, while our Korean business declined. China continues to be challenging both in terms of distribution expansion as well as softening economic trends, and our business in Hong Kong has not been strong due at least in part to some of the political upheaval there, resulting in fewer Chinese tourists.
Concession sales increased during the quarter, while concession comps overall were down. We ended the quarter with 334 concessions in the region.
For the year, Asia wholesale sales increased 11% on a reported basis and 13% in constant dollars. In our direct business, fourth quarter sales increased 12% to $313 million and increased 16% in constant dollars. Sales growth was driven by store expansion and an 8% comp increase with all 3 regions delivering positive comps and with increases in jewelry, leathers and watches. We are very pleased with our retail business during the quarter, particularly in the U.S., where we took advantage of improving holiday traffic.
With a great customer experience, compelling assortment and very targeted and tested promotions, we drove strong conversion and delivered a solid positive comp, the first positive comp in the United States since 2013. Our performance emboldens us to believe that we are on the right track with the FOSSIL brand. Our goal is to build on this momentum both in our stores and online.
During the quarter, we opened a net 12 stores, primarily outlets, bringing our company-owned store count to 593 at quarter end. For the full year, direct sales increased 13% on a reported basis and 14% in constant dollars. Comps increased 2% for the year with increases in Europe and Asia Pacific, while North America was flat. For the year, we opened a net 50 new stores, primarily international outlets.
The fourth quarter gross profit decreased $604 million, and gross margin declined 60 basis points to 56.8%. The combination of international growth, a favorable channel mix and lower off-price volumes compared to last year all benefited gross margins in the quarter. These tailwinds were more than offset by changes in foreign currency, higher cost as well as increased promotion levels, primarily in outlets, where we drove higher retail sales and profits with some compression in the rate.
As we talked about on our last call, we feel we have reached an inflection point in our spending, pivoting away from infrastructure investments and focusing investments on initiatives to drive growth. In the quarter, operating expenses declined 2% to $382 million with the reduction largely attributable to reversing incentive comp accrual. Offsetting that decline was a very modest increase in infrastructure spending, a small increase in direct retail expenses as well as increases in advertising royalties and demand creation activities. We leveraged expenses by 80 basis points. Operating income increased slightly to $222 million, including an $18 million unfavorable currency impact, and operating margin increased 30 basis points to 20.9%.
Interest expense increased $1 million to $5 million given our higher debt level. Other income for the quarter was $7 million, which primarily relates to a $6 million gain associated with the settlement related to our 2012 SKAGEN acquisition. Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter was 30.4% compared to 30% last year.
So overall, fourth quarter net income increased 4% to $154 million, as the decline in gross profit was offset by lower operating expenses and a nonoperating gain. During the fourth quarter, we invested $117 million to repurchase 1.1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $101, leaving $1.1 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization.
And now turning to our cash flows and balance sheet. For the full year, we generated operating cash flow of $377 million and drew down a net $122 million on our revolver. We used those funds to invest $435 million in share repurchases and $95 million in CapEx. We ended the year with roughly $276 million in cash compared to $320 million last year and debt of $630 million compared to $508 million a year ago.
We ended the year with inventory of $597 million, a 5% increase over last year. In constant dollars, the growth rate was roughly 11%.
Accounts receivable decreased by 5% to $431 million, and wholesale DSOs were in line with the prior year. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $22 million for the quarter and $96 million for the full year.
And now moving to our outlook. As Kosta described earlier, 2015 is clearly a pivot year for us with investments shifting from infrastructure to driving growth. We expect roughly 75% of our new OpEx investments will be focused on building brand awareness, engaging more with our customers, enhancing our digital presence and developing and launching products in the wearable space.
We believe those investments position us well for growth both in the near and long term. We operate in a growing industry, and we believe our design, production and distribution capabilities make us the best partner for global lifestyle brands. We're excited to add Kate Spade to our portfolio, an existing business that will have an immediate impact on our sales. Combination of their brand and our capabilities can be truly explosive on a global scale.
We see opportunities in developing new categories, like wearable tech and growing existing categories such as branded jewelry and leather. These opportunities do not come without challenges. While notable newcomers can help grow the market by bringing new customers into the category, they might also cause a near-term disruption. Managing the natural ebbs and flows of brand life cycles can also prove challenging. However, our portfolio of diversified brands can help navigate these challenges.
While our European business has been very strong, China, with its enormous potential, is taking longer to development. We expect that the factors that have driven our success in North America will play out in Europe and in Asia over time. We believe that the demographics in Asia are certainly in our favor, and while the acceleration in growth may be further in the future, we are well positioned with our infrastructure largely in place.
North America, our most developed market, poses its own challenges as we work to protect our position and seek new opportunities for growth. Now specific to 2015, there are several factors that are significant and impactful to our financial results and will tend to obscure the underlying trends in our financial plan: currencies, last year's extra week and a restructuring charge. To better understand our outlook, our 2015 analyses are done on a constant dollar basis and exclude restructure.  We'll also provide an estimate of the sales impact of last year's extra week. Estimating these factors and their impacts are not precise sciences and are provided to help gauge the overall impact of these factors rather than create implied non-GAAP measures.
2015, we expect the overall 2014 sales trend to continue with the strongest sales growth coming from our international markets. We continue to expect strong performance from watches and jewelry with both Europe and Asia poised to gain share. Overall, we're planning for continued growth in the multi-brand watch portfolio with opportunities from new and recently launched brands as well as category expansion. We're very excited about our prospects in our international markets, particularly given the performance in Europe over the past year.
In the Americas, we are not planning on wholesale growth. We do see category opportunities in the region, particularly as we continue to enjoy great success in branded jewelry. In our own retail environment, we've been very pleased with our most recent performance, and as we continue to invest in our own brands, our goal is to continue these trends and drive productivity improvement in our stores.
For the full year, we are planning constant dollar sales growth in the range between 3% and 7%. This excludes the impact of the extra week in 2014 estimated at roughly 1.25 points of growth.
For the first quarter, we're planning constant dollar sales growth in the range between 3.5% and 6%, excluding the impact of the extra week. This also includes the impact of lower anticipated off-price sales compared to first quarter of 2014.  Neutralizing for last year's extra week, the timing off-price shipments and currencies, we see the first quarter trending at roughly the full year rate.
With respect to 2015 gross margin, we expect strong international growth to benefit gross margins, which has helped offset the impact of higher cost. We believe pricing can be an opportunity for further margin enhancement and continuously evaluate our pricing strategies to ensure that our products are positioned appropriately and competitively. We executed on a very targeted price adjustment in the latter part of 2014 and expect that the competitive environment, particularly in light of currency changes, can create additional opportunities for pricing enhancement. Beyond that, our teams continue to work on initiatives to drive supply chain efficiencies.
Overall for 2015, our goal is to achieve constant dollar gross margin expansion. We expect modest constant dollar gross margin expansion in the first quarter and expect that our margin enhancement initiatives to the extent we achieve them would yield improvements weighted towards the second half of the year.
With respect to operating expenses, we plan to leverage our infrastructure and reinvest back capacities to drive growth. We feel that the structure we need to support and grow our business for the foreseeable future is largely in place. Our second half 2014 infrastructure spending grew only slightly, and we expect that trend will continue. As a growth company, we will continue to look for opportunities to redeploy resources as our business evolves, and that can create some variations among quarters. Overall for 2015, we are planning nearly flat infrastructure spending with modest growth at the beginning of the year, tailing off significantly as we anniversary last year's leveling of infrastructure and realize benefits from our efficiency initiatives.
For 2015, we will continue to make significant marketing investments to support the expansion of our portfolio brands, while we fund incremental investments to ignite FOSSIL and SKAGEN. Continuing to build out our digital capabilities is critical for our strategy, and we are earmarking funding to enhance those capabilities. And with solid partnerships already in place with tech giants like Google and Intel, we are poised invest in connected accessories and support a product launch later in the year.
2015, in addition to our ongoing marketing investments, we plan to invest up to $35 million or $0.50 per share to support these critical strategic initiatives. We expect the highest relative increase for our marketing investments will come in the first quarter, as we anniversary a very low level of spending last year and in the fourth quarter, as we invest to support our holiday business. We expect roughly 20% of our expense growth will come from investments in our direct businesses, mainly concessions, which require far less capital than stores. We expect store-related expense growth will be highest in the first quarter, tailing off as we anniversary stores added last year. Our strategy in 2015 is to expand our digital presence and open fewer stores, a net 10 new stores focused on international outlets.
Lastly, as I mentioned in my fourth quarter review, we reduced our incentive comp expense in 2014 as we did not achieve all of last year's goal. Our 2015 expectations include an assumption of success against our 2015 goals, which would then result in an expense headwind in Q4. Inclusive of all these investments, we expect our overall expenses to grow in the high single digits. We expect the highest growth rates to be in the first quarter, which also include the impact of earlier expenses from Baselworld.
We expect the expense growth will be lowest in the middle 2 quarters, increasing again in the fourth given our marketing investments and expectations around incentive comp. Taking all of these factors into account, we expect full year constant dollar operating margins to be roughly flat to down 80 basis points, as gross margin expansion and infrastructure leverage offset the impact of growth investment. For the first quarter, we expect constant dollar operating margins in the range between 9.5% and 10.5%.
As we mentioned on our last call, currencies will have a material impact on our financial results for 2015. In November, we estimated the impact on our 2014 results if the then prevailing rates would have been in effect for the full 2014 year. That estimate adjusted for the first 3 quarters of 2014 but anticipated no Q4 headwind since the guidance assumes prevailing rate as of November.
Since then, the U.S. dollar has further strengthened against most currencies that affect us, especially the euro, which is the currency that impacts us most. The euro averaged in the mid $1.30 in the first 3 quarters of 2014 and was roughly $1.25 when we spoke in November. Since then, the euro depreciation has accelerated, particularly since year end, reaching roughly $1.14 today.
Now the impact on the first 3 quarters of 2014 has more than doubled, and there is a significant currency headwind in the fourth quarter as well, which is the quarter in which we earned roughly 40% of our operating income. That much larger 2014 headwind will now expand further as we move into 2015 given most of our earnings growth will come from our international businesses, and our gross margins will be further impacted by the rapid strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Based on prevailing exchange rate, we estimate that the net impact on our 2015 result, inclusive of hedging program offset, will be roughly $1.20 per share.
We'll continue to look at pricing as a potential offset, though any pricing opportunities we may pursue would have a delayed impact and will primarily be dependent on the market's competitive environment. At prevailing exchange rates, we estimate the negative impact on our 2015 revenue growth will be roughly 500 basis points, and the negative impact on both gross and operating margins will be more than 250 basis points. We expect a quarterly top line headwind of roughly 600 basis points until we reach the fourth quarter when the headwind will be roughly half that amount. The absolute EPS headwind should build and intensify as we move through the first 3 quarters and then stabilize in the fourth where the relative currency headwind will be much smaller, so the earnings base should be larger.
With respect to restructuring investments, while the process of optimizing our operating structure is always ongoing, we feel we are in the later stages of near-term infrastructure investments. In 2015, we plan to invest roughly $25 million or $0.35 per share to refine and optimize our structure, creating greater efficiencies and improving our retail profitability. These initiatives primarily emerged from the detailed strategic planning process that we undertook last year. These investments will include the remainder of the store closures that we announced in 2014 that were not completed by last year end.
We believe these investments all have compelling near-term paybacks, including some benefits later this year and just as importantly, will support our efforts to create a best-in-class operating platform capable of responding quickly to our many growth opportunities. We expect the vast majority of these charges will be recorded in the first half of this year with about $10 million or $0.14 per share impacting the first quarter.
On a reported GAAP basis, including all the factors I mentioned, we anticipate full year revenues in the range between a 1% increase and a 3% decrease. For the first quarter, we expect to report revenues that are down between 5.5% and 7.5%. For the full year, we expect reported operating margins between 12% and 13%. For the first quarter, we expect operating margins in the range between 6% and 7%.
We expect full year GAAP EPS in the range between $5.45 and $6.05 per share, which includes the negative impact of the $1.20 currency headwind, the $0.35 negative impact from the restructuring charge and the $0.50 impact from our strategic investments. These amounts assume that currencies remain roughly at the prevailing rates and include net nonoperating gains associated with currencies both contract and account balances. They also assume a higher level of interest expense given increased debt, continued investment in our share repurchase program and a tax rate of roughly 31%.
For the first quarter, we expect GAAP EPS in the range between $0.59 and $0.69 per share, which includes the $0.14 restructuring charge and a $0.17 currency headwind. We are planning CapEx of roughly $120 million. We expect that our capital investments will generally shift away from new store openings to investments to build our digital and CRM capabilities as well as incremental shop in shop.

Also, keep in mind, in the third quarter of last year, we actually had a 9% increase in watches in the United States, so some of this may have been building stock for Christmas. We also know, as we mentioned, is that the sell-out comp percent in our wholesale partners in the United States was not -- it was slightly negative down but not down as much as our wholesale shipments. So having said all that, there's a lot of moving parts going on. The market is, I think, in United States, still -- we still think it's a very important category for the stores. It's very extremely profitable. There's a lot of activity going on. We're launching Tory Burch. We're expanding to more doors. Kate Spade is already in there, but we'll be expanding it. We are hopeful to put some wearable technology in the space. This -- in 2015, it could spark interest and bring more people to the counter. But as far as the watch trend is concerned overall, Euromonitor says that in the United States and globally, the watch business still grew at 4% last year.

We talked about the $1.20 headwind. Roughly half of that will come from translation.

We talked about the $1.20 headwind. Roughly half of that will come from translation. That means, as we're translating our foreign earnings into U.S. dollars, each line item on the P&L obviously translates into a lower amount. So when we consolidate all of that into U.S. dollars, that all combines to represent roughly half of that headwind. So that's the part that we don't hedge. Now the other half, the $1.20, relates to the transactions in our foreign subs by inventory primarily in U.S. dollars. So as the dollar strengthens, their cost of goods goes up, and obviously, their margins are reduced. Now we do hedge that exposure with foreign contracts based on our order estimates. Obviously, with the greatest visibility in the very near term, our program runs roughly over 18 months, and we dollar cost average into the rate. So the hedging offset is highest in the near quarter up to roughly 2/3 and then tails off over time, averaging just under about 1/2 of a full year offset as we head into 2015. So that's helped offset the impact. Although, remember, the offset is recorded below the line in other income, so that net impact is the other half of the $1.20 headwind. Now in addition to forward, we've already implemented price increases, some last year with more to come very soon, and we're still working on more later in the year. So obviously, their success will depend on market conditions, so we can't yet predict the full impact. However, if you combine our contract hedges along with the price adjustments we're planning, combined, they would virtually offset the full P&L impact, not the margin rate but the transactional P&L impact of the strong U.S. dollar at those rates. So that's the overall currency environment. Then with respect to the Swiss franc, we're fairly automatically or naturally hedged with that in as much as our Swiss franc expense base roughly in line with our revenue base."

SKAGEN grew double digits, accelerated towards the back half of the year. Branded jewelry, leathers have been trending well for us, new brands. So there's a lot tailwinds in there.

So we're looking at both display items like smart watches but also non-display items, like jewelry and potentially bracelets, et cetera. And we think eventually, it'll probably impact all brands. One way to look at this is if we have a business in wearable technology that involves fashion with some technology, whether it's sensors or communication, theoretically, potentially someday, every watch we make could have some type of technology on it. So I expect, at some point, all our watches will have enhanced technology, whether it's sensors, communication. It could be apps in the community involved as well, and that's really the approach we're taking. So as I said, we'll be shipping something later this year.

Averaging retailers are very high, and we want to continue to fuel it with new brands and ideas and innovation and technology. That's really our idea, and we think we can do that. On the inventory side, when we look at both the inventory in our wholesale partners' stores and also, our own inventory, we think we're in good shape. We ended up in our own inventory slightly up, but that was mostly because of the sales miss. But the practical matter, Chinese New Year's coming in, and our global planning organization will absorb that, and we'll keep going. Also, keep in mind that we have a good part of our inventory especially in watches and on quick-response items. So it's really just a process of managing the ebb and flow of quick-response items, so we should be able to work through pretty quickly."

And we also typically, and you'd see that in those numbers, would expect the regions to act and grow relative to their own level of maturity. So the international businesses drive the most growth for us. Europe has been very strong. Asia has been growing in double digits, and North America is a region where we're not anticipating wholesale growth, very encouraged by the retail comps. So we -- our goal is to see those trends continue. With respect to store closures, I mean, what we said is that we're opening a net 10 stores. Most of those stores will be overseas. In fact, we should operate with fewer stores by the end of the year here in North America. So most of the -- or all of the growth will be international, and we will execute some closures here. That's also what some of the cost in those restructuring charges will facilitate."

And if you look at, from our perspective, the huge amount of spending going on in technology products, so phones, cellphones, iPads, cell service, et cetera, if you look at the huge amount of spending going on in that category -- and the watch business is relatively small. If just a small percentage of that spending drops down in the watch business. It could have a dramatic impact on the growth of the category and make it more relevant, and we think we're sitting right in the middle of something that could be much larger. So there's a lot of moving parts. We are very excited to be investing with our partners, both Intel and Google and others, on coming up with new ideas to engage customers, have communication vehicles and really enable customers to make their watch and their wearable technology more relevant to their lives. I think it's -- it puts the -- it makes the watch category much more relevant, especially when you consider the millennials largely had grown up without watches.

We will begin with our prepared remarks and then open the call to answer any questions. 
We are pleased to report first quarter results today that give us the belief that we are on track to achieve our goals for the year. We continue to enjoy both the operational and strategic benefits of our diversified business model. Once again, our global operating platform and powerful brand served us well, leading the first quarter net sales and overall performance that were in line with our expectations. 
Looking at the business operationally during the quarter, we continued our leadership in watches, which led our performance. We grew our own brands with both FOSSIL and SKAGEN posting solid increases, especially in watches, and we increased our business and our licensed portfolio. We grew across all of our regions and continued to expand internationally with the strong performance in Europe. We delivered positive comps in our retail stores, and we continue to invest to drive our future growth while returning capital to our shareholders. While there are pockets of our business that remain challenging, we're off to a good start and remain focus on delivering both our near- and longer-term objectives. We have spent several decades developing competitive advantage that have us positioned to take advantage of the growing global watch market and accessories markets. Our expertise in design and creativity, combined with our operational competencies, including our supply chain and global distribution capabilities, enable us to partner with the best brands in the world and help each of them reach their full potential, growing our global footprint in watches and fashion accessories. 
We are focused on preserving our business in developed markets and replicating that great success in newer markets where our potential to gain market share is substantial. We have built a strong and scalable operating platform, capable of leveraging our great strengths in design, manufacturing and distribution. In the first quarter, we made progress on the key areas of strategic focus for us that we outlined on our Investor Day in March. As we shared on that day, we feel very strongly about the company's future and our ability to extend our leadership position in the growing watch and accessories markets. Growing our own brands, FOSSIL and SKAGEN, enhancing our digital capabilities and bringing to market compelling connected accessories are all critical elements of the strategy, and we advanced our cause in the quarter. 
For the FOSSIL brand, in like-for-like currencies and the calendar, we grew the brand 6% for the quarter with increases in all of our regions and solid growth in watches and leathers. While we are still not yet where we want to be with the brand, we're seeing an encouraging sell-out trends in our American wholesale business in both these categories and strong acceleration in Asia, where we believe we are gaining traction in building brand awareness. 
We continue to focus our efforts in marketing to build awareness to ignite the FOSSIL brand, and while it's still early, we remain encouraged by the results, including delivering positive comps across our global fleet of retail stores. We are continuing to build our analytic capabilities to help focus our investments in the brand to drive stronger returns both for this year and beyond. 
For SKAGEN, the progress we are making is very encouraging. Like-for-like SKAGEN sales increased more than 20% with solid double-digit increases in all regions. Watch performance led the business and we're also seeing positive responses to both leathers and jewelry. We continue to see great potential with SKAGEN as we further develop the brand and expand the distribution globally. 
In digital, our goal is to build world-class capabilities over the next 2 years. To remain competitive and relevant, we have to enhance our digital experience, creating a better connection with our customers and evolving to meet the needs of today's consumers. In the quarter, we made excellent progress in extending our social presence and improving our CRM capabilities to communicate with customers in a more targeted way. Our goal for the year is to further enhance the customer experience with a redesigned website optimized for mobile and a rollout of tablet devices to all of our full-priced stores in the United States in order to support sales and our CRM efforts. We're also investing in key foundational components like order management and point-of-sale systems to further expand our omni-channel capabilities. 
When it comes to connected accessories, we feel very strongly about both our progress and our prospects to be a strong catalyst for growth in the category. There's a lot of consumer interest in the space and a wide diversity of perspectives on the role that smart watches and other connected accessories will play in the market. With our partnerships with Google and Intel, coupled with our ability to create fashion at scale, we believe we have a significant opportunity as the convergence of fashion and technology enables us to bring compelling tech enhanced accessories to the consumer. We continue to make progress and we look forward to launching later this year with FOSSIL products in stores for holiday 2015. 
At the core of our objectives is to leverage what we do best and to extend our leadership position in watches with our strategic advantages in design, production and distribution. Our objective is to gain share in the global watch market. In February, we added Kate Spade New York to our portfolio and began shipping the products in March. This is an emerging brand with global appeal and we are looking forward to further developing the products and distribution over the next few years. 
Additionally, last month, we partnered with the Ralph Lauren Corporation to develop watches under the Chaps label that will further enhance our portfolio. The Chaps label complements our multibrand portfolio with opportunities for new price points and distribution channels. We look forward to leveraging our competitive advantages to help expand the brand's global footprint. 
We're working with all of our brands to help them achieve their full potential and drive global growth by leveraging on our operating platform and competitive strengths. During the first quarter, on a like-for-like basis, our multibrand watch portfolio grew 3% with the strongest growth in Europe. We believe our international markets represent a great opportunity to gain share and the benefit from global category growth. We saw growth across Michael Kors, Armani, Diesel and continue to benefit from the launch of new brands like Tory Burch. 
Looking at our results regionally, we continued to benefit from a diversified geographic model with each of our regions growing on a like-for-like basis during the quarter. This includes the Americas where we grew by 3%, a sequential improvement from last year's fourth quarter. Our retail business continues to improve with positive comps across the fleet, while wholesale sell-in increase U.S. Department stores sell-out trends were mixed with some brands accelerating while others have not been as strong. There's a lot of disruption in this market right now with new entrants and existing brands that are maturing. While we do see growth from other markets like Latin America, our focus is on our U.S. wholesale business is to protect the significant share that we have built over the years. Europe continued to be strong for us with a 9% increase with solid performances in our larger markets such as Germany and the United Kingdom. We continue to see white space opportunities to grow in new markets and to add more of our brands to our existing distribution. In Asia, sales grew by 4%, and while we experienced stronger performances in markets such as Japan, Australia and India, we are working hard to address opportunities to ignite growth across the region. Our infrastructure investments are largely in place and now we are focusing our resources on increasing brand awareness and adding distribution to advance all of our brands in the region. While the Asian watch market is the largest and fastest-growing globally, it remains dominated by traditional watch brands and higher price points. We remain confident that as the middle class emerges in key markets like China, we are well positioned to benefit from the same market dynamics that helped drive our significant share gains in the United States. 
So with the first quarter behind us, we feel we're on track. We remain confident in our strategies and are focused on building our brands, developing digital and advancing in our connected accessories in an advantaged way. We're restructuring our operating model and shifting our investments away from infrastructure towards direct growth driving initiatives. And while there are challenges, especially in the near term, we are very excited about the long term. We operate a very diverse business model with many levers of growth. Our operating model gives us opportunities for leverage and efficiencies to drive growth, and our strong financial position gives us access to the field that we need to drive our business and to deliver solid returns. 
We continue to expect that 2015 will be another year of progress towards our overarching objective, which is to deliver sustained growth and solid returns for our shareholders over the long term. And now I'll turn it over to Dennis for more comments."

Before I get into the numbers, let me first address our reporting segments. Over the last couple of years, we've realigned our operating structure. Strategic and brand direction are central and regional management",2791,"Thanks, Kosta. Good afternoon, everybody. Before I get into the numbers, let me first address our reporting segments. Over the last couple of years, we've realigned our operating structure. Strategic and brand direction are central and regional management is now fully empowered and responsible to drive though strategies in brand directions across all brands and channels within their regions. In the past, our regional team's managed just their wholesale businesses while the retail business we've managed globally. We feel the current structure will be far more effective in developing our business, particularly as consumer shopping habits continue to evolve. 
In addition, in our prior reporting intercompany profits from factory operations were reported based on their region of production, which is primarily in Asia, rather than in the region where the products were sold. With the implementation of our new reporting systems, we are now able to extract discrete financial information that aligns with our operating structure and is more consistent with how we evaluate our business performance. In our earnings release, you will find a table with 2014 results restated under the new segments, including operating margins across our 3 regions reflective of all channels of distribution. Costs that support companywide rather than region-specific activities such as brand management, design, global marketing expenses, among many others, are reported using corporate cost independent of where those expenses are actually incurred. With that, let me now address our performance. 
There are several factors that will make understanding our performance relative to both last year and our expectations challenging currency headwinds, last year's extra week and the timing of expenditures. As we go through this report, I will isolate these factors recognizing that this is not a precise science, particularly the impact of the extra week. The headline for our total first quarter performance is that both sales and earnings per share came in generally in the middle of our range of expectations. Against those expectations, further currency headwinds pulled our sales numbers down while net expense deferrals increased our earnings. On a like-for-like currency and calendar basis, first quarter net sales increased 5%. On a reported basis, sales declined 7% to $725 million with stronger currency headwinds than we expected and last year's extra week representing a 5.5 point headwind. 
For the quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $0.75 compared to $1.22 last year. This quarter's EPS benefited by roughly $0.12 versus expectations as some planned marketing, fixturing and display cost move later in the year while some restructuring activity was completed earlier. Against last year's EPS, this quarter's results was negatively impacted by roughly $0.13 due to currencies and another $0.16 due to our restructuring charges. While like-for-like sales growth and a lower share count favorably impacted the year-over-year comparison, these were more than offset by higher marketing expenses even considering the deferral I just mentioned as well as the impact of store and infrastructure investments made late last year that we had yet to anniversary. The EPS impact of last year's extra week was minimal. 
Like-for-like FOSSIL brand sales increased about 6%. Solid growth in watches and leather has more than offset the decline in jewelry. The business increased in all 3 regions and we continue to be encouraged by leather where women's handbags delivered solid comp in our retail stores. 
Like-for-like SKAGEN sales grew 24% with 20-plus percent growth in all 3 regions. Strong double-digit watch growth drove the business with solid increases from our newer and smaller leather and jewelry businesses. Like-for-like sales growth from our multibrand watch portfolio was about 3% with the strongest performance from Europe. 
In the Americas, reported sales decreased 4% to $367 million while like-for-like sales increased about 3%. The growth was driven by strong gains in branded jewelry, especially Michael Kors jewelry, as well as a modest increase in our leathers business as the watch business was roughly flat. Like-for-like sales for the FOSSIL, SKAGEN and Michael Kors brand increased in the quarter. The increase was driven by our retail stores where comp store sales increased modestly with conversion improving due to compelling promotions in the outlet channel. Traffic in our American stores remained down. Like-for-like wholesale sales increased slightly as international increases offset declines in off-price selling and U.S. department store sell-in. Sell-out data from our department store partners where we have planned business down this year would did show a decline from the consistent quarterly trends from last year. Sell-out in watches continued to improve sequentially for both FOSSIL and SKAGEN while Michael Kors declined. We continue to drive increases in our own e-commerce business and our wholesale partners tell us that they are seeing strong sell-out increases on their own sites as well. 
In Europe, reported sales decreased 10% to $234 million while like-for-like sales increased 9%. Continued expansion of our watch business drove the growth while jewelry, still a smaller business increased sharply with a very strong growth rate. Our leathers business also posted a modest increase. We continue to see strong performances in various established markets like Germany, France and the U.K., which delivered the strongest increases in the quarter. Both FOSSIL and SKAGEN expanded in the quarter with particular strength in watches. Within the licensed portfolio, Michael Kors, Armani and Diesel increased, while DKNY was weaker. Comp store sales increased modestly in the region with increases in both our full price and outlet stores. 
Our reported Asia sales decreased 7% to $124 million, and on a like-for-like basis, they increased 4%. Watches, leathers and jewelry all grew in the quarter. Japan, Australia and India were our strongest performing markets while we continue to see weakness in South Korea, and our distributor business was down. FOSSIL was our strongest performing brand and Michael Kors increased as did SKAGEN. Each of these 3 brands posted solid double-digit gains. Our business with the Armani brand declined in the quarter. Comp store sales decreased modestly in the region with the strongest performance coming from the outlet channel. Like-for-like concessions sales increased during the quarter, driven by new doors,, while concession comps overall were down. In the quarter, gross profit decreased to $401 million and gross margin declined 180 basis points to 55.3%. The decrease was primarily driven by the headwinds resulting from the strong U.S. dollar. Aside from that, favorable regional distribution mix, along with these favorable impact from the initial price increases we took late last year, roughly offset the impact of promotions where we adjusted our strategy later last year mainly with Watch Station outlets here in the United States. 
In the quarter, operating expenses increased 2% to $345 million, which includes a $12 million restructuring charge to optimize our store fleet and our operating structure. Operationally, our expense increases were focused on marketing and brand-building activities. Expenses were also impacted by this year's earlier Basel fair as well as the store and infrastructure investments made early last year, which we have not yet anniversaried. With last year's pivotal way for store in infrastructure investments, we expect these investments will abate as we move the balance of this year. These areas of expense growth were partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currencies, last year's extra week and a reduction in corporate back office expenses. First quarter operating expenses were lower than we had initially planned as some advertising investments, along with deployment of fixturing and displays, were moved later in the year. We also completed the closure of one store earlier than planned, which increased the quarter's restructuring charge. Our operating expense rate was 47.5% compared to 43.6% last year, due principally to the fact that I just described, other than currencies, which don't significantly affect the overall expense rate. 
Operating income decreased to $56 million, including a $16 million unfavorable currency impact. Operating margin decreased to 7.7% compared to 13.5% last year due mainly to the impact of the restructuring charges, operating expense increases and currencies. Restructuring charges create a 170 basis point headwind on operating margins and the impact of currencies was 150 basis points. 
Interest expense increased slightly to $4 million given our higher debt levels. First quarter other income, which principally relates to foreign currency contracts and balances for the quarter was $7 million higher than we had expected given the further strengthening of the U.S. dollar. 
Our effective income tax rate for the first quarter was 31.3% similar to last year's first quarter, and we are planning the full year at about 31%. So first quarter net income decreased $28 million as like-for-like sales growth was offset by operating expense increases, restructuring charges and the impact of currencies. 
Now turning to our cash flows and balance sheet. For the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $86 million versus $97 million a year ago. We drew down a net $13 [ph] million on our revolver. We invested $17 [ph] million in capital expenditures and $115 million to repurchase 1.3 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $88. We ended the quarter with $944 million remaining on our repurchase authorization. We ended the quarter with $237 million in cash and $645 million in debt. First quarter ending inventory totaled $631 million, a 5% increase over last year. In constant dollars, the growth rate was roughly 14%. Accounts receivable decreased by 8% to $266 million and wholesale DSOs improved by roughly 5 days. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $22 million for the quarter. 
Moving now to our outlook. First, to restate our earlier message. With the first quarter results generally in line with our expectations, other than the timing of our marketing investments, our annual operational outlook remains largely unchanged as do our strategies. We continue to expect to generate leverage from our operating structure and use that capacity to invest in our long-term growth. Our priorities remain unchanged to invest in our own brands, FOSSIL and SKAGEN to invest in building our digital platform and enhancing the online experience of our customers, to invest in connected accessories and leverage the partnerships that we are building to bring fashion to the space and, of course, to use and optimize our portfolio of lifestyle brands to extend our leadership position in the growing global watch market. 
As we said before, nearer-term challenges remain. Newcomers are entering our market, and managing the natural ebbs and flows of brands in the life cycle is an imperfect science. Consumer shopping behaviors are changing in an unprecedented rate and we continue to be cautious in the United States. This is our most developed market and we are actively engaged in protecting our position, seeking new opportunities for growth and working to replicate our great success here in international markets. With these near-term challenges, we see even greater longer-term opportunities. Kate Spade New York brings another of the world's hottest fashion brands into our portfolio and it can be a powerful weapon to preserve and gain share. We are well positioned to take advantage of favorable market demographics to expand the penetration of fashion brands in growing international markets. Our research supports significant growth opportunities for both FOSSIL and SKAGEN and we are focusing more target investments to support this. There are both near- and longer-term opportunities to leverage our full brand portfolio to grow in our well-developed global distribution, and we see levers such as price to drive top line growth. We're seeing success with our initial price adjustments and are implementing more that we'll roll out later in the year. 
The only significant change to our outlook for this year relates to foreign currencies. While the U.S. dollar strengthened further in the quarter, it has weakened significantly in the last couple of weeks and we are updating our outlook to reflect that volatility using a range that roughly aligns with our initial 2015 guidance rate from the high side and more current prevailing rates on the low side. So with respect to sales, we continued to expect full year sales growth in the range between 3% and 7%. This excludes the impact of last year's extra week, a roughly 1.25 point, headwind as well as currency headwinds, which, based on our assumptions, would range between 5 points and 6 points. We see opportunities for current sales trend to improve modestly in the middle quarters as we benefit from the addition of Kate Spade to our portfolio. We expect the bigger opportunity for a more accelerated growth rate in the fourth quarter as we anniversary last year's performance and also benefit from the step-up in marketing investments, which are targeted for the second half of the year to support the most important selling season. 
For the second quarter, we expect constant dollar sales growth in the range of 4% to 6%. We expect currency headwinds on sales will be most severe in the second quarter, roughly 6.5 to 7 full points begin to lessen in the third quarter and diminish even more in the fourth quarter, though certainly still significant. Based on these assumptions, for the full year, we now expect reported GAAP sales in the range between a 1% increase and a 4% decrease and for second quarter reported GAAP sales to decline between 0.5% and 3%. 
With respect to gross margins, excluding the impact of currencies, we continue to anticipate gross margin expansion driven by continued favorable international mix, along with our pricing and margin enhancement initiatives. We expect the greatest opportunity for expansion will come in the second half of the year when more of our pricing changes will be implemented and as we anniversary last year's handbag liquidation and the outlet promotion strategy, which we implemented later last year. Based on our currency assumptions, the currency headwind on gross margins, which we estimate in the range between 2.5 and 3 full points, should generally follow the same pattern -- quarterly pattern of sales, though roughly 1 quarter delayed as currencies first impact inventories and only affect margins once products are sold. So we would expect the third quarter to absorb the greatest gross margin decline. We also expect the offsetting nonoperating gains related to our foreign currencies contracts should roughly mirror the currency impact on gross margins but will also be impacted by the underlying sales volume, which is highest in the fourth quarter. 
Regarding expenses, with the first quarter now behind us, and given our sales expectations, we continue to expect to generate leverage from our overall infrastructure and store expense base, including some initial benefits from our restructuring efforts. We expect the total annual expense rate to increase year-over-year given the additional $35 million or $0.50 per share that we plan to invest this year to support our marketing and brand awareness activities, our digital strategy and to develop connected accessories. The concentration of these investments will occur during the second half of the year to support the key selling season. We expect to incur about $8 million or roughly $0.11 per share of this year's $25 million in restructuring charges in the second quarter as we enhance our operating structure. Given these factors, along with this year earlier Basel fair, which already impacted the first quarter, we are expecting our overall second quarter expense rate to decline slightly. Given these assumptions, we continue to expect full year adjusted operating margins, excluding both the impacts of currencies and the restructuring charge, in a range that is roughly flat to down 80 basis points. Including our currency assumptions, we now expect full year reported GAAP operating margins in the range between 11.5% and 13%. For the second quarter, we expect reported GAAP operating margin in the range between 8% and 9% and adjusted operating margin in the range between 11.5% and 12.5%. 
Given all these factors, along with continued share repurchases, we continue to expect reported GAAP full year earnings per share at $6.05 on the high side and, given our updated currency assumptions, at $5.25 on the low side. This includes a net unfavorable currency impact between $1.20 and $1.40 per share and a $0.35 impact related to restructuring charges. On a constant dollar basis, excluding restructuring charges, adjusted EPS would be in the range between $7 and $7.60. 
For the second quarter, we expect reported GAAP earnings per share in the range between $0.80 and $0.91. This includes a net unfavorable currency impact of about $0.27 and $0.11 related to restructuring charges. We now expect capital expenditures between $110 million and $120 million. Our plan is to support fewer openings of stores and a shift toward investment to build our digital and CRM capabilities as well as incremental shop in shops. And so now I'll turn the call back over to the operator for your questions."

It sounds like you said your sell-in improved on a sequential basis versus the prior quarter and yet your sell-through was a little mixed. I just wanted a little bit more expansion of what your partners are seeing there and why is the sell-through mixed from your perspective? Is it mixed by brand in the department store channel distribution? And then lastly, when you just say you want to focus on in the U.S. wholesale channel protecting your market share, what do you mean by that? And what actions do you think you have to take to protect that share, if any?"

Having said that, we mentioned about fourth quarter last year that our shipments 2 stores were not -- they were negative and they were retail sell-out during the quarter, and our wholesale partners was not as negative. So I think what we're saying now is we're seeing the reverse in the first quarter are sell-in to those accounts in the first quarter was actually better than their sell-out. So part of that could be we shipped less in the fourth quarter last year. And so if you balance it on 2 quarters put together it may not be an impact at all. So I'll just caution you to look at entire year when it's done and probably get more information from that. So our focus really is obviously the markets very disruptive phase. We're seeing in our wholesale partners I'd say is we actually are seeing, as mentioned, their declining business there. Keep in mind also that first quarter is a relatively small part of the year. We still expect and always have that 40% retail sales in watches happen in the fourth quarter. So but having said that, we're seeing declines in there and also there's a lot of disruption. Obviously, there's a new entrant in the market. We're not sure if there's some impact on the consumer side to see with that new entrant products look like et cetera, but they have yet to be seen. So our mission is really we have a big share in the market. We've got a lot of initiatives in place to continue to grow the U.S. market and we're seeing strong -- we're seeing growth in FOSSIL and FOSSIL SKAGEN we have accelerated demand creation activities as well as our omni-channel activities in the back half of this year that we think we can continue to grow those faster. We still, obviously, have Kate Spade is new to the market. Tory Burch started in the fourth quarter last year, so we got 3 quarters of the year to start that. Both those brands look like they have significant long-term potential. We also are looking at launching wearable technology in the back half of the year in the fourth quarter. We think that can add some fuel to the fire in the U.S. So we're being very aggressive in the U.S. and we think we have some initiatives in place to fuel growth."

So we're kind of in a transition phase right now where our objective really are continuing to grow the existing businesses we have. We have a lot of new product initiatives in place that we think can fuel that. And we do have a lot of interest in wearable technology. We think we're in a situation where consumers are very, very interested in this convergence of fashion and technology. So our objective is to put some of this technology, which could be notifications, sensors, other types of activity in our watches that could add value. And when you leverage across the large scale, large numbers of units that we have, we could be in a situation where we could add a lot of value in products but not a lot of expense and have another series of disruptive growth in our business and really change the market in the U.S. And that's really what we're working towards. We think it's quite a significant opportunity and we're looking at that from that perspective. We do think that we have an opportunity to bring new ideas and compelling products that are tech-enhanced that millennials will embrace. And again keep, in mind that millennials largely have not been wearing watches because they grew up with cell phones, and obviously, they're interested in technology and we think it could be a long-term opportunity for us."

So now we've redistributed those to the actual underlying selling region. We've also been able better to differentiate some corporate costs that we're sitting in the U.S. wholesale business. Now those are really corporate activity. So at the end of the day now, and you see also the impact of taking the direct businesses and reallocating those to the underlying geographic region. So the Asia region is the smallest of our regions. It's about 1/3 of the size of the overall U.S. or American business with a fully developed infrastructure there that provides significant amount of opportunity for leverage over the long term, but it has to grow to ultimately fully absorb the cost of that infrastructure. So the margin structures are different in each of those business in Asia. You've got higher gross margins but you also have a much heavier concentration of concessions, which carry a significant amount of expense as well. So again, we've realigned not. We've absorbed the direct businesses into those regional structures, aggregated the corporate cost, those costs that solely relate to central expenses and reported it that way with the biggest opportunity for margin gains as the fastest -- long-term fastest-growing region could be Asia as it fully absorbs all those fixed cost."

But one of the things to keep in mind is the department stores are very interested in this because they perceive there to be consumer demand. Another issue here also, which is if you look at -- the watch business is about $65 billion globally, relatively a small industry, whereas the tech industry, which now includes smartphones, self-service, iPads, all the activity is gone in the technology world. The spending in there is huge. So just a small percentage of that spending and interest comes in the watch business and kind of have a huge impact on the watch business to make it much, much larger. A lot of that spending or most of it is not happening in the department store where our customers are. Our mission is really in a disruptive way to bring some of these technologies and ideas to the brands and enable us to add additional functionality at not a lot of cost could make the watch category more relevant and could be a significant amount of sales into the channels that we still too. And that's where we're working on. We think it's a pretty big opportunity."

We just think that we have a lot of ammunition. So having said that, I look at the first quarter and sales were down at the department stores. There's obviously a big new entrant into the category. We're not really sure exactly what impact that will have on the overall watch market. We do think that long term, as I mentioned, I think it's a net plus for us and could be a significant advantage for us. But we're looking at the entire market and how can we gain share. And the Chaps opportunity I think is one where if you look at the market, the watch market globally, over the last several years as we've put more feature function, more innovation, we've raised the average retail across all our brands from Fossil all the way up, and we do have a sense that it's created because as we've elevated our price points and it's created some white space below most of our brands in a more valued way. So there is some distribution we sell to in the U.S. and globally that has been disadvantaged because they don't have access to all those brands that they've been disadvantaged and there's a pretty big opportunity. If you look at the value channel and if you look at their watch business, they're very underpenetrated compared to stores that are modern department stores and above because they don't have access to brands. So part of this Chaps opportunity is for us to bring energy, design, innovation and branding to stores that may not have the potential to get other brands, and it could be a pretty big opportunity for us to round out our portfolio and to give us additional market share. So that's what that's about. But in general, [indiscernible] been very aggressive with the U.S. the market. We continue to believe that we can make it bigger and grow all our brands and take share over time, and we do expect that the expectations are still that the market will grow over the next 5 years. We've seen indications from [indiscernible] it's going to grow single digits. That's before the wearable technology entrants are in there, so we're not sure exactly what the markets can do except that we're going to be very aggressive and go after it."

Dennis Secor, our Chief Financial Officer, is also joining us today. We will begin with our prepared remarks and then open the call to answer any questions.We are pleased to report first quart",1557,"Good afternoon, and thank you for participating on our call. Dennis Secor, our Chief Financial Officer, is also joining us today. We will begin with our prepared remarks and then open the call to answer any questions.
We are pleased to report first quarter results today that give us the belief that we are on track to achieve our goals for the year. We continue to enjoy both the operational and strategic benefits of our diversified business model. Once again, our global operating platform and powerful brand served us well, leading the first quarter net sales and overall performance that were in line with our expectations.
Looking at the business operationally during the quarter, we continued our leadership in watches, which led our performance. We grew our own brands with both FOSSIL and SKAGEN posting solid increases, especially in watches, and we increased our business and our licensed portfolio. We grew across all of our regions and continued to expand internationally with the strong performance in Europe. We delivered positive comps in our retail stores, and we continue to invest to drive our future growth while returning capital to our shareholders. While there are pockets of our business that remain challenging, we're off to a good start and remain focused on delivering both our near- and longer-term objectives. We have spent several decades developing competitive advantage that have us positioned to take advantage of the growing global watch market and accessories markets. Our expertise in design and creativity, combined with our operational competencies, including our supply chain and global distribution capabilities, enable us to partner with the best brands in the world and help each of them reach their full potential, growing our global footprint in watches and fashion accessories.
We are focused on preserving our business in developed markets and replicating that great success in newer markets where our potential to gain market share is substantial. We have built a strong and scalable operating platform, capable of leveraging our great strengths in design, manufacturing and distribution. 
In the first quarter, we made progress on the key areas of strategic focus for us that we outlined on our Investor Day in March. As we shared on that day, we feel very strongly about the company's future and our ability to extend our leadership position in the growing watch and accessories markets. Growing our own brands, FOSSIL and SKAGEN, enhancing our digital capabilities and bringing to market compelling connected accessories are all critical elements of the strategy, and we advanced our cause in the quarter.
For the FOSSIL brand, in like-for-like currencies in the calendar, we grew the brand 6% for the quarter, with increases in all of our regions and solid growth in watches and leathers. While we are still not yet where we want to be with the brand, we're seeing encouraging sell-out trends in our American wholesale business in both these categories and strong acceleration in Asia, where we believe we are gaining traction in building brand awareness.
We continue to focus our efforts in marketing to build awareness to ignite the FOSSIL brand, and while it's still early, we remain encouraged by the results, including delivering positive comps across our global fleet of retail stores. We are continuing to build our analytic capabilities to help focus our investments in the brand to drive stronger returns both for this year and beyond.
For SKAGEN, the progress we are making is very encouraging. Like-for-like SKAGEN sales increased more than 20%, with solid double-digit increases in all regions. Watch performance led the business and we're also seeing positive responses to both leathers and jewelry. We continue to see great potential with SKAGEN as we further develop the brand and expand the distribution globally.
In digital, our goal is to build world-class capabilities over the next 2 years. To remain competitive and relevant, we have to enhance our digital experience, creating a better connection with our customers and evolving to meet the needs of today's consumers. In the quarter, we made excellent progress in extending our social presence and improving our CRM capabilities to communicate with customers in a more targeted way. Our goal for the year is to further enhance the customer experience with a redesigned website optimized for mobile and a rollout of tablet devices to all of our full-priced stores in the United States in order to support sales and our CRM efforts. We're also investing in key foundational components like order management and point-of-sale systems to further extend our omni-channel capabilities.
When it comes to connected accessories, we feel very strongly about both our progress and our prospects to be a strong catalyst for growth in the category. There's a lot of consumer interest in the space and a wide diversity of perspectives on the role that smart watches and other connected accessories will play in the market. With our partnerships with Google and Intel, coupled with our ability to create fashion at scale, we believe we have a significant opportunity as the convergence of fashion and technology enables us to bring compelling tech-enhanced accessories to the consumer. We continue to make progress, and we look forward to launching later this year with FOSSIL products in stores for holiday 2015.
At the core of our objectives is to leverage what we do best and to extend our leadership position in watches with our strategic advantages in design, production and distribution. Our objective is to gain share in the global watch market. In February, we added Kate Spade New York to our portfolio and began shipping the products in March. This is an emerging brand with global appeal, and we are looking forward to further developing the products and the distribution over the next few years. 
Additionally, last month, we partnered with the Ralph Lauren Corporation to develop watches under the Chaps label that will further enhance our portfolio. The Chaps label complements our multi-brand portfolio with opportunities for new price points and distribution channels. We look forward to leveraging our competitive advantages to help expand the brand's global footprint.
We're working with all of our brands to help them achieve their full potential and drive global growth by leveraging our operating platform and competitive strengths. During the first quarter, on a like-for-like basis, our multi-brand watch portfolio grew 3%, with the strongest growth in Europe. We believe our international markets represent a great opportunity to gain share and the benefit from global category growth. We saw growth across Michael Kors, Armani, Diesel and continue to benefit from the launch of newer brands like Tory Burch. 
Looking at our results regionally, we continued to benefit from a diversified geographic model, with each of our regions growing on a like-for-like basis during the quarter. This includes the Americas where we grew by 3%, a sequential improvement from last year's fourth quarter. Our retail business continues to improve with positive comps across the fleet. While wholesale sell-in increase U.S. department store sell-out trends were mixed, with some brands accelerating, while others have not been as strong. There's a lot of disruption in this market right now with new entrants and existing brands that are maturing. 
While we do see growth from other markets like Latin America, our focus is on our U.S. wholesale business is to protect the significant share that we have built over the years. Europe continued to be strong for us, with a 9% increase with solid performances in our larger markets such as Germany and the United Kingdom. We continue to see white-space opportunities to grow in new markets and to add more of our brands to our existing distribution. 
In Asia, sales grew by 4%, and while we experienced stronger performances in markets such as Japan, Australia and India, we are working hard to address opportunities to ignite growth across the region. Our infrastructure investments are largely in place and now we are focusing our resources on increasing brand awareness and adding distribution to advance all of our brands in the region. While the Asian watch market is the largest and fastest-growing globally, it remains dominated by traditional watch brands and higher price points. We remain confident that as the middle class emerges in key markets like China, we are well positioned to benefit from the same market dynamics that helped drive our significant share gains in the United States.
So with the first quarter behind us, we feel we're on track. We remain confident in our strategies and are focused on building our brands, developing digital and advancing in our connected accessories in an advantaged way. We're restructuring our operating model and shifting our investments away from infrastructure towards direct growth-driving initiatives. And while there are challenges, especially in the near term, we are very excited about the long term. We operate a very diverse business model with many levers of growth. Our operating model gives us opportunities for leverage and efficiencies to drive growth, and our strong financial position gives us access to the field that we need to drive our business and to deliver solid returns.
We continue to expect that 2015 will be another year of progress towards our overarching objective, which is to deliver sustained growth and solid returns for our shareholders over the long term. 
And now I'll turn it over to Dennis for more comments."
317037,292146320,804490,"Fossil Group, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Fossil Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kosta. Good afternoon, everybody. Before I get into the numbers, let me first address our reporting segments. Over the last couple of years, we've realigned our operating structure. Strategic and brand direction are set centrally and regional mana",2787,"Thanks, Kosta. Good afternoon, everybody. Before I get into the numbers, let me first address our reporting segments. Over the last couple of years, we've realigned our operating structure. Strategic and brand direction are set centrally and regional management is now fully empowered and responsible to drive those strategies in brand directions across all brands and channels within their regions. In the past, our regional team's managed just their wholesale businesses, while the retail business was managed globally. We feel the current structure will be far more effective in developing our business, particularly as consumer shopping habits continue to evolve.
In addition, in our prior reporting, intercompany profits from factory operations were reported based on their region of production, which is primarily Asia, rather than in the region where the products were sold. With the implementation of our new reporting systems, we are now able to extract discrete financial information that aligns with our operating structure and is more consistent with how we evaluate our business performance. 
In our earnings release, you will find a table with 2014 results restated under the new segments, including operating margins across our 3 regions reflective of all channels of distribution. Costs that support company-wide rather than region-specific activities, such as brand management, design, global marketing expenses, among many others, are reported using corporate cost, independent of where those expenses are actually incurred. With that, let me now address our performance.
There are several factors that will make understanding our performance relative to both last year and our expectations challenging, currency headwinds, last year's extra week and the timing of expenditures. As we go through this report, I will isolate these factors, recognizing that this is not a precise science, particularly the impact of the extra week. 
The headline for our total first quarter performance is that both sales and earnings per share came in generally in the middle of our range of expectations. Against those expectations, further currency headwinds pulled our sales numbers down, while net expense deferrals increased our earnings. 
On a like-for-like currency and calendar basis, first quarter net sales increased 5%. On a reported basis, sales declined 7% to $725 million, with stronger currency headwinds than we expected and last year's extra week representing a 5.5 point headwind.
For the quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $0.75 compared to $1.22 last year. This quarter's EPS benefited by roughly $0.12 versus expectations, as some planned marketing, fixturing and display costs moved later in the year while some restructuring activity was completed earlier. Against last year's EPS, this quarter's result was negatively impacted by roughly $0.13 due to currencies and another $0.16 due to our restructuring charges. While like-for-like sales growth and a lower share count favorably impacted the year-over-year comparison, these were more than offset by higher marketing expenses, even considering the deferral I just mentioned as well as the impact of store and infrastructure investments made late last year that we have yet to anniversary. The EPS impact of last year's extra week was minimal.
Like-for-like FOSSIL brand sales increased about 6%. Solid growth in watches and leather has more than offset the decline in jewelry. The business increased in all 3 regions, and we continue to be encouraged by leathers, where women's handbags delivered solid comp in our retail stores.
Like-for-like SKAGEN sales grew 24% with 20-plus percent growth in all 3 regions. Strong double-digit watch growth drove the business with solid increases from our newer and smaller leathers and jewelry businesses. Like-for-like sales growth from our multibrand watch portfolio was about 3% with the strongest performance from Europe.
In the Americas, reported sales decreased 4% to $367 million, while like-for-like sales increased about 3%. The growth was driven by strong gains in branded jewelry, especially Michael Kors jewelry as well as a modest increase in our leathers business as the watch business was roughly flat. 
Like-for-like sales for the FOSSIL, SKAGEN and Michael Kors brand increased in the quarter. The increase was driven mainly by our retail stores, where comp store sales increased modestly, with conversion improving due to compelling promotions in the outlet channel. Traffic in our American stores remained down. Like-for-like wholesale sales increased slightly, as international increases offset declines in off-price selling and U.S. department store sell-in. Sell-out data from our department store partners, where we have planned the business down this year, did show a decline from the consistent quarterly trends from last year. Sell-out in watches continued to improve sequentially for both FOSSIL and SKAGEN while Michael Kors declined. We continue to drive increases in our own e-commerce business, and our wholesale partners tell us that they are seeing strong sell-out increases on their own sites as well.
In Europe, reported sales decreased 10% to $234 million, while like-for-like sales increased 9%. Continued expansion of our watch business drove the growth, while jewelry, still a smaller business increased sharply with a very strong growth rate. Our leathers business also posted a modest increase. 
We continued to see strong performances in various established markets like Germany, France and the U.K., which delivered the strongest increases in the quarter. Both FOSSIL and SKAGEN expanded in the quarter with particular strength in watches. Within the licensed portfolio, Michael Kors, Armani and Diesel increased while DKNY was weaker. Comp store sales increased modestly in the region with increases in both our full price and outlet stores. 
Our reported Asia sales decreased 7% to $124 million, and on a like-for-like basis, they increased 4%. Watches, leathers and jewelry all grew in the quarter. Japan, Australia and India were our strongest performing markets, while we continue to see weakness in South Korea, and our distributor business was down. FOSSIL was our strongest performing brand and Michael Kors increased as did SKAGEN. Each of these 3 brands posted solid double-digit gains. Our business with the Armani brand declined in the quarter. Comp store sales decreased modestly in the region with the strongest performance coming from the outlet channel. Like-for-like concession sales increased during the quarter, driven by new doors, while concession comps overall were down. 
In the quarter, gross profit decreased to $401 million and gross margin declined 180 basis points to 55.3%. The decrease was primarily driven by the headwinds resulting from the strong U.S. dollar. Aside from that, favorable regional distribution mix, along with these favorable impact from the initial price increases we took late last year, roughly offset the impact of promotions where we adjusted our strategy later last year mainly with Watch Station outlets here in the United States. 
In the quarter, operating expenses increased 2% to $345 million, which includes a $12 million restructuring charge to optimize our store fleet and our operating structure. Operationally, our expense increases were focused on marketing and brand-building activities. Expenses were also impacted by this year's earlier Basel fair as well as by the store and infrastructure investments made early last year, which we had not yet anniversaried. With last year's pivot away for store and infrastructure investments, we expect these headwinds will abate as we move through the balance of this year. These areas of expense growth were partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currencies, last year's extra week and a reduction in corporate back-office expenses. 
First quarter operating expenses were lower than we had initially planned as some advertising investments, along with the deployment of fixturing and displays, were moved later in the year. We also completed the closure of 1 store earlier than planned, which increased the quarter's restructuring charge. Our operating expense rate was 47.5% compared to 43.6% last year, due principally to the factors I just described, other than currencies, which don't significantly affect the overall expense rate.
Operating income decreased to $56 million, including a $16 million unfavorable currency impact. Operating margin decreased to 7.7% compared to 13.5% last year due mainly to the impact of the restructuring charges, operating expense increases and currencies. Restructuring charges created a 170 basis point headwind on operating margin, and the impact of currencies was 150 basis points. 
Interest expense increased slightly to $4 million given our higher debt levels. First quarter other income, which principally relates to foreign currency contracts and balances for the quarter was $7 million, higher than we had expected, given the further strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
Our effective income tax rate for the first quarter was 31.3% similar to last year's first quarter, and we are planning the full year at about 31%. So first quarter net income decreased $28 million, as like-for-like sales growth was offset by operating expense increases, restructuring charges and the impact of currencies.
Now turning to our cash flows and balance sheet. For the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $86 million versus $97 million a year ago. We drew down a net $13 million on our revolver. We invested $17 million in capital expenditures and $115 million to repurchase 1.3 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $88. We ended the quarter with $944 million remaining on our repurchase authorizations. 
We ended the quarter with $237 million in cash and $645 million in debt. First quarter ending inventory totaled $631 million, a 5% increase over last year. In constant dollars, the growth rate was roughly 14%. Accounts receivable decreased by 8% to $266 million, and wholesale DSOs improved by roughly 5 days. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $22 million for the quarter.
Moving now to our outlook. First, to restate our earlier message. With the first quarter results generally in line with our expectations, other than the timing of our marketing investments, our annual operational outlook remains largely unchanged as do our strategies. We continue to expect to generate leverage from our operating structure and use that capacity to invest in our long-term growth. Our priorities remain unchanged: to invest in our own brands, FOSSIL and SKAGEN; to invest in building our digital platform and enhancing the online experience of our customers; to invest in connected accessories and leverage the partnerships that we are building to bring fashion to the space; and of course, to use and optimize our portfolio of lifestyle brands to extend our leadership position in the growing global watch market.
As we said before, nearer-term challenges remain. Newcomers are entering our market, and managing the natural ebbs and flows of brands in the life cycle is an imperfect science. Consumer shopping behaviors are changing in an unprecedented rate, and we continue to be cautious in the United States. This is our most developed market, and we are actively engaged in protecting our position, seeking new opportunities for growth and working to replicate our great success here in international markets. 
With these near-term challenges, we see even greater longer-term opportunities. Kate Spade New York brings another of the world's hottest fashion brands into our portfolio and it can be a powerful weapon to preserve and gain share. We are well positioned to take advantage of favorable market demographics to expand the penetration of fashion brands in growing international markets. Our research supports significant growth opportunities for both FOSSIL and SKAGEN, and we are focusing more target investments to support this. There are both near- and longer-term opportunities to leverage our full brand portfolio to grow in our well-developed global distribution, and we see levers such as price to drive top line growth. We're seeing success with our initial price adjustments and are implementing more that we'll roll out later in the year.
The only significant change to our outlook for this year relates to foreign currencies. While the U.S. dollar strengthened further in the quarter, it has weakened significantly in the last couple of weeks. And we are updating our outlook to reflect that volatility using a range that roughly aligns with our initial 2015 guidance rate from the high side and more current prevailing rates on the low side. 
So with respect to sales, we continued to expect full year sales growth in the range between 3% and 7%. This excludes the impact of last year's extra week, a roughly 1.25 point headwind as well as currency headwinds, which, based on our assumptions, would range between 5 points and 6 points. We see opportunities for current sales trends to improve modestly in the middle quarters as we benefit from the addition of Kate Spade to our portfolio. 
We expect the bigger opportunity for a more accelerated growth rate in the fourth quarter as we anniversary last year's performance and also benefit from the step-up in marketing investments, which are targeted for the second half of the year to support the most important selling seasons.
For the second quarter, we expect constant dollar sales growth in the range of 4% to 6%. We expect currency headwinds on sales will be most severe in the second quarter, roughly 6.5 to 7 full points, begin to lessen in the third quarter and diminish even more in the fourth quarter, though certainly still significant. Based on these assumptions, for the full year, we now expect reported GAAP sales in the range between a 1% increase and a 4% decrease, and for second quarter reported GAAP sales to decline between 0.5% and 3%.
With respect to gross margins, excluding the impact of currencies, we continue to anticipate gross margin expansion, driven by continued favorable international mix, along with our pricing and margin-enhancement initiatives. We expect the greatest opportunity for expansion will come in the second half of the year, when more of our pricing changes will be implemented and as we anniversary last year's handbag liquidation and the outlet promotion strategy, which we implemented later last year. 
Based on our currency assumptions, the currency headwind on gross margins, which we estimate in the range between 2.5 and 3 full points, should generally follow the same pattern -- quarterly pattern of sales, though roughly 1 quarter delayed, as currencies first impact inventories and only affect margins once products are sold. So we would expect the third quarter to absorb the greatest gross margin decline. We also expect that the offsetting nonoperating gains related to our foreign currencies contracts should roughly mirror the currency impact on gross margins, but will also be impacted by the underlying sales volume, which is highest in the fourth quarter.
Regarding expenses, with the first quarter now behind us, and given our sales expectations, we continue to expect to generate leverage from our overall infrastructure and store expense base, including some initial benefits from our restructuring efforts. We expect the total annual expense rate to increase year-over-year, given the additional $35 million or $0.50 per share that we plan to invest this year to support our marketing and brand-awareness activities, our digital strategy and to develop connected accessories. The concentration of these investments will occur during the second half of the year to support the key selling season. We expect to incur about $8 million or roughly $0.11 per share of this year's $25 million in restructuring charges in the second quarter as we enhance our operating structure. Given these factors, along with this year earlier Basel fair, which already impacted the first quarter, we are expecting our overall second quarter expense rate to decline slightly. Given these assumptions, we continue to expect full year adjusted operating margins, excluding both the impacts of currencies and the restructuring charge, in a range that is roughly flat to down 80 basis points. 
Including our currency assumptions, we now expect full year reported GAAP operating margins in the range between 11.5% and 13%. For the second quarter, we expect reported GAAP operating margin in the range between 8% and 9% and adjusted operating margin in the range between 11.5% and 12.5%.
Given all these factors, along with continued share repurchases, we continue to expect reported GAAP full year earnings per share at $6.05 on the high side, and given our updated currency assumptions, at $5.25 on the low side. This includes a net unfavorable currency impact between $1.20 and $1.40 per share and a $0.35 impact related to restructuring charges. On a constant dollar basis, excluding restructuring charges, adjusted EPS would be in the range between $7 and $7.60.
For the second quarter, we expect reported GAAP earnings per share in the range between $0.80 and $0.91. This includes a net unfavorable currency impact of about $0.27 and $0.11 related to restructuring charges. We now expect capital expenditures between $110 million and $120 million. Our plan is to support fewer openings of stores and a shift toward investments to build our digital and CRM capabilities as well as incremental shop-in-shops.

Having said that, we mentioned about fourth quarter last year",446,"Well, to begin with, I would caution you to remember that on a quarter-to-quarter basis, it's hard to tell exactly information about sell-in and sell-through because we're not direct to retail. Having said that, we mentioned about fourth quarter last year that our shipments to stores were not -- they were negative and our retail sell-out during the quarter and our wholesale partners was not as negative. So I think what we're saying now is we're seeing the reverse in the first quarter as our sell-in to those accounts in the first quarter was actually better than their sell-out. So part of that could be we shipped less in the fourth quarter last year. And so if you balance it on a -- 2 quarters put together, it may not be an impact at all. So I'll just caution you to look at the entire year when it's done and probably get more information from that. So our focus really is -- obviously, the market's in a very disruptive phase. We're seeing -- in our wholesale partners in the United States, we actually are seeing, as mentioned, their declining business there. Keep in mind also that first quarter is a relatively small part of the year. We still expect, and always have, is that 40% of the retail sales in watches happen in the fourth quarter. So -- but having said that, we're seeing declines in there and also there's a lot of disruption. Obviously, there's a new entrant in the market. We're not sure if there's some impact on the consumers' side to see what that new entrant's products look like, et cetera, but they have yet to be seen. So our mission is really -- we have a big share in the market and we've got a lot of initiatives in place to continue to grow the U.S. market and we're seeing strong -- we're seeing growth in FOSSIL and SKAGEN. We will have accelerated demand-creation activities as well as our omni-channel activities in the back half of this year that we think we can continue to grow those faster. We still, obviously, have -- Kate Spade is new to the market. Tory Burch started in the fourth quarter last year, so we got 3 quarters of the year to start that. Both those brands look like they have significant long-term potential. We also are looking at launching wearable technology in the back half of the year in the fourth quarter. We think that can add some fuel to the fire in the U.S. So we're being very aggressive in the U.S., and we think we have some initiatives in place to fuel growth."

Good question. What -- if you look at the last 5 years and how much the U.S. department store business especially has grown in watches, because we had been very disruptive, bringing in new brands to market at higher retails, more features and functions, more innovation and new ideas, and it really created quite a lot of growth at really high margins in the department stores. So we're kind of in a transition phase right now, where our objectives really are to continue to grow the existing businesses we have. We have a lot of new product initiatives in place that we think can fuel that. And we do have a lot of interest in wearable technology. We think we're in a situation where consumers are very, very interested in this convergence of fashion and technology. So our objective is to put some of this technology, which could be notifications, sensors, other types of activity, in our watches that could add value. And when you leverage across the large scale, large numbers of units that we have, we could be in a situation where we could add a lot of value to the products, with not a lot of expense and have another series of disruptive growth in our business and really change the market in the U.S. And that's really what we're working towards. We think it's quite a significant opportunity, and we're looking at it from that perspective. We do think that we have an opportunity to bring new ideas and compelling products that are tech-enhanced that millennials will embrace. And again, keep in mind that millennials largely have not been wearing watches because they grew up with cell phones and, obviously, they're very interested in technology. And we think it could be a long-term opportunity for us."

I think, if I'm reading the press release correctly, the new margin structure has the U.S. as the highest operating margin and Asia is the lowest. Correct me if I'm wrong, but can we just talk about, for a minute, why that is? I think the U.S. has the most stores, which was the lowest margin and also, it was previously the lowest wholesale margin. So I guess, any color you can provide there and maybe the right way to think about kind of a new geographic economics, the right way to think about the go-forward margin opportunity would be helpful."

I mean, the way you -- to try to understand the previous reporting structure to this one, before, you had all the inter-product company profits sitting in Asia. So now we've redistributed those to the actual underlying selling region. We've also been able better to differentiate some corporate costs that were sitting in the U.S. wholesale business. Now those are really corporate activity. So at the end of the day now, the -- and you see also the impact of taking the direct businesses and reallocating those to the underlying geographic region. So you've got -- the Asia region is the smallest of our regions. It's about 1/3 of the size of the overall U.S. or American business, with a fully developed infrastructure there that provides significant amount of opportunity for leverage over the long term, but it has to grow to ultimately fully absorb the cost of that infrastructure. So the margin structures are different in each of those businesses in Asia. You've got higher gross margins, but you also have a much heavier concentration of concessions, which carry a significant amount of expense as well. So again, we've realigned that. We've absorbed the direct businesses into those regional structures; aggregated the corporate costs, those costs that solely relate to central expenses, and reported it that way, with the biggest opportunity for margin gains as the fastest -- long-term fastest-growing region could be Asia as it fully absorbs all those fixed costs."

One of the things to keep in mind is the department stores are very interested in this because they perceive there to be consumer demand. But there's another issue here also, which is, if you look at the -- the watch business is about $65 billion globally, relatively a small industry, whereas, the tech industry, which includes smartphones, cell service, iPads, all the activity has gone to the technology world. The spending in there is huge. So just a small percentage of that spending and interest, when it comes in the watch business, it could have a huge impact on the watch business and make it much, much larger. A lot of that spending or most of it is not happening in the department store where our customers are. So our mission is really, in a disruptive way, to bring some of these technologies and ideas to the brands and enable us to add additional functionality at not a lot of cost could make the watch category more relevant and could bring a significant amount of sales into the channels that we sell to. And that's where we're working on, and we think it's a pretty big opportunity."

We just think we have a lot of ammunition. So having said that, I look at the first quarter and sales were down at the department stores. We're in a -- there's obviously a big new entrant into the category. We're not really sure exactly what impact that will have on the overall watch market. We do think that long term, as I mentioned, I think it's a net plus for us and could be a significant advantage for us. But we're looking at the entire market and how can we gain share. And the Chaps opportunity I think, is one where, if you look at the market, the watch market globally, over the last several years, as we've put more feature function, more innovation, we've raised the average in retail across all our brands from Fossil all the way up. And we do have a sense that there -- it's created because we've elevated our price points so that there's -- created some white space below most of our brands in a more valued way. So there is some distribution we sell to in the U.S. And globally, that has been disadvantaged because they don't have access to all those brands that they've been disadvantaged, and there's a pretty big opportunity. If you look at the value channel and if you look at their watch business, they're very under-penetrated compared to stores that are -- modern department stores and above, just because they don't have access to brands. So part of this Chaps opportunity is for us to bring energy, design, innovation and branding to stores that may not have the potential to get other brands. And it could be a pretty big opportunity for us to round out our portfolio and to give us additional market share. So that's what that's about. But we're, in general, just being very aggressive with the U.S. the market. We continue to believe that we can make it bigger and grow all our brands and take share over time. And we do expect that the expectations are still that the market will grow over the next 5 years. We've seen indications from [indiscernible] it's going to grow single digits. That's before the wearable technology entrants are in there. So we're not sure exactly what the market's going to do, except that we're going to be very aggressive and go after it."

Dennis Secor, our Chief Financial Officer, is also joining us today. We will begin with our prepared remarks and then open the call to answer any questions.
We are pleased to report first quarter results today that give us the belief that we are on track to achieve our goals for the year. We continue to enjoy both the operational and strategic benefits of our diversified business model. Once again, our global operating platform and powerful brand served us well, leading the first quarter net sales and overall performance that were in line with our expectations.
Looking at the business operationally during the quarter, we continued our leadership in watches, which led our performance. We grew our own brands with both FOSSIL and SKAGEN posting solid increases, especially in watches, and we increased our business and our licensed portfolio. We grew across all of our regions and continued to expand internationally with the strong performance in Europe. We delivered positive comps in our retail stores, and we continue to invest to drive our future growth while returning capital to our shareholders. While there are pockets of our business that remain challenging, we're off to a good start and remain focused on delivering both our near- and longer-term objectives. We have spent several decades developing competitive advantage that have us positioned to take advantage of the growing global watch market and accessories markets. Our expertise in design and creativity, combined with our operational competencies, including our supply chain and global distribution capabilities, enable us to partner with the best brands in the world and help each of them reach their full potential, growing our global footprint in watches and fashion accessories.
We are focused on preserving our business in developed markets and replicating that great success in newer markets where our potential to gain market share is substantial. We have built a strong and scalable operating platform, capable of leveraging our great strengths in design, manufacturing and distribution. 
In the first quarter, we made progress on the key areas of strategic focus for us that we outlined on our Investor Day in March. As we shared on that day, we feel very strongly about the company's future and our ability to extend our leadership position in the growing watch and accessories markets. Growing our own brands, FOSSIL and SKAGEN, enhancing our digital capabilities and bringing to market compelling connected accessories are all critical elements of the strategy, and we advanced our cause in the quarter.
For the FOSSIL brand, in like-for-like currencies in the calendar, we grew the brand 6% for the quarter, with increases in all of our regions and solid growth in watches and leathers. While we are still not yet where we want to be with the brand, we're seeing encouraging sell-out trends in our American wholesale business in both these categories and strong acceleration in Asia, where we believe we are gaining traction in building brand awareness.
We continue to focus our efforts in marketing to build awareness to ignite the FOSSIL brand, and while it's still early, we remain encouraged by the results, including delivering positive comps across our global fleet of retail stores. We are continuing to build our analytic capabilities to help focus our investments in the brand to drive stronger returns both for this year and beyond.
For SKAGEN, the progress we are making is very encouraging. Like-for-like SKAGEN sales increased more than 20%, with solid double-digit increases in all regions. Watch performance led the business and we're also seeing positive responses to both leathers and jewelry. We continue to see great potential with SKAGEN as we further develop the brand and expand the distribution globally.
In digital, our goal is to build world-class capabilities over the next 2 years. To remain competitive and relevant, we have to enhance our digital experience, creating a better connection with our customers and evolving to meet the needs of today's consumers. In the quarter, we made excellent progress in extending our social presence and improving our CRM capabilities to communicate with customers in a more targeted way. Our goal for the year is to further enhance the customer experience with a redesigned website optimized for mobile and a rollout of tablet devices to all of our full-priced stores in the United States in order to support sales and our CRM efforts. We're also investing in key foundational components like order management and point-of-sale systems to further extend our omni-channel capabilities.
When it comes to connected accessories, we feel very strongly about both our progress and our prospects to be a strong catalyst for growth in the category. There's a lot of consumer interest in the space and a wide diversity of perspectives on the role that smart watches and other connected accessories will play in the market. With our partnerships with Google and Intel, coupled with our ability to create fashion at scale, we believe we have a significant opportunity as the convergence of fashion and technology enables us to bring compelling tech-enhanced accessories to the consumer. We continue to make progress, and we look forward to launching later this year with FOSSIL products in stores for holiday 2015.
At the core of our objectives is to leverage what we do best and to extend our leadership position in watches. With our strategic advantages in design, production and distribution,  our objective is to gain share in the global watch market. In February, we added Kate Spade New York to our portfolio and began shipping the products in March. This is an emerging brand with global appeal, and we are looking forward to further developing the products and the distribution over the next few years. 
Additionally, last month, we partnered with the Ralph Lauren Corporation to develop watches under the Chaps label that will further enhance our portfolio. The Chaps label complements our multi-brand portfolio with opportunities for new price points and distribution channels. We look forward to leveraging our competitive advantages to help expand the brand's global footprint.
We're working with all of our brands to help them achieve their full potential and drive global growth by leveraging our operating platform and competitive strengths. During the first quarter, on a like-for-like basis, our multi-brand watch portfolio grew 3%, with the strongest growth in Europe. We believe our international markets represent a great opportunity to gain share and to benefit from global category growth. We saw growth across Michael Kors, Armani, Diesel and continue to benefit from the launch of newer brands like Tory Burch. 
Looking at our results regionally, we continued to benefit from a diversified geographic model, with each of our regions growing on a like-for-like basis during the quarter. This includes the Americas where we grew by 3%, a sequential improvement from last year's fourth quarter. Our retail business continues to improve with positive comps across the fleet. While wholesale sell-in increase U.S. department store sell-out trends were mixed, with some brands accelerating, while others have not been as strong. There's a lot of this disruption in this market right now with new entrants and existing brands that are maturing. 
While we do see growth from other markets like Latin America, our focus is on our U.S. wholesale business is to protect the significant share that we have built over the years. Europe continued to be strong for us, with a 9% increase with solid performances in our larger markets such as Germany and the United Kingdom. We continue to see white-space opportunities to grow in new markets and to add more of our brands to our existing distribution. 
In Asia, sales grew by 4%, and while we experienced stronger performances in markets such as Japan, Australia and India, we are working hard to address opportunities to ignite growth across the region. Our infrastructure investments are largely in place and now we are focusing our resources on increasing brand awareness and adding distribution to advance all of our brands in the region. While the Asian watch market is the largest and fastest-growing globally, it remains dominated by traditional watch brands and higher price points. We remain confident that as the middle class emerges in key markets like China, we are well positioned to benefit from the same market dynamics that helped drive our significant share gains in the United States.
So with the first quarter behind us, we feel we're on track. We remain confident in our strategies and are focused on building our brands, developing digital and advancing our connected accessories in an advantaged way. We're restructuring our operating model and shifting our investments away from infrastructure towards direct growth-driving initiatives. And while there are challenges, especially in the near term, we are very excited about the long term. We operate a very diverse business model with many levers of growth. Our operating model gives us opportunities for leverage and efficiencies to drive growth, and our strong financial position gives us access to the fuel that we need to drive our business and to deliver solid returns.
We continue to expect that 2015 will be another year of progress towards our overarching objective, which is to deliver sustained growth and solid returns for our shareholders over the long term. 
And now I'll turn it over to Dennis for more comments."
317037,292146320,804634,"Fossil Group, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Fossil Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kosta. Good afternoon, everybody. Before I get into the numbers, let me first address our reporting segments. Over the last couple of years, we've realigned our operating structure. Strategic and brand direction are sent centrally and regional man",2787,"Thanks, Kosta. Good afternoon, everybody. Before I get into the numbers, let me first address our reporting segments. Over the last couple of years, we've realigned our operating structure. Strategic and brand direction are sent centrally and regional management is now fully empowered and responsible to drive those strategies in brand directions across all brands and channels within their regions. In the past, our regional teams managed just their wholesale businesses, while the retail business was managed globally. We feel the current structure will be far more effective in developing our business, particularly as consumer shopping habits continue to evolve.
In addition, in our prior reporting, intercompany profits from factory operations were reported based on their region of production, which is primarily Asia, rather than in the region where the products were sold. With the implementation of our new reporting systems, we are now able to extract discrete financial information that aligns with our operating structure and is more consistent with how we evaluate our business performance. 
In our earnings release, you will find a table with 2014 results restated under the new segments, including operating margins across our 3 regions reflective of all channels of distribution. Costs that support company-wide rather than region-specific activities, such as brand management, design, global marketing expenses, among many others, are reported within corporate cost, independent of where those expenses are actually incurred. With that, let me now address our performance.
There are several factors that will make understanding our performance relative to both last year and our expectations challenging: currency headwinds, last year's extra week and the timing of expenditures. As we go through this report, I will isolate these factors, recognizing that this is not a precise science, particularly the impact of the extra week. 
The headline for our total first quarter performance is that both sales and earnings per share came in generally in the middle of our range of expectations. Against those expectations, further currency headwinds pulled our sales numbers down, while net expense deferrals increased our earnings. 
On a like-for-like currency and calendar basis, first quarter net sales increased 5%. On a reported basis, sales declined 7% to $725 million, with stronger currency headwinds than we expected and last year's extra week representing a 5.5 point headwind.
For the quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $0.75 compared to $1.22 last year. This quarter's EPS benefited by roughly $0.12 versus expectations, as some planned marketing, fixturing and display costs moved later in the year while some restructuring activity was completed earlier. Against last year's EPS, this quarter's result was negatively impacted by roughly $0.13 due to currencies and another $0.16 due to our restructuring charges. While like-for-like sales growth and a lower share count favorably impacted the year-over-year comparison, these were more than offset by higher marketing expenses, even considering the deferral I just mentioned as well as the impact of store and infrastructure investments made late last year that we have yet to anniversary. The EPS impact of last year's extra week was minimal.
Like-for-like FOSSIL brand sales increased about 6%. Solid growth in watches and leather has more than offset the decline in jewelry. The business increased in all 3 regions, and we continue to be encouraged by leathers, where women's handbags delivered solid comp in our retail stores.
Like-for-like SKAGEN sales grew 24% with 20-plus percent growth in all 3 regions. Strong double-digit watch growth drove the business with solid increases from our newer and smaller leathers and jewelry businesses. Like-for-like sales growth from our multibrand watch portfolio was about 3% with the strongest performance from Europe.
In the Americas, reported sales decreased 4% to $367 million, while like-for-like sales increased about 3%. The growth was driven by strong gains in branded jewelry, especially Michael Kors jewelry as well as a modest increase in our leathers business as the watch business was roughly flat. 
Like-for-like sales for the FOSSIL, SKAGEN and Michael Kors brand increased in the quarter. The increase was driven mainly by our retail stores, where comp store sales increased modestly, with conversion improving due to compelling promotions in the outlet channel. Traffic in our American stores remained down. Like-for-like wholesale sales increased slightly, as international increases offset declines in off-price selling and U.S. department store sell-in. Sell-out data from our department store partners, where we have planned the business down this year, did show a decline from the consistent quarterly trends from last year. Sell-out in watches continued to improve sequentially for both FOSSIL and SKAGEN while Michael Kors declined. We continue to drive increases in our own e-commerce business, and our wholesale partners tell us that they are seeing strong sell-out increases on their own sites as well.
In Europe, reported sales decreased 10% to $234 million, while like-for-like sales increased 9%. Continued expansion of our watch business drove the growth, while jewelry, still a smaller business, increased sharply with a very strong growth rate. Our leathers business also posted a modest increase. 
We continued to see strong performances in very established markets like Germany, France and the U.K., which delivered the strongest increases in the quarter. Both FOSSIL and SKAGEN expanded in the quarter with particular strength in watches. Within the licensed portfolio, Michael Kors, Armani and Diesel increased while DKNY was weaker. Comp store sales increased modestly in the region with increases in both our full price and outlet stores. 
Our reported Asia sales decreased 7% to $124 million, and on a like-for-like basis, they increased 4%. Watches, leathers and jewelry all grew in the quarter. Japan, Australia and India were our strongest performing markets, while we continue to see weakness in South Korea, and our distributor business was down. FOSSIL was our strongest performing brand and Michael Kors increased as did SKAGEN. Each of these 3 brands posted solid double-digit gains. Our business with the Armani brand declined in the quarter. Comp store sales decreased modestly in the region with the strongest performance coming from the outlet channel. Like-for-like concession sales increased during the quarter, driven by new doors, while concession comps overall were down. 
In the quarter, gross profit decreased to $401 million and gross margin declined 180 basis points to 55.3%. The decrease was primarily driven by the headwinds resulting from the strong U.S. dollar. Aside from that, favorable regional distribution mix, along with these favorable impact from the initial price increases we took late last year, roughly offset the impact of promotions where we adjusted our strategy later last year mainly with Watch Station outlets here in the United States. 
In the quarter, operating expenses increased 2% to $345 million, which includes a $12 million restructuring charge to optimize our store fleet and our operating structure. Operationally, our expense increases were focused on marketing and brand-building activities. Expenses were also impacted by this year's earlier Basel fair as well as by the store and infrastructure investments made early last year, which we had not yet anniversaried. With last year's pivot away from store and infrastructure investments, we expect these headwinds will abate as we move through the balance of this year. These areas of expense growth were partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currencies, last year's extra week and a reduction in corporate back-office expenses. 
First quarter operating expenses were lower than we had initially planned as some advertising investments, along with the deployment of fixturing and displays, were moved later in the year. We also completed the closure of 1 store earlier than planned, which increased the quarter's restructuring charge. Our operating expense rate was 47.5% compared to 43.6% last year, due principally to the factors I just described, other than currencies, which don't significantly affect the overall expense rate.
Operating income decreased to $56 million, including a $16 million unfavorable currency impact. Operating margin decreased to 7.7% compared to 13.5% last year due mainly to the impact of the restructuring charges, operating expense increases and currencies. Restructuring charges created a 170 basis point headwind on operating margin, and the impact of currencies was 150 basis points. 
Interest expense increased slightly to $4 million given our higher debt levels. First quarter other income, which principally relates to foreign currency contracts and balances for the quarter was $7 million, higher than we had expected, given the further strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
Our effective income tax rate for the first quarter was 31.3% similar to last year's first quarter, and we are planning the full year at about 31%. So first quarter net income decreased $28 million, as like-for-like sales growth was offset by operating expense increases, restructuring charges and the impact of currencies.
Now turning to our cash flows and balance sheet. For the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $86 million versus $97 million a year ago. We drew down a net $13 million on our revolver. We invested $17 million in capital expenditures and $115 million to repurchase 1.3 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $88. We ended the quarter with $944 million remaining on our repurchase authorizations. 
We ended the quarter with $237 million in cash and $645 million in debt. First quarter ending inventory totaled $631 million, a 5% increase over last year. In constant dollars, the growth rate was roughly 14%. Accounts receivable decreased by 8% to $266 million, and wholesale DSOs improved by roughly 5 days. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $22 million for the quarter.
Moving now to our outlook. First, to restate our earlier message. With the first quarter results generally in line with our expectations, other than the timing of our marketing investments, our annual operational outlook remains largely unchanged as do our strategies. We continue to expect to generate leverage from our operating structure and use that capacity to invest in our long-term growth. Our priorities remain unchanged: to invest in our own brands, FOSSIL and SKAGEN; to invest in building our digital platform and enhancing the online experience of our customers; to invest in connected accessories and leverage the partnerships that we are building to bring fashion to the space; and of course, to use and optimize our portfolio of lifestyle brands to extend our leadership position in the growing global watch market.
As we said before, nearer-term challenges remain. Newcomers are entering our market, and managing the natural ebbs and flows of brands in the life cycle is an imperfect science. Consumer shopping behaviors are changing at an unprecedented rate, and we continue to be cautious in the United States. This is our most developed market, and we are actively engaged in protecting our position, seeking new opportunities for growth and working to replicate our great success here in international markets. 
With these near-term challenges, we see even greater longer-term opportunities. Kate Spade New York brings another of the world's hottest fashion brands into our portfolio and it can be a powerful weapon to preserve and gain share. We are well positioned to take advantage of favorable market demographics to expand the penetration of fashion brands in growing international markets. Our research supports significant growth opportunities for both FOSSIL and SKAGEN, and we are focusing more target investments to support this. There are both near- and longer-term opportunities to leverage our full brand portfolio to grow in our well-developed global distribution, and we see levers such as price to drive top line growth. We're seeing success with our initial price adjustments and are implementing more that we'll roll out later in the year.
The only significant change to our outlook for this year relates to foreign currencies. While the U.S. dollar strengthened further in the quarter, it has weakened significantly in the last couple of weeks. And we are updating our outlook to reflect that volatility using a range that roughly aligns with our initial 2015 guidance rate on the high side and more current prevailing rates on the low side. 
So with respect to sales, we continued to expect full year sales growth in the range between 3% and 7%. This excludes the impact of last year's extra week, a roughly 1.25 point headwind as well as currency headwinds, which, based on our assumptions, would range between 5 points and 6 points. We see opportunities for current sales trends to improve modestly in the middle quarters as we benefit from the addition of Kate Spade to our portfolio. 
We expect the bigger opportunity for a more accelerated growth rate in the fourth quarter as we anniversary last year's performance and also benefit from the step-up in marketing investments, which are targeted for the second half of the year to support the most important selling seasons.
For the second quarter, we expect constant dollar sales growth in the range of 4% to 6%. We expect currency headwinds on sales will be most severe in the second quarter, roughly 6.5 to 7 full points, begin to lessen in the third quarter and diminish even more in the fourth quarter, though certainly still significant. Based on these assumptions, for the full year, we now expect reported GAAP sales in the range between a 1% increase and a 4% decrease, and for second quarter reported GAAP sales to decline between 0.5% and 3%.
With respect to gross margins, excluding the impact of currencies, we continue to anticipate gross margin expansion, driven by continued favorable international mix, along with our pricing and margin-enhancement initiatives. We expect the greatest opportunity for expansion will come in the second half of the year, when more of our pricing changes will be implemented and as we anniversary last year's handbag liquidation and the outlet promotion strategy, which we implemented later last year. 
Based on our currency assumptions, the currency headwind on gross margins, which we estimate in the range between 2.5 and 3 full points, should generally follow the same pattern -- quarterly pattern of sales, though roughly 1 quarter delayed, as currencies first impact inventories and only affect margins once products are sold. So we would expect the third quarter to absorb the greatest gross margin decline. We also expect that the offsetting nonoperating gains related to our foreign currencies contracts should roughly mirror the currency impact on gross margins, but will also be impacted by the underlying sales volume, which is highest in the fourth quarter.
Regarding expenses, with the first quarter now behind us, and given our sales expectations, we continue to expect to generate leverage from our overall infrastructure and store expense base, including some initial benefits from our restructuring efforts. We expect the total annual expense rate to increase year-over-year, given the additional $35 million or $0.50 per share that we plan to invest this year to support our marketing and brand-awareness activities, our digital strategy and to develop connected accessories. The concentration of these investments will occur during the second half of the year to support the key selling season. We expect to incur about $8 million or roughly $0.11 per share of this year's $25 million in restructuring charges in the second quarter as we enhance our operating structure. Given these factors, along with this year earlier Basel fair, which already impacted the first quarter, we are expecting our overall second quarter expense rate to decline slightly. Given these assumptions, we continue to expect full year adjusted operating margins, excluding both the impacts of currencies and the restructuring charge, in a range that is roughly flat to down 80 basis points. 
Including our currency assumptions, we now expect full year reported GAAP operating margins in the range between 11.5% and 13%. For the second quarter, we expect reported GAAP operating margin in the range between 8% and 9% and adjusted operating margin in the range between 11.5% and 12.5%.
Given all these factors, along with continued share repurchases, we continue to expect reported GAAP full year earnings per share at $6.05 on the high side, and given our updated currency assumptions, at $5.25 on the low side. This includes a net unfavorable currency impact between $1.20 and $1.40 per share and a $0.35 impact related to restructuring charges. On a constant dollar basis, excluding restructuring charges, adjusted EPS would be in the range between $7 and $7.60.
For the second quarter, we expect reported GAAP earnings per share in the range between $0.80 and $0.91. This includes a net unfavorable currency impact of about $0.27 and $0.11 related to restructuring charges. We now expect capital expenditures between $110 million and $120 million. Our plan is to support fewer openings of stores and a shift toward investments to build our digital and CRM capabilities as well as incremental shop-in-shops.

Having said that, we mentioned about fourth quarter last year that our shipments to stores were not -- they were negative and our retail sell-out during the quarter and our wholesale partners was not as negative. So I think what we're saying now is we're seeing the reverse in the first quarter as our sell-in to those accounts in the first quarter was actually better than their sell-out. So part of that could be we shipped less in the fourth quarter last year. And so if you balance it on a -- 2 quarters put together, it may not be an impact at all. So I'll just caution you to look at the entire year when it's done and probably get more information from that. So our focus really is -- obviously, the market's in a very disruptive phase. We're seeing -- in our wholesale partners in the United States, we actually are seeing, as mentioned, their declining business there. Keep in mind also that first quarter is a relatively small part of the year. We still expect, and always have, is that 40% of the retail sales in watches happen in the fourth quarter. So -- but having said that, we're seeing declines in there and also there's a lot of disruption. Obviously, there's a new entrant in the market. We're not sure if there's some impact on the consumers' side to see what that new entrant's products look like, et cetera, but they have yet to be seen. So our mission is really -- we have a big share in the market and we've got a lot of initiatives in place to continue to grow the U.S. market and we're seeing strong -- we're seeing growth in FOSSIL and SKAGEN. We will have accelerated demand-creation activities as well as our omni-channel activities in the back half of this year that we think we can continue to grow those faster. We still, obviously, have -- Kate Spade is new to the market. Tory Burch started in the fourth quarter last year, so we got 3/4 of the year to start that. Both those brands look like they have significant long-term potential. We also are looking at launching wearable technology in the back half of the year in the fourth quarter. We think that can add some fuel to the fire in the U.S. So we're being very aggressive in the U.S., and we think we have some initiatives in place to fuel growth."

Good question. What -- if you look at the last 5 years and how much the U.S. department store business especially has grown in watches, because we had been very disruptive, bringing in new brands to market at higher retails, more features and functions, more innovation and new ideas, and it really created quite a lot of growth at really high margins in the department stores. So we're kind of in a transition phase right now, where our objectives really are to continue to grow the existing businesses we have. We have a lot of new product initiatives in place that we think can fuel that. And we do have a lot of interest in wearable technology. We think we're in a situation where consumers are very, very interested in this convergence of fashion and technology. So our objective is to put some of this technology, which could be notifications, sensors, other types of activity, in our watches that could add value. And when you leverage across the large scale, large numbers of units that we have, we could be in a situation where we could add a lot of value to the products, with not a lot of expense and have another series of disruptive growth in our business and really change the market in the U.S. And that's really what we're working towards. We think it's quite a significant opportunity, and we're looking at it from that perspective. We do think that we have an opportunity to bring new ideas and compelling products that are tech-enhanced that millennials will embrace. And again, keep in mind that millennials largely have not been wearing watches because they grew up with cell phones and, obviously, they're very interested in technology. And we think it could be a long-term opportunity for us."

Now those are really corporate activity. So at the end of the day now, the -- and you see also the impact of taking the direct businesses and reallocating those to the underlying geographic region. So you've got -- the Asia region is the smallest of our regions. It's about 1/3 of the size of the overall U.S. or American business, with a fully developed infrastructure there that provides significant amount of opportunity for leverage over the long term, but it has to grow to ultimately fully absorb the cost of that infrastructure. So the margin structures are different in each of those businesses in Asia. You've got higher gross margins, but you also have a much heavier concentration of concessions, which carry a significant amount of expense as well. So again, we've realigned that. We've absorbed the direct businesses into those regional structures; aggregated the corporate costs, those costs that solely relate to central expenses, and reported it that way, with the biggest opportunity for margin gains as the fastest -- long-term fastest-growing region could be Asia as it fully absorbs all those fixed costs."

One of the things to keep in mind is the department stores are very interested in this because they perceive there to be consumer demand. But there's another issue here also, which is, if you look at the -- the watch business is about $65 billion globally, relatively a small industry, whereas, the tech industry, which includes smartphones, cell service, iPads, all the activity has gone to the technology world. The spending in there is huge. So just a small percentage of that spending and interest, when it comes in the watch business, it could have a huge impact on the watch business and make it much, much larger. A lot of that spending or most of it is not happening in the department store where our customers are. So our mission is really, in a disruptive way, to bring some of these technologies and ideas to the brands and enable us to add additional functionality at not a lot of cost could make the watch category more relevant and could bring a significant amount of sales into the channels that we sell to.

We just think we have a lot of ammunition. So having said that, I look at the first quarter and sales were down at the department stores. We're in a -- there's obviously a big new entrant into the category. We're not really sure exactly what impact that will have on the overall watch market. We do think that long term, as I mentioned, I think it's a net plus for us and could be a significant advantage for us. But we're looking at the entire market and how can we gain share. And the Chaps opportunity I think, is one where, if you look at the market, the watch market globally, over the last several years, as we've put more feature function, more innovation, we've raised the average unit retail across all our brands from Fossil all the way up. And we do have a sense that there -- it's created because we've elevated all our price points so that there's -- created some white space below most of our brands in a more valued way. So there is some distribution we sell to in the U.S. and globally that has been disadvantaged because they don't have access to all those brands that they've been disadvantaged, and there's a pretty big opportunity. If you look at the value channel and if you look at their watch business, they're very under-penetrated compared to stores that are -- modern department stores and above, just because they don't have access to brands. So part of this Chaps opportunity is for us to bring energy, design, innovation and branding to stores that may not have the potential to get other brands. And it could be a pretty big opportunity for us to round out our portfolio and to give us additional market share. So that's what that's about. But we're, in general, just being very aggressive with the U.S. the market. We continue to believe that we can make it bigger and grow all our brands and take share over time. And we do expect that the expectations are still that the market will grow over the next 5 years. We've seen indications from mirror monitors [ph] it's going to grow single digits. That's before the wearable technology entrants are in there. So we're not sure exactly what the market's going to do, except that we're going to be very aggressive and go after it."

For the second quarter, we delivered sales growth across all regions and earnings per share growth ahead of our expectations. From a top line perspective, our FOSSIL and SKAGEN brands drove the increase, and we also benefited from our recent addition of newer brands. Across all of our brands and categories, leathers and jewelry increased compared to last year, while watches were flat. 
Overall, there's a lot happening in our market right now. On the one hand, we are encouraged with the early reads on our own brand investments and expect to see continued improvements that [indiscernible] even more in the second half of the year. We continue to leverage our strategic advantages to partner with the best fashion brands and companies in the world. On the other hand, we are adjusting to changing consumer shopping patterns and preferences as well as the natural progression of brands in their life cycles. We also see technology emerging at the latest trend in fashion, with the growing interest in wearable technology inspiring new entrants into the watch space. We believe our key competitive advantage in design, sourcing distribution, as well as the great brands in our portfolio, have us well positioned to capitalize on the evolving landscape. 
Our anticipated launch of connected accessories later this year has the potential to energize the accessories category, given the innovation we are bringing to market and the strong consumer interest in the category. We operate a resilient and diversified model that benefits from scale, diversification and financial strength and positions us well to win in the long term. The second quarter proved to be an example of this. Despite difficult economic conditions in some of our key markets as well as strong currency headwinds, we generated solid results and earnings per share that exceeded our expectations, aided by ongoing efforts to leverage our base infrastructure as well as our share repurchase activity. 
Turning to our key highlights for the quarter. We grew across all of our major geographies, the Americas, Europe and Asia. We grew our own brands, with both FOSSIL and SKAGEN delivering solid growth led by watches. We delivered positive comps in our retail stores, and we continued to invest in initiatives that we believe can fuel our future growth while using our strong financial position to repurchase over $100 million of our stock for the benefit of our shareholders. 
For FOSSIL, the brand grew 6% in constant currency, with increases in all of our regions and solid growth in both watches and leathers. Across geographies, FOSSIL saw the strongest gains in Asia followed by the Americas and Europe. Globally, our retail stores continued to deliver positive comps led by the Americas region, and the brand saw very strong growth in the e-commerce channel. Overall, it was a solid quarter for the brand. We expect to build upon our momentum as we further invest to drive brand awareness and sharpen our analytic capabilities to measure returns on these investments to ensure we are directing our resources to areas that generate strong returns. 
In our retail channel, comp store sales increased 2%, with positive comps in our core category, watches, as well as leathers, where recent investments in the category including our design capabilities are driving positive changes in the assortment. 
For SKAGEN, the progress we continue to make with the brand is very encouraging. Constant currency sales increased over 20% with solid double-digit increases in all regions. Watches led the performance and we are also seeing positive responses to both leathers and jewelry. We continue to see great potential with SKAGEN through expanded global distribution, fueled by excitement around its unique positioning in design. 
As we continue our journey to become world-class in our digital capabilities, we made progress in advancing our CRM initiatives our omni-channel capabilities and our digital experiences for our customers, all things that position us to engage customers in this very disruptive environment. We look forward to relaunching the FOSSIL brand website with improved mobile functionality later this quarter. 
We are excited to launch the upgraded side [indiscernible] holiday, which will provide an enhanced customer experience and introduce rich brand content, positioning us to drive sales and further build interest in the FOSSIL brand. This quarter, we also made significant progress in developing connected accessories. This is a category we are increasingly excited about given the significant consumer interest in the space. We remain on track to launch our first product under the FOSSIL brand in the fall. We are finalizing our plans for distribution, which will include our FOSSIL stores and select wholesale distribution and are very pleased with the functionality and the design of the product. While these are only the first generation of products, we are excited to enter the space and learn from the initial assortment. We will incorporate our learnings in the next generation of products as well as introduce new products under additional brands in 2016. We continue to leverage our partnerships with technology leaders as we look to scale technology across our platform of products and brands. We believe this will add heat to our categories and drive increases in awareness in sales. 
Turning to our multibrand watch portfolio. As you know, our objective is to leverage what we do best, exercise our strategic advantages in design and production and distribution to gain share in the global watch market and extend our leadership position. While we believe that we have the most desirable fashion brands in our portfolio, we know that all brands evolve through life cycles over time and we are experiencing that with our own brand strengthening while other brands in the portfolio are not growing as fast. During the second quarter, our multibrand watch portfolio was flat to last year, a disappointing performance for the quarter, as growth in the Americas was offset by slight declines in Europe and Asia compared to last year. In our international markets, we believe Europe and Asia represent a significant opportunity to gain share, particularly given that we are underpenetrated in many markets around the world. Specific to the second quarter, however, we feel our growth was impacted by unique market-specific conditions that we believe will move in our favor over time. 
In Europe, while our business did grow in constant dollars, we saw some softness in parts of our business. This was especially true over U.K. where performance was also impacted by accelerated Q2 shipments last year as we transitioned the warehouse there. Our business in Germany was not as strong as we expected, while we did see some strong double-digit growth in France. In Asia, our business grew but did not meet our expectations. The mers operate in South Korea and the economic downturns affecting Hong Kong and Macau are putting pressure on our near-term results. China continues to be tough with economic and political and distribution challenges there, making it difficult to drive near-term growth. On a positive note, markets like Japan, Australia and India continue to grow, with India posting strong double-digit growth in the quarter. 
We don't believe the quarter's performance is indicative of the true potential of the international business and continue to believe the market share opportunity available to us in the regions is very meaningful. We believe we are poised to succeed in our international markets at the same market dynamics that help drive our significant share gains in the United States to play out across the globe. We continue to have opportunities to drive brand through our just existing distribution in Europe as well as expand in new markets in there. And in Asia, where we feel market demographics was in our favor, we are well positioned to take advantage of fashion brands emerging to take share from traditional watch brands. 
As we enter the year, we identified several disruptive factors that are going to make 2015 challenging. We expect the visibility will be difficult, with new entrants moving to our market. While we feel this will energize the category in the long term as we add technology to our products, the near-term implications seem to be playing out. Also, the natural ebbs and flows of brands in their life cycles can create volatility and sales patterns as consumer preferences evolve around the globe. Teh currencies have put a significant strain on our near-term results. With that in mind, we remain focused on pursuing the investments that we believe are most critical to our long-term success. 
As a company with significant competitive advantages, we are moving quickly with changes in our business. We are ramping up innovation across the board in design, technology and marketing. We believe our competitive position and a strong balance sheet are even more advantageous in a challenging economic and currency environment as we have the financial flexibility to invest in innovation and our growth initiatives to increase our global watch and accessories market share. We remain intently focused on executing to the key objective that we believe position us to accelerate sales growth and we have already seen traction from the initiatives we are embarking on to drive toward our objectives. 
First, we're investing in our own brands, FOSSIL and SKAGEN, which have already delivered solid first half growth. We're making additional investments in the second half, and we expect to see even stronger results later this year. Second, we're well on our way to enhancing our digital capabilities including omni-channel, retail and then e-commerce. We've taken big strides in developing a robust platform and have already seen the sharp uptick in online sales for the first half. And finally, connected accessories. We are leveraging the significant partnerships that we've built and are on track with products that will hit our stores in the fall. We think this will be an important driver in the years ahead. 
At the same time, we continued to see significant potential to expand our watch portfolio sales, with long-standing brands as well as the benefit of new brands including Tory Burch, Kate Spade New York and Chaps in 2016. We expect continued expansion in the other categories we offer such as in leathers and jewelry and soon to be connected accessories. We also still have significant growth ahead of us internationally, with Asia representing our biggest opportunity by far. While we recognize that pockets of our business are challenging and may remain so in the short term, overall, we remain excited about the many strategic initiatives we are implementing through the remainder of the year and our potential to ignite future growth. 
The world is changing quickly, and so are we, positioning the company for long-term sustainable growth in an evolving environment. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Dennis for more comments."

Second quarter net sales increased 2% in constant dollars and, on a reported basis, declined 4% to $740 million.

Second quarter net sales increased 2% in constant dollars and, on a reported basis, declined 4% to $740 million. While we delivered constant dollar increases across all regions, sales came in below our expectations as both Europe and Asia grew at a lower rate than we anticipated. For the quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $1.12 compared to $0.98 last year. This quarter's EPS benefited by roughly $0.09 of nonoperatings gains, $0.04 from a lower tax rate related to second quarter audits and a net $0.05 related to financing activities. 
Compared to EPS in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, this quarter's results was negatively impacted by roughly $0.30 due to currency and another $0.10 due to our restructuring charges. Constant currency sales growth had a lower share count combined with nonoperating gains to drive the year-over-year comparison. Overall, operating expenses decreased compared to last year, primarily driven by changes in foreign currencies. In constant dollars and excluding restructuring costs, expenses were flat to last year despite the impact of new store additions from last year that we had yet to anniversary. 
Before I get into second quarter details, let me share some insight on our first half performance as our reported results tend to obscure what we consider our core earnings per share. Thus far, in 2015, our reported results have absorbed $0.43 of currency headwinds and $0.27 of restructuring charges. We've also benefited $0.09 from the tax and financing activity I just mentioned. Factoring out those items, we delivered first half core EPS that is nearly 13% higher than the comparable period last year. 
Now specific to the second quarter, FOSSIL sales increased 6% in constant dollars. Solid growth in watches and leathers more than offset the decline in jewelry. Sales for the brand increase in all 3 regions with Asia delivering a midteen increase. While still a relatively small part of the business for the brand, the e-commerce channel drove solid double-digit increases with higher traffic and improved conversion rates, early indications that we feel tell us our demand creation initiatives are working. 
SKAGEN sales grew 21% in constant dollars with growth in all 3 regions including 20-plus percent growth in Europe and the Americas. Strong double-digit watch growth drove the business with solid increases in leathers and jewelry as well. E-commerce sales for SKAGEN also increased nicely, driven by higher traffic. 
In constant dollars, our multibrand watch portfolio was flat to last year, with increases in the Americas offsetting decline in our international regions. In the Americas, reported sales increased 1% to $386 million, a 3% constant dollar increase, which aligns with our first quarter trend. The increase was driven by growth across all 3 categories, with watches and leathers driving the volume and jewelry increasing in the midteens as the Michael Kors brand drove the category. Across brands, constant dollar sales for the FOSSIL, SKAGEN and Armani brands increased in the quarter, and we benefited from the addition of Kate Spade New York. Michael Kors brand sales declined slightly as very strong jewelry growth nearly offset lower sales in watches. The overall regional sales increase was driven by our retail stores, which delivered a solid positive comp, propelled by improved conversion resulting from compelling promotions in our outlet. Traffic was down again in the region. We continue to drive a significant increase in our e-commerce business across all of our websites and posted a solid double-digit gain in the quarter. 
Constant dollar wholesale sales were flat to last year, with international increases offsetting declines in the United States. The U.S. department store business, where we have planned the business down this year, continued to be soft. While this is likely to continue, we also expect that growth from our direct business can drive overall growth in this region. 
In Europe, reported sales decreased 12% to $228 million, while constant dollar sales increased to 2%. Growth in jewelry and leathers offset a slight decline in watches. Growth in the region was softer than expected, particularly in watches, with overall sales in major markets such as Germany roughly flat and Italy and the U.K. down to last year. The performance in the U.K. was at least partially attributable to a strong performance in the second quarter of last year, when some orders were shipped early ahead of the warehouse transition. Brands drove the slight increase for the region during the quarter. 
Both FOSSIL and SKAGEN grew during the quarter, with notable strength in watches, and the Michael Kors brand grew in the quarter, driven by strong jewelry sales along with watch growth in boutiques. Within the portfolio, nearly all of the licensed brands posted slight declines for the quarter. In the region, our sales growth was driven by our retail channels, where comp store sales increased slightly driven by our outlet stores. 
In Asia, reported sales decreased 6% to $126 million, while constant dollar sales increased 1%. Growth in leathers offset a slight decline in watches, while jewelry was roughly flat. India, Japan and Australia were our strongest performing markets and the growth was partially offset by continued weakness in South Korea and the decline in China. Michael Kors, FOSSIL and SKAGEN were our strongest performers with each of the brands delivering solid double-digit gains. Comp store sales decreased modestly in the region with the strongest performance coming from the outlet stores. 
In the quarter, gross profit decreased to $410 million and gross margin declined 220 basis points to 55.3%. The decrease was primarily driven by changes in foreign currencies. Excluding currencies, gross margin expanded in the quarter, mainly due to the favorable impact of our pricing initiative, partially offset by the impact of continued outlet promotions as we haven't yet lapped promotional changes that we initiated last year. 
Second quarter operating expenses decreased 6% to $339 million, largely due to the impact of changes in foreign currency and included a $7 million restructuring charge directed at optimizing our operating structure and improving retail profitability. Excluding the impact of currencies and restructuring, operating expenses were flat to last year. Store expenses were higher mainly due to store investments we made last year that had yet to anniversary. Infrastructure expenses were down, as were customer engagement cost and marketing, though the latter change is due mainly to timing including this year's earlier Basel world. Thus far this year, our constant dollar expenses, setting aside restructuring charges, have increased principally in those areas that directly touch the customer. Infrastructure spending thus far is flat, while marketing and customer engagement investments have increased over 10%. For the second half, we plan to lean in more on these marketing investments with the goal to ignite our business both for the near and long term. Our second quarter operating expense rate was 45.8% compared to 46.5% last year, primarily due to these same factors. 
Operating income decreased to $70 million including a $28 million unfavorable currency impact. Operating margin decreased to 9.5% compared to 11% last year, due mainly to the impact of currencies. Restructuring charges created a 90 basis point headwind on operating margins and the negative impact of currencies was 290 basis points. 
Interest expense increased to $5 million given our higher debt level. Second quarter other income increased $15 million to $40 million, largely due to a gain associated with an interest rate hedge settlement as well as net gains on foreign currency contract and account balances. Our effective income tax rate for the second quarter was 28.7%, lower than last year's 31.2%, due to the favorable impact of tax audits that were completed during the quarter. Second quarter net income increased $2 million to $55 million, largely due to nonoperating gains. 
Now turning to our cash flows and balance sheet. For the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $78 million versus $59 million a year ago. We drew down a net $48 million on our revolver. We invested $60 [ph] million in capital expenditures and $103 million to purchase roughly 1.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $82. We ended the quarter with $842 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We ended the quarter with $250 million in cash and $695 million in debt. Second quarter ending inventory totaled $669 million, a slight increase compared to last year. We're expecting some inventory growth in the third quarter and our goal is to realign with sales by year-end given changes to this year's demand. Accounts receivable decreased by 16% to $255 million and wholesale DSOs improved by roughly 5 days. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $22 million for the quarter. 
Moving now to our outlook. And just for clarity, I will start with our assessment based on constant dollars, a like-for-like calendar to exclude the effects of last year's extra week as well as this year's restructuring charges. At the end, I will also give you the various data that include these items. 
Back to the business. We remain very excited about our prospects, our competitive position and our future. We operate a business model that is well diversified and possess key strategic advantages that position us for strong share gains and a growing market over time. We generate strong cash flows and solid returns both in good and more challenging times. With the year now half of behind us, the factors that we anticipated could affect our business for 2015 are generally coming to fruition, and we expected on balance, that headwinds this year will be stronger than tailwinds. That is proving to be the case. We expected with new entrants in our market, consumers could take a pause to evaluate a new product offerings and divert spending away from traditional products. We expected to see brands continuing to ebb and flow in their natural life cycle, making it always a challenge to immediately fill in as customers pace shifts. We expected that there'll be certain markets where competitive pressures would be strong and where economic conditions might impact our ability to grow uniformly, and we expected that the currency environment would continue to put pressure on our operating results. 
With so much happening with consumers and in our markets to date continues to be very challenging to gain greater visibility into near-term sales trends and demand. Our second quarter sales did not meet expectations especially in our international markets, which resulted in a sequential slowdown in watch growth. In Europe, our U.K. business declined. Some of the change in trends there was caused by some operational changes we made last year, but we are very focused on understanding the underlying trends in the business there. Asia continues to be challenging for a variety of reasons. South Korea, which has been economically challenging for some time, was further impacted by mers. Hong Kong and Macau have been weak in China, which still represents a big opportunity long term is taking longer to develop. We are advantaged with our diversified business model that we have the opportunity to pursue nearer-term opportunities like India and China, while continuing to invest in opportunities that may take longer to achieve. Newer brands like Kate Spade New York and Tory Burch, while contributing, are not yet driving outside growth but are hog brands with enormous potential in international stature. We are seeing encouraging results thus far this year with the FOSSIL brand across all categories, and we have not yet begun our most significant marketing investment, which will start to support our business in the second half of this year. SKAGEN continues to make steady progress with continued strong double-digit growth in all markets. 
Strategically, we remain committed to the priorities we outlined at the beginning of the year including investing in additional $35 million or $0.50 per share to support our most critical strategic priorities. In the second half, we are stepping up our marketing investments for FOSSIL and SKAGEN, focusing on bringing new customers into our stores, heavily leveraging digital channels and fresh created to reach our target customers. For FOSSIL, we're launching a new global campaign in the third quarter that highlights the brand's heritage and personality to [indiscernible] the collaborators and influencers featuring our key product categories. The campaign as a fully integrated approach with emphasis on digital and social along with print and strategic markets. Our investments are focused on markets and media that drove results to the end of last year. We're also investing in targeted digital marketing with key partners globally to support all channels of our business. We're continuing to invest in our multiyear, omni-channel road map that advances our capabilities to interact with consumers in a more digital, personally relevant and on-demand way. We're elevating our in-store and online experiences to improve conversion, engagement and overall consumer experience. This will include the rollout of tablets in all U.S. stores, better tools to capture customer data both in-store and online and a redesigned website that is optimized for mobile. We continue to pursue our entry into wearable technology and we have already made significant progress with the tech relationships that we have built. We see one of the biggest trends in fashion today as technology, and we have developed our initial suite of products for the FOSSIL brand expected in stores this fall. More products and more brands will follow in 2016. We continue to believe that with our great design capabilities, scale and world-class portfolio of brands, we can be the point where technology and great fashion come together. We believe that we can win where others can't. 
Considering then all of these factors, along with the trends we saw coming out of the first half of the year, we now expect full year constant dollar and constant calendar sales growth to range from a 3% increase to a 1% decrease. On the upper end, this range generally reflects our most recent trends including tempered international expectations but also includes an expectation of benefits from our FOSSIL investments as well as the potential for some further softening due to some of the headwinds that we've been experiencing this year to lower end where it culminates even greater headwind. For the third quarter, we are expecting constant dollar revenues to decline in the range between 3% and 8%. We do expect the third quarter will be our weakest quarter in terms of relative top line performance given the strong growth rates that we posted last year especially in the Americas and in Europe. We continue to expect full year constant dollar gross margins to expand compared to last year. This is largely due to our efforts to increase margins through both targeted price increases as well as cost improvement initiatives in our supply chain. For the third quarter, we expect a similar growth margin profile. 
For the full year, excluding restructuring expenses, we expect to operate with a higher expense rate, driven primarily by the investments that we are making in marketing, omni-channel and connected accessories. Store and concession expenses will modestly increase the rate due mainly to stores that we added last year. Modestly offsetting these factors, we expect to achieve leverage from our overall global infrastructure. We expect that our third quarter expense profile will be similar to the full year. Based on a lower sales base, we now expect full year constant dollar operating margin between 14% and 15%. We now expect full year constant dollar earnings per share between $6.20 and $7 per share. For the third quarter, we expect operating margin between 13.5% and 15%. We expect third quarter constant dollar EPS between $1.45 and $1.70. These constant dollar estimates all assume a tax rate of about 31% and excludes the impact of restructuring charges.
For reported GAAP purposes, we're continuing to expect that currencies will consider significantly impact our reported numbers. Over the last quarter, the U.S. dollar, while still very strong, has been more stable against most of the currencies that affect us. So our reported guidance assumes roughly prevailing rates above the high and low points of our guidance. Given that we've tempered our expectations for international growth this year, this will actually serve to reduce the overall currency headwind compared to our prior expectations. For the third quarter, our assumptions would yield a reported sales decline between 10% and 15%. We expect reported third quarter operating margin between 9.5% and 11% and EPS between $1.03 and $1.28. This includes a restructuring charge of about $0.06 per share. For the full year, reported GAAP sales will decline between 4% and 8%. Operating margin would range between 10.5% and 11.5% and EPS would range between $4.80 and $5.60 including a restructuring charge of $0.35 per share. 
Our guidance continues to assume higher interest costs due to higher levels of debt as well as continued investment in our share repurchase program, though, as we share before, not at the same level as last year. We estimate capital expenditures for the year will be between $100 million and $110 million. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

Are there other things you're seeing in the watch marketplace that are causing you to see a much lower revenue number in the second half versus what you're thinking? And then related, as I look at the things you're talking about on the call connected accessories, you're really ramping up the marketing and brand investments around FOSSIL in SKAGEN, should we take that to read in the corporate level of view or across the watch category that's changed?"

With respect to the guidance, as we said on our prepared remarks, we always expect that 2015 would be challenging as much as there would be fairly significant headwinds and the net headwinds would be greater than the tailwinds, as we said. That certainly has proven to be the case with currencies, the entrance of new competitors, brands moving, economic choppiness in some markets. The American market performed pretty close to the way we expected in the first half as in Asia. Asia was a little weaker. Europe was the standout for us. It was certainly weaker than we expected in the second quarter, and that largely drove the second quarter, where our sales missed the top or the bottom of our range. So that's number one, is that we just missed our sales expectations for the second quarter. So as we look out for the remainder of the year, we're operating still with a fair amount of a lack of visibility as we always do, and that's exacerbated by some of the factors that we talked about, and Europe, while we're still evaluating that hard to better understand those dynamics, and there's a good probability that we're going to discover that a lot of the factors that are impacting the rest of the business is also affecting Europe. You've got some economic issues going on there, too, with continued impact of Greece and the Russian ruble and oil impacting our Middle East. So Europe generally was softer than we expected. So what we wanted to do was adjust our expectations accordingly, and this year, we're operating now with the sales expectations much wider than we had done certainly last year and implied in the back half of the year because I think, to some extent, there's a little more uncertainty in the business in the back half of the year than we thought before. But for the same -- likely the same -- there are similar reasons."

And I would say about wearable technology, our investments in working with partners as a [indiscernible] point we're probably more excited about wearable technology and its future right now than we were at the beginning of the year.

I think we got a perfect setup our additional activity in the back of the year. So that performance in North America is largely due to both FOSSIL and SKAGEN doing well, and yes, we mentioned our comps were pretty strong.

Our analytics clearly show that. And we also know it's driving traffic to our wholesale partners, stores and their websites, so we're having the benefit that we expected.

That doesn't necessarily create a linear growth trajectory because you're up against last year. If you remember last year, we had a very strong third quarter. We just -- and as we evaluated that performance, there was some inventory build that happened in the channel in the third quarter and that turned in the fourth, and our sales I think in the third quarter last year were up 10 and they were roughly flat in the fourth quarter. So a lot of the choppiness you see this year is the reciprocal, if you will, of what we saw last year. But generally, the assumption is, if the current trend continues, we do expect with the significant investments that we're making in FOSSIL and SKAGEN, we're very excited with the improvements we've seen thus far and we're really just beginning to invest in those brands, and we will lean in significantly more, so there'll be a lot more marketing support to the FOSSIL brand in the back half of the year. So our goal is to see some uptick and we left some room for some further softening in some of the places where the business hasn't been as strong but generally operating at that current trend.

In addition to that, obviously, China and Asia hasn't been as active, so there's not much discussion about it, but I do think that's a short-term situation. If you look at the global watch market, which we are relatively small share now and want to be a larger share, a very significant portion of the global traditional watch business is Swiss-made. So long term, we want to play in that environment. So it still remains a big white space for us. And as you know, we're building our own automatic movement in Switzerland we have Swiss activities in different product lines. Tory Burch was launched last year in Swiss, and it's going to do very well and we're still moving along. I think long term it's a very large white space for us, and I just think technology is taking a little bit of win from those sales in the last 6 months to a year."

Generally, that would be the rational expectation down there as well as you always consider the fact that we have taken on debt as we need to look at interest rate, which, over the last few years -- our interest expense rather, which is in growing as we've taken on some more debt. Our share repurchase, I just remind you that we did say this year that we would not expect to be buying as many shares as we did last year and the year before that as that was largely driven by taking on some debt on the balance sheet overall. Thinking forward, we haven't guided to '16, but -- and so we'll provide more insight as we get to that point. But just generally speaking, if you look at the pattern of currencies, you would expect still some additional -- if currency now flattened out now for the rest of next year, you'd probably still have some headwinds at the beginning of the year, largely in the first quarter and then my definition of my example here, they would neutralize for the rest of the year."

It's going to be on our own stores plus other partners globally, so -- and the numbers will not be significant to us it's mostly pretty large test. It gives you an idea of how this is working. One thing to keep in mind is that, when we talk about wearables it's not just smart watches. There's actually -- it's kind of crystallized into 3 different categories. First of all, there's the smart watch, which is the Android digital screen watch, which it looks really good for fall. And we think over the next couple of years, we'll get better as it gets smaller and more robust technology gets better. We think that's got long-term legs as it continues to improve. And we also have nondisplay items like our bracelets, more like jewelry that are -- we think has the capability of creating an entirely new accessories category based around technology. And then the third, and probably the most significant long term, is what we call smarter watches, which is just adding chips and additional functionality to existing watches. So we're launching that this year, which is to watch -- which looks like a regular analog watch but it has a chip in it and gives measures activities and sleep and also has notifications in it. So to a certain extent, you could say that what we're doing is moving towards we think someday every watch we make will have some type of technology in it. What we have been making in the last 20 years are actually [indiscernible] watches largely and these have -- basically it's port chip. So over time, by us adding additional functionality, sensors, as technology changes, we think that we can add across our platform and have additional functionality in the watches and other products without a lot of additional cost, the additional benefit from it also is that there's an app that goes with these that measures people's activities, et cetera, and also enables us to get data from them and also build the community and the tie-in to our CRM and our marketing isn't really significant. So a lot of benefits for us, which is why we're so interested in it, and we think it over time can be a very significant think the scale across our entire platform."

I will begin with a few prepared remarks before turning the call over to Dennis Secor, our Chief Financial Officer, and then we will open the call to answer any questions. 
For the second quarter, we delivered sales growth across all regions and earnings per share growth ahead of our expectations. From a top line perspective, our FOSSIL and SKAGEN brands drove the increase, and we also benefited from our recent addition of newer brands. Across all of our brands and categories, leathers and jewelry increased compared to last year, while watches were flat. 
Overall, there's a lot happening in our market right now. On the one hand, we are encouraged with the early reads on our own brand investments and expect to see continued improvements as lean in even more in the second half of the year. We continue to leverage our strategic advantages to partner with the best fashion brands and companies in the world. On the other hand, we are adjusting to changing consumer shopping patterns and preferences as well as the natural progression of brands in their life cycles. We also see technology emerging at the latest trend in fashion, with the growing interest in wearable technology, inspiring new entrants into the watch space. We believe our key competitive advantages in design, sourcing and distribution, as well as the great brands in our portfolio, have us well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving landscape. 
Our anticipated launch of connected accessories later this year has the potential to energize the accessories category, given the innovation we are bringing to market and the strong consumer interest in the category. We operate a resilient and diversified model that benefits from scale, diversification and financial strength, and positions us well to win in the long term. 
The second quarter proved to be an example of this. Despite difficult economic conditions in some of our key markets as well as strong currency headwinds, we generated solid results and earnings per share that exceeded our expectations, aided by ongoing efforts to leverage our base infrastructure as well as our share repurchase activity. 
Turning to our key highlights for the quarter. We grew across all of our major geographies, the Americas, Europe and Asia. We grew our own brands, with both FOSSIL and SKAGEN delivering solid growth, led by watches. We delivered positive comps in our retail stores, and we continue to invest in initiatives that we believe can fuel our future growth while using our strong financial position to repurchase over $100 million of our stock for the benefit of our shareholders. 
For FOSSIL, the brand grew 6% in constant currency, with increases in all of our regions and solid growth in both watches and leathers. Across geographies, FOSSIL saw the strongest gains in Asia, followed by the Americas and Europe. Globally, our retail stores continued to deliver positive comps, led by the Americas region, and the brand saw very strong growth in the e-commerce channel. Overall, it was a solid quarter for the brand. We expect to build upon our momentum as we further invest to drive brand awareness and sharpen our analytic capabilities to measure returns on these investments to ensure we are directing our resources to areas that generate strong returns. 
In our retail channel, comp store sales increased 2%, with positive comps in our core category, watches, as well as leathers, where recent investments in the category including our design capabilities are driving positive changes in the assortment. 
For SKAGEN, the progress we continue to make with the brand is very encouraging. Constant currency sales increased over 20%, with solid double digit increases in all regions. Watches led the performance and we are also seeing positive responses to both leathers and jewelry. We continue to see great potential with SKAGEN through expanded global distribution, fueled by excitement around its unique positioning and design. 
As we continue our journey to become world-class in our digital capabilities, we made progress in advancing our CRM initiatives, our omni-channel capabilities and our digital experiences for our customers, all things that position us to engage customers in this very disruptive environment. We look forward to relaunching the FOSSIL brand website with improved mobile functionality later this quarter. 
We are excited to launch the upgraded site ahead of holiday, which will provide an enhanced customer experience and introduce rich brand content, positioning us to drive sales and further build interest in the FOSSIL brand. This quarter, we also made significant progress in developing connected accessories. This is a category we are increasingly excited about, given the significant consumer interest in the space. We remain on track to launch our first products under the FOSSIL brand in the fall. We are finalizing our plans for distribution, which will include our FOSSIL stores and select wholesale distribution and are very pleased with the functionality and the design of the product. While these are only the first generation of products, we're excited to enter the space and learn from the initial assortment. We'll incorporate our learnings in the next generation of products as well as introduce new products under additional brands in 2016. 
We continue to leverage our partnerships with technology leaders as we look to scale technology across our platform of products and brands. We believe this will add heat to our categories and drive increases and awareness in sales. 
Turning to our multi-brand watch portfolio. As you know, our objective is to leverage what we do best, exercise our strategic advantages in design, production and distribution to gain share in the global watch market and extend our leadership position. While we believe that we have the most desirable fashion brands in our portfolio, we know that all brands evolve through life cycles over time and we are experiencing that with our own brand strengthening while other brands in the portfolio are not growing as fast. During the second quarter, our multi-brand watch portfolio was flat to last year, a disappointing performance for the quarter, as growth in the Americas was offset by slight declines in Europe and Asia compared to last year. 
In our international markets, we believe Europe and Asia represent a significant opportunity to gain share, particularly given that we are underpenetrated in many markets around the world. Specific to the second quarter, however, we feel our growth was impacted by unique market-specific conditions that we believe will move in our favor over time. 
In Europe, while our business did grow in constant dollars, we saw some softness in parts of our business. This was especially true over the U.K. where performance was also impacted by accelerated Q2 shipments last year as we transitioned our warehouse there. Our business in Germany was not as strong as we expected, while we did see some strong double-digit growth in France. In Asia, our business grew but did not meet our expectations. The MERS outbreak in South Korea and economic downturns affecting Hong Kong and Macau are putting pressure on our near-term results. China continues to be tough with economic, political and distribution challenges there, making it difficult to drive near-term growth. On a positive note, markets like Japan, Australia and India continue to grow, with India posting strong double digit growth in the quarter. 
We don't believe the quarter's performance is indicative of the true potential of the international business and continue to believe the market share opportunity available to us in the regions is very meaningful. We believe we are poised to succeed in our international markets as the same market dynamics that help drive our significant share gains in United States play out across the globe. We continue to have opportunities to drive brands through our existing distribution in Europe, as well as expand in new markets in there. And in Asia, where we feel market demographics will skew in our favor, we are well-positioned to take advantage of fashion brands emerging to take share from traditional watch brands. 
As we enter the year, we identified several disruptive factors that were going to make 2015 challenging. We expected visibility would be difficult, with new entrants moving into our market. While we feel this will energize the category in the long term as we add technology to our products, the near-term implications seem to be playing out. Also, the natural ebbs and flows of brands in their life cycles can create volatility in sales patterns as consumer preferences evolve around the globe. And currencies have put a significant strain on our near-term results. With that in mind, we remain focused on pursuing the investments that we believe are most critical to our long-term success. 
As a company with significant competitive advantages, we are moving quickly with changes in our business. We are ramping up innovation across the board in design, technology and marketing. We believe our competitive positioning and a strong balance sheet are even more advantageous in a challenging economic and currency environment, as we have the financial flexibility to invest in innovation and our growth initiatives to increase our global watch and accessories market share. We remain intently focused on executing to the key objectives that we believe position us to accelerate sales growth and we have already seen traction from the initiatives we are embarking on to drive toward our objectives. 
First, we're investing in our own brands, FOSSIL and SKAGEN, which have already delivered solid first half growth. We're making additional investments in the second half, and we expect to see even stronger results later this year. Second, we're well on our way to enhancing our digital capabilities including omni-channel retailing and e-commerce. We're taking big strides in developing a robust platform and have already seen a sharp uptick in online sales for the first half. 
And finally, connected accessories. We are leveraging the significant partnerships that we've built and are on track with products that will hit our stores in the fall. We think this will be an important driver in the years ahead. 
At the same time, we continue to see significant potential to expand our watch portfolio sales with long-standing brands as well as the benefit of new brands including Tory Burch, Kate Spade New York and Chaps in 2016. We expect continued expansion in the other categories we offer such as in leathers and jewelry and soon to be connected accessories. We also still have significant growth ahead of us internationally, with Asia representing our biggest opportunity by far. While we recognize that pockets of our business are challenging and may remain so in the short term, overall, we remain excited about the many strategic initiatives we are implementing through the remainder of the year and our potential to ignite future growth. 
The world is changing quickly, and so are we, positioning the company for long-term sustainable growth in an evolving environment. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Dennis for more comments."

Second quarter net sales increased 2% in constant dollars, and on a reported basis, declined 4% to $740 million. While we delivered constant dollar increases across all regions, sales came in below our expectat",2852,"Thanks, Kosta, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter net sales increased 2% in constant dollars, and on a reported basis, declined 4% to $740 million. While we delivered constant dollar increases across all regions, sales came in below our expectations as both Europe and Asia grew at a lower rate than we anticipated. For the quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $1.12 compared to $0.98 last year. This quarter's EPS benefited by roughly $0.09 of non-operating gains, $0.04 from a lower tax rate related to second quarter audits and a net $0.05 related to financing activities. 
Compared to EPS in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, this quarter's results was negatively impacted by roughly $0.30 due to currencies and another $0.10 due to our restructuring charges. Constant currency sales growth and a lower share count combined with nonoperating gains to drive the year-over-year comparison. Overall, operating expenses decreased compared to last year, primarily driven by changes in foreign currencies. In constant dollars and excluding restructuring costs, expenses were flat to last year despite the impact of new store additions from last year that we had yet to anniversary. 
Before I get into second quarter details, let me share some insight on our first half performance as our reported results tend to obscure what we consider our core earnings per share. Thus far, in 2015, our reported results have absorbed $0.43 of currency headwinds and $0.27 of restructuring charges. We've also benefited $0.09 from the tax and financing activity I just mentioned. Factoring out those items, we delivered first half core EPS that is nearly 13% higher than the comparable period last year. 
Now specific to the second quarter, FOSSIL sales increased 6% in constant dollars. Solid growth in watches and leathers more than offset the decline in jewelry. Sales for the brand increased in all 3 regions, with Asia delivering a mid-teen increase. While still a relatively small part of the business for the brand, the e-commerce channel drove solid double-digit increases with higher traffic and improved conversion rates, early indications that we feel tell us our demand creation initiatives are working. 
SKAGEN sales grew 21% in constant dollars with growth in all 3 regions including 20-plus percent growth in Europe and the Americas. Strong double-digit watch growth drove the business with solid increases in leathers and jewelry as well. E-commerce sales for SKAGEN also increased nicely, driven by higher traffic. 
In constant dollars, our multi-brand watch portfolio was flat to last year, with increases in the Americas offsetting declines in our international regions. In the Americas, reported sales increased 1% to $386 million, a 3% constant dollar increase, which aligns with our first quarter trend. The increase was driven by growth across all 3 categories, with watches and leathers driving the volume and jewelry increasing in the mid-teens as the Michael Kors brand drove the category. Across brands, constant dollar sales for the FOSSIL, SKAGEN and Armani brands increased in the quarter, and we benefited from the addition of Kate Spade New York. Michael Kors brand sales declined slightly as very strong jewelry growth nearly offset lower sales in watches. The overall regional sales increase was driven by our retail stores, which delivered a solid positive comp, propelled by improved conversion resulting from compelling promotions in our outlet. Traffic was down again in the region. We continue to drive a significant increase in our e-commerce business across all of our websites and posted a solid double-digit gain in the quarter. 
Constant dollar wholesale sales were flat to last year, with international increases offsetting declines in the United States. U.S. department store business, where we have planned the business down this year, continued to be soft. While this is likely to continue, we also expect that growth from our direct business can drive overall growth in this region. 
In Europe, reported sales decreased 12% to $228 million, while constant dollar sales increased to 2%. Growth in jewelry and leathers offset a slight decline in watches. Growth in the region was softer than expected, particularly in watches, with overall sales in major markets such as Germany roughly flat and Italy and the U.K. down to last year. The performance in the U.K. was at least partially attributable to a strong performance in the second quarter of last year when some orders were shipped early ahead of the warehouse transition. Brands drove the slight increase for the region during the quarter. 
Both FOSSIL and SKAGEN grew during the quarter, with notable strength in watches. And the Michael Kors brand grew in the quarter, driven by strong jewelry sales along with watch growth in boutiques. Within the portfolio, nearly all of the licensed brands posted slight declines for the quarter. In the region, our sales growth was driven by our retail channels, where comp store sales increased slightly driven by our outlet stores. 
In Asia, reported sales decreased 6% to $126 million, while constant dollar sales increased 1%. Growth in leathers offset a slight decline in watches, while jewelry was roughly flat. India, Japan and Australia were our strongest performing markets and the growth was partially offset by continued weakness in South Korea and the decline in China. Michael Kors, FOSSIL and SKAGEN were our strongest performers with each of the brands delivering solid double-digit gains. Comp store sales decreased modestly in the region, with the strongest performance coming from the outlet stores. 
In the quarter, gross profit decreased to $410 million and gross margin declined 220 basis points to 55.3%. The decrease was primarily driven by changes in foreign currencies. Excluding currencies, gross margin expanded in the quarter, mainly due to the favorable impact of our pricing initiatives, partially offset by the impact of continued outlet promotions as we hadn't yet lapped promotional changes that we initiated last year. 
Second quarter operating expenses decreased 6% to $339 million, largely due to the impact of changes in foreign currency, and included a $7 million restructuring charge directed at optimizing our operating structure and improving retail profitability. Excluding the impact of currencies and restructuring, operating expenses were flat to last year. Store expenses were higher mainly due to store investments we made last year that had yet to anniversary. Infrastructure expenses were down, as were customer engagement cost and marketing, though the latter change is due mainly to timing, including this year's earlier Baselworld. 
Thus far this year, our constant dollar expenses, setting aside restructuring charges, have increased principally in those areas that directly touch the customer. Infrastructure spending thus far is flat, while marketing and customer engagement investments have increased over 10%. For the second half, we plan to lean in more on these marketing investments with a goal to ignite our business both for the near and long term. Our second quarter operating expense rate was 45.8% compared to 46.5% last year, primarily due to these same factors. 
Operating income decreased to $70 million, including a $28 million unfavorable currency impact. Operating margin decreased to 9.5% compared to 11% last year, due mainly to the impact of currencies. Restructuring charges created a 90 basis point headwind on operating margins and the negative impact of currencies was 290 basis points. 
Interest expense increased to $5 million given our higher debt level. Second quarter other income increased $15 million to $14 million, largely due to a gain associated with an interest rate hedge settlement as well as net gains on foreign currency contract and account balances. Our effective income tax rate for the second quarter was 28.7%, lower than last year's 31.2% due to the favorable impact of tax audits that were completed during the quarter. Second quarter net income increased $2 million to $55 million, largely due to nonoperating gains. 
Now turning to our cash flows and balance sheet. For the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $78 million versus $59 million a year ago. We drew down a net $48 million on our revolver. We invested $60  million in capital expenditures and $103 million to purchase roughly 1.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $82. We ended the quarter with $842 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We ended the quarter with $250 million in cash and $695 million in debt. 
Second quarter ending inventory totaled $669 million, a slight increase compared to last year. We're expecting some inventory growth in the third quarter and our goal is to realign with sales by year-end given changes to this year's demand. Accounts receivable decreased by 16% to $255 million, and wholesale DSOs improved by roughly 5 days. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $22 million for the quarter. 
Moving now to our outlook. And just for clarity, I will start with our assessment based on constant dollars, a like-for-like calendar to exclude the effects of last year's extra week as well as this year's restructuring charges. At the end, I will also give you the various data that include these items. 
Back to the business. We remain very excited about our prospects, our competitive position and our future. We operate a business model that is well-diversified and possess key strategic advantages that position us for strong share gains and a growing market over time. We generate strong cash flows and solid returns both in good and more challenging times. 
With the year now half behind us, the factors that we anticipated could affect our business for 2015 are generally coming to fruition, and we expected, on balance, that headwinds this year would be stronger than tailwinds. That is proving to be the case. We expected, with new entrants in our market, consumers could take a pause to evaluate new product offerings and divert spending away from traditional products. We expected to see brands continuing to ebb and flow in their natural life cycles, making it always a challenge to immediately fill in as customers pace shifts. We expected that there'll be certain markets where competitive pressures would be strong and where economic conditions might impact our ability to grow uniformly, and we expected that the currency environment would continue to put pressure on our operating results. 
With so much happening with consumers and in our markets today continues to be very challenging to gain greater visibility into near-term sales trends and demand. Our second quarter sales did not meet expectations, especially in our international markets, which resulted in a sequential slowdown in watch growth. In Europe, our U.K. business declined. Some of the change in trends there was caused by some operational changes we made last year, but we are very focused on understanding the underlying trends in the business there. Asia continues to be challenging for a variety of reasons. South Korea, which has been economically challenging for some time, was further impacted by MERS. Hong Kong and Macau have been weak, and China, which still represents a big opportunity long term, is taking longer to develop. 
We are advantaged with our diversified business model that we have the opportunity to pursue nearer-term opportunities like India and China, while continuing to invest in opportunities that may take longer to achieve. Newer brands like Kate Spade New York and Tory Burch, while contributing, are not yet driving outside growth but are hot brands with enormous potential in international stature. We are seeing encouraging results thus far this year with the FOSSIL brand across all categories, and we have not yet begun our most significant marketing investment, which will start to support our business in the second half of this year. SKAGEN continues to make steady progress with continued strong double-digit growth in all markets. 
Strategically, we remain committed to the priorities we outlined at the beginning of the year, including investing in additional $35 million or $0.50 per share to support our most critical strategic priorities. In the second half, we are stepping up our marketing investments for FOSSIL and SKAGEN, focusing on bringing new customers into our stores, heavily leveraging digital channels and fresh creative to reach our target customers. 
For FOSSIL, we're launching a new global campaign in the third quarter that highlights the brand's heritage and personality through a cast of collaborators and influencers featuring our key product categories. The campaign has a fully integrated approach with emphasis on digital and social, along with print and strategic markets. Our investments are focused on markets and media that drove results at the end of last year. 
We're also investing in targeted digital marketing with key partners globally to support all channels of our business. We're continuing to invest in our multiyear, omni-channel roadmap that advances our capabilities to interact with consumers in a more digital, personally relevant and on-demand way. We're elevating our in-store and online experiences to improve conversion, engagement and overall consumer experience. This will include the rollout of tablets in all U.S. stores, better tools to capture customer data, both in-store and online, and a redesigned website that is optimized for mobile. 
We continue to pursue our entry into wearable technology and we have already made significant progress with the tech relationships that we have built. We see one of the biggest trends in fashion today as technology, and we have developed our initial suite of products for the FOSSIL brand expected in stores this fall. More products and more brands will follow in 2016. We continue to believe that with our great design capabilities, scale and world-class portfolio of brands, we can be the point where technology and great fashion come together. We believe that we can win here, where others can't. 
Considering then all of these factors, along with the trends we saw coming out of the first half of the year, we now expect full year constant dollar and constant calendar sales growth to range from a 3% increase to a 1% decrease. On the upper end, this range generally reflects our most recent trends, including tempered international expectations, but also includes an expectation of benefits from our FOSSIL investments as well as the potential for some further softening due to some of the headwinds that we've been experiencing this year. The lower end would accommodate even greater headwind. For the third quarter, we are expecting constant dollar revenues to decline in the range between 3% and 8%. 
We do expect the third quarter will be our weakest quarter in terms of relative top line performance given the strong growth rates that we posted last year, especially in the Americas and in Europe. We continue to expect full year constant dollar gross margins to expand compared to last year. This is largely due to our efforts to increase margins through both targeted price increases as well as cost improvement initiatives in our supply chain. For the third quarter, we expect a similar growth margin profile. 
For the full year, excluding restructuring expenses, we expect to operate with a higher expense rate, driven primarily by the investments that we are making in marketing, omni-channel and connected accessories. Store and concession expenses will modestly increase the rates due mainly to stores that we added last year. Modestly offsetting these factors, we expect to achieve leverage from our overall global infrastructure. We expect that our third quarter expense profile will be similar to the full year. 
Based on a lower sales base, we now expect full year constant dollar operating margin between 14% and 15%. We now expect full year constant dollar earnings per share between $6.20 and $7 per share. For the third quarter, we expect operating margin between 13.5% and 15%. We expect third quarter constant dollar EPS between $1.45 and $1.70. These constant dollar estimates all assume a tax rate of about 31% and excludes the impact of restructuring charges.
For reported GAAP purposes, we're continuing to expect that currencies will consider significantly impact our reported numbers. Over the last quarter, the U.S. dollar, while still very strong, has been more stable against most of the currencies that affect us. So our reported guidance assumes roughly prevailing rates at both the high and low points of our guidance. 
Given that we've tempered our expectations for international growth this year, this will actually serve to reduce the overall currency headwind compared to our prior expectations. For the third quarter, our assumptions would yield a reported sales decline between 10% and 15%. We'd expect reported third quarter operating margin between 9.5% and 11%, and EPS between $1.03 and $1.28. This includes a restructuring charge of about $0.06 per share. For the full year, reported GAAP sales would decline between 4% and 8%. Operating margin would range between 10.5% and 11.5%, and EPS would range between $4.80 and $5.60, including a restructuring charge of $0.35 per share. 
Our guidance continues to assume higher interest costs due to higher levels of debt as well as continued investment in our share repurchase program, though, as we shared before, not at the same level as last year. We estimate capital expenditures for the year will be between $100 million and $110 million. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

If I look at your second half guidance where it was 90 days ago versus where it is today x currency, of course, it's certainly come down a lot. Has something changed? And obviously, it looks like international business is a little bit slower. Is that the only key driver there? Are there other things you're seeing in the watch marketplace that are causing you to see a much lower revenue number in the second half versus what you're thinking? And then, related, as I look at the things you're talking about on the call, connected accessories, you're really ramping up the marketing and brand investments around FOSSIL and SKAGEN, should we take that to read in a corporate level view across the watch category that's changed?"

With respect to the guidance, as we said on our prepared remarks, we always expect that 2015 would be challenging as much as there would be some fairly significant headwinds and the net headwinds would be greater than the tailwinds. And as we said, that certainly has proven to be the case with currencies, the entrance of new competitors, brands moving, economic choppiness in some markets. The American market performed pretty close to the way we expected in the first half as, in Asia, Asia was a little weaker. Europe was the standout for us. It was certainly weaker than we expected in the second quarter, and that largely drove the second quarter where our sales missed the top -- or the bottom of our range. So that's number one, is that we just missed our sales expectations for the second quarter. So as we look out for the remainder of the year, we're operating still with a fair amount of -- lack of visibility, as we always do, and that's exacerbated by some of the factors that we talked about. And Europe, while we're still evaluating that hard to better understand those dynamics, and there's a good probability that we're going to discover that a lot of the factors that are impacting the rest of the business is also affecting Europe. You've got some economic issues going on there, too, with continued impact of Greece and the Russian ruble and oil impacting our Middle East business. So Europe generally was softer than we expected. So what we wanted to do was adjust our expectations accordingly. And this year, we're operating now with sales expectations much wider than we had done certainly last year and implied in the back half of the year because, I think, to some extent, there's a little more uncertainty in the business in the back half of the year than we thought before. But for the same -- likely the same -- they're similar reasons."

We're already seeing benefits from our omni-channel investments and our digital capabilities, so that's starting to happen. And I would say about wearable technology, our investments in working with partners, as a gossip point, we're actually probably more excited about wearable technology and its future right now than we were at the beginning of the year. So all in all, holding the SG&A flat and investing pretty heavily in our future, I think, is playing out pretty well, and we'll see how that goes."

It looks pretty strong. We think we got a perfect setup for additional activity in the back of the year. So performance in North America is largely due to both FOSSIL and SKAGEN doing well. And as we mentioned, our comps were pretty strong. Our e-commerce business, because of all the activities we're doing, is -- has a lot of traffic on it, a lot of increases in traffic, increase in sales. We know it's driving traffic to our stores. Our analytics clearly show that. And we also know it's driving traffic to our wholesale partners, stores and their websites, so we're having the benefit that we expected. And we think that by -- in North America, by continuing to do this plus adding wearable technology later this year and next year, we think we're in a pretty good place to continue to gain share in the U.S."

We just -- and as we evaluated that performance, there were some inventory build that happened in the channel in the third quarter and that turned in the fourth, and our sales, I think, in the third quarter last year were up 10 and they were roughly flat in the fourth quarter. So a lot of the choppiness you see this year is the reciprocal, if you will, of what we saw last year. But generally, the assumption is, if the current trend continues, we do expect with the significant investments that we're making in FOSSIL and SKAGEN, we're very excited with the improvements we've seen thus far and we're really just beginning to invest in those brands, and we will lean in significantly more, so there'll be a lot more marketing support to support the FOSSIL brand in the back half of the year. So our goal is to see some uptick and we left some room for some further softening in some of the places where the business hasn't been as strong but generally operating at that current trend. And then, on the bottom of the range, we've assumed a more challenging performance."

We also are -- they're ramping up their activities in men's, and we've got a whole initiative around automatics.

If you look at the global watch market, which we are a relatively small share now and want to be a larger share, a very significant portion of the global traditional watch business is Swiss-made. So long term, we want to play in that environment. So it still remains a big whitespace for us. And as you know, we're building our own automatic movements in Switzerland, we have Swiss activities in different product lines. Tory Burch was launched last year in Swiss, and it's going to do very well. We're still moving along.

Our share repurchase, I'd just remind you that we did say this year that we would not expect to be buying as many shares as we did last year and the year before that as that was largely driven by taking on some debt on the balance sheet overall.

It's going to be in our own stores plus other partners globally, so -- and the numbers will not be significant to us, it's mostly pretty large test just to get an idea of how this is working. One thing to keep in mind is that, when we talk about wearables, it's not just smart watches. There's actually -- it's kind of crystallized into 3 different categories. First of all, there's the smart watch, which is the Android digital screen watch, which it looks really good for fall, and we think, over the next couple of years, will get better as it gets smaller and more robust, the technology gets better. We think that's got long-term legs as it continues to improve. And we also have non-=display items like our bracelets, more like jewelry that are -- we think has the capability of creating an entirely new accessories category based around technology. And then, the third, and probably the most significant long term is what we call smarter watches, which is just adding chips and additional functionality to existing watches. So we're launching that this year, which is it's a watch, looks just like a regular analog watch but it does have a chip in it that gives measures, activity and sleep and also has notifications in it. So to a certain extent, you could say that what we're doing is moving towards, we think, someday, every watch we make will have some type of technology in it. What we have been making in the last 20 years are actually quartz watches largely, and these have -- basically, it's a quartz chip. So over time, by us adding additional functionality, sensors, as technology changes, we think that we can add this across our platform and have additional functionality in the watches and other products without a lot of additional cost. The additional benefit from it also is that there's an app that goes with these that measures people's activities, et cetera, and also enables us to get data from them and also build a community and the tie-in to our CRM and our marketing is really significant. So it's a lot of benefits for us, which is why we're so interested in it, and we think it, over time, could be a very significant thing to scale across our entire platform."

For the second quarter, we delivered sales growth across all regions and earnings per share growth ahead of our expectations. From a top line perspective, our FOSSIL and SKAGEN brands drove the increase, and we also benefited from our recent addition of newer brands. Across all of our brands and categories, leathers and jewelry increased compared to last year, while watches were flat. 
Overall, there's a lot happening in our market right now. On the one hand, we are encouraged with the early reads on our own brand investments and expect to see continued improvements as we lean in even more in the second half of the year. We continue to leverage our strategic advantages to partner with the best fashion brands and companies in the world. On the other hand, we are adjusting to changing consumer shopping patterns and preferences as well as the natural progression of brands in their life cycles. We also see technology emerging at the latest trend in fashion, with the growing interest in wearable technology, inspiring new entrants into the watch space. We believe our key competitive advantages in design, sourcing and distribution, as well as the great brands in our portfolio, have us well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving landscape. 
Our anticipated launch of connected accessories later this year has the potential to energize the accessories category, given the innovation we are bringing to market and the strong consumer interest in the category. We operate a resilient and diversified model that benefits from scale, diversification and financial strength, and positions us well to win in the long term. 
The second quarter proved to be an example of this. Despite difficult economic conditions in some of our key markets as well as strong currency headwinds, we generated solid results and earnings per share that exceeded our expectations, aided by ongoing efforts to leverage our base infrastructure as well as our share repurchase activity. 
Turning to our key highlights for the quarter. We grew across all of our major geographies, the Americas, Europe and Asia. We grew our own brands, with both FOSSIL and SKAGEN delivering solid growth, led by watches. We delivered positive comps in our retail stores, and we continue to invest in initiatives that we believe can fuel our future growth while using our strong financial position to repurchase over $100 million of our stock for the benefit of our shareholders. 
For FOSSIL, the brand grew 6% in constant currency, with increases in all of our regions and solid growth in both watches and leathers. Across geographies, FOSSIL saw the strongest gains in Asia, followed by the Americas and Europe. Globally, our retail stores continued to deliver positive comps, led by the Americas region, and the brand saw very strong growth in the e-commerce channel. Overall, it was a solid quarter for the brand. We expect to build upon our momentum as we further invest to drive brand awareness and sharpen our analytic capabilities to measure returns on these investments to ensure we are directing our resources to areas that generate strong returns. 
In our retail channel, comp store sales increased 2%, with positive comps in our core category, watches, as well as leathers, where recent investments in the category including our design capabilities are driving positive changes in the assortment. 
For SKAGEN, the progress we continue to make with the brand is very encouraging. Constant currency sales increased over 20%, with solid double digit increases in all regions. Watches led the performance and we are also seeing positive responses to both leathers and jewelry. We continue to see great potential with SKAGEN through expanded global distribution, fueled by excitement around its unique positioning and design. 
As we continue our journey to become world-class in our digital capabilities, we made progress in advancing our CRM initiatives, our omni-channel capabilities and our digital experiences for our customers, all things that position us to engage customers in this very disruptive environment. We look forward to relaunching the FOSSIL brand website with improved mobile functionality later this quarter. 
We are excited to launch the upgraded site ahead of holiday, which will provide an enhanced customer experience and introduce rich brand content, positioning us to drive sales and further build interest in the FOSSIL brand. This quarter, we also made significant progress in developing connected accessories. This is a category we are increasingly excited about, given the significant consumer interest in the space. We remain on track to launch our first products under the FOSSIL brand in the fall. We are finalizing our plans for distribution, which will include our FOSSIL stores and select wholesale distribution and are very pleased with the functionality and the design of the product. While these are only the first generation of products, we're excited to enter the space and learn from the initial assortment. We'll incorporate our learnings in the next generation of products as well as introduce new products under additional brands in 2016. 
We continue to leverage our partnerships with technology leaders as we look to scale technology across our platform of products and brands. We believe this will add heat to our categories and drive increases and awareness in sales. 
Turning to our multi-brand watch portfolio. As you know, our objective is to leverage what we do best, exercise our strategic advantages in design, production and distribution to gain share in the global watch market and extend our leadership position. While we believe that we have the most desirable fashion brands in our portfolio, we know that all brands evolve through life cycles over time and we are experiencing that with our own brand strengthening while other brands in the portfolio are not growing as fast. During the second quarter, our multi-brand watch portfolio was flat to last year, a disappointing performance for the quarter, as growth in the Americas was offset by slight declines in Europe and Asia compared to last year. 
In our international markets, we believe Europe and Asia represent a significant opportunity to gain share, particularly given that we are underpenetrated in many markets around the world. Specific to the second quarter, however, we feel our growth was impacted by unique market-specific conditions that we believe will move in our favor over time. 
In Europe, while our business did grow in constant dollars, we saw some softness in parts of our business. This was especially true over the U.K. where performance was also impacted by accelerated Q2 shipments last year as we transitioned our warehouse there. Our business in Germany was not as strong as we expected, while we did see some strong double-digit growth in France. In Asia, our business grew but did not meet our expectations. The MERS outbreak in South Korea and economic downturns affecting Hong Kong and Macau are putting pressure on our near-term results. China continues to be tough with economic, political and distribution challenges there, making it difficult to drive near-term growth. On a positive note, markets like Japan, Australia and India continue to grow, with India posting strong double digit growth in the quarter. 
We don't believe the quarter's performance is indicative of the true potential of the international business and continue to believe the market share opportunity available to us in the regions is very meaningful. We believe we are poised to succeed in our international markets as the same market dynamics that help drive our significant share gains in United States play out across the globe. We continue to have opportunities to drive brands through our existing distribution in Europe, as well as expand in new markets in there. And in Asia, where we feel market demographics will skew in our favor, we are well-positioned to take advantage of fashion brands emerging to take share from traditional watch brands. 
As we entered the year, we identified several disruptive factors that were going to make 2015 challenging. We expected visibility would be difficult, with new entrants moving into our market. While we feel this will energize the category in the long term as we add technology to our products, the near-term implications seem to be playing out. Also, the natural ebbs and flows of brands in their life cycles can create volatility in sales patterns as consumer preferences evolve around the globe. And currencies have put a significant strain on our near-term results. With that in mind, we remain focused on pursuing the investments that we believe are most critical to our long-term success. 
As a company with significant competitive advantages, we are moving quickly with changes in our business. We are ramping up innovation across the board in design, technology and marketing. We believe our competitive positioning and a strong balance sheet are even more advantageous in a challenging economic and currency environment, as we have the financial flexibility to invest in innovation and our growth initiatives to increase our global watch and accessories market share. We remain intently focused on executing to the key objectives that we believe position us to accelerate sales growth and we have already seen traction from the initiatives we are embarking on to drive toward our objectives. 
First, we're investing in our own brands, FOSSIL and SKAGEN, which have already delivered solid first half growth. We're making additional investments in the second half, and we expect to see even stronger results later this year. Second, we're well on our way to enhancing our digital capabilities including omni-channel retailing and e-commerce. We're taking big strides in developing a robust platform and have already seen a sharp uptick in online sales for the first half. 
And finally, connected accessories. We are leveraging the significant partnerships that we've built and are on track with products that will hit our stores in the fall. We think this will be an important driver in the years ahead. 
At the same time, we continue to see significant potential to expand our watch portfolio sales with long-standing brands as well as the benefit of new brands including Tory Burch, Kate Spade New York and Chaps in 2016. We expect continued expansion in the other categories we offer such as in leathers and jewelry and soon to be connected accessories. We also still have significant growth ahead of us internationally, with Asia representing our biggest opportunity by far. While we recognize that pockets of our business are challenging and may remain so in the short term, overall, we remain excited about the many strategic initiatives we are implementing through the remainder of the year and our potential to ignite future growth. 
The world is changing quickly, and so are we, positioning the company for long-term sustainable growth in an evolving environment. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Dennis for more comments."

Second quarter net sales increased 2% in constant dollars, and on a reported basis, declined 4% to $740 million.

Second quarter net sales increased 2% in constant dollars, and on a reported basis, declined 4% to $740 million. While we delivered constant dollar increases across all regions, sales came in below our expectations as both Europe and Asia grew at a lower rate than we anticipated. For the quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $1.12 compared to $0.98 last year. This quarter's EPS benefited by roughly $0.09 of non-operating gains, $0.04 from a lower tax rate related to second quarter audits and a net $0.05 related to financing activities. 
Compared to EPS in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, this quarter's results was negatively impacted by roughly $0.30 due to currencies and another $0.10 due to our restructuring charges. Constant currency sales growth and a lower share count combined with nonoperating gains to drive the year-over-year comparison. Overall, operating expenses decreased compared to last year, primarily driven by changes in foreign currencies. In constant dollars and excluding restructuring costs, expenses were flat to last year despite the impact of new store additions from last year that we had yet to anniversary. 
Before I get into second quarter details, let me share some insight on our first half performance as our reported results tend to obscure what we consider our core earnings per share. Thus far, in 2015, our reported results have absorbed $0.43 of currency headwinds and $0.27 of restructuring charges. We've also benefited $0.09 from the tax and financing activity I just mentioned. Factoring out those items, we delivered first half core EPS that is nearly 13% higher than the comparable period last year. 
Now specific to the second quarter, FOSSIL sales increased 6% in constant dollars. Solid growth in watches and leathers more than offset the decline in jewelry. Sales for the brand increased in all 3 regions, with Asia delivering a mid-teen increase. While still a relatively small part of the business for the brand, the e-commerce channel drove solid double-digit increases with higher traffic and improved conversion rates, early indications that we feel tell us our demand creation initiatives are working. 
SKAGEN sales grew 21% in constant dollars with growth in all 3 regions including 20-plus percent growth in Europe and the Americas. Strong double-digit watch growth drove the business with solid increases in leathers and jewelry as well. E-commerce sales for SKAGEN also increased nicely, driven by higher traffic. 
In constant dollars, our multi-brand watch portfolio was flat to last year, with increases in the Americas offsetting declines in our international regions. In the Americas, reported sales increased 1% to $386 million, a 3% constant dollar increase, which aligns with our first quarter trend. The increase was driven by growth across all 3 categories, with watches and leathers driving the volume and jewelry increasing in the mid-teens as the Michael Kors brand drove the category. Across brands, constant dollar sales for the FOSSIL, SKAGEN and Armani brands increased in the quarter, and we benefited from the addition of Kate Spade New York. Michael Kors brand sales declined slightly as very strong jewelry growth nearly offset lower sales in watches. The overall regional sales increase was driven by our retail stores, which delivered a solid positive comp, propelled by improved conversion resulting from compelling promotions in our outlet. Traffic was down again in the region. We continue to drive a significant increase in our e-commerce business across all of our websites and posted a solid double-digit gain in the quarter. 
Constant dollar wholesale sales were flat to last year, with international increases offsetting declines in the United States. U.S. department store business, where we have planned the business down this year, continued to be soft. While this is likely to continue, we also expect that growth from our direct business can drive overall growth in this region. 
In Europe, reported sales decreased 12% to $228 million, while constant dollar sales increased to 2%. Growth in jewelry and leathers offset a slight decline in watches. Growth in the region was softer than expected, particularly in watches, with overall sales in major markets such as Germany roughly flat and Italy and the U.K. down to last year. The performance in the U.K. was at least partially attributable to a strong performance in the second quarter of last year when some orders were shipped early ahead of the warehouse transition. France drove the slight increase for the region during the quarter. 
Both FOSSIL and SKAGEN grew during the quarter, with notable strength in watches. And the Michael Kors brand grew in the quarter, driven by strong jewelry sales along with watch growth in boutiques. Within the portfolio, nearly all of the licensed brands posted slight declines for the quarter. In the region, our sales growth was driven by our retail channels, where comp store sales increased slightly driven by our outlet stores. 
In Asia, reported sales decreased 6% to $126 million, while constant dollar sales increased 1%. Growth in leathers offset a slight decline in watches, while jewelry was roughly flat. India, Japan and Australia were our strongest performing markets and the growth was partially offset by continued weakness in South Korea and the decline in China. Michael Kors, FOSSIL and SKAGEN were our strongest performers with each of the brands delivering solid double-digit gains. Comp store sales decreased modestly in the region, with the strongest performance coming from the outlet stores. 
In the quarter, gross profit decreased to $410 million and gross margin declined 220 basis points to 55.3%. The decrease was primarily driven by changes in foreign currencies. Excluding currencies, gross margin expanded in the quarter, mainly due to the favorable impact of our pricing initiatives, partially offset by the impact of continued outlet promotions as we hadn't yet lapped promotional changes that we initiated last year. 
Second quarter operating expenses decreased 6% to $339 million, largely due to the impact of changes in foreign currency, and included a $7 million restructuring charge directed at optimizing our operating structure and improving retail profitability. Excluding the impact of currencies and restructuring, operating expenses were flat to last year. Store expenses were higher mainly due to store investments we made last year that had yet to anniversary. Infrastructure expenses were down, as were customer engagement cost and marketing, though the latter change is due mainly to timing, including this year's earlier Baselworld. 
Thus far this year, our constant dollar expenses, setting aside restructuring charges, have increased principally in those areas that directly touch the customer. Infrastructure spending thus far is flat, while marketing and customer engagement investments have increased over 10%. For the second half, we plan to lean in more on these marketing investments with a goal to ignite our business both for the near and long term. Our second quarter operating expense rate was 45.8% compared to 46.5% last year, primarily due to these same factors. 
Operating income decreased to $70 million, including a $28 million unfavorable currency impact. Operating margin decreased to 9.5% compared to 11% last year, due mainly to the impact of currencies. Restructuring charges created a 90 basis point headwind on operating margins and the negative impact of currencies was 290 basis points. 
Interest expense increased to $5 million given our higher debt level. Second quarter other income increased $15 million to $14 million, largely due to a gain associated with an interest rate hedge settlement as well as net gains on foreign currency contracts and account balances. Our effective income tax rate for the second quarter was 28.7%, lower than last year's 31.2% due to the favorable impact of tax audits that were completed during the quarter. Second quarter net income increased $2 million to $55 million, largely due to nonoperating gains. 
Now turning to our cash flows and balance sheet. For the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $78 million versus $59 million a year ago. We drew down a net $48 million on our revolver. We invested $60 million in capital expenditures and $103 million to purchase roughly 1.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $82. We ended the quarter with $842 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We ended the quarter with $250 million in cash and $695 million in debt. 
Second quarter ending inventory totaled $669 million, a slight increase compared to last year. We're expecting some inventory growth in the third quarter and our goal is to realign with sales by year-end given changes to this year's demand. Accounts receivable decreased by 16% to $255 million, and wholesale DSOs improved by roughly 5 days. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $22 million for the quarter. 
Moving now to our outlook. And just for clarity, I will start with our assessment based on constant dollars, a like-for-like calendar to exclude the effects of last year's extra week as well as this year's restructuring charges. At the end, I will also give you the various data that include these items. 
Back to the business. We remain very excited about our prospects, our competitive position and our future. We operate a business model that is well-diversified and possess key strategic advantages that position us for strong share gains and a growing market over time. We generate strong cash flows and solid returns both in good and more challenging times. 
With the year now half behind us, the factors that we anticipated could affect our business for 2015 are generally coming to fruition, and we expected, on balance, that headwinds this year would be stronger than tailwinds. That is proving to be the case. We expected, with new entrants in our market, consumers could take a pause to evaluate new product offerings and divert spending away from traditional products. We expected to see brands continuing to ebb and flow in their natural life cycles, making it always a challenge to immediately fill in as customers taste shifts. We expected that there'll be certain markets where competitive pressures would be strong and where economic conditions might impact our ability to grow uniformly, and we expected that the currency environment would continue to put pressure on our operating results. 
With so much happening with consumers and in our markets today continues to be very challenging to gain greater visibility into near-term sales trends and demand. Our second quarter sales did not meet expectations, especially in our international markets, which resulted in a sequential slowdown in watch growth. In Europe, our U.K. business declined. Some of the change in trends there was caused by some operational changes we made last year, but we are very focused on understanding the underlying trends in the business there. Asia continues to be challenging for a variety of reasons. South Korea, which has been economically challenging for some time, was further impacted by MERS. Hong Kong and Macau have been weak, and China, which still represents a big opportunity long term, is taking longer to develop. 
We are advantaged with our diversified business model that we have the opportunity to pursue nearer-term opportunities like India and China, while continuing to invest in opportunities that may take longer to achieve. Newer brands like Kate Spade New York and Tory Burch, while contributing, are not yet driving outsized growth but are hot brands with enormous potential in international stature. We are seeing encouraging results thus far this year with the FOSSIL brand across all categories, and we have not yet begun our most significant marketing investment, which will start to support our business in the second half of this year. SKAGEN continues to make steady progress with continued strong double-digit growth in all markets. 
Strategically, we remain committed to the priorities we outlined at the beginning of the year, including investing in additional $35 million or $0.50 per share to support our most critical strategic priorities. In the second half, we are stepping up our marketing investments for FOSSIL and SKAGEN, focusing on bringing new customers into our stores, heavily leveraging digital channels and fresh creative to reach our target customers. 
For FOSSIL, we're launching a new global campaign in the third quarter that highlights the brand's heritage and personality through a cast of collaborators and influencers featuring our key product categories. The campaign has a fully integrated approach with emphasis on digital and social, along with print and strategic markets. Our investments are focused on markets and media that drove results at the end of last year. 
We're also investing in targeted digital marketing with key partners globally to support all channels of our business. We're continuing to invest in our multiyear, omni-channel roadmap that advances our capabilities to interact with consumers in a more digital, personally relevant and on-demand way. We're elevating our in-store and online experiences to improve conversion, engagement and overall consumer experience. This will include the rollout of tablets in all U.S. stores, better tools to capture customer data, both in-store and online, and a redesigned website that is optimized for mobile. 
We continue to pursue our entry into wearable technology and we have already made significant progress with the tech relationships that we have built. We see one of the biggest trends in fashion today as technology, and we have developed our initial suite of products for the FOSSIL brand expected in stores this fall. More products and more brands will follow in 2016. We continue to believe that with our great design capabilities, scale and world-class portfolio of brands, we can be the point where technology and great fashion come together. We believe that we can win here, where others can't. 
Considering then all of these factors, along with the trends we saw coming out of the first half of the year, we now expect full year constant dollar and constant calendar sales growth to range from a 3% increase to a 1% decrease. On the upper end, this range generally reflects our most recent trends, including tempered international expectations, but also includes an expectation of benefits from our FOSSIL investments as well as the potential for some further softening due to some of the headwinds that we've been experiencing this year. The lower end would accommodate even greater headwinds. For the third quarter, we are expecting constant dollar revenues to decline in the range between 3% and 8%. 
We do expect the third quarter will be our weakest quarter in terms of relative top line performance given the strong growth rates that we posted last year, especially in the Americas and in Europe. We continue to expect full year constant dollar gross margins to expand compared to last year. This is largely due to our efforts to increase margins through both targeted price increases as well as cost improvement initiatives in our supply chain. For the third quarter, we expect a similar gross margin profile. 
For the full year, excluding restructuring expenses, we expect to operate with a higher expense rate, driven primarily by the investments that we are making in marketing, omni-channel and connected accessories. Store and concession expenses will modestly increase the rates due mainly to stores that we added last year. Modestly offsetting these factors, we expect to achieve leverage from our overall global infrastructure. We expect that our third quarter expense profile will be similar to the full year. 
Based on a lower sales base, we now expect full year constant dollar operating margin between 14% and 15%. We now expect full year constant dollar earnings per share between $6.20 and $7 per share. For the third quarter, we expect operating margin between 13.5% and 15%. We expect third quarter constant dollar EPS between $1.45 and $1.70. These constant dollar estimates all assume a tax rate of about 31% and excludes the impact of restructuring charges.
For reported GAAP purposes, we're continuing to expect that currencies will consider significantly impact our reported numbers. Over the last quarter, the U.S. dollar, while still very strong, has been more stable against most of the currencies that affect us. So our reported guidance assumes roughly prevailing rates at both the high and low points of our guidance. 
Given that we've tempered our expectations for international growth this year, this will actually serve to reduce the overall currency headwind compared to our prior expectations. For the third quarter, our assumptions would yield a reported sales decline between 10% and 15%. We'd expect reported third quarter operating margin between 9.5% and 11%, and EPS between $1.03 and $1.28. This includes a restructuring charge of about $0.06 per share. For the full year, reported GAAP sales would decline between 4% and 8%. Operating margin would range between 10.5% and 11.5%, and EPS would range between $4.80 and $5.60, including a restructuring charge of $0.35 per share. 
Our guidance continues to assume higher interest costs due to higher levels of debt as well as continued investment in our share repurchase program, though, as we shared before, not at the same level as last year. We estimate capital expenditures for the year will be between $100 million and $110 million. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

With respect to the guidance, as we said on our prepared remarks, we always expect that 2015 would be challenging as much as there would be some fairly significant headwinds and the net headwinds would be greater than the tailwinds. And as we said, that certainly has proven to be the case with currencies, the entrance of new competitors, brands moving, economic choppiness in some markets. The American market performed pretty close to the way we expected in the first half as, in Asia, Asia was a little weaker. Europe was the standout for us. It was certainly weaker than we expected in the second quarter, and that largely drove the second quarter where our sales missed the top -- or the bottom of our range. So that's number one, is that we just missed our sales expectations for the second quarter. So as we look out for the remainder of the year, we're operating still with a fair amount of -- lack of visibility, as we always do, and that's exacerbated by some of the factors that we talked about. And Europe, while we're still evaluating that hard to better understand those dynamics, and there's a good probability that we're going to discover that a lot of the factors that are impacting the rest of the business is also affecting Europe. You've got some economic issues going on there, too, with continued impact of Greece and the Russian ruble and oil impacting our Middle East business. So Europe generally was softer than we expected. So what we wanted to do was adjust our expectations accordingly. And this year, we're operating now with sales expectations much wider than we had done certainly last year and implied in the back half of the year because, I think, to some extent, there's a little more uncertainty in the business in the back half of the year than we thought before. But for the same -- likely the same or similar reasons."

I think, the year's playing out pretty much like we've planned it in that regard. We're already seeing results from our demand creation and most of that spend starts in September. We're already seeing benefits from our omni-channel investments and our digital capabilities, so that's starting to happen. And I would say about wearable technology, our investments in working with partners, as a gossip point, we're actually probably more excited about wearable technology and its future right now than we were at the beginning of the year. So all in all, holding the SG&A flat and investing pretty heavily in our future, I think, is playing out pretty well, and we'll see how that goes."

Just on the guidance, if I get the midpoint of your third quarter sales guidance, it implies the fourth quarter is down only about 1%.

It looks pretty strong. We think we got a perfect setup for additional activity in the back of the year. So performance in North America is largely due to both FOSSIL and SKAGEN doing well. And as we mentioned, our comps were pretty strong. Our e-commerce business, because of all the activities we're doing, is -- has a lot of traffic on it, a lot of increases in traffic, increase in sales. We know it's driving traffic to our stores. Our analytics clearly show that. And we also know it's driving traffic to our wholesale partners, stores and their websites, so we're having the benefit that we expected.

That doesn't necessarily create a linear growth trajectory because you're up against last year. If you remember, last year, we had a very strong third quarter. We just -- and as we evaluated that performance, there were some inventory build that happened in the channel in the third quarter and that turned in the fourth, and our sales, I think, in the third quarter last year were up 10 and they were roughly flat in the fourth quarter. So a lot of the choppiness you see this year is the reciprocal, if you will, of what we saw last year. But generally, the assumption is, if the current trend continues, we do expect with the significant investments that we're making in FOSSIL and SKAGEN, we're very excited with the improvements we've seen thus far and we're really just beginning to invest in those brands, and we will lean in significantly more, so there'll be a lot more marketing support to support the FOSSIL brand in the back half of the year. So our goal is to see some uptick and we left some room for some further softening in some of the places where the business hasn't been as strong but generally operating at that current trend. And then, on the bottom of the range, we've assumed a more challenging performance."

So long term, we want to play in that environment. So it still remains a big whitespace for us.

It's going to be in our own stores plus other partners globally, so -- and the numbers will not be significant to us, it's mostly a pretty large test just to get an idea of how this is working. One thing to keep in mind is that, when we talk about wearables, it's not just smart watches. There's actually -- it's kind of crystallized into 3 different categories. First of all, there's the smart watch, which is the Android digital screen watch, which it looks really good for fall, and we think, over the next couple of years, will get better as it gets smaller and more robust, the technology gets better. We think that's got long-term legs as it continues to improve. And we also have non-display items like our bracelets, more like jewelry that are -- we think has the capability of creating an entirely new accessories category based around technology. And then, the third, and probably the most significant long term is what we call smarter watches, which is just adding chips and additional functionality to existing watches. So we're launching that this year, which is it's a watch, looks just like a regular analog watch but it does have a chip in it that gives measures, activity and sleep and also has notifications in it. So to a certain extent, you could say that what we're doing is moving towards, we think, someday, every watch we make will have some type of technology in it. What we have been making in the last 20 years are actually quartz watches largely, and these have -- basically, it's a quartz chip. So over time, by us adding additional functionality, sensors, as technology changes, we think that we can add this across our platform and have additional functionality in the watches and other products without a lot of additional cost. The additional benefit from it also is that there's an app that goes with these that measures people's activities, et cetera, and also enables us to get data from them and also build a community and the tie-in to our CRM and our marketing is really significant. So it's a lot of benefits for us, which is why we're so interested in it, and we think it, over time, could be a very significant thing to scale across our entire platform."

As we benchmark ourselves, other companies at this stage in their life cycle, top line was what really drove long-term value. So our goal is to really improve the health of our overall operating structure to really get the infrastructure lean and drive leverage to that and create the capacity to use that to reinvest in top line, and that's what you're seeing this year.

I will begin with a few prepared remarks before turning the call over to Dennis Secor, our Chief Financial Officer, and then we will open the call to answer any questions. 
For the second quarter, we delivered sales growth across all regions and earnings per share growth ahead of our expectations. From a top line perspective, our FOSSIL and SKAGEN brands drove the increase, and we also benefited from our recent addition of newer brands. Across all of our brands and categories, leathers and jewelry increased compared to last year, while watches were flat. 
Overall, there's a lot happening in our market right now. On the one hand, we are encouraged with the early reads on our own brand investments and expect to see continued improvements as we lean in even more in the second half of the year. We continue to leverage our strategic advantages to partner with the best fashion brands and companies in the world. On the other hand, we are adjusting to changing consumer shopping patterns and preferences as well as the natural progression of brands in their life cycles. We also see technology emerging at the latest trend in fashion, with the growing interest in wearable technology, inspiring new entrants into the watch space. We believe our key competitive advantages in design, sourcing and distribution, as well as the great brands in our portfolio, have us well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving landscape. 
Our anticipated launch of connected accessories later this year has the potential to energize the accessories category, given the innovation we are bringing to market and the strong consumer interest in the category. We operate a resilient and diversified model that benefits from scale, diversification and financial strength, and positions us well to win in the long term. 
The second quarter proved to be an example of this. Despite difficult economic conditions in some of our key markets as well as strong currency headwinds, we generated solid results and earnings per share that exceeded our expectations, aided by ongoing efforts to leverage our base infrastructure as well as our share repurchase activity. 
Turning to our key highlights for the quarter. We grew across all of our major geographies, the Americas, Europe and Asia. We grew our own brands, with both FOSSIL and SKAGEN delivering solid growth, led by watches. We delivered positive comps in our retail stores, and we continue to invest in initiatives that we believe can fuel our future growth while using our strong financial position to repurchase over $100 million of our stock for the benefit of our shareholders. 
For FOSSIL, the brand grew 6% in constant currency, with increases in all of our regions and solid growth in both watches and leathers. Across geographies, FOSSIL saw the strongest gains in Asia, followed by the Americas and Europe. Globally, our retail stores continued to deliver positive comps, led by the Americas region, and the brand saw very strong growth in the e-commerce channel. Overall, it was a solid quarter for the brand. We expect to build upon our momentum as we further invest to drive brand awareness and sharpen our analytic capabilities to measure returns on these investments to ensure we are directing our resources to areas that generate strong returns. 
In our retail channel, comp store sales increased 2%, with positive comps in our core category, watches, as well as leathers, where recent investments in the category including our design capabilities are driving positive changes in the assortment. 
For SKAGEN, the progress we continue to make with the brand is very encouraging. Constant currency sales increased over 20%, with solid double digit increases in all regions. Watches led the performance and we are also seeing positive responses to both leathers and jewelry. We continue to see great potential with SKAGEN through expanded global distribution, fueled by excitement around its unique positioning and design. 
As we continue our journey to become world-class in our digital capabilities, we made progress in advancing our CRM initiatives, our omni-channel capabilities and our digital experiences for our customers, all things that position us to engage customers in this very disruptive environment. We look forward to relaunching the FOSSIL brand website with improved mobile functionality later this quarter. 
We are excited to launch the upgraded site ahead of holiday, which will provide an enhanced customer experience and introduce rich brand content, positioning us to drive sales and further build interest in the FOSSIL brand. This quarter, we also made significant progress in developing connected accessories. This is a category we are increasingly excited about, given the significant consumer interest in the space. We remain on track to launch our first products under the FOSSIL brand in the fall. We are finalizing our plans for distribution, which will include our FOSSIL stores and select wholesale distribution and are very pleased with the functionality and the design of the product. While these are only the first generation of products, we're excited to enter the space and learn from the initial assortment. We'll incorporate our learnings in the next generation of products as well as introduce new products under additional brands in 2016. 
We continue to leverage our partnerships with technology leaders as we look to scale technology across our platform of products and brands. We believe this will add heat to our categories and drive increases in awareness and sales. 
Turning to our multi-brand watch portfolio. As you know, our objective is to leverage what we do best, exercise our strategic advantages in design, production and distribution to gain share in the global watch market and extend our leadership position. While we believe that we have the most desirable fashion brands in our portfolio, we know that all brands evolve through life cycles over time and we are experiencing that with our own brand strengthening while other brands in the portfolio are not growing as fast. During the second quarter, our multi-brand watch portfolio was flat to last year, a disappointing performance for the quarter, as growth in the Americas was offset by slight declines in Europe and Asia compared to last year. 
In our international markets, we believe Europe and Asia represent a significant opportunity to gain share, particularly given that we are underpenetrated in many markets around the world. Specific to the second quarter, however, we feel our growth was impacted by unique market-specific conditions that we believe will move in our favor over time. 
In Europe, while our business did grow in constant dollars, we saw some softness in parts of our business. This was especially true over the U.K. where performance was also impacted by accelerated Q2 shipments last year as we transitioned our warehouse there. Our business in Germany was not as strong as we expected, while we did see some strong double-digit growth in France. In Asia, our business grew but did not meet our expectations. The MERS outbreak in South Korea and economic downturns affecting Hong Kong and Macau are putting pressure on our near-term results. China continues to be tough with economic, political and distribution challenges there, making it difficult to drive near-term growth. On a positive note, markets like Japan, Australia and India continue to grow, with India posting strong double digit growth in the quarter. 
We don't believe the quarter's performance is indicative of the true potential of the international business and continue to believe the market share opportunity available to us in the regions is very meaningful. We believe we are poised to succeed in our international markets as the same market dynamics that help drive our significant share gains in United States play out across the globe. We continue to have opportunities to drive brands through our existing distribution in Europe, as well as expand in new markets in there. And in Asia, where we feel market demographics will skew in our favor, we are well-positioned to take advantage of fashion brands emerging to take share from traditional watch brands. 
As we entered the year, we identified several disruptive factors that were going to make 2015 challenging. We expected visibility would be difficult, with new entrants moving into our market. While we feel this will energize the category in the long term as we add technology to our products, the near-term implications seem to be playing out. Also, the natural ebbs and flows of brands in their life cycles can create volatility in sales patterns as consumer preferences evolve around the globe. And currencies have put a significant strain on our near-term results. With that in mind, we remain focused on pursuing the investments that we believe are most critical to our long-term success. 
As a company with significant competitive advantages, we are moving quickly with changes in our business. We are ramping up innovation across the board in design, technology and marketing. We believe our competitive positioning and a strong balance sheet are even more advantageous in a challenging economic and currency environment, as we have the financial flexibility to invest in innovation and our growth initiatives to increase our global watch and accessories market share. We remain intently focused on executing to the key objectives that we believe position us to accelerate sales growth and we have already seen traction from the initiatives we are embarking on to drive toward our objectives. 
First, we're investing in our own brands, FOSSIL and SKAGEN, which have already delivered solid first half growth. We're making additional investments in the second half, and we expect to see even stronger results later this year. Second, we're well on our way to enhancing our digital capabilities including omni-channel retailing and e-commerce. We're taking big strides in developing a robust platform and have already seen a sharp uptick in online sales for the first half. 
And finally, connected accessories. We are leveraging the significant partnerships that we've built and are on track with products that will hit our stores in the fall. We think this will be an important driver in the years ahead. 
At the same time, we continue to see significant potential to expand our watch portfolio sales with long-standing brands as well as the benefit of new brands including Tory Burch, Kate Spade New York and Chaps in 2016. We expect continued expansion in the other categories we offer such as in leathers and jewelry and soon to be connected accessories. We also still have significant growth ahead of us internationally, with Asia representing our biggest opportunity by far. While we recognize that pockets of our business are challenging and may remain so in the short term, overall, we remain excited about the many strategic initiatives we are implementing through the remainder of the year and our potential to ignite future growth. 
The world is changing quickly, and so are we, positioning the company for long-term sustainable growth in an evolving environment. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Dennis for more comments."

Second quarter net sales increased 2% in constant dollars, and on a reported basis, declined 4% to $740 million. While we delivered constant dollar increases across all regions, sales came in below our expectations as both Europe and Asia grew at a lower rate than we anticipated. For the quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $1.12 compared to $0.98 last year. This quarter's EPS benefited by roughly $0.09 of non-operating gains, $0.04 from a lower tax rate related to second quarter audits and a net $0.05 related to financing activities. 
Compared to EPS in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, this quarter's results was negatively impacted by roughly $0.30 due to currencies and another $0.10 due to our restructuring charges. Constant currency sales growth and a lower share count combined with nonoperating gains to drive the year-over-year comparison. Overall, operating expenses decreased compared to last year, primarily driven by changes in foreign currencies. In constant dollars and excluding restructuring costs, expenses were flat to last year despite the impact of new store additions from last year that we had yet to anniversary. 
Before I get into second quarter details, let me share some insight on our first half performance as our reported results tend to obscure what we consider our core earnings per share. Thus far, in 2015, our reported results have absorbed $0.43 of currency headwinds and $0.27 of restructuring charges. We've also benefited $0.09 from the tax and financing activity I just mentioned. Factoring out those items, we delivered first half core EPS that is nearly 13% higher than the comparable period last year. 
Now specific to the second quarter, FOSSIL sales increased 6% in constant dollars. Solid growth in watches and leathers more than offset the decline in jewelry. Sales for the brand increased in all 3 regions, with Asia delivering a mid-teen increase. While still a relatively small part of the business for the brand, the e-commerce channel drove solid double-digit increases with higher traffic and improved conversion rates, early indications that we feel tell us our demand creation initiatives are working. 
SKAGEN sales grew 21% in constant dollars with growth in all 3 regions including 20-plus percent growth in Europe and the Americas. Strong double-digit watch growth drove the business with solid increases in leathers and jewelry as well. E-commerce sales for SKAGEN also increased nicely, driven by higher traffic. 
In constant dollars, our multi-brand watch portfolio was flat to last year, with increases in the Americas offsetting declines in our international regions. In the Americas, reported sales increased 1% to $386 million, a 3% constant dollar increase, which aligns with our first quarter trend. The increase was driven by growth across all 3 categories, with watches and leathers driving the volume and jewelry increasing in the mid-teens as the Michael Kors brand drove the category. Across brands, constant dollar sales for the FOSSIL, SKAGEN and Armani brands increased in the quarter, and we benefited from the addition of Kate Spade New York. Michael Kors brand sales declined slightly as very strong jewelry growth nearly offset lower sell-in watches. The overall regional sales increase was driven by our retail stores, which delivered a solid positive comp, propelled by improved conversion resulting from compelling promotions in our outlet. Traffic was down again in the region. We continue to drive a significant increase in our e-commerce business across all of our websites and posted a solid double-digit gain in the quarter. 
Constant dollar wholesale sales were flat to last year, with international increases offsetting declines in the United States. U.S. department store business, where we have planned the business down this year, continued to be soft. While this is likely to continue, we also expect that growth from our direct business can drive overall growth in this region. 
In Europe, reported sales decreased 12% to $228 million, while constant dollar sales increased to 2%. Growth in jewelry and leathers offset a slight decline in watches. Growth in the region was softer than expected, particularly in watches, with overall sales in major markets such as Germany roughly flat and Italy and the U.K. down to last year. The performance in the U.K. was at least partially attributable to a strong performance in the second quarter of last year when some orders were shipped early ahead of the warehouse transition. France drove the slight increase for the region during the quarter. 
Both FOSSIL and SKAGEN grew during the quarter, with notable strength in watches. And the Michael Kors brand grew in the quarter, driven by strong jewelry sales along with watch growth in boutiques. Within the portfolio, nearly all of the licensed brands posted slight declines for the quarter. In the region, our sales growth was driven by our retail channels, where comp store sales increased slightly driven by our outlet stores. 
In Asia, reported sales decreased 6% to $126 million, while constant dollar sales increased 1%. Growth in leathers offset a slight decline in watches, while jewelry was roughly flat. India, Japan and Australia were our strongest performing markets and the growth was partially offset by continued weakness in South Korea and the decline in China. Michael Kors, FOSSIL and SKAGEN were our strongest performers with each of the brands delivering solid double-digit gains. Comp store sales decreased modestly in the region, with the strongest performance coming from the outlet stores. 
In the quarter, gross profit decreased to $410 million and gross margin declined 220 basis points to 55.3%. The decrease was primarily driven by changes in foreign currencies. Excluding currencies, gross margin expanded in the quarter, mainly due to the favorable impact of our pricing initiatives, partially offset by the impact of continued outlet promotions as we hadn't yet lapped promotional changes that we initiated last year. 
Second quarter operating expenses decreased 6% to $339 million, largely due to the impact of changes in foreign currency, and included a $7 million restructuring charge directed at optimizing our operating structure and improving retail profitability. Excluding the impact of currencies and restructuring, operating expenses were flat to last year. Store expenses were higher mainly due to store investments we made last year that had yet to anniversary. Infrastructure expenses were down, as were customer engagement cost and marketing, though the latter change is due mainly to timing, including this year's earlier Baselworld. 
Thus far this year, our constant dollar expenses, setting aside restructuring charges, have increased principally in those areas that directly touch the customer. Infrastructure spending thus far is flat, while marketing and customer engagement investments have increased over 10%. For the second half, we plan to lean in more on these marketing investments with a goal to ignite our business both for the near and long term. Our second quarter operating expense rate was 45.8% compared to 46.5% last year, primarily due to these same factors. 
Operating income decreased to $70 million, including a $28 million unfavorable currency impact. Operating margin decreased to 9.5% compared to 11% last year, due mainly to the impact of currencies. Restructuring charges created a 90 basis point headwind on operating margins and the negative impact of currencies was 290 basis points. 
Interest expense increased to $5 million given our higher debt level. Second quarter other income increased $15 million to $14 million, largely due to a gain associated with an interest rate hedge settlement as well as net gains on foreign currency contracts and account balances. Our effective income tax rate for the second quarter was 28.7%, lower than last year's 31.2% due to the favorable impact of tax audits that were completed during the quarter. Second quarter net income increased $2 million to $55 million, largely due to nonoperating gains. 
Now turning to our cash flows and balance sheet. For the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $78 million versus $59 million a year ago. We drew down a net $48 million on our revolver. We invested $60 million in capital expenditures and $103 million to purchase roughly 1.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $82. We ended the quarter with $842 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We ended the quarter with $250 million in cash and $695 million in debt. 
Second quarter ending inventory totaled $669 million, a slight increase compared to last year. We're expecting some inventory growth in the third quarter and our goal is to realign with sales by year-end given changes to this year's demand. Accounts receivable decreased by 16% to $255 million, and wholesale DSOs improved by roughly 5 days. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $22 million for the quarter. 
Moving now to our outlook. And just for clarity, I will start with our assessment based on constant dollars, a like-for-like calendar to exclude the effects of last year's extra week as well as this year's restructuring charges. At the end, I will also give you the various data that include these items. 
Back to the business. We remain very excited about our prospects, our competitive position and our future. We operate a business model that is well-diversified and possess key strategic advantages that position us for strong share gains and a growing market over time. We generate strong cash flows and solid returns both in good and more challenging times. 
With the year now half behind us, the factors that we anticipated could affect our business for 2015 are generally coming to fruition, and we expected, on balance, that headwinds this year would be stronger than tailwinds. That is proving to be the case. We expected, with new entrants in our market, consumers could take a pause to evaluate new product offerings and divert spending away from traditional products. We expected to see brands continuing to ebb and flow in their natural life cycles, making it always a challenge to immediately fill in as customers taste shifts. We expected that there'll be certain markets where competitive pressures would be strong and where economic conditions might impact our ability to grow uniformly, and we expected that the currency environment would continue to put pressure on our operating results. 
With so much happening with consumers and in our markets today continues to be very challenging to gain great visibility into near-term sales trends and demand. Our second quarter sales did not meet expectations, especially in our international markets, which resulted in a sequential slowdown in watch growth. In Europe, our U.K. business declined. Some of the change in trends there was caused by some operational changes we made last year, but we are very focused on understanding the underlying trends in the business there. Asia continues to be challenging for a variety of reasons. South Korea, which has been economically challenging for some time, was further impacted by MERS. Hong Kong and Macau have been weak, and China, which still represents a big opportunity long term, is taking longer to develop. 
We are advantaged with our diversified business model that we have the opportunity to pursue nearer-term opportunities like India and China, while continuing to invest in opportunities that may take longer to achieve. Newer brands like Kate Spade New York and Tory Burch, while contributing, are not yet driving outsized growth but are hot brands with enormous potential in international stature. We are seeing encouraging results thus far this year with the FOSSIL brand across all categories, and we have not yet begun our most significant marketing investment, which will start to support our business in the second half of this year. SKAGEN continues to make steady progress with continued strong double-digit growth in all markets. 
Strategically, we remain committed to the priorities we outlined at the beginning of the year, including investing an additional $35 million or $0.50 per share to support our most critical strategic priorities. In the second half, we are stepping up our marketing investments for FOSSIL and SKAGEN, focusing on bringing new customers into our stores, heavily leveraging digital channels and fresh creative to reach our target customers. 
For FOSSIL, we're launching a new global campaign in the third quarter that highlights the brand's heritage and personality through a cast of collaborators and influencers featuring our key product categories. The campaign has a fully integrated approach with emphasis on digital and social, along with print and strategic markets. Our investments are focused on markets and media that drove results at the end of last year. 
We're also investing in targeted digital marketing with key partners globally to support all channels of our business. We're continuing to invest in our multiyear, omni-channel roadmap that advances our capabilities to interact with consumers in a more digital, personally relevant and on-demand way. We're elevating our in-store and online experiences to improve conversion, engagement and overall consumer experience. This will include the rollout of tablets in all U.S. stores, better tools to capture customer data, both in-store and online, and a redesigned website that is optimized for mobile. 
We continue to pursue our entry into wearable technology and we have already made significant progress with the tech relationships that we have built. We see one of the biggest trends in fashion today as technology, and we have developed our initial suite of products for the FOSSIL brand expected in stores this fall. More products and more brands will follow in 2016. We continue to believe that with our great design capabilities, scale and world-class portfolio of brands, we can be the point where technology and great fashion come together. We believe that we can win here, where others can't. 
Considering then all of these factors, along with the trends we saw coming out of the first half of the year, we now expect full year constant dollar and constant calendar sales growth to range from a 3% increase to a 1% decrease. On the upper end, this range generally reflects our most recent trends, including tempered international expectations, but also includes an expectation of benefits from our FOSSIL investments as well as the potential for some further softening due to some of the headwinds that we've been experiencing this year. The lower end would accommodate even greater headwinds. For the third quarter, we are expecting constant dollar revenues to decline in the range between 3% and 8%. 
We do expect the third quarter will be our weakest quarter in terms of relative top line performance given the strong growth rates that we posted last year, especially in the Americas and in Europe. We continue to expect full year constant dollar gross margins to expand compared to last year. This is largely due to our efforts to increase margins through both targeted price increases as well as cost improvement initiatives in our supply chain. For the third quarter, we expect a similar gross margin profile. 
For the full year, excluding restructuring expenses, we expect to operate with a higher expense rate, driven primarily by the investments that we are making in marketing, omni-channel and connected accessories. Store and concession expenses will modestly increase the rates due mainly to stores that we added last year. Modestly offsetting these factors, we expect to achieve leverage from our overall global infrastructure. We expect that our third quarter expense profile will be similar to the full year. 
Based on a lower sales base, we now expect full year constant dollar operating margin between 14% and 15%. We now expect full year constant dollar earnings per share between $6.20 and $7 per share. For the third quarter, we expect operating margin between 13.5% and 15%. We expect third quarter constant dollar EPS between $1.45 and $1.70. These constant dollar estimates all assume a tax rate of about 31% and excludes the impact of restructuring charges.
For reported GAAP purposes, we're continuing to expect that currencies will consider significantly impact our reported numbers. Over the last quarter, the U.S. dollar, while still very strong, has been more stable against most of the currencies that affect us. So our reported guidance assumes roughly prevailing rates at both the high and low points of our guidance. 
Given that we've tempered our expectations for international growth this year, this will actually serve to reduce the overall currency headwind compared to our prior expectations. For the third quarter, our assumptions would yield a reported sales decline between 10% and 15%. We'd expect reported third quarter operating margin between 9.5% and 11%, and EPS between $1.03 and $1.28. This includes a restructuring charge of about $0.06 per share. For the full year, reported GAAP sales would decline between 4% and 8%. Operating margin would range between 10.5% and 11.5%, and EPS would range between $4.80 and $5.60, including a restructuring charge of $0.35 per share. 
Our guidance continues to assume higher interest costs due to higher levels of debt as well as continued investment in our share repurchase program, though, as we shared before, not at the same level as last year. We estimate capital expenditures for the year will be between $100 million and $110 million. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

If I look at your second half guidance where it was 90 days ago versus where it is today, ex currency, of course, it's certainly come down a lot. Has something changed? And obviously, it looks like international business is a little bit slower. Is that the only key driver there? Are there other things you're seeing in the watch marketplace that are causing you to see a much lower revenue number in the second half versus what you're thinking? And then, related, as I look at the things you're talking about on the call, connected accessories, you're really ramping up the marketing and brand investments around FOSSIL and SKAGEN, should we take that to read in a corporate level view across the watch category that's changed?"

With respect to the guidance, as we said on our prepared remarks, we always expect that 2015 would be challenging as much as there would be some fairly significant headwinds and the net headwinds would be greater than the tailwinds. And as we said, that certainly has proven to be the case with currencies, the entrance of new competitors, brands moving, economic choppiness in some markets. The American market performed pretty close to the way we expected in the first half as, in Asia, Asia was a little weaker. Europe was the standout for us. It was certainly weaker than we expected in the second quarter, and that largely drove the second quarter where our sales missed the top -- or the bottom of our range. So that's number one, is that we just missed our sales expectations for the second quarter. So as we look out for the remainder of the year, we're operating still with a fair amount of -- lack of visibility, as we always do, and that's exacerbated by some of the factors that we talked about. And Europe, while we're still evaluating that hard to better understand those dynamics, and there's a good probability that we're going to discover that a lot of the factors that are impacting the rest of the business is also affecting Europe. You've got some economic issues going on there, too, with continued impact of Greece and the Russian ruble and oil impacting our Middle East business. So Europe generally was softer than we expected. So what we wanted to do was adjust our expectations accordingly. And this year, we're operating now with sales expectations much wider than we had done certainly last year and implied in the back half of the year because, I think, to some extent, there's a little more uncertainty in the business in the back half of the year than we thought before. But for the same -- likely the same or similar reasons."

We're already seeing benefits from our omni-channel investments and our digital capabilities, so that's starting to happen. And I would say about wearable technology, our investments and working with partners has got us to the point where we're actually probably more excited about wearable technology and its future right now than we were at the beginning of the year. So all in all, holding the SG&A flat and investing pretty heavily in our future, I think, is playing out pretty well, and we'll see how it works."

It looks pretty strong. We think we got a perfect setup for additional activity in the back of the year. So performance in North America is largely due to both FOSSIL and SKAGEN doing well. And as we mentioned, our comps were pretty strong. Our e-commerce business, because of all the activities we're doing, is -- has a lot of traffic on it, a lot of increases in traffic, increase in sales. We know it's driving traffic to our stores. Our analytics clearly show that. And we also know it's driving traffic to our wholesale partners, stores and their websites, so we're having the benefit that we expected. And we think that by -- in North America, by continuing to do this plus adding wearable technology later this year and next year, we think we're in a pretty good place to continue to gain share in the U.S."

That doesn't necessarily create a linear growth trajectory because you're up against last year. If you remember, last year, we had a very strong third quarter. We just -- and as we evaluated that performance, there were some inventory build that happened in the channel in the third quarter and that turned in the fourth, and our sales, I think, in the third quarter last year were up 10 and they were roughly flat in the fourth quarter. So a lot of the choppiness you see this year is the reciprocal, if you will, of what we saw last year. But generally, the assumption is, if the current trend continues, we do expect with the significant investments that we're making in FOSSIL and SKAGEN, we're very excited with the improvements we've seen thus far and we're really just beginning to invest in those brands, and we will lean in significantly more, so there'll be a lot more marketing support to support the FOSSIL brand in the back half of the year. So our goal is to see some uptick and we left some room for some further softening in some of the places where the business hasn't been as strong but generally operating at that current trend. And then, on the bottom of the range, we've assumed a more challenging performance."

In terms of below the line, if you will, I think you should always anticipate in an environment where currency is a headwind given that we hedge that, when you're talking about GAAP -- reported GAAP number that you would have some benefit from the currency contracts that we have. Generally, that would be the rational expectation down there as well as always consider the fact that we have taken on debt as we need to look at interest rate, which, over the last few years -- our interest expense rather, which has been growing as we've taken on some more debt. Our share repurchase, I'd just remind you that we did say this year that we would not expect to be buying as many shares as we did last year and the year before that as that was largely driven by taking on some debt on the balance sheet overall. Thinking forward, we haven't guided to '16, but -- and so we'll provide more insight as we get to that point. But just generally speaking, if you look at the pattern of currencies, you would expect still some additional -- if currencies now flattened out now for the rest of next year, you'd probably still have some headwinds at the beginning of the year, largely in the first quarter, and then my definition on my example here, they would neutralize for the rest of the year."

It's going to be in our own stores plus other partners globally, so -- and the numbers will not be significant to us, it's mostly a pretty large test just to get an idea of how this is working. One thing to keep in mind is that, when we talk about wearables, it's not just smart watches. There's actually -- it's kind of crystallized into 3 different categories. First of all, there's the smart watch, which is the Android digital screen watch, which it looks really good for fall, and we think, over the next couple of years, will get better as it gets smaller and more robust, the technology gets better. We think that's got long-term legs as it continues to improve. And we also have non-display items like our bracelets, more like jewelry that are -- we think has the capability of creating an entirely new accessories category based around technology. And then, the third, and probably the most significant long term is what we call smarter watches, which is just adding chips and additional functionality to existing watches. So we're launching that this year, which is it's a watch, looks just like a regular analog watch but it does have a chip in it that gives measures, activity and sleep and also has notifications in it. So to a certain extent, you could say that what we're doing is moving towards, we think, someday, every watch we make will have some type of technology in it. What we have been making over the last many years are actually quartz watches largely, and these have -- basically, it's a quartz chip. So over time, by us adding additional functionality, sensors, as technology changes, we think that we can add this across our platform and have additional functionality in the watches and other products without a lot of additional cost. The additional benefit from it also is that there's an app that goes with these that measures people's activities, et cetera, and also enables us to get data from them and also build a community and the tie-in to our CRM and our marketing is really significant. So it's a lot of benefits for us, which is why we're so interested in it, and we think it, over time, could be a very significant thing to scale across our entire platform."

Following his prepared remarks, Greg McKelvey, our Chief Strategy and Marketing Officer, will join us for Q&A. 
For the third quarter, we delivered sales and earnings within our expectations. Given last year's strong third quarter, we knew that comparisons would be tough and that proved to be the case. From a top line perspective and in constant currency, overall sales declined 8%. While we are certainly not satisfied with that result, we executed well and delivered solid results in several parts of our business. Our initiative to drive our own brand is gaining traction as both FOSSIL and SKAGEN grew even amidst a difficult environment. In constant currency, our leathers and jewelry businesses both continued to grow in the half or the full year and our digital and omni-channel initiatives drove strong growth in our e-commerce channel. 
The channel remains with our watch business, which declined in the quarter. The traditional watch category remains sluggish as tech-enabled devices offer consumers additional choices. Compounding net negative impact is the fact that we are lapping the historical outsized success of the Michael Kors brand. As a company with significant competitive advantages, we are moving quickly and ramping up innovation and design, marketing and technology to change the current trend in our business and continue to increase our share in the global watch and accessories market.
During the quarter, the FOSSIL brand grew 2% in constant currency, with increases in each of our regions and global growth led by leathers and watches. We launched the new FOSSIL website during the quarter that incorporates compelling brand content and stories and enhanced customer shopping experience, improved mobile capability and behind-the-scenes and world-class content management system, which is a critical element in support of our omni-channel initiatives. The new website positions us to further build interest in the brand, drive sales through an improved shopping experience and learn more about our customer and further develop their relationship with the brand.
While not a third quarter development, last month, we launched our first connected accessory product with the FOSSIL Q product line. This is our first-generation of wearable technology products that combines fashion and functionality. We know that customers are interested in technology and FOSSIL Q allows us to bring together fashion and function in the assortment. The reaction has been very positive, not only to the product but the entire platform including the software application developed for users. We distributed the assortment through select FOSSIL retail doors and completely sold out the entire production quantity intended for our select wholesale partners. 
I want to share a bit more about FOSSIL Q so you can appreciate the elements of the offering and understand our excitement. We created a line of fashionable connected accessories that showcases our design excellence and expert craftsmanship. In the stores out are 2 styles of watches that are on display and 2 styles of tracker devices or connected bracelets. The FOSSIL Q Dreamer and Reveler are designed for both men and women in our nondisplay fashion activity trackers that include notification alerts in the form of vibrations and LED lights with a battery life lasting up to 1 week. The FOSSIL Q Grant is one of our top-selling traditional analog watch styles for both men and women, infused with technology that interacts with a smartphone and notifies the wearer of messages and phone calls from selected context through an LED indicator and general vibration. This battery also lasts up to a week. Available at the end of the month, the FOSSIL Q Founder is our connected watch with display that utilizes Android wear and is one of the first digital display watches to offer full compatibility with virtually all smartphones. This product allows the wearer to customize our watch face as well as other features will utilizing the FOSSIL Q app. 
The FOSSIL Q app was designed to be the command center for all the FOSSIL Q products. It allows us to uniquely interact with customer, provides important functionality like smart notifications and allows customers to learn more about themselves from tracking physical activities to counting calories and connect seamlessly to other fitness apps that customers might already be using. The exciting thing about the app is the opportunity to eventually carry the functionality across the brands in our licensed portfolio and create a unique specialized branded experience for the customer. This will enable brands such as Michael Kors and others to compete in the connected accessories category and to attract new customers. 
So overall, for FOSSIL, a good third quarter, a nice start to connected accessories in October, and we hope to build on the momentum. We look forward to seeing how the assortment performs for the holiday period, and the team is already hard at work on future generations of product. 
As for SKAGEN, the brand had another good quarter with constant currency double-digit global growth and increases in each of our regions. Watches led the performance and we've also seen continued positive responses to both leathers and jewelry. We continue to see great potential with SKAGEN through expanded global distribution fueled by excitement around its unique positioning and design. 
Turning to our multibrand watch portfolio. During the third quarter, our multibrand watch portfolio was down 11% to last year in constant currency, a disappointing performance, with declines across our 3 regions and with a single brand driving the vast majority of that decline. We expected a tough quarter and given last year's strong performance, the historical strength of the Michael Kors brand and consumers' gravitation towards technology. We believe we have the best fashion brands in our portfolio and are focused on driving innovation including designs, colors, styles and now technology to drive growth in this portion of our business. We are enjoying the benefit of having Kate Spade in the portfolio and the team is working to further develop the assortment so we can fully leverage our distribution platform and expand the brand's presence globally. The team is also focused on developing the Chaps assortment ahead of its launch in early 2016.
In our international markets, we are being faced with near-term macro challenges, particularly in Asia and China. While we believe the same market dynamics that help drive our significant share gains in the U.S. will play out in the region over time, the current headwinds are impacting our business as traffic is challenged and economic conditions are volatile. In Asia, we believe the market demographics will eventually move in our favor given the expected significant growth of the middle-class, and we are well positioned to take advantage of fashion brands emerging to take share from traditional watch brands. 
As for Europe, we also continue to see longer-term opportunities as we go in new markets and add more brands to our existing distribution. Over the last couple of years, Europe has been a strong driver of growth for us, but those tailwinds have quickly turned to headwinds and we are now experiencing many of the same challenges we've seen in other markets. 
Now we will shift here from our third quarter performance and talk about the market we find ourselves in today and how we are responding to the challenges and the opportunity. As we discussed last quarter, it's a very dynamic and exciting time in retail and particularly in our space. With disruption in the market comes opportunity to take advantage of growth and changing trends. It reminds us of the last time we faced segment growth, which is in 2008. We regrouped and refocused our efforts on design and innovation and position FOSSIL Group for strong growth. While today's source of disruption in the market is different than it was at that time, our sense of determination focus and drive for innovation hasn't changed. And with the strength of FOSSIL Q, we've already proven our ability to identify and fill voids within a trending category, delivering fashion and function that sets us apart from our peers. 
Currently, technology is emerging as the latest trend in fashion, with the growing interest in wearable technology inspiring new entrants into the watch space as well as explosive growth in activity trackers. Our acquisition of Misfit will allow us to combine our key competitive advantages in design, sourcing and distribution and powerful brands with a business that is already a recognized player in technology-infused accessories and possesses a world-class software and hardware engineering team to stay ahead of emerging technology trends. You can find additional information regarding Misfit and their technology platform and the connected accessories opportunity in the slide presentation on our Investor Relations website.
For those of you that do not know Misfit, it is a company that started just a few years ago and is led by Sonny Vu, a highly [indiscernible] thought leader in the wearable technology space. They have a robust product pipeline focused on exciting tech-enabled experiences across multiple distribution channels including consumer technology, healthcare, enterprise and wholesale. We are excited to have Sonny join us as the President and Chief Technology Officer of connected devices here at FOSSIL Group as well as the rest of the team at Misfit. 
As we have told many of you, we envision the day when watches and accessories across all of our brands will be connected devices. With the acquisition of Misfit, FOSSIL Group will be uniquely positioned to lead the convergence of style and technology to become the fashion gateway to the high-growth, wearable technology and connected device markets. This acquisition accelerates our ability to compete in the connected accessories space, as we expand our addressable market while leveraging in all the design and scale with which we serve the existing watch market. We are very excited about this acquisition for many reasons. 
First, Misfit's culture and qualities are aligned with FOSSIL Group. Like us, Misfit has an energetic culture that embraces innovation. Their team of roughly 200 people includes a highly talented engineering group that is focused on new technologies and functionality for accessories. On top of this, Misfit shares our appreciation for design and branding with the use of color and unique style that surpasses others in the space. And they have a holistic approach to technology that improves the quality of life with the integration of data tracking. We expect to integrate Misfit's technology platform into our FOSSIL and SKAGEN brands and have the opportunity to do the same across our portfolio of powerful brands.
Second, Misfit is a globally recognized wearable technology brand in the activity tracker space there. As many of you are aware, the activity tracker space is one of the fastest-growing segments in accessories, given strong consumer interest in learning more about health wellness and improving quality of life. We believe some of the headwinds we have been experiencing resulted from a lack of technology in our core business, and this acquisition will allow us to quickly start turning those headwinds as tailwinds. 
And third, we see a significant opportunity to drive top line growth. We expect to accelerate Misfit sales growth as we leverage our distribution platform and their pipeline of innovative products. We will also leverage Misfit's scalable cloud and app platform and its a world-class engineering team to develop cutting-edge technology-infused products for our portfolio beginning in holiday of 2016. Sonny and the team at Misfit will collaborate with FOSSIL Group to develop new functionality for accessories that is relevant for our brands and customers.
And while the near term, our focus will be on driving sales growth, we also see margin expansion opportunities longer-term from the added scale Misfit will bring to our company. This is a very exciting development for FOSSIL Group and we believe it is a great investment in the future of the company. 
Overall, we continue to believe based on independent forecast that the watch category will grow over the next several years. Beyond that, we believe that technology can expand that growth by bringing new customers, those that don't traditionally wear watches into the space. Within that category, and with our strategic advantages, the design, branding and distribution, we believe we are poised to gain share. While recently we believe we have been disadvantaged as the fashion trend in watches is about technology, with Misfit, we believe we are poised to capitalize on today's fashion in a differentiated way that helps consumers enhance their lives. Simply put, we will marry fashion with technology and distribute it with strong branding across our distribution platform. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Dennis for more comments."

I'd like to start with discussing our third quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year before going into additional detail regarding the Misfit acquisition. Third quarter net sales decrease",3275,"Thanks, Kosta, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start with discussing our third quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year before going into additional detail regarding the Misfit acquisition. 
Third quarter net sales decreased 8% and on a reported basis declined 14% to $771 million. While sales overall were soft, partially due to the strong quarter we experienced in 2014, they came in at the low end of our expectations. For the quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $1.19 compared to $1.96 last year. Compared to the third quarter of 2014, this quarter's EPS was negatively impacted by roughly $0.40 due to currencies and another $0.05 due to our restructuring charges. Our investments to support our strategic initiatives and enhance marketing totaled about $0.19 per share and the current quarter benefited $0.13 due to a lower tax rate.
FOSSIL sales increased 2% in constant dollars. Leathers and watches grew while jewelry was flat. Sales for the brand increased in all 3 regions with the highest growth in Asia. The brand drove positive comps in Europe and a double-digit increase in our global e-com business, driven by higher traffic and improved conversion rates. 
SKAGEN sales grew 10% in constant dollars with growth in all 3 regions. Solid growth in watches drove the business with increases in leathers and jewelry as well. In constant dollars, our multibrand watch portfolio declined 11% compared to last year, partially due to last year's tough 12% comparison, but also it is clear that technology is putting pressure on the traditional watch category. Compounding this effect is the fact that we have brands in our portfolio that are lapping historically explosive growth. 
In the Americas, reported sales decreased 11% to $391 million, a 10% constant dollar decrease. The decrease was driven by watches as the decline in the category offset modest growth in leathers and jewelry. Across brands, constant dollar sales for the Armani brands, SKAGEN and FOSSIL increased during the quarter, and we continue to benefit from the addition of Kate Spade in New York. The remainder of the brands within the portfolio declined.
Within the region, growth in the retail channel was driven by a strong performance in Canada, which was offset by a decline in wholesale sales. Comp store sales declined slightly as traffic continued to be down in the region particularly in markets that benefit from heavy tourism. We're pleased with our e-com results where sales increased across all of our websites. Constant dollar wholesale sales were down to last year, largely driven by U.S. department stores where the business continues to be soft. 
In Europe, the sharp change in trend that we experienced in the second quarter continued into the third as reported sales decreased 15% to $260 million. Constant dollar sales decreased 3%. Modest growth in jewelry and leathers offset the decline in watches. The decline in the region was driven by the licensed portfolio, offsetting growth in FOSSIL and SKAGEN, where watches drove the growth in both brands. Within the region, declines in distributor markets and the U.K. offset slight increases in France and Italy. In the region, growth in the retail channel was driven by new stores and positive comps including a solid performance in FOSSIL stores. Our e-com business performed very well in the quarter with strong double-digit growth supported by more effective investments in marketing. 
In Asia, reported sales decreased 19% to $120 million, while constant dollar sales decreased 10%. Growth in leathers offset a decline in watches and a slight decline in jewelry. Strong growth in India was offset by declines in most markets in the region including Korea, Hong Kong and China, where general economic sluggishness and changing travel patterns continue to impact our business. Michael Kors, FOSSIL and SKAGEN were our strongest performers with each of the brands delivering increases. Comp store sales decreased in the region.
Before I move past sales, let me pause and provide some additional context. To reiterate Kosta's point, we are not satisfied with our top line. As you can see from our announcements today, we are committed to investing to drive growth. The data we collect suggests that very recently the watch category has declined with what we believe are 2 root causes. First, tech-enabled watches are clearly impacting traditional watches. Some of that may be temporary, but the data clearly support that. Second, the huge success that the Michael Kors brand had in driving interest to the category has not yet translated to other brands. It is a phenomenon that can obviously affect our results but also masks our overall performance. On a year-to-date basis, excluding Michael Kors, our watch business is roughly flat in constant dollars and we believe outperforming the overall category. Our independent research shows that apart from Michael Kors, we are gaining share in the U.S. watch market at price points under $1,000, and we believe we got the best set of brands to drive share gains in the future. Again, we are not satisfied and we remain committed to driving growth, but we believe that despite the current challenges, we have been able to maintain and advance our leadership position.
So moving back now to the quarter's results. In the quarter, gross profit decreased to $418 million and gross margin declined to 270 basis points to 54.2%. The decrease was primarily driven by changes in foreign currency. Excluding the currency headwind, gross margin actually expanded during the quarter, mainly due to our pricing initiatives and lower product cost, partially offset by a markdown in clearance activities.
Third quarter operating expenses decreased 3% to $342 million due to the impact of changes in foreign currency and included $3 million for restructuring programs that we announced earlier. As planned, excluding the impact of currencies and restructuring, operating expenses increased slightly due to increased marketing and advertising investments, investments to support strategic initiatives and new store expenses associated with 2014 store openings. Infrastructure expenses were down compared to last year. Our third quarter operating expense rate was 44.3% compared to 39.6%.
Operating income decreased to $76 million including a $33 million unfavorable currency impact and operating margin decreased to 9.8% including a 330 basis point headwind from currencies. Higher marketing and strategic investments, greater retail mix, deleverage on fixed cost given the sales decline and the restructuring charges offset by constant dollar gross margin improvements, accounted for the other changes in operating margin. Interest expense increased to $5 million, given our higher debt levels. Third quarter other income increased $5 million to $7 million due to net gains on foreign currency contracts and account balances.
Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter was 22.3%, lower than last year's 30.6% due to the favorable impact of foreign tax credits recognized during the quarter. Third quarter net income decreased to $58 million, largely due to lower sales and operating income, partially offset by lower taxes.
Now turning to our cash flows and balance sheet. For the quarter, our operations consumes $28 million of cash versus providing $42 million a year ago. We drew down a net $113 million on our revolver. We invested $21 million in CapEx and $12 million to repurchase roughly 200,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $69. We ended the quarter with $829 million remaining on our repurchase authorization. We ended the quarter with $302 million in cash and $807 million in debt. 
Third quarter ending inventory totaled $746 million, a 7% increase compared to last year, given lower demand this year. Our inventory growth is primarily in our better selling brands, and we have adjusted our receipt plans to reflect changing sales trends. We also are working to reduce our Swiss inventory levels, which are higher than planned given sluggishness in certain markets like Asia. Accounts receivable decreased by 17% to $330 million and wholesale DSOs were in line with the prior year. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $20 million for the quarter.
Now let me share with you our updated outlook for the rest of the year. The bulk of my analysis will exclude the impact of currencies, restructuring charges and Misfit transaction cost. I will provide the related GAAP number at the end, which will include those items. Given our expectation that the Misfit acquisition will close late in the fourth quarter, we don't expect the impact on our operating results other than the transaction cost will be material. After that, I'll talk about the acquisition of Misfit and how we see that affecting our sales growth, operating results and capital deployment over the next few years.
Let's start with the rest of 2015. As a reminder, the factors that we've always anticipated would affect our 2015 results have materialized and have not abated. In fact, some have intensified since last we spoke. The U.S. dollar continues to be relatively strong, putting pressure on both top line growth and margins. The phenomenal historical success of probably the hottest fashion launched brand ever, Michael Kors, is affecting our year-over-year comparisons. And it is clear that wearables on the wrist are here to stay, giving our existing customers new choices while also expanding the population of new people, mainly millennials who want to wear something on their wrists. We think that affecting the category as a whole an immediate near-term while it provides us a huge opportunity over time. Over the last quarter, we also saw a sequential change in each of our regional businesses, with category pressures intensifying uniformly. In the Americas, with continued category softness, we expect wholesale partners will manage inventory levels tightly, impacting fourth quarter receipt plans.
On our last call, we reported that we had not anticipated the significant slowdown that we experienced in the second quarter in Europe. In addition to many economic factors that are weighing on the region, we now believe that many of the same factors that are affecting the category in other regions are impacting our European business, especially in the wholesale channels. There are still several markets where we continue to see significant white space opportunities, but markets like the U.K. and the Middle East have been challenging and we now expect that trend to continue in the fourth quarter.
Finally, in Asia, while there are pockets of strength like India, which continues to be a big long-term opportunity, most markets continue to be sluggish and our third quarter business did not materialize as we had planned. While there are headwinds in our business, we continue to be pleased with our progress in FOSSIL and SKAGEN and look forward to holiday period supported by the marketing investments we have been making to continue to build and drive traffic both to stores and websites. And we're very excited about the launch of our FOSSIL Q wearables. The response from customers has been encouraging and we're excited about the buzz that these great products have created.
Given those factors for the fourth quarter, we're expecting constant dollar sales to decline between 2% and 11%. Excluding the impact of last year's extra first quarter week, this would result in a full year sales decline between 1% and 3.5%. We are planning constant dollar gross margins flat to slightly down in the quarter. Our price initiatives continue to drive improvements in our margins so we have now anniversary-ed some of our initial price increases so the benefit will not be as strong as we've seen in recent quarters. The change in trajectory of our international businesses, where margins are stronger, will offset some of that benefit. Also, given the softness in the watch category, we also expect we may need to invest to help traffic and move inventory during the key holiday period. Overall, for the full year, we expect a modest expansion of constant dollar gross margin.
For the fourth quarter, we are planning with a higher expense rate, driven mainly by the investments we are making in marketing and in our strategic initiatives and these will account for nearly half of the rate growth. The rate will also be affected by last year's fourth quarter reversal of performance compensation accruals and the impact of this year's lower sales on our fixed infrastructure. Overall, we expect our full year expense rate will be higher mainly due to the strategic investments along with the impact of stores that we opened in 2014.
Given these factors, we are planning adjusted fourth quarter operating margin in the range of 12% and 15% and full year adjusted operating margin in the range between 12.5% and 13.5%. In constant dollars, we estimate that fourth quarter adjusted EPS would be in the range between $1.40 and $2 per share and full year constant dollar adjusted EPS would be in the range between $5.60 and $6.20 per share. 
On a reported basis, we anticipate fourth quarter sales to decline in the range between 7% and 16% and full year sales decline in the range between 8% and 10.5%. We expect reported fourth quarter operating margin in the range between 8.5% and 11.5% and full year operating margin in the range between 9% and 10%. We expect reported fourth quarter EPS in the range between $1.05 and $1.65 and full year EPS in the range between $4.15 and $4.75. These reported amounts include restructuring charges of $24 million or $0.35 per share for the full year, of which $2 million or $0.03 per share will be recorded in the fourth quarter. They also include an estimated $8 million or $0.12 per share for Misfit transaction costs, which will also be recorded as an operating expense in the fourth quarter.
We are planning with the fourth quarter tax rate of 31%. Given the lower tax rate in the third quarter, we are now planning the full year with a tax rate of roughly 28% and we now expect annual CapEx to be approximately $90 million. Our guidance continues to include higher interest costs due to increased debt levels and additional share repurchase more in line with our third quarter activity.
Now let me share some additional perspective on Misfit and how we see this opportunity impacting our financials and capital deployment over the next few years. There's plenty of growth still left in traditional watches, where we have a clear competitive advantage, but there are customers, mainly millennials, who don't wear watches because watches don't give them the functionality that they want, and that's tech. [indiscernible] in the wearables market estimated to grow at a 36% CAGR to $45 billion by 2019. Despite that enormous growth, we believe there are consumers who won't participate in connected accessories because it doesn't give them what they want, fashion and design across the brands that they love. We believe our acquisition of Misfit with the scalable tech platform that brings and the world-class engineering team it brings, fast forward FOSSIL Group to be the one company that can drive the convergence of the growing watch and wearables markets with all the necessary capabilities to compete design and innovation, global distribution and operating platform, world-class supply chain and scale to drive the right economics, a leading-edge tech platform and app experience and the best lifestyle brand that consumers love.
There are and will be companies who can design great products but who lack the scale that our production volumes of nearly 30 million watches a year create. There are and will be companies who design great products at scale but they lack the breadth of our portfolio of 16 lifestyle brands. There are and will be companies who produce big volumes of tech products but they lack the design and style that so many consumers demand. When we do that analysis, we believe that we are uniquely positioned in this market and set up to win like no one else can. The integration of technology into watches is the next innovation in the evolution of the category, and we believe we can once again do what we did to the functional watch category, grow and gain share while elegantly and seamlessly blending design and brands with function. We believe that this acquisition can be the catalyst to reverse our most recent trends to quickly restore growth and has the potential to drive strong growth beyond what we might have imagined just a couple of years ago. It will not be easy and it will require additional investments. This is arguably one of the hottest consumer trends right now and now is the time to invest in marketing and building awareness for our brands and amazing new products. That's what we plan to do in 2016. 
So while we expect the acquisition will drive growth next year, beyond growing Misfit's roughly $30 million 2015 revenues, we expect earnings and margin dilution for next year. It will also not be until the second half of next year that we can bring products to market that leverage the Misfit platform. These assumptions assume a relatively stable currency environment. So 2016's earnings, unrelated to the acquisition of Misfit, would not benefit from the significant nonoperating currency gains that 2015's earnings did.
As we move past next year, we'd expect growth to accelerate as we bring more brands onto the platform. As that growth accelerates, we do expect to see downward pressure on gross margin as wearables becomes a larger part of our mix. We also expect that accelerated growth will provide an opportunity for infrastructure leverage that can begin to restore sequential earnings growth. 
Now let me discuss briefly how we think of this transaction in terms of our capital structure and deployment. As we've always said, our top priority for capital deployment is to drive growth to deliver value to shareholder and this fits that priority perfectly. At the purchase price of $260 million including transaction costs, it is a similar size deals to our SKAGEN acquisition in 2012. While we're still very pleased with SKAGEN, the Misfit acquisition will play a much broader strategic growth in driving growth. It does give us a brand that is native to the wearable space and we believe we have great potential to drive that brand's growth by leveraging our global distribution and operating platform. 
Beyond that, though, the capabilities and speed that it brings we believe can be an enormous catalyst to drive growth across our entire portfolio and deliver even greater value to shareholders. Investing in share repurchase has always been an important, though secondary, vehicle, by which we deliver value to our shareholders. We will finance the acquisition, which represents a little more than 1 year free cash flow through a combination of bank debt and repatriated international cash. It does bring our leverage ratio to levels where we have not historically operated, though we believe still with ample liquidity to fund our operations, capital needs while leading some dry powder to the opportunities. Our near-term strategy then would be to prioritize our free cash flow to restore leverage ratios to more recent levels, likely limiting near-term share repurchases to levels sufficient to offset dilution from annual employee equity activity.
So to close, Kosta said the best in today's earnings release. We remain confident in our long-term strategies. We believe the substantial capabilities we acquire with Misfit and the many opportunities it creates, combined with our diversified business model, our solid financial position and cash flow generation, set us up to win over the long term and drive value for our shareholders. We are very excited about our future. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

Yes, in terms of the confidence and the size of the category, it's -- I think first is we're seeing the market develop, where it's increasingly clear to us that wearable technology is and will be a large growing category. There's projections out there that are putting in about $45 billion in the next 4 or 5 years with roughly 2/3 of that being risk [indiscernible]. That would put the size of that market at roughly the same size of the under $1,000 global watch market. And we believe that all 3 categories that make up that market which would be activity trackers, smart watches with display and then the third being smarter watches, so integrating technology similar to what you find in activity tracker into the same type of watches we saw today, all 3 of those are viable products that are -- that we see actually our FOSSIL Q launch being very successful with. So we're going part of that. We see the markets developing and we have a position to play in it. With Misfit, it's -- we've learned a lot in the last couple of years in developing products and bring it to market to FOSSIL Q. We believe that we are now in a connected age where apps and cloud services are effectively now part of product and an extension of brand and have needs to support and mirror our business model of today, so meaning multibrand, fashion- and design-driven and globally scalable. And it's so integral not to product and brand development that it's really too important to outsource that to somebody else's. So we will own that customer experience, own the platform, be able to have -- get to market much more quickly. And then as we scale it across the breadth of our portfolio of brands and 20 languages in 115 countries, just the pure economics of scaling our product, size, breadth, number of brands across the fixed cost of the development of that platform makes for much more attractive margins ultimately than we get if we fully outsourced it."

There seems to be in just the general watch business that people are maybe waiting to see, they're looking for technology, they're not sure. In the meantime, the wrist devices with technology are selling extremely quickly. So we think that one of the most important fashion trends right now in the industry is this huge interest on the consumer side of the convergence of fashion and technology. And we are moving very quickly to make sure that we can scale technology in many different ways across our platform, as we mentioned, not just in Android display smart watches but across our entire platform with devices and watches, putting sensors and connectivity, et cetera. And we think actually at some point, everything we make will have some type of chip in it but will add additional functionality and not a lot of additional cost because of the fact that we make 50 million pieces of accessories a year and it's going to enable us to scale across our entire organization. But it's all the stuff that we talked about in the past. One thing is millennials clearly overspend on technology. There seems to be a slowdown in consumer activity overall, but one thing that's clear is consumers are still spending on technology. We think that continues. We also know that from our past consumers, we'll spend on additional fashion entity. A lot of our growth over the last 5 years has come from us adding chronographs and other technical features that are higher average retail and consumers are very willing to spend it and that's one of the things we're going to be putting in there. The other thing to remember is the watch industry is fundamentally a small business, about $65 billion globally. So the projections on the wearable business are that it's going to grow very quickly and at some point will be the same size as the watch business. But if you look at the trillions of these things spent on technology right now for all different types of cellphones and service and games, et cetera, a small percentage of that spending comes to our accessory business that can make a huge impact of them, and that's what we're working for. And this acquisition also gives us the ability to innovate and differentiate us from our competitors. We're going to be able to put products in the market that are unique and special and address people's lives in many different ways and it's going to be a very unique and long-term opportunity for us to differentiate and to innovate like we do on the rest of our business."

We're going to change the look it's more modern, simpler, et cetera. It's a totally new look. It gives consumers the Kosta fan a reason to buy another watch.

It's not typically been a big part of our ongoing business model. We don't expect that to change dramatically. As far as the wearables, as we've been talking about, we have a lower gross margin now. But we think over the long term, as [indiscernible] come into play, we scale that across our platform, that we can actually have a situation where we're able to increase that over time. Just looking at Moore's Law and chips get less expensive and more robust and we think that will play out, especially with our quantities and how we will go-to-market and especially also with us having the expertise to develop this ourselves rather than rely on third parties largely to do most of it."

We don't operate with backlogs and what we do, do is we analyze our business in a lot of different ways. We look at it regionally, by category, by brand. I did say earlier the biggest change in the way we're thinking about the fourth quarter comes from Europe, where going into this last quarter, we had seen 1 quarter of less favorable performance following about 7 or 8. It's very strong double digits or so growth coming out of Europe. So the trajectory changed there fairly quickly so we've adjusted our expectations. I mean we're coming off of a down 7.5 third quarter, up against a 10. We've we provided a wide range to reflect a relatively choppy environment right now that's difficult to predict and we want to be able to accommodate in our range the deteriorating trends. The second quarter, we saw a step-down from Q2 going into Q3, and most of the business in the fourth quarter happens in the back part of the quarter.

We have been holding the infrastructure type and we think that is the way we're going to manage 2016. We've actually been operating with very limited store growth, and we would expect to continue to do that into next year. One thing that we have to work through that we don't have yet, it's just one of the purchase accounting implications of the Misfit acquisition and how that will likely affect the expense line. But what we believe is that -- and this is the hottest category right now and now at that time for us to invest, we're seeing traction from the investments that we're making in FOSSIL in SKAGEN in Omni and we intend to continue to do that and really drive the top line. Again, we talked about it on the last call or the last question rather, currencies are going to impact our earnings because in 2015, you really saw in the operating margins but the earnings were lifted up because we have nonoperating contracts supporting it below the line. Now in 2016, we're going to be anywhere from 1.5 years to 2.5 years outside of when the dollar really started strengthening. So the contracts only buy you time and now that's been neutralized. SO even in the base business, all other things being equal, the currencies, because of the lack of those nonoperating gains, are going to create earnings headwinds."

Following his prepared remarks, Greg McKelvey, our Chief Strategy and Marketing Officer, will join us for Q&A.
For the third quarter, we delivered sales and earnings within our expectations. Given last year's strong third quarter, we knew that comparisons would be tough and that proved to be the case. From a top line perspective and in constant currency, overall sales declined 8%. While we are certainly not satisfied with that result, we executed well and delivered solid results in several parts of our business. Our initiative to drive our own brands is gaining traction, as both FOSSIL and SKAGEN grew even amidst a difficult environment. In constant currency, our leathers and jewelry businesses both continued to grow [indiscernible] the full year and our digital and omni-channel initiatives drove strong growth in our e-commerce channel.
The challenge remains with our watch business, which declined in the quarter. The traditional watch category remains sluggish as tech-enabled devices offer consumers additional choices. Compounding net negative impact is the fact that we are lapping the historical outsized success of the Michael Kors brand. As a company with significant competitive advantages, we are moving quickly and ramping up innovation and design, marketing and technology to change the current trend in our business and continue to increase our share in the global watch and accessories market.
During the quarter, the FOSSIL brand grew 2% in constant currency, with increases in each of our regions and global growth led by leathers and watches. We launched a new FOSSIL website during the quarter that incorporates compelling brand content and stories and enhanced customer shopping experience, improved mobile capability and behind-the-scenes, a world-class content management system, which is a critical element in support of our omni-channel initiatives. The new website positions us to further build interest in the brand, drive sales through an improved shopping experience and learn more about our customer and further develop their relationship with the brands.
While not a third quarter development, last month, we launched our first connected accessories product with the FOSSIL Q product line. This is our first-generation of wearable technology products that combines fashion and functionality. We know that customers are interested in technology and FOSSIL Q allows us to bring together fashion and function in the assortment. The reaction has been very positive, not only to the product but the entire platform, including the software application developed for users. We distribute the assortment through select FOSSIL retail doors and completely sold out the entire production quantity intended for our select wholesale partners.
I want to share a bit more about FOSSIL Q so you can appreciate the elements of the offering and understand our excitement. We created a line of fashionable connected accessories that showcases our design excellence and expert craftsmanship. In the stores now are 2 styles of watches that are nondisplay and 2 styles of tracker devices or connected bracelets. The FOSSIL Q Dreamer and Reveler are designed for both men and women and are nondisplay fashion activity trackers that include notification alerts in the form of vibrations and LED lights with a battery life lasting up to 1 week.
The FOSSIL Q Grant is one of our top-selling traditional analog watch styles for both men and women, infused with technology that interacts with a smartphone and notifies the wearer of messages and phone calls from selected context through an LED indicator and general vibration. This battery also lasts up to 1 week. Available at the end of the month, the FOSSIL Q Founder is our connected watch with display that utilizes Android wear and is one of the first digital display watches to offer full compatibility with virtually all smartphones. This product allows the wearer to customize their watch face as well as other features while utilizing the FOSSIL Q App.
The FOSSIL Q App was designed to be the command center for all the FOSSIL Q products. It allows us to uniquely interact with customers, provides important functionality like smart notifications and allows customers to learn more about themselves from tracking physical activity through counting calories and connect seamlessly to other fitness apps that customers might already be using. The exciting thing about the app is the opportunity to eventually carry the functionality across the brands in our licensed portfolio and create a unique specialized branded experience for the customer. This will enable brands such as Michael Kors and others to compete in the connected accessories category and to attract new customers.
So overall, for FOSSIL, a good third quarter, a nice start to connected accessories in October, and we hope to build on the momentum. We look forward to seeing how the assortment performs for the holiday period, and the team is already hard at work on future generations of product.
As for SKAGEN, the brand had another good quarter, with constant currency double-digit global growth and increases in each of our regions. Watches led the performance and we are also seeing continued positive responses to both leathers and jewelry. We continue to see great potential with SKAGEN through expanded global distribution, fueled by excitement around its unique positioning and design.
Turning to our multibrand watch portfolio. During the third quarter, our multibrand watch portfolio was down 11% to last year in constant currency, a disappointing performance, with declines across our 3 regions and with a single brand driving the vast majority of that decline. We expected a tough quarter, given last year's strong performance, the historical strength of the Michael Kors brand and consumers' gravitation towards technology. We believe we have the best fashion brands in our portfolio and are focused on driving innovation, including designs, colors, styles and now technology, to drive growth in this portion of our business. We are enjoying the benefit of having Kate Spade in the portfolio and the team is working to further develop the assortment so we can fully leverage our distribution platform and expand the brand's presence globally. The team is also focused on developing the Chaps assortment ahead of its launch in early 2016.
In our international markets, we are being faced with near-term macro challenges, particularly in Asia and China. While we believe the same market dynamics that help drive our significant share gains in the U.S. will play out in the region over time, the current headwinds are impacting our business as traffic is challenged and economic conditions are volatile. In Asia, we believe the market demographics will eventually move in our favor, given the expected significant growth of the middle-class, and we are well-positioned to take advantage of fashion brands emerging to take share from traditional watch brands.
As for Europe, we also continue to see longer-term opportunities, as we go in new markets and add more brands to our existing distribution. For the last couple of years, Europe has been a strong driver of growth for us, but those tailwinds have quickly turned to headwinds and we are now experiencing many of the same challenges we've seen in other markets. 
Now we will shift gears from our third quarter performance and talk about the market we find ourselves in today and how we are responding to the challenges and the opportunity. As we discussed last quarter, it's a very dynamic and exciting time in retail and particularly in our space. With disruption in the market comes opportunity to take advantage of growth and changing trends. It reminds us of the last time we faced segment growth, which is in 2008. We regrouped and refocused our efforts on design and innovation and positioned FOSSIL Group for strong growth. While today's source of disruption in the market is different than it was at that time, our sense of determination, focus and drive for innovation hasn't changed. And with the strength of FOSSIL Q, we have already proven our ability to identify and fill voids within a trending category, delivering fashion and function that sets us apart from our peers.
Currently, technology is emerging as the latest trend in fashion, with the growing interest in wearable technology inspiring new entrants into the watch space as well as explosive growth in activity trackers. Our acquisition of Misfit will allow us to combine our key competitive advantages in design, sourcing and distribution and powerful brands, with a business that is already a recognized player in technology-infused accessories and possesses a world-class software and hardware engineering team to stay ahead of emerging technology trends. You can find additional information regarding Misfit and their technology platform and the connected accessories opportunity in the slide presentation on our Investor Relations website.
For those of you that do not know Misfit, it is a company that started just a few years ago and is led by Sonny Vu, a highly regarded thought leader in the wearable technology space. They have a robust product pipeline focused on exciting tech-enabled experiences across multiple distribution channels, including consumer technology, healthcare, enterprise and wholesale. We are excited to have Sonny join us as the President and Chief Technology Officer of connected devices here at FOSSIL Group as well as the rest of the team at Misfit.
As we have told many of you, we envision a day when watches and accessories across all of our brands will be connected devices. With the acquisition of Misfit, FOSSIL Group will be uniquely positioned to lead the convergence of style and technology to become the fashion gateway to the high-growth wearable technology and connected device markets. This acquisition accelerates our ability to compete in the connected accessory space, as we expand our addressable market while leveraging all of the design and scale with which we serve the existing watch market.
We are very excited about this acquisition for many reasons. First, Misfit's culture and qualities are aligned with FOSSIL Group. Like us, Misfit has an energetic culture that embraces innovation. Their team of roughly 200 people includes a highly talented engineering group that is focused on new technologies and functionality for accessories. On top of this, Misfit shares our appreciation for design and branding with the use of color and unique style that surpasses others in the space. And they have a holistic approach to technology that improves the quality of life with the integration of data tracking. We expect to integrate Misfit's technology platform into our FOSSIL and SKAGEN brands and have the opportunity to do the same across our portfolio of powerful brands.
Second, Misfit is a globally recognized wearable technology brand in the activity tracker space. As many of you are aware, the activity tracker space is one of the fastest-growing segments in accessories, given strong consumer interest in learning more about health, wellness and improving the quality of life. We believe some of the headwinds we have been experiencing resulted from a lack of technology in our core business, and this acquisition will allow us to quickly start turning those headwinds into tailwinds.
And third, we see a significant opportunity to drive top line growth. We expect to accelerate Misfit sales growth as we leverage our distribution platform and their pipeline of innovative products. We will also leverage Misfit's scalable cloud and app platform and its world-class engineering team to develop cutting-edge technology-infused products for our portfolio beginning in holiday of 2016. Sonny and the team at Misfit will collaborate with FOSSIL Group to develop new functionality for accessories that is relevant for our brands and customers.
And while in the near term our focus will be on driving sales growth, we also see margin expansion opportunities longer-term from the added scale Misfit will bring to our company. This is a very exciting development for FOSSIL Group and we believe it is a great investment in the future of the company.
Overall, we continue to believe, based on independent forecast, that the watch category will grow over the next several years. Beyond that, we believe that technology can expand that growth by bringing new customers, those that don't traditionally wear watches, into the space. Within that category and with our strategic advantages, the design, branding and the distribution, we believe we are poised to gain share. While recently we believe we have been disadvantaged as the fashion trend in watches is about technology, with Misfit, we believe we are poised to capitalize on today's fashion in a differentiated way that helps consumers enhance their lives. Simply put, we will marry fashion with technology and distribute it with strong branding across our distribution platform.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Dennis for more comments."

I'd like to start with discussing our third quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year before going into additional detail regarding the Misfit acquisition.Third quarter net sales decreased",3269,"Thanks, Kosta, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start with discussing our third quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year before going into additional detail regarding the Misfit acquisition.
Third quarter net sales decreased 8% and on a reported basis declined 14% to $771 million. While sales overall were soft, partially due to the strong quarter we experienced in 2014, they came in at the low end of our expectations. For the quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $1.19 compared to $1.96 last year. Compared to the third quarter of 2014, this quarter's EPS was negatively impacted by roughly $0.40 due to currencies and another $0.05 due to our restructuring charges. Our investments to support our strategic initiatives and enhanced marketing totaled about $0.19 per share, and the current quarter benefited $0.13 due to a lower tax rate.
FOSSIL sales increased 2% in constant dollars. Leathers and watches grew, while jewelry was flat. Sales for the brand increased in all 3 regions, with the highest growth in Asia. The brand drove positive comps in Europe and a double-digit increase in our global e-com business, driven by higher traffic and improved conversion rates.
SKAGEN sales grew 10% in constant dollars, with growth in all 3 regions. Solid growth in watches drove the business, with increases in leathers and jewelry as well. In constant dollars, our multibrand watch portfolio declined 11% compared to last year, partially due to last year's tough 12% comparison, but also it is clear that technology is putting pressure on the traditional watch category. Compounding this effect is the fact that we have brands in our portfolio that are lapping historically explosive growth.
In the Americas, reported sales decreased 11% to $391 million, a 10% constant dollar decrease. The decrease was driven by watches, as the decline in the category offset modest growth in leathers and jewelry. Across brands, constant dollar sales for the Armani brands, SKAGEN and FOSSIL increased during the quarter, and we continue to benefit from the addition of Kate Spade New York. The remainder of the brands within the portfolio declined.
Within the region, growth in the retail channel was driven by a strong performance in Canada, which was offset by a decline in wholesale sales. Comp store sales declined slightly as traffic continued to be down in the region, particularly in markets that benefit from heavy tourism. We're pleased with our e-com results, where sales increased across all of our websites. Constant dollar wholesale sales were down to last year, largely driven by U.S. department stores where the business continues to be soft.
In Europe, the sharp change in trend that we experienced in the second quarter continued into the third, as reported sales decreased 15% to $260 million. Constant dollar sales decreased 3%. Modest growth in jewelry and leathers offset the decline in watches. The decline in the region was driven by the licensed portfolio offsetting growth in FOSSIL and SKAGEN where watches drove the growth in both brands. Within the region, declines in distributor markets and the U.K. offset slight increases in France and Italy. In the region, growth in the retail channel was driven by new stores and positive comps including a solid performance in FOSSIL stores. Our e-com business performed very well in the quarter, with strong double-digit growth supported by more effective investments in marketing.
In Asia, reported sales decreased 19% to $120 million, while constant dollar sales decreased 10%. Growth in leathers offset the decline in watches and a slight decline in jewelry. Strong growth in India was offset by declines in most markets in the region, including Korea, Hong Kong and China, where general economic sluggishness and changing travel patterns continue to impact our business. Michael Kors, FOSSIL and SKAGEN were our strongest performers, with each of the brands delivering increases. Comp store sales decreased in the region.
Before I move past sales, let me pause and provide some additional context. To reiterate Kosta's point, we are not satisfied with our top line. As you can see from our announcements today, we are committed to investing to drive growth. The data we collect suggests that, very recently, the watch category has declined with what we believe are 2 root causes. First, tech-enabled watches are clearly impacting traditional watches. Some of that may be temporary, but the data clearly support that. Second, the huge success that the Michael Kors brand had in driving interest to the category has not yet translated to other brands. It is a phenomenon that can obviously affect our results but also masks our overall performance. On a year-to-date basis, excluding Michael Kors, our watch business is roughly flat in constant dollars and we believe outperforming the overall category. Our independent research shows that apart from Michael Kors, we are gaining share in the U.S. watch market at price points under $1,000, and we believe we've got the best set of brands to drive share gains in the future. Again, we are not satisfied and we remain committed to driving growth, but we believe that despite the current challenges, we have been able to maintain and advance our leadership position.
So moving back now to the quarter's results. In the quarter, gross profit decreased to $418 million and gross margin declined to 270 basis points to 54.2%. The decrease was primarily driven by changes in foreign currency. Excluding the currency headwind, gross margin actually expanded during the quarter, mainly due to our pricing initiatives and lower product cost, partially offset by markdown in clearance activities.
Third quarter operating expenses decreased 3% to $342 million due to the impact of changes in foreign currency and included $3 million for restructuring programs that we announced earlier. As planned, excluding the impact of currencies and restructuring, operating expenses increased slightly due to increased marketing and advertising investments, investments to support strategic initiatives and new store expenses associated with 2014 store openings. Infrastructure expenses were down compared to last year. Our third quarter operating expense rate was 44.3% compared to 39.6%.
Operating income decreased to $76 million, including a $33 million unfavorable currency impact; and operating margin decreased to 9.8%, including a 330 basis point headwind from currencies. Higher marketing and strategic investments, greater retail mix, deleverage on fixed cost given the sales decline and restructuring charges, offset by constant dollar gross margin improvements, accounted for the other changes in operating margin. Interest expense increased to $5 million given our higher debt levels. Third quarter other income increased $5 million to $7 million due to net gains on foreign currency contracts and account balances.
Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter was 22.3%, lower than last year's 30.6% due to the favorable impact of foreign tax credits recognized during the quarter. Third quarter net income decreased to $58 million, largely due to lower sales and operating income, partially offset by lower taxes.
Now turning to our cash flows and balance sheet. For the quarter, our operations consumed $28 million of cash versus providing $42 million a year ago. We drew down a net $113 million on our revolver. We invested $21 million in CapEx and $12 million to repurchase roughly 200,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $69. We ended the quarter with $829 million remaining on our repurchase authorization. We ended the quarter with $302 million in cash and $807 million in debt.
Third quarter ending inventory totaled $746 million, a 7% increase compared to last year, given lower demand this year. Our inventory growth is primarily in our better-selling brands, and we have adjusted our receipt plans to reflect changing sales trends. We also are working to reduce our Swiss inventory levels, which are higher than planned given sluggishness in certain markets like Asia. Accounts receivable decreased by 17% to $330 million, and wholesale DSOs were in line with the prior year. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $20 million for the quarter.
Now let me share with you our updated outlook for the rest of the year. The bulk of my analysis will exclude the impact of currencies, restructuring charges and Misfit transaction cost. I will provide the related GAAP number at the end, which will include those items. Given our expectation that the Misfit acquisition will close late in the fourth quarter, we don't expect the impact on our operating results, other than the transaction cost, will be material. After that, I'll talk about the acquisition of Misfit and how we see that affecting our sales growth, operating results and capital deployment over the next few years.
Let's start with the rest of 2015. As a reminder, the factors that we've always anticipated would affect our 2015 results have materialized and have not abated. In fact, some have intensified since last we spoke. The U.S. dollar continues to be relatively strong, putting pressure on both top line growth and margins. The phenomenal historical success of probably the hottest fashion-launched brand ever, Michael Kors, is affecting our year-over-year comparisons. And it is clear that wearables on the wrist are here to stay, giving our existing customers new choices while also expanding the population of new people, mainly millennials, who want to wear something on their wrist. We think that's affecting the category as a whole in immediate near term, but it provides us a huge opportunity over time. Over the last quarter, we also saw a sequential change in each of our regional businesses, with category pressures intensifying uniformly. In the Americas, with continued category softness, we expect wholesale partners will manage inventory levels tightly, impacting fourth quarter receipt plans.
On our last call, we reported that we had not anticipated the significant slowdown that we experienced in the second quarter in Europe. In addition to many economic factors that are weighing on the region, we now believe that many of the same factors that are affecting the category in other regions are impacting our European business, especially in the wholesale channels. There are still several markets where we continue to see significant white space opportunities, but markets like the U.K. and the Middle East have been challenging and we now expect that trend to continue in the fourth quarter.
Finally, in Asia, while there are pockets of strength like India, which continues to be a big long-term opportunity, most markets continue to be sluggish and our third quarter business did not materialize as we had planned. While there are headwinds in our business, we continue to be pleased with our progress in FOSSIL and SKAGEN and look forward to holiday period supported by the marketing investments we have been making to continue to build and drive traffic both to stores and websites. And we're very excited about the launch of our FOSSIL Q wearables. The response from customers has been encouraging and we're excited about the buzz that these great products have created.
Given those factors for the fourth quarter, we're expecting constant dollar sales to decline between 2% and 11%. Excluding the impact of last year's extra first quarter week, this would result in a full year sales decline between 1% and 3.5%. We are planning constant dollar gross margins flat to slightly down in the quarter. Our price initiatives continue to drive improvements in our margins so we have now anniversary-ed some of our initial price increases so the benefit will not be as strong as we've seen in recent quarters. The change in trajectory of our international businesses, where margins are stronger, will offset some of that benefit. Also, given the softness in the watch category, we also expect we may need to invest to help traffic and move inventory during the key holiday period. Overall, for the full year, we expect a modest expansion of constant dollar gross margin.
For the fourth quarter, we are planning with a higher expense rate, driven mainly by the investments we are making in marketing and in our strategic initiatives, and these will account for nearly half of the rate growth. The rate will also be affected by last year's fourth quarter reversal of performance compensation accruals and the impact of this year's lower sales on our fixed infrastructure. Overall, we expect our full year expense rate will be higher, mainly due to the strategic investments, along with the impact of stores that we opened in 2014. Given these factors, we are planning adjusted fourth quarter operating margin in the range of 12% and 15%, and full year adjusted operating margin in the range between 12.5% and 13.5%. In constant dollars, we estimate that fourth quarter adjusted EPS would be in the range between $1.40 and $2 per share, and full year constant dollar adjusted EPS would be in the range between $5.60 and $6.20 per share.
On a reported basis, we anticipate fourth quarter sales to decline in the range between 7% and 16% and full year sales decline in the range between 8% and 10.5%. We expect reported fourth quarter operating margin in the range between 8.5% and 11.5%, and full year operating margin in the range between 9% and 10%. We expect reported fourth quarter EPS in the range between $1.05 and $1.65, and full year EPS in the range between $4.15 and $4.75. These reported amounts include restructuring charges of $24 million or $0.35 per share for the full year, of which $2 million or $0.03 per share will be recorded in the fourth quarter. They also include an estimated $8 million or $0.12 per share for Misfit transaction costs, which will also be recorded as an operating expense in the fourth quarter.
We are planning with a fourth quarter tax rate of 31%. Given the lower tax rate in the third quarter, we are now planning the full year with a tax rate of roughly 28%, and we now expect annual CapEx to be approximately $90 million. Our guidance continues to include higher interest costs due to increased debt levels and additional share repurchase more in line with our third quarter activity.
Now let me share some additional perspective on Misfit and how we see this opportunity impacting our financials and capital deployment over the next few years. There's plenty of growth still left in traditional watches, where we have a clear competitive advantage, but there are customers, mainly millennials, who don't wear watches because watches don't give them the functionality that they want, and that's tech. Then there's the wearables market, estimated to grow at a 36% CAGR to $45 billion by 2019. Despite that enormous growth, we believe there are consumers who won't participate in connected accessories because it doesn't give them what they want, fashion and design across the brands that they love. We believe our acquisition of Misfit, the scalable tech platform that brings, and the world-class engineering team it brings, fast-forward FOSSIL Group to be the one company that can drive the convergence of the growing watch and wearables markets with all the necessary capabilities to compete, design and innovation, global distribution and operating platform, world-class supply chain and scale to drive the right economics, a leading-edge tech platform and app experience and the best lifestyle brand that consumers love.
There are and will be companies who can design great products but who lack the scale that our production volumes of nearly 30 million watches a year create. There are and will be companies who design great products at scale but they lack the breadth of our portfolio of 16 lifestyle brands. There are and will be companies who produce big volumes of tech products but they lack the design and style that so many consumers demand. When we do that analysis, we believe that we are uniquely positioned in this market and set up to win like no one else can. The integration of technology into watches is the next innovation in the evolution of the category, and we believe we can once again do what we did to the functional watch category, grow and gain share by elegantly and seamlessly blending design and brand with function. We believe that this acquisition can be the catalyst to reverse our most recent trends, to quickly restore growth and has the potential to drive strong growth beyond what we might have imagined just a couple of years ago. It will not be easy and it will require additional investments. This is arguably one of the hottest consumer trends right now and now is the time to invest in marketing and building awareness for our brands and amazing new products. That's what we plan to do in 2016.
So while we expect the acquisition will drive growth next year, beyond growing Misfit's roughly $30 million 2015 revenues, we expect earnings and margin dilution for next year. It will also not be until the second half of next year that we can bring products to market that leverage the Misfit platform. These assumptions assume a relatively stable currency environment. So 2016's earnings, unrelated to the acquisition of Misfit, would not benefit from the significant nonoperating currency gains that 2015's earnings did.
As we move past next year, we'd expect growth to accelerate as we bring more brands onto the platform. As that growth accelerates, we do expect to see downward pressure on gross margins as wearables becomes a larger part of our mix. We also expect that accelerated growth will provide an opportunity for infrastructure leverage that can begin to restore sequential earnings growth.
Now let me discuss briefly how we think of this transaction in terms of our capital structure and deployment. As we've always said, our top priority for capital deployment is to drive growth to deliver value to shareholder, and this fits that priority perfectly. At the purchase price of $260 million including transaction costs, it is a similar-sized deal to our SKAGEN acquisition in 2012. While we're still very pleased with SKAGEN, the Misfit acquisition will play a much broader strategic role in driving growth. It does give us a brand that is native to the wearable space and we believe we have great potential to drive that brand's growth by leveraging our global distribution and operating platform.
Beyond that, though, the capabilities and speed that it brings, we believe, can be an enormous catalyst to drive growth across our entire portfolio and deliver even greater value to shareholders. Investing in share repurchase has always been an important, though secondary, vehicle, by which we deliver value to our shareholders. We will finance the acquisition, which represents a little more than 1 year of free cash flow through a combination of bank debt and repatriated international cash. It does bring our leverage ratio to levels where we have not historically operated, though we believe still with ample liquidity to fund our operations, capital needs while leaving some dry powder to be opportunistic. Our near-term strategy then will be to prioritize our free cash flow to restore leverage ratios to more recent levels, likely limiting near-term share repurchases to levels sufficient to offset dilution from annual employee equity activity.
So to close, Kosta said it best in today's earnings release. We remain confident in our long-term strategy. We believe the substantial capabilities we acquire with Misfit and the many opportunities it creates, combined with our diversified business model, our solid financial position and cash flow generation, set us up to win over the long term and drive value for our shareholders. We are very excited about our future.
So with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

So -- and in addition to that, I would say that the Michael Kors business is still extremely productive, our most productive brand, very powerful globally. So we expect that the business will probably settle a bit, for a while. We'll get wearables in there next year, and then we'll set it up for more long-term growth. It's a very strong global brand.

Yes, in terms of the confidence and the size of the category, it's -- I think first is we're seeing the market develop, where it's increasingly clear to us that wearable technology is and will be a large growing category. There's projections out there that are putting it at about $45 billion in the next 4 or 5 years with roughly 2/3 of that being wrist worn. That would put the size of that market at roughly the same size of the under $1,000 global watch market. And we believe that all 3 categories that make up that market, which would be activity trackers, smart watches with display and then the third being smarter watches, so integrating technology similar to what you'd find in activity tracker into the same type of watches we sell today, all 3 of those are viable products that are -- that we see actually our FOSSIL Q launch being very successful with. So we're going -- part of that, we see the markets developing and we have a position to play in it. With Misfit, it's -- we've learned a lot in the last couple of years in developing product and bringing it to market, FOSSIL Q. We believe that we're now in a connected age where apps and cloud services are effectively now part of product and an extension of brand and that needs to support and mirror our business model of today, so meaning multibrand, fashion- and design-driven and globally scalable. And it's so integral now to product and brand development that it's really too important to outsource that to somebody else. So we need -- we want to own that customer experience, own the platform, be able to have -- be -- get to market much more quickly. And then as we scale it across the breadth of our portfolio of brands and 20 languages in 115 countries, just the pure economics of scaling our product size, breadth, number of brands across the fixed cost of the development of that platform makes for much more attractive margins ultimately than we'd get if we fully outsourced it."

They're global, especially with strengths in the U.S. and in Asia, which is important to us. They've got an 18-month pipeline of products and innovation that we're going to be able to extend not only into the Misfit brand but into the full breadth of our product portfolio and brand portfolio.

They're selling in terms of trackers and also in new entrants, the smart watches. You could say for our overall watch business that there -- we have a fashion miss, which is we don't have technology across our platform. There seems to be, in just the general watch business, that people are maybe waiting to see, they're looking for technology, they're not sure. In the meantime, wrist devices with technology are selling extremely quickly. So we think that one of the most important fashion trends right now in the industry is this huge interest on the consumer side of the convergence of fashion and technology. And we are moving very quickly to make sure that we can scale technology in many different ways across our platform, as we mentioned, not just in Android display smart watches but across our entire platform with devices and watches, putting sensors and connectivity, et cetera. And we think, actually, at some point, everything we make will have some type of chip in it that will add additional functionality and not a lot of additional cost because of the fact that we make 50 million pieces of accessories a year and it's going to enable us to scale it across our entire organization. But it's all the stuff that we've talked about in the past. And one thing is millennials clearly overspend on technology. There's a -- seems to be a slowdown in consumer activity overall, but one thing that's clear is consumers are still spending on technology. We think that continues. We also know that from our past, consumers will spend on additional functionality. A lot of our growth over the last 5 years has come from us adding chronographs and other technical features that are higher average retail and consumers are very willing to spend it and that's one of the things we're going to be putting in there. The other thing to remember is the watch industry is fundamentally a small business, about $65 billion globally. So the projections on the wearable business are that it's going to grow very quickly and at some point will be of the same size as the watch business. But if you look at the trillions that's being spent on technology right now from all different types of cellphones and service and games, et cetera, if a small percentage of that spending comes into our accessory business, it can make a huge impact, and that's what we're working for. And this acquisition also gives us the ability to innovate and differentiate us from our competitors. We're going to be able to put products in the market that are unique and special and address people's lives in many different ways and it's going to be a very unique and long-term opportunity for us to differentiate and to innovate like we do on the rest of our business."

And I'd say one thing we haven't done, which we're working are right now, is we haven't innovated off of that idea fast enough, and you're going to see a whole new assortment of Kors watches next year, even before the wearable technology comes in. We're going to totally change the look, it's more modern, simpler, et cetera. There's a totally new look for it. It gives the consumers, the Kors fan, a reason to buy another watch. But clearly, when we put the wearable technology in there and we put -- Michael Kors himself gets behind it and the entire power of that organization is talking about technology and how can it fit with the Kors lifestyle, et cetera, we think it's another catalyst for another phase of growth.

There's no seasonality. It's not like swimwear and shorts and outerwear, et cetera. So the margins that retailers get are relatively high. And it's not typically been a big part of our ongoing business model, we don't expect that to change dramatically. As far as the wearables, as we've been talking about, we have a lower gross margin now. But we think over long term, as quantities come into play, we scale this across our platform, that we can actually have a situation where we're able to increase that over time. Just looking at Moore's Law, chips get less expensive and more robust, and we think that will play out, especially with our quantities and how we're going to go to market, and especially also with us having the expertise to develop this ourselves rather than rely on third parties largely to do most of it."

What we do, do is we analyze our business in a lot of different ways. We look at it regionally, by category, by brand. I did say earlier, the biggest change in the way we're thinking about the fourth quarter comes from Europe, where going into this last quarter, we had seen 1 quarter of less favorable performance following about 7 or 8 quarters of very strong double digit-or-so growth coming out of Europe. So the trajectory changed there fairly quickly so we've adjusted our expectations. I mean, we're coming off of a down 7.5 third quarter, up against a 10. We've we provided a wide range to reflect a relatively choppy environment right now that's difficult to predict and we want to be able to accommodate in our range the deteriorating trends.

We have been holding infrastructure tight and we think that is the way we're going to manage 2016. We've actually been operating with very limited store growth, and we would expect to continue to do that into next year. One thing that we have to work through that we don't have yet, is just what are the purchase accounting implications of the Misfit acquisition and how that will likely affect the expense line. But what we believe is that -- I mean, this is the hottest category right now and now is the time for us to invest, we're seeing traction from the investments that we're making in FOSSIL, in SKAGEN, in Omni and we intend to continue to do that and really drive the top line. Again, we talked about it on the last call -- or the last question rather, currencies are going to impact our earnings because in 2015, you really saw it in the operating margins but the earnings were lifted up because we have the nonoperating contracts supporting it below the line. Now in 2016, we're going to be anywhere from 1.5 years to 2.5 years outside of when the dollar really started strengthening. So the contracts only buy you time and now that's been neutralized. So even in the base business, all other things being equal, the currencies, because of the lack of those nonoperating gains, are going to create earnings headwinds."

Following his prepared remarks, Greg McKelvey, our Chief Strategy and Marketing Officer, will join us for Q&A.
For the third quarter, we delivered sales and earnings within our expectations. Given last year's strong third quarter, we knew that comparisons would be tough and that proved to be the case. From a top line perspective and in constant currency, overall sales declined 8%. While we are certainly not satisfied with that result, we executed well and delivered solid results in several parts of our business. Our initiative to drive our own brand is gaining traction, as both FOSSIL and SKAGEN grew even amidst a difficult environment. In constant currency, our Leathers and Jewelry businesses both continue to grow as they have for the full year and our digital and omni-channel initiatives drove strong growth in our e-commerce channel.
The challenge remains with our Watch business, which declined in the quarter. The traditional Watch category remains sluggish as tech-enabled devices offer consumers additional choices. Compounding net negative impact is the fact that we are lapping the historical outsized success of the Michael Kors brand. As a company with significant competitive advantages, we are moving quickly and ramping up innovation and design, marketing and technology to change the current trend in our business and continue to increase our share in the global watch and accessories market.
During the quarter, the FOSSIL brand grew 2% in constant currency, with increases in each of our regions and global growth led by Leathers and Watches. We launched a new FOSSIL website during the quarter that incorporates compelling brand content and stories and enhanced customer shopping experience, improved mobile capability and behind the scenes, a world-class content management system, which is a critical element in support of our omni-channel initiatives. The new website positions us to further build interest in the brand, drive sales through an improved shopping experience and learn more about our customer and further develop their relationship with the brands.
While not a third quarter development, last month, we launched our first connected accessories product with the FOSSIL Q product line. This is our first generation of wearable technology products that combines fashion and functionality. We know that customers are interested in technology and FOSSIL Q allows us to bring together fashion and function in the assortment. The reaction has been very positive, not only to the product but the entire platform, including the software application developed for users. We distributed the assortment through select FOSSIL retail doors and completely sold out the entire production quantity intended for our select wholesale partners.
I want to share a bit more about FOSSIL Q so you can appreciate the elements of the offering and understand our excitement. We created a line of fashionable connected accessories that showcases our design excellence and expert craftsmanship. In the stores now are 2 styles of watches that are nondisplay and 2 styles of tracker devices or connected bracelets. The FOSSIL Q Dreamer and Reveler are designed for both men and women and are nondisplay fashion activity trackers that include notification alerts in the form of vibrations and LED lights with a battery life lasting up to 1 week.
The FOSSIL Q Grant is one of our top-selling traditional analog watch styles for both men and women, infused with technology that interacts with a smartphone and notifies the wearer of messages and phone calls from selected context through an LED indicator and general vibration. This battery also lasts up to 1 week. Available at the end of the month, the FOSSIL Q Founder is our connected watch with display that utilizes Android wear and is one of the first digital display watches to offer full compatibility with virtually all smartphones. This product allows the wearer to customize their watch face as well as other features while utilizing the FOSSIL Q App.
The FOSSIL Q App was designed to be the command center for all the FOSSIL Q products. It allows us to uniquely interact with customers, provides important functionality like smart notifications and allows customers to learn more about themselves from tracking physical activity to counting calories and can connect seamlessly to other fitness apps that customers might already be using. The exciting thing about the app is the opportunity to eventually carry the functionality across the brands in our licensed portfolio and create a unique specialized branded experience for the customer. This will enable brands such as Michael Kors and others to compete in the connected accessories category and to attract new customers.
So overall, for FOSSIL, a good third quarter, a nice start to connected accessories in October, and we hope to build on the momentum. We look forward to seeing how the assortment performs for the holiday period, and the team is already hard at work on future generations of product.
As for SKAGEN, the brand had another good quarter, with constant currency double-digit global growth and increases in each of our regions. Watches led the performance and we are also seeing continued positive responses to both Leathers and Jewelry. We continue to see great potential with SKAGEN through expanded global distribution, fueled by excitement around its unique positioning and design.
Turning to our Multi-brand Watch portfolio. During the third quarter, our Multi-brand Watch portfolio was down 11% to last year in constant currency, a disappointing performance, with declines across our 3 regions and with a single brand driving the vast majority of that decline. We expected a tough quarter, given last year's strong performance, the historical strength of the Michael Kors brand and consumers' gravitation towards technology. We believe we have the best fashion brands in our portfolio and are focused on driving innovation, including designs, colors, styles and now technology, to drive growth in this portion of our business. We are enjoying the benefit of having Kate Spade in the portfolio and the team is working to further develop the assortment so we can fully leverage our distribution platform and expand the brand's presence globally. The team is also focused on developing the Chaps assortment ahead of its launch in early 2016.
In our international markets, we are being faced with near-term macro challenges, particularly in Asia and China. While we believe the same market dynamics that help drive our significant share gains in the U.S. will play out in the region over time, the current headwinds are impacting our business as traffic is challenged and economic conditions are volatile. In Asia, we believe the market demographics will eventually move in our favor, given the expected significant growth of the middle-class, and we are well-positioned to take advantage of fashion brands emerging to take share from traditional watch brands.
As for Europe, we also continue to see longer-term opportunities, as we grow in new markets and add more brands to our existing distribution. For the last couple of years, Europe has been a strong driver of growth for us, but those tailwinds have quickly turned to headwinds and we are now experiencing many of the same challenges we've seen in other markets. 
Now we will shift gears from our third quarter performance and talk about the market we find ourselves in today and how we are responding to the challenges and the opportunity. As we discussed last quarter, it's a very dynamic and exciting time in retail and particularly in our space. With disruption in the market comes opportunity to take advantage of growth and changing trends. It reminds us of the last time we faced segment growth, which was in 2008. We regrouped and refocused our efforts on design and innovation and positioned FOSSIL Group for strong growth. While today's source of disruption in the market is different than it was at that time, our sense of determination, focus and drive for innovation hasn't changed. And with the strength of FOSSIL Q, we have already proven our ability to identify and fill voids within a trending category, delivering fashion and function that sets us apart from our peers.
Currently, technology is emerging as the latest trend in fashion, with a growing interest in wearable technology inspiring new entrants into the watch space as well as explosive growth in activity trackers. Our acquisition of Misfit will allow us to combine our key competitive advantages in design, sourcing and distribution and powerful brands, with a business that is already a recognized player in technology-infused accessories and possesses a world-class software and hardware engineering team that stays ahead of emerging technology trends. You can find additional information regarding Misfit and their technology platform and the connected accessories opportunity in the slide presentation on our Investor Relations website.
For those of you that do not know Misfit, it is a company that started just a few years ago and is led by Sonny Vu, a highly regarded thought leader in the wearable technology space. They have a robust product pipeline focused on exciting tech-enabled experiences across multiple distribution channels, including consumer technology, healthcare, enterprise and wholesale. We are excited to have Sonny join us as the President and Chief Technology Officer of Connected Devices here at FOSSIL Group as well as the rest of the team at Misfit.
As we have told many of you, we envision a day when watches and accessories across all of our brands will be connected devices. With the acquisition of Misfit, FOSSIL Group will be uniquely positioned to lead the convergence of style and technology to become the fashion gateway to the high-growth wearable technology and connected device markets. This acquisition accelerates our ability to compete in the connected accessory space, as we expand our addressable market while leveraging all of the design and scale with which we serve the existing watch market.
We are very excited about this acquisition for many reasons. First, Misfit's culture and qualities are aligned with FOSSIL Group. Like us, Misfit has an energetic culture that embraces innovation. Their team of roughly 200 people includes a highly talented engineering group that is focused on new technologies and functionality for accessories. On top of this, Misfit shares our appreciation for design and branding with the use of color and unique style that surpasses others in the space. And they have a holistic approach to technology that improves the quality of life with the integration of data tracking. We expect to integrate Misfit's technology platform into our FOSSIL and SKAGEN brands and have the opportunity to do the same across our portfolio of powerful brands.
Second, Misfit is a globally recognized wearable technology brand in the activity tracker space. As many of you are aware, the activity tracker space is one of the fastest-growing segments in accessories, given strong consumer interest in learning more about health, wellness and improving the quality of life. We believe some of the headwinds we have been experiencing resulted from a lack of technology in our core business, and this acquisition will allow us to quickly start turning those headwinds into tailwinds.
And third, we see a significant opportunity to drive top line growth. We expect to accelerate Misfit sales growth as we leverage our distribution platform and their pipeline of innovative products. We will also leverage Misfit's scalable cloud and app platform and its world-class engineering team to develop cutting-edge, technology-infused products for our portfolio beginning in holiday of 2016. Sonny and the team at Misfit will collaborate with FOSSIL Group to develop new functionality for accessories that is relevant for our brands and customers.
And while in the near term our focus will be on driving sales growth, we also see margin expansion opportunities longer-term from the added scale Misfit will bring to our company. This is a very exciting development for FOSSIL Group and we believe it is a great investment in the future of the company.
Overall, we continue to believe, based on independent forecasts, that the watch category will grow over the next several years. Beyond that, we believe that technology can expand that growth by bringing new customers, those that don't traditionally wear watches, into the space. Within that category and with our strategic advantages, the design, branding and the distribution, we believe we are poised to gain share. While recently we believe we have been disadvantaged as the fashion trend in watches is about technology, with Misfit, we believe we are poised to capitalize on today's fashion in a differentiated way that helps consumers enhance their lives. Simply put, we will marry fashion with technology and distribute it with strong branding across our distribution platform.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Dennis for more comments."

I'd like to start with discussing our third quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year before going into additional detail regarding the Misfit acquisition.Third quarter net sales decreased",3271,"Thanks, Kosta, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start with discussing our third quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year before going into additional detail regarding the Misfit acquisition.
Third quarter net sales decreased 8% and on a reported basis declined 14% to $771 million. While sales overall were soft, partially due to the strong quarter we experienced in 2014, they came in at the low end of our expectations. For the quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $1.19 compared to $1.96 last year. Compared to the third quarter of 2014, this quarter's EPS was negatively impacted by roughly $0.40 due to currencies and another $0.05 due to our restructuring charges. Our investments to support our strategic initiatives and enhanced marketing totaled about $0.19 per share, and the current quarter benefited $0.13 due to a lower tax rate.
FOSSIL sales increased 2% in constant dollars. Leathers and Watches grew, while Jewelry was flat. Sales for the brand increased in all 3 regions, with the highest growth in Asia. The brand drove positive comps in Europe and a double-digit increase in our global e-com business, driven by higher traffic and improved conversion rates.
SKAGEN sales grew 10% in constant dollars, with growth in all 3 regions. Solid growth in watches drove the business, with increases in Leathers and Jewelry as well. In constant dollars, our Multi-brand Watch portfolio declined 11% compared to last year, partially due to last year's tough 12% comparison, but also it is clear that technology is putting pressure on the traditional watch category. Compounding this effect is the fact that we have brands in our portfolio that are lapping historically explosive growth.
In the Americas, reported sales decreased 11% to $391 million, a 10% constant dollar decrease. The decrease was driven by Watches, as the decline in the category offset modest growth in Leathers and Jewelry. Across brands, constant dollar sales for the Armani brands, SKAGEN and FOSSIL increased during the quarter, and we continued to benefit from the addition of Kate Spade New York. The remainder of the brands within the portfolio declined.
Within the region, growth in the retail channel was driven by a strong performance in Canada, which was offset by a decline in wholesale sales. Comp store sales declined slightly as traffic continued to be down in the region, particularly in markets that benefit from heavy tourism. We're pleased with our e-com results, where sales increased across all of our websites. Constant dollar wholesale sales were down to last year, largely driven by U.S. department stores where the business continues to be soft.
In Europe, the sharp change in trend that we experienced in the second quarter continued into the third, as reported sales decreased 15% to $260 million. Constant dollar sales decreased 3%. Modest growth in Jewelry and Leathers offset the decline in Watches. The decline in the region was driven by the licensed portfolio offsetting growth in FOSSIL and SKAGEN where watches drove the growth in both brands. Within the region, declines in distributor markets and the U.K. offset slight increases in France and Italy. In the region, growth in the retail channel was driven by new stores and positive comps including a solid performance in FOSSIL stores. Our e-com business performed very well in the quarter, with strong double-digit growth supported by more effective investments in marketing.
In Asia, reported sales decreased 19% to $120 million, while constant dollar sales decreased 10%. Growth in Leathers offset a decline in Watches and a slight decline in Jewelry. Strong growth in India was offset by declines in most markets in the region, including Korea, Hong Kong and China, where general economic sluggishness and changing travel patterns continue to impact our business. Michael Kors, FOSSIL and SKAGEN were our strongest performers, with each of the brands delivering increases. Comp store sales decreased in the region.
Before I move past sales, let me pause and provide some additional context. To reiterate Kosta's point, we are not satisfied with our top line. As you can see from our announcements today, we are committed to investing to drive growth. The data we collect suggests that, very recently, the watch category has declined with what we believe are 2 root causes. First, tech-enabled watches are clearly impacting traditional watches. Some of that may be temporary, but the data clearly support that. Second, the huge success that the Michael Kors brand had in driving interest to the category has not yet translated to other brands. It is a phenomenon that can obviously affect our results but also masks our overall performance. On a year-to-date basis, excluding Michael Kors, our Watch business is roughly flat in constant dollars and we believe outperforming the overall category. Our independent research shows that apart from Michael Kors, we are gaining share in the U.S. watch market at price points under $1,000, and we believe we've got the best set of brands to drive share gains in the future. Again, we are not satisfied and we remain committed to driving growth, but we believe that despite the current challenges, we have been able to maintain and advance our leadership position.
So moving back now to the quarter's results. In the quarter, gross profit decreased to $418 million and gross margin declined to 270 basis points to 54.2%. The decrease was primarily driven by changes in foreign currency. Excluding the currency headwind, gross margin actually expanded during the quarter, mainly due to our pricing initiatives and lower product costs, partially offset by markdown in clearance activities.
Third quarter operating expenses decreased 3% to $342 million due to the impact of changes in foreign currency and included $3 million for restructuring programs that we announced earlier. As planned, excluding the impact of currencies and restructuring, operating expenses increased slightly due to increased marketing and advertising investments, investments to support strategic initiatives and new store expenses associated with 2014 store openings. Infrastructure expenses were down compared to last year. Our third quarter operating expense rate was 44.3% compared to 39.6%.
Operating income decreased to $76 million, including a $33 million unfavorable currency impact; and operating margin decreased to 9.8%, including a 330 basis point headwind from currencies. Higher marketing and strategic investments, greater retail mix, deleverage on fixed cost given the sales decline and restructuring charges, offset by constant dollar gross margin improvements, accounted for the other changes in operating margin. Interest expense increased to $5 million given our higher debt levels. Third quarter other income increased $5 million to $7 million due to net gains on foreign currency contracts and account balances.
Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter was 22.3%, lower than last year's 30.6% due to the favorable impact of foreign tax credits recognized during the quarter. Third quarter net income decreased to $58 million, largely due to lower sales and operating income, partially offset by lower taxes.
Now turning to our cash flows and balance sheet. For the quarter, our operations consumed $28 million of cash versus providing $42 million a year ago. We drew down a net $113 million on our revolver. We invested $21 million in CapEx and $12 million to repurchase roughly 200,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $69. We ended the quarter with $829 million remaining on our repurchase authorization. We ended the quarter with $302 million in cash and $807 million in debt.
Third quarter ending inventory totaled $746 million, a 7% increase compared to last year, given lower demand this year. Our inventory growth is primarily in our better-selling brands, and we have adjusted our receipt plans to reflect changing sales trends. We also are working to reduce our Swiss inventory levels, which are higher than planned given sluggishness in certain markets like Asia. Accounts receivable decreased by 17% to $330 million, and wholesale DSOs were in line with the prior year. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $20 million for the quarter.
Now let me share with you our updated outlook for the rest of the year. The bulk of my analysis will exclude the impact of currencies, restructuring charges and Misfit transaction costs. I will provide the related GAAP numbers at the end, which will include those items. Given our expectation that the Misfit acquisition will close late in the fourth quarter, we don't expect the impact on our operating results, other than the transaction cost, will be material. After that, I'll talk about the acquisition of Misfit and how we see that affecting our sales growth, operating results and capital deployment over the next few years.
Let's start with the rest of 2015. As a reminder, the factors that we've always anticipated would affect our 2015 results have materialized and have not abated. In fact, some have intensified since last we spoke. The U.S. dollar continues to be relatively strong, putting pressure on both top line growth and margins. The phenomenal historical success of probably the hottest fashion-launched brand ever, Michael Kors, is affecting our year-over-year comparisons. And it is clear that wearables on the wrist are here to stay, giving our existing customers new choices while also expanding the population of new people, mainly millennials, who want to wear something on their wrist. We think that's affecting the category as a whole in the immediate near term, but it provides us a huge opportunity over time. Over the last quarter, we also saw a sequential change in each of our regional businesses, with category pressures intensifying uniformly. In the Americas, with continued category softness, we expect wholesale partners will manage inventory levels tightly, impacting fourth quarter receipt plans.
On our last call, we reported that we had not anticipated the significant slowdown that we experienced in the second quarter in Europe. In addition to many economic factors that are weighing on the region, we now believe that many of the same factors that are affecting the category in other regions are impacting our European business, especially in the wholesale channels. There are still several markets where we continue to see significant white space opportunities, but markets like the U.K. and the Middle East have been challenging and we now expect that trend to continue in the fourth quarter.
Finally, in Asia, while there are pockets of strength like India, which continues to be a big long-term opportunity, most markets continue to be sluggish and our third quarter business did not materialize as we had planned. While there are headwinds in our business, we continue to be pleased with our progress in FOSSIL and SKAGEN and look forward to a holiday period supported by the marketing investments we have been making to continue to build and drive traffic both to stores and websites. And we're very excited about the launch of our FOSSIL Q wearables. The response from customers has been encouraging and we're excited about the buzz that these great products have created.
Given those factors for the fourth quarter, we're expecting constant dollar sales to decline between 2% and 11%. Excluding the impact of last year's extra first quarter week, this would result in a full year sales decline between 1% and 3.5%. We are planning constant dollar gross margins flat to slightly down in the quarter. Our price initiatives continue to drive improvements in our margins so we have now anniversary-ed some of our initial price increases so the benefit will not be as strong as we've seen in recent quarters. The change in trajectory of our international businesses, where margins are stronger, will offset some of that benefit. Also, given the softness in the watch category, we also expect we may need to invest to help traffic and move inventory during the key holiday period. Overall, for the full year, we expect a modest expansion of constant dollar gross margin.
For the fourth quarter, we are planning with a higher expense rate, driven mainly by the investments we are making in marketing and in our strategic initiatives, and these will account for nearly 1/2 of the rate growth. The rate will also be affected by last year's fourth quarter reversal of performance compensation accruals and the impact of this year's lower sales on our fixed infrastructure. Overall, we expect our full year expense rate will be higher, mainly due to the strategic investments, along with the impact of stores that we opened in 2014. Given these factors, we are planning adjusted fourth quarter operating margin in the range of 12% and 15%, and full year adjusted operating margin in the range between 12.5% and 13.5%. In constant dollars, we estimate that fourth quarter adjusted EPS would be in the range between $1.40 and $2 per share, and full year constant dollar adjusted EPS would be in the range between $5.60 and $6.20 per share.
On a reported basis, we anticipate fourth quarter sales to decline in the range between 7% and 16% and full year sales decline in the range between 8% and 10.5%. We expect reported fourth quarter operating margin in the range between 8.5% and 11.5%, and full year operating margin in the range between 9% and 10%. We expect reported fourth quarter EPS in the range between $1.05 and $1.65, and full year EPS in the range between $4.15 and $4.75. These reported amounts include restructuring charges of $24 million or $0.35 per share for the full year, of which $2 million or $0.03 per share will be recorded in the fourth quarter. They also include an estimated $8 million or $0.12 per share for Misfit transaction costs, which will also be recorded as an operating expense in the fourth quarter.
We are planning with a fourth quarter tax rate of 31%. Given the lower tax rate in the third quarter, we are now planning the full year with a tax rate of roughly 28%, and we now expect annual CapEx to be approximately $90 million. Our guidance continues to include higher interest costs due to increased debt levels and additional share repurchase more in line with our third quarter activity.
Now let me share some additional perspective on Misfit and how we see this opportunity impacting our financials and capital deployment over the next few years. There's plenty of growth still left in traditional watches, where we have a clear competitive advantage, but there are customers, mainly millennials, who don't wear watches because watches don't give them the functionality that they want, and that's tech. Then there's the wearables market, estimated to grow at a 36% CAGR to $45 billion by 2019. Despite that enormous growth, we believe there are consumers who won't participate in connected accessories because it doesn't give them what they want, fashion and design across the brands that they love. We believe our acquisition of Misfit, the scalable tech platform it brings, and the world-class engineering team it brings, fast-forward FOSSIL Group to be the one company that can drive the convergence of the growing watch and wearables markets with all the necessary capabilities to compete: design and innovation, global distribution and operating platform, world-class supply chain and scale to drive the right economics, a leading-edge tech platform and app experience and the best lifestyle brand that consumers love.
There are and will be companies who can design great products but who lack the scale that our production volumes of nearly 30 million watches a year create. There are and will be companies who design great products at scale but they lack the breadth of our portfolio of 16 lifestyle brands. There are and will be companies who produce big volumes of tech products but they lack the design and style that so many consumers demand. When we do that analysis, we believe that we are uniquely positioned in this market and set up to win like no one else can. The integration of technology into watches is the next innovation in the evolution of the category, and we believe we can once again do what we did to the functional watch category: grow and gain share by elegantly and seamlessly blending design and brand with function. We believe that this acquisition can be the catalyst to reverse our most recent trends, to quickly restore growth and has the potential to drive strong growth beyond what we might have imagined just a couple of years ago. It will not be easy and it will require additional investments. This is arguably one of the hottest consumer trends right now and now is the time to invest in marketing and building awareness for our brands and amazing new products. That's what we plan to do in 2016.
So while we expect the acquisition will drive growth next year, beyond growing Misfit's roughly $30 million 2015 revenues, we expect earnings and margin dilution for next year. It will also not be until the second half of next year that we can bring products to market that leverage the Misfit platform. These assumptions assume a relatively stable currency environment. So 2016's earnings, unrelated to the acquisition of Misfit, would not benefit from the significant nonoperating currency gains that 2015's earnings did.
As we move past next year, we'd expect growth to accelerate as we bring more brands onto the platform. As that growth accelerates, we do expect to see downward pressure on gross margins as wearables becomes a larger part of our mix. We also expect that accelerated growth will provide an opportunity for infrastructure leverage that can begin to restore sequential earnings growth.
Now let me discuss briefly how we think of this transaction in terms of our capital structure and deployment. As we've always said, our top priority for capital deployment is to drive growth to deliver value to shareholders, and this fits that priority perfectly. At the purchase price of $260 million including transaction costs, it is a similar-sized deal to our SKAGEN acquisition in 2012. While we're still very pleased with SKAGEN, the Misfit acquisition will play a much broader strategic role in driving growth. It does give us a brand that is native to the wearable space and we believe we have great potential to drive that brand's growth by leveraging our global distribution and operating platform.
Beyond that, though, the capabilities and speed that it brings, we believe, can be an enormous catalyst to drive growth across our entire portfolio and deliver even greater value to shareholders. Investing in share repurchase has always been an important, though secondary, vehicle, by which we deliver value to our shareholders. We will finance the acquisition, which represents a little more than 1 year of free cash flow through a combination of bank debt and repatriated international cash. It does bring our leverage ratio to levels where we have not historically operated, though we believe still with ample liquidity to fund our operations, capital needs while leaving some dry powder to be opportunistic. Our near-term strategy then will be to prioritize our free cash flow to restore leverage ratios to more recent levels, likely limiting near-term share repurchases to levels sufficient to offset dilution from annual employee equity activity.
So to close, Kosta said it best in today's earnings release. We remain confident in our long-term strategy. We believe the substantial capabilities we acquire with Misfit and the many opportunities it creates, combined with our diversified business model, our solid financial position and cash flow generation, set us up to win over the long term and drive value for our shareholders. We are very excited about our future.
So with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

Yes, in terms of the confidence in the size of the category, it's -- I think first is we're seeing the market develop, where it's increasingly clear to us that wearable technology is and will be a large growing category. There's projections out there that are putting it at about $45 billion in the next 4 or 5 years with roughly 2/3 of that being wrist worn. That would put the size of that market at roughly the same size of the under $1,000 global watch market. And we believe that all 3 categories that make up that market, which would be activity trackers, smart watches with display and then the third being smarter watches, so integrating technology similar to what you'd find in activity tracker into the same type of watches we sell today, all 3 of those are viable products that are -- that we see actually our FOSSIL Q launch being very successful with. So we're going -- part of that, we see the market's developing and we have a position to play in it. With Misfit, it's -- we've learned a lot in the last couple of years in developing product and bringing it to market, FOSSIL Q. We believe that we're now in a connected age where apps and cloud services are effectively now part of product and an extension of brand and that needs to support and mirror our business model of today, so meaning multi-brand, fashion- and design-driven and globally scalable. And it's so integral now to product and brand development that it's really too important to outsource that to somebody else. So we need -- we want to own that customer experience, own the platform, be able to have -- be -- get to market much more quickly. And then as we scale it across the breadth of our portfolio of brands in 20 languages in 115 countries, just the pure economics of scaling our product size, breadth, number of brands across the fixed cost of the development of that platform makes for much more attractive margins ultimately than we'd get if we fully outsourced it."

They've got an 18-month pipeline of products and innovation that we're going to be able to extend not only into the Misfit brand but into the full breadth of our product portfolio and brand portfolio.

They're selling in terms of trackers and also in new entrants in smart watches. You could say for our overall Watch business that there -- we have a fashion miss, which is we don't have technology across our platform. There seems to be, in just the general watch business, that people are maybe waiting to see, they're looking for technology, they're not sure. In the meantime, wrist devices with technology are selling extremely quickly. So we think that one of the most important fashion trends right now in the industry is this huge interest on the consumer side of the convergence of fashion and technology. And we are moving very quickly to make sure that we can scale technology in many different ways across our platform, as we mentioned, not just in Android display smart watches but across our entire platform of devices and watches, putting sensors and connectivity, et cetera. And we think, actually, at some point, everything we make will have some type of chip in it that will add additional functionality and not at a lot of additional cost because of the fact that we make 50 million pieces of accessories a year and it's going to enable us to scale it across our entire organization. But it's all the stuff we've talked about in the past. And one thing is millennials clearly overspend on technology. There's a -- seems to be a slowdown in consumer activity overall, but one thing that's clear is consumers are still spending on technology and we think that continues. We also know that from our past, consumers will spend on additional functionality. A lot of our growth over the last 5 years has come from us adding chronographs and other technical features that are higher average retail and consumers are very willing to spend it and that's one of the things we're going to be putting in there. The other thing to remember is the watch industry is fundamentally a small business, about $65 billion globally. So the projections on the wearable business are that it's going to grow very quickly and at some point will be of the same size as the watch business. But if you look at the trillions that's being spent on technology right now from all different types of cellphones and service and games, et cetera, if a small percentage of that spending comes into our accessory business, it can make a huge impact on it and that's what we're working for. And this acquisition also gives us the ability to innovate and differentiate us from our competitors. We're going to be able to put products on the market that are unique and special and address people's lives in many different ways and it's going to be a very unique and long-term opportunity for us to differentiate and to innovate like we do in the rest of our business."

We're going to totally change the look. It's more modern, simpler, et cetera. There's a totally new look for it. It gives the consumer, the Kors fan, a reason to buy another watch.

Every region, those brands are growing in. We're seeing benefits from the marketing investments that we are making. And our omni investments are also yielding dividends. Our e-commerce business has been up. So there's a lot of tailwinds going into next year. What remains to be seen is what are the -- and we really need the fourth quarter to get better informed about this. What are the category trends? How is the consumer feeling? Economic trends, brand trends. So we need more and we'll learn more through the fourth quarter. But we see a portfolio going into next year that includes a number of tailwinds including -- this acquisition will provide many of those."

The products look great and we're showing some pretty good increases relative to the market. So this is a typical pro forma for us. When times get tough, we innovate like crazy and put more designs in there, take some chances, et cetera. And typically during tough times, we come out of it in pretty strong growth. Our operating model is really built for resilience and flexibility. Our inventory turns are faster than the rest of the market. Our design innovation is better and quicker. Our resources are broader and have a larger scale. Just giving you one example is that we -- globally, we use -- most of our business is done through our own wholly owned subsidiaries where our competitors largely use distributors. When times get tough, distributors pull back in inventory investments, et cetera and we just keep going. So this is the time for us to get stronger, take more share while we're moving very quickly, to disrupt the market with new innovation, with technology and new ideas, et cetera. So we think we're in a pretty good position. Over the next couple of years, we think it will play out pretty well for us."

And it's not typically been a big part of our ongoing business model. We don't expect that to change dramatically. As far as the wearables, as we've been talking about, we have a lower gross margin now. But we think over long term, as quantities come into play and we scale this across our platform, that we can actually have a situation where we're able to increase that over time. Just looking at Moore's Law, chips get less expensive and more robust, and we think that will play out for us, especially with our quantities and how we're going to go to market and especially also with us having the expertise to develop this ourselves rather than rely on third parties largely to do most of it."

What we do, do is we analyze our business in a lot of different ways. We look at it regionally, by category, by brand. I did say earlier, the biggest change in the way we're thinking about the fourth quarter comes from Europe, where going into this last quarter, we had seen 1 quarter of less favorable performance following about 7 or 8 quarters of very strong double digits-or-so growth coming out of Europe. So the trajectory changed there fairly quickly so we've adjusted our expectations. I mean, we're coming off of a down 7.5 third quarter, up against a 10. We've we provided a wide range to reflect a relatively choppy environment right now that's difficult to predict and we want to be able to accommodate in our range the deteriorating trends.

We have been holding infrastructure tight and we think that is the way we're going to manage 2016. We've actually been operating with very limited store growth, and we would expect to continue to do that into next year. One thing that we have to work through that we don't have yet, is just what are the purchase accounting implications of the Misfit acquisition and how that will likely affect the expense line. But what we believe is that -- I mean, this is the hottest category right now and now is the time for us to invest. We're seeing traction from the investments that we're making in FOSSIL, in SKAGEN, in Omni and we intend to continue to do that and really drive the top line. Again, we talked about it on the last call -- or the last question rather, currencies are going to impact our earnings because in 2015, you really saw it in the operating margins but the earnings were lifted up because we had the nonoperating contracts supporting it below the line. Now in 2016, we're going to be anywhere from 1.5 years to 2.5 years outside of when the dollar really started strengthening. So the contracts only buy you time and now that's been neutralized.
