Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly auto parts fourth quarter conference call.

David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman; Ted Wise, our Executive Vice President of expansion; and Greg Johnson, our Executive Vice President of supply chain, are also present. 
I'd like to begin our call today by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another great quarter, which closes out a very successful year. Our team's ability to consistently grow market share by providing excellent customer service, day in and day out, is highlighted by our comparable store sales results, which exceeded 5% each quarter of 2014 and finished at 6% for the full year. Our goal is not just to grow our market share, but to grow it profitably. And again, our team's commitment to customer service drove exceptional results in 2014 as we set record high quarterly operating margins each quarter of the year. These consistently outstanding results was a result of the hard work and dedication of each of our Team Members, and I would like to thank our team for their relentless commitment to our ongoing success.
As we have seen the past 3 quarters, undercar repairs such as brakes, driveline, chassis and ride control were key contributors to our strong 6.3% comparable store sales increase for the fourth quarter, which exceeded our guidance of 3% to 5%. The strength in undercar categories, along with general strength in all hard parts categories, drove comparable store sales of 6% for the year, which exceeded our guidance from the beginning of the year of 3% to 5%. 
For the year, we increased sales by $567 million to $7.2 billion, and we are especially proud of our team's ability to profitably grow market share as we achieved another quarterly record operating profit of 17.2% in the fourth quarter, culminating in a record full year operating profit of 17.6% for 2014, which is 100 basis point increase over 2013. 
Our ability to profitably grow market share, combined with the prudent expense control, yielded earnings per share growth of 26% for the quarter, representing our 24th consecutive quarter with earnings per share growth in excess of 15%. For the year, earnings per share increased to $7.34 a share, which is a 22% increase over the prior year and represents the sixth consecutive year of EPS growth in excess of 21%. 
For the quarter, our comparable store sales were a robust 6.3% on top of strong comps in the fourth quarter of 2014 of 5.4%. Sales volumes during the quarter were relatively consistent. However, comparable store sales percentages slowed somewhat in December as we faced our toughest comparisons. Both our DIY and our professional comparable store sales were strongly positive for both the quarter and for the year.
I would now like to discuss our comparable ticket count and average ticket size results and how these factor into our view for 2015. For the quarter and full year, we consistently and robustly grew our professional comparable transaction count as we very successfully grow in new and acquired markets. We expect to continue to aggressively grow our professional business throughout 2015. 
On the DIY side of the business, we generated comparable traffic growth for both the quarter and for the year. Our improved DIY business is the combined result of our focus on opportunities on this side of the business, which Jeff will discuss in a moment, and a gradual improvement in the health of the DIY consumer.
During the year, the unemployment rate has dropped from 6.7% to 5.6%. This improvement has contributed to a consistent, yet somewhat modest, growth path in miles driven, and we are optimistic this trend, combined with lower gas prices, will be a tailwind to the DIY business in 2015. 
Average ticket increases are due to an increased mix of hard parts sales and increased parts complexity, which drives up the average repair cost. The increase in average ticket has been -- has not benefited from inflation for the past 2 years, and we have seen less than 0.5% of inflation on selling price for like parts. This recent trend is below historic norms and creates a headwind to the comp growth we expect in 2015. However, we expect to see continued growth in average transaction size, driven by increased parts complexity and cost of repair, which we firmly believe is a long-term driver in our industry.
For the first quarter of 2015 and the full year, we are establishing comparable store sales guidance of 3% to 5%. In developing our guidance, we expect miles driven will continue to increase at a moderate rate and benefit demand in our industry. We base this view on the improving health of the consumer and, for the time being, lower gas prices.
We further expect to see continued growth in miles driven, specifically in a population of out-of-warranty vehicles as the better engineered and manufactured vehicles from the past 15 years are capable of being reliably driven with high mileages if reasonably maintained. We believe this is an ongoing long-term trend that will benefit our industry for the foreseeable future. Finally, our comparable store sales expectations assume pricing in the industry will remain rational, and as I previously noted, inflation will remain muted.
While we expect each of these factors to be tailwinds for our business in the coming year, we will face tough 2014 comparisons in every quarter of 2015. Ultimately, our ability to grow our comparable store sales in 2015 and beyond is based on our team's commitment of providing the highest levels of service in our industry, and I'm very confident that commitment is very strong. Not only has our team been able to increase our total sales by 8.5% over the prior year, the sales increase represents sustainable profitable growth, which is reflected in our strong gross margin expansion. 
For the year, our gross margin improved to 51.4% of sales, which was a 73 basis point improvement and at the top end of our beginning of the year gross margin guidance of 50.9% to 51.4%. During the year, our gross margin improvement was driven by significant product acquisition cost improvements and a growing mix of higher-margin hard parts as a percentage of our total sales mix. Looking at 2015, we are setting our gross margin guidance at 51.8% to 52.2%. Our assumptions in developing this guidance are based on the abatement of the LIFO impact we experienced in 2014, which Tom will discuss in more detail; continued rational industry pricing; and modest incremental improvements in the acquisition costs and distribution center efficiency. 
Thanks to the dedication of our over 67,000 Team Members, we continue to aggressively grow our market share. We are very confident we will continue to execute our proven model at a very high level. Based on the strength of our team and our continued confidence in the long-term drivers of demand in our industry, we are establishing our operating margin guidance for 2015 at a range of 18.1% to 18.5%. We are also establishing our earnings per share guidance at $8.20 to $8.30.
January yielded solid results for us, so we feel like we're off to a good start in 2015. And to complete my comments, I would like to commend all of Team O'Reilly for a record-breaking performance in 2014 and their ongoing commitment to our continued success. Because of each of you, 2014 represents the 22nd consecutive year we have increased both our comparable store sales and our operating income every year our company has been publicly trading. Thanks to all of you for your excellent work. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Shaw."

I'd like to begin by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another outstanding quarter and year. Our industry-leading 6.3% fourth quarter comps and full year comps of 6% wouldn't be possible without the excellent consistent customer service you provide our customers. Your relentless focus on [indiscernible] and outservicing our competitors drives our success, and I'd like to thank you for your hard work and commitment. Today, I'm going to discuss our operational results for the quarter and year and provide color on some of our operational initiatives. 
SG&A levered 23 basis points for the fourth quarter and 28 basis points for the year, driven by our strong comp performance. At the beginning of the year, we anticipated per-store SG&A would increase around 1.5% for the year, but actual results for the year were an increase of 3%. Early in the year, we made the decision to be more aggressive in our store staffing to capitalize on the favorable industry trends. As we've discussed on this call many times, we staff our stores to provide excellent customer service and to fuel the growth of our business. Based on our industry-leading comparable store sales results, we feel this decision to be more aggressive was warranted.
When we look at our business, we know we have a tremendous opportunity to improve our average DIY per store volumes. I'd like to touch on 2 of the items we feel helped drive our strong DIY results for the year and feel that we will continue to drive our business going forward. First, as I mentioned, we were aggressive in our store staffing hours, while also increasing the flexibility of those hours. This allowed us to provide better levels of customer service, especially on nights and weekends, which are high-volume DIY times. Second, we continue to roll out enhanced weekend access to expanded inventories to our DC and hub networks. We began testing this in 2012 and began rolling it out in 2013 through 2014. This enhanced parts availability has been a strong driver to our weekend business. Based on our results in 2014, we feel we have our store staffing levels dialed in at the appropriate level to provide excellent customer service and drive sales growth. As a result, we expect to see a more moderate growth in average SG&A per store and are establishing guidance at an increase of 1.5% per store for 2015. 
Touching on our distribution team. We successfully opened distribution centers in Lakeland, Florida, Chicago, Illinois and Boston, Massachusetts during the year. Each of these DCs came online very smoothly and are now servicing all of the stores in their respective service areas.
With the addition of these 3 DCs, we're well positioned for expansion in new and existing markets with capacity for an additional 800 stores across the country. Our ability to provide industry-leading parts availability operating very cost effectively is a big driver of our sales and profitability growth, and I'd like to congratulate our DC teams on a great 2014.
For the year, we accomplished our goal of opening 200 net new stores. We continue to take advantage of new store opportunities across the country with the most significant growth concentrated in the following regions: the Florida market, supported by our new Lakeland DC; California, as we backfill attractive markets not previously penetrated by CSK; the upper Great Lakes as we ease growth constraints across multiple DCs with the opening of the new Chicago DC; and Texas, which continues to be a growing market for us. 
For 2015, we expect to open 205 new stores. We will again open new stores across the country with areas of high concentrations similar to 2014 and additional growth ramping up in the Northeast supported by the Boston DC. We've been very pleased with the productivity of our new stores and believe that 2015 store class will produce another great year.
In closing, I would like to again thank all of our 67,000 Team Members for your hard work and dedication. Your focus on providing excellent customer service each and every day is the reason we had such a successful 2014 and it will be the driver to a great 2015. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."
324289,280980976,755551,"O'Reilly Automotive Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I would also like to thank all Team O'Reilly for your continued dedication to excellent customer service, which drove our outstanding results. I will take a closer look at our results and provide additional guidance for 2015. For the quart",1210,"Thanks, Jeff. I would also like to thank all Team O'Reilly for your continued dedication to excellent customer service, which drove our outstanding results. I will take a closer look at our results and provide additional guidance for 2015. 
For the quarter, sales increased $143 million comprised of $100 million increase in comp store sales, a $42 million increase in noncomp store sales, a $2 million increase in noncomp nonstore sales and a $1 million decrease from closed stores. For the year, total sales are $7.2 billion, which represents an annual increase of 8.5% over the prior year and finished at the top end of our initial revenue guidance of $7 billion to $7.2 billion. For 2015, we're establishing our revenue guidance at $7.6 billion to $7.8 billion.
Our gross margin results of 51.4% this year were very strong, improving 73 basis points as we are very successful in reducing acquisition costs. However, the impact of our LIFO creates the need for additional color in this area. Our success in reducing our acquisition cost over time exhausted our LIFO reserve, with the result that additional cost decreases create onetime noncash headwinds to gross margin as we adjust our existing inventory on hand to the lower cumulative acquisition costs. 
For the year, our gross margin of 51.4% included LIFO headwind of $41 million. As Greg previously mentioned, our gross margin guidance for 2015 is 51.8% to 52.2%. This guidance assumes it will not experience additional LIFO headwinds. Said another way, we expect the acquisition price decreases and increases to be about the same in 2015. To the extent we are successful in gaining net reductions, we will face more LIFO headwinds. However, if this does occur, we would expect a much smaller impact than we experienced in 2014 and our merchandise margins will see a corresponding benefit from the decreased cost. When we look at our quarterly gross margin, we expect our rate results to be relatively consistent quarter-to-quarter in 2015. This means we will see our largest year-over-year gross margin increase in the first quarter due to the significant LIFO headwinds we experienced in the first quarter of 2014.
Our effective tax rate for the year was 36.3%, which was better than our beginning-of-the-year estimate of 37% as we benefited from better-than-expected job tax credits. When we look at the full year of 2015, we'd expect our tax rate to be approximately 37% of pretax income as certain job tax credit programs have expired. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, we expect our quarterly tax rate to be around 37.3%, with the exception of the third quarter when we expect that tax rate of approximately 36.2% as we adjust for the tolling of certain tax periods. These estimated rates are subject to the resolution of open tax periods under audit and our success in qualifying for existing job tax credit programs. 
Now we move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results and our expectations for 2015. For the year, we generated free cash flow of $760 million, which exceeded our beginning-of-the-year estimate of $570 million to $620 million. I'll spend some time to discuss the main factors driving our free cash flow results. 
Inventory per store at the end of the year was $585,000, which was an increase of 2.6%. We had expected to keep per-store inventory flat from 2013. However, we ended the year with a spike in December DC inventory. For 2015, we expect our per-store inventory to increase a little less than 1% per store. Our ongoing goal is to ensure we're growing per store inventory at a lower rate than the comparable store sales growth we generated. We accomplished that goal in 2014, expect to continue with our success of efficiently deploying inventory in 2015. 
Our AP inventory ratio finished the year at 94.6%. This was substantially better than the beginning-of-the-year estimate of approaching 90%, and this strong improvement, combined with net income over plan, were the main drivers to our better-than-expected free cash flow. In 2015, we expect the growth of this ratio to slow substantially as we approach a yet to be determined ceiling and are projecting the year-end 2015 AP inventory ratio of 97%. For the year, capital expenditures were $430 million, which was above the range we established at the beginning of the year of $390 million to $420 million. This above expectations result was driven by an increased percent of owned versus lease properties under development for opening in 2015, resulting in a higher investment for these new stores in the books at year-end than we expected. 
For 2015, we're setting our CapEx guidance at $400 million to $430 million. The decrease is the result of the completion of our last [indiscernible] DC openings, offset in part by the higher mix of owned stores versus leased. Given these factors, we're setting our 2015 full year free cash flow guidance of $675 million to $725 million.
This moves us along to our capital structure. Yes, we're still below our target debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2x to 2.25x. During the year, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio actually decreased from 1.9x to 1.7x. However, we continue to believe our stated range is appropriate for our business. We will continue to look for the appropriate time to take on additional borrowings and enter our range knowing that we remain very committed to prudently managing our debt levels so that we can maintain or improve our investment-grade ratings, which are a critical factor to the success of our vendor financing program. On this point, we are very pleased by the recent action of Standard & Poor's to raise our corporate credit rating and the ratings on our bonds from BBB flat to BBB+.
We continue to execute our share repurchase program, and in the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $152.05 per share for a total investment of $179 million. Subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter through yesterday, we repurchased an additional 0.1 million shares at an average price of $183.20 per share, for an additional $9 million investment. For fiscal 2014, we repurchased 5.7 million shares for a total investment of $866 million. We continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning available cash to our shareholders after we take advantage of the opportunities to invest in our business at a higher rate of return, and we'll continue to prudently execute our program with an emphasis on maximizing long-term returns to our shareholders.
For the first quarter, we're establishing diluted earnings per share guidance of $1.89 to $1.93. And for the year, our EPS guidance is $8.20 to $8.30 per share. As a reminder, our diluted EPS guidance for both the first quarter and full year take into account the shares repurchased through yesterday, but do not reflect the impact of any potential future share repurchases. 
In closing, I'd like to once again thank the entire Team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to the company's success. Congratulations on another record-setting year.
This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I'd like to ask Vanessa, the operator, to return to the line, and we'd be happy to answer your questions."

We also have the tailwind of unemployment, which is lower and down, which is good both from a consumer pocketbook standpoint but also on our business from miles driven standpoint as commuter miles increase. As we said throughout last year after we had the tough winter last winter, it's hard to ever really know the impact that has on your business, although we did see by category some of the categories that we would speculate to be affected by harsh weather performed very well, and they continue to. Our business still [indiscernible] quarters I said has been good and we see no reason for that to change. I think the thing that we all need to keep in mind is that the car population being driven yesterday is an older population, and these higher mileage cars, while they're very reliable from an engine transmission differential or transactional perspective, and they're capable of being kept on the road for a long time, they still require maintenance, and higher mileage is they require more maintenance and these aren't catastrophic mechanical failures that would cause the car to be retired, but they are things that can be reasonably expensive. So I think that those things are contributing to our industry's growth and I think part of it, part of what we all saw last year when we had a relatively strong year was not purely weather-related; it was vehicle age related, combined with the weather, which is helpful. So it's hard for me to predict the impact of the consumers having more money in their pocket as a result of the gas prices and employment being a little better and the effect that maybe milder winter so far, we saw some winter last, so we'll see what happens. But we're expecting we feel confident in the comp store sales range we gave for the year. And like I said, January has started off good for us, so we're hopeful that we'll continue on that trend."

So I would say that, that across the board, including the CSK, is probably our biggest contributor. One of the things that we talk about here a lot is how fragmented the professional side is, and while we feel like we've been a really good professional provider for a long long time, it's very fragmented. And the percentage of the total business that we have, even though we feel reasonably dominant in many marketplaces, if you look at the whole U.S. and the percentage of the business that we're doing, there's a lot of upside there. So we see a lot of opportunity on both. So I think it would be hard for me to say that there's more opportunity on one side than the other or in CSK. I think that we're getting pretty reasonably mature in the Western part of the country, but there's a lot of business out there that we don't have. I will say that the past couple of years, our do-it-for-me business has grown a little more faster than our DIY. And I think for reasons that have been discussed a lot in the past relative to vehicle complexity and things like that, that we'll continue to see that trend, although that trend is somewhat mitigated by our efforts to grow on the DIY side. So I guess what I would say is, we see a lot of opportunity on those sides."

Our hub store strategy really kind of plays into our DC strategy because typically where we put hubs is where we don't have DC service that would put us in a position to where we would have access in our spoke stores or regular stores to a larger inventory. I don't have a number as far as the number of hubs that we'll add this year, but we consistently add hub stores and evaluate markets where we might benefit from having access to a larger inventory, and our strategy for a, long long time, long before they were even called hub stores, we had these larger inventory stores that serviced other stores from a hot shot delivery standpoint, a customer needed a part and we made it available through the hub. We've never used our hubs as replenishment. We've used them only for availability purposes on a same-day basis, and we'll continue to use that strategy, especially up in the Northeast as we expand and we move into markets outside of Boston, for instance, where we wouldn't be able to have enough same-day drops out of our Boston DC to those areas, which there's a very dense population up there. We will have good access to inventory. So our strategy from this point forward will continue to be as it has been for a number of years, to use hub stores as a means of augmenting our coverage in markets where we don't have a distribution center."

David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman; Ted Wise, our Executive Vice President of Expansion; and Greg Johnson, our Executive Vice President of Supply Chain, are also present.
I'd like to begin our call today by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another great quarter, which closes out a very successful year. Our team's ability to consistently grow market share by providing excellent customer service, day in and day out, is highlighted by our comparable store sales results, which exceeded 5% each quarter of 2014 and finished at 6% for the full year. Our goal is not just to grow our market share, but to grow it profitably. And again, our team's commitment to customer service drove exceptional results in 2014, as we set record high quarterly operating margins each quarter of the year. These consistently outstanding results are as a result of the hard work and dedication of each of our Team Members, and I would like to thank our team for their relentless commitment to our ongoing success.
As we have seen in the past 3 quarters, undercar repairs such as brakes, driveline, chassis and ride control were key contributors to our strong 6.3% comparable store sales increase for the fourth quarter, which exceeded our guidance of 3% to 5%. The strength in undercar categories, along with general strength in all hard parts categories, drove comparable store sales of 6% for the year, which exceeded our guidance from the beginning of the year of 3% to 5%.
For the year, we increased sales by $567 million to $7.2 billion, and we are especially proud of our team's ability to profitably grow market share, as we achieved another quarterly record operating profit of 17.2% in the fourth quarter, culminating in a record full year operating profit of 17.6% for 2014, which is 100 basis point increase over 2013.
Our ability to profitably grow market share, combined with the prudent expense control, yielded earnings per share growth of 26% for the quarter, representing our 24th consecutive quarter, with earnings per share growth in excess of 15%. For the year, earnings per share increased to $7.34 a share, which is a 22% increase over the prior year and represents the sixth consecutive year of EPS growth in excess of 21%.
For the quarter, our comparable store sales were a robust 6.3% on top of strong comps in the fourth quarter of 2014 of 5.4%. Sales volumes during the quarter were relatively consistent. However, comparable store sales percentages slowed somewhat in December as we faced our toughest comparisons. Both our DIY and our professional comparable store sales were strongly positive for both the quarter and for the year.
I would now like to discuss our comparable ticket count and average ticket size results, and how these factor into our view for 2015. For the quarter and full year, we consistently and robustly grew our professional comparable transaction count, as we very successfully grow in new and acquired markets. We expect to continue to aggressively grow our professional business throughout 2015.
On the DIY side of the business, we generated comparable traffic growth for both the quarter and for the year. Our improved DIY business is the combined result of our focus on opportunities on this side of the business, which Jeff will discuss in a moment, and a gradual improvement in the health of the DIY consumer.
During the year, the unemployment rate has dropped from 6.7% to 5.6%. This improvement has contributed to a consistent, yet somewhat modest, growth path in miles driven, and we are optimistic this trend, combined with lower gas prices, will be a tailwind to the DIY business in 2015.
Average ticket increases are due to an increased mix of hard parts sales and the increased parts complexity, which drives up the average repair cost. The increase in average ticket has been -- has not benefited from inflation for the past 2 years, and we have seen less than 0.5% of inflation on selling price of like parts. This recent trend is below historic norms and creates a headwind to the comp growth we expect in 2015. However, we expect to see continued growth in average transaction size, driven by increased parts complexity and cost of repair, which we firmly believe is a long-term driver in our industry.
For the first quarter of 2015 and the full year, we are establishing comparable store sales guidance of 3% to 5%. In developing our guidance, we expect miles driven will continue to increase at a moderate rate and benefit demand in our industry. We base this view on the improving health of the consumer and, for the time being, lower gas prices.
We further expect to see continued growth in miles driven, specifically in a population of out-of-warranty vehicles, as the better engineered and manufactured vehicles from the past 15 years are capable of being reliably driven at high mileages, if reasonably maintained. We believe this is an ongoing long-term trend that will benefit our industry for the foreseeable future.
Finally, our comparable store sales expectation assume pricing in the industry will remain rational, and as I previously noted, inflation will remain muted.
While we expect each of these factors to be tailwinds for our business in the coming year, we will face tough 2014 comparisons in every quarter of 2015. Ultimately, our ability to grow our comparable store sales in 2015 and beyond is based on our team's commitment of providing the highest levels of service in our industry, and I'm very confident that commitment is very strong. Not only has our team been able to increase our total sales by 8.5% over the prior year, but the sales increase represents sustainable profitable growth, which is reflected in our strong gross margin expansion.
For the year, our gross margin improved to 51.4% of sales, which was a 73 basis point improvement and at the top end of -- our beginning of the year gross margin guidance of 50.9% to 51.4%. During the year, our gross margin improvement was driven by significant product acquisition cost improvements and a growing mix of higher-margin hard parts as a percentage of our total sales mix.
Looking at 2015, we are setting our gross margin guidance at 51.8% to 52.2%. Our assumptions in developing this guidance are based on the abatement of the LIFO impact we experienced in 2014, which Tom will discuss in more detail; continued rational industry pricing; and modest incremental improvements in the acquisition costs and distribution center efficiency.
Thanks to the dedication of over 67,000 Team Members, we continue to aggressively grow our market share. We are very confident. We will continue to execute our proven model at a very high level. And based on the strength of our team and our continued confidence in the long-term drivers of demand in our industry, we are establishing our operating margin guidance for 2015 at a range of 18.1% to 18.5%. We are also establishing our earnings per share guidance at $8.20 to $8.30.
January yielded solid results for us, so we feel like we're off to a good start in 2015. And to complete my comments, I would like to commend all of Team O'Reilly for a record-breaking performance in 2014 and their ongoing commitment to our continued success. Because of each of you, 2014 represents the 22nd consecutive year we have increased both our comparable store sales and our operating income. Every year our company has been publicly trading. Thanks to all of you for your excellent work. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Shaw."

I'd like to begin by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another outstanding quarter and year. Our industry-leading 6.3% fourth quarter comps and full year comps of 6% wouldn't be possible without the excellent, consistent customer service you provide our customers. Your relentless focus on outhustling and outservicing our competitors drives our success. And I'd like to thank you for your hard work and commitment. Today, I'm going to discuss our operational results for the quarter and year and provide color on some of our operational initiatives.
SG&A levered 23 basis points for the fourth quarter and 28 basis points for the year, driven by our strong comp performance. At the beginning of the year, we anticipated per store SG&A would increase around 1.5% for the year, but actual results for the year were an increase of 3%. Early in the year, we made the decision to be more aggressive in our store staffing to capitalize on the favorable industry trends. As we've discussed on this call many times, we staff our stores to provide excellent customer service and to fuel the growth of our business. Based on our industry-leading comparable store sales results, we feel this decision to be more aggressive was warranted.
When we look at our business, we know we have a tremendous opportunity to improve our average DIY per store volumes. I'd like to touch on 2 of the items we feel helped to drive our strong DIY results for the year and feel that we will continue to drive our business going forward. First, as I mentioned, we were aggressive in our store staffing hours, while also increasing the flexibility of those hours. This allowed us to provide better levels of customer service, especially on nights and weekends, which are high-volume DIY times. Second, we continue to roll out enhanced weekend access to expanded inventories through our DC and hub networks. We began testing this in 2012 and began rolling it out in 2013 through 2014. This enhanced parts availability has been a strong driver to our weekend business. Based on our results in 2014, we feel, we have our store staffing levels dialed in at the appropriate level to provide excellent customer service and drive sales growth. As a result, we expect to see a more moderate growth in average SG&A per store and are establishing guidance at an increase 1.5% per store for 2015.
Touching on our distribution team. We successfully opened distribution centers in Lakeland, Florida; Chicago, Illinois; and Boston, Massachusetts during the year. Each of these DCs came online very smoothly and are now servicing all of the stores in their respective service areas.
With the addition of these 3 DCs, we're well positioned for expansion in new and existing markets, with capacity for an additional 800 stores across the country. Our ability to provide industry-leading parts availability were operating very cost effectively is a big driver of our sales and profitability growth, and I'd like to congratulate our DC teams on a great 2014.
For the year, we accomplished our goal of opening 200 net new stores. We continue to take advantage of new store opportunities across the country, with the most significant growth concentrated in the following regions: the Florida market, supported by our new Lakeland DC; California, as we backfill attractive markets not previously penetrated by CSK; the upper Great Lakes, as we ease growth constraints across multiple DCs with the opening of the new Chicago DC; and Texas, which continues to be a growing market for us.
For 2015, we expect to open 205 new stores. We will again open new stores across the country with areas of high concentrations similar to 2014 and additional growth ramping up in the Northeast supported by the Boston DC. We've been very pleased with the productivity of our new stores and believe that 2015 store class will produce another great year.
In closing, I would like to, again, thank all of our 67,000 Team Members for your hard work and dedication. Your focus on providing excellent customer service each and every day is the reason we had such a successful 2014 and it will be the driver to a great 2015.
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."
324289,280980976,755826,"O'Reilly Automotive Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I would also like to thank all Team O'Reilly for your continued dedication to excellent customer service, which drove our outstanding results.

I would also like to thank all Team O'Reilly for your continued dedication to excellent customer service, which drove our outstanding results. Now we'll take a closer look at our results and provide additional guidance for 2015.
For the quarter, sales increased to $143 million comprised of $100 million increase in comp store sales, a $42 million increase in noncomp store sales, a $2 million increase in noncomp -- nonstore sales and a $1 million decrease from closed stores. For the year, total sales are $7.2 billion, which represents an annual increase of 8.5% over the prior year and finished at the top end of our initial revenue guidance of $7 billion to $7.2 billion. For 2015, we're establishing our revenue guidance at $7.6 billion to $7.8 billion.
Our gross margin results of 51.4% this year were very strong, improving 73 basis points, as we are very successful in reducing acquisition costs. However, the impact of our LIFO accounting creates the need for additional color in this area. Our success in reducing our acquisition cost over time exhausted our LIFO reserve, with the result that additional cost decreases create onetime noncash headwinds to gross margin as we adjust our existing inventory on hand to the lower cumulative acquisition costs.
For the year, our gross margin of 51.4% included LIFO headwind of $41 million. As Greg previously mentioned, our gross margin guidance for 2015 is 51.8% to 52.2%. This guidance assumes it will not experience additional LIFO headwinds. Said another way, we expect acquisition price decreases and increases to be about the same in 2015. To the extent we are successful in gaining net reductions, we will face more LIFO headwinds. However, if this does occur, we would expect a much smaller impact than we experienced in 2014 and our merchandise margins will see a corresponding benefit from the decreased cost. When we look at our quarterly gross margin, we expect our rate results to be relatively consistent quarter-to-quarter in 2015. This means we will see our largest year-over-year gross margin increase in the first quarter due to the significant LIFO headwinds we experienced in the first quarter of 2014.
Our effective tax rate for the year was 36.3%, which was better than our beginning-of-the-year estimate of 37%, as we benefited from better-than-expected job tax credits. When we look at the full year of 2015, we'd expect our tax rate to be approximately 37% of pretax income, as certain job tax credit programs have expired. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, we expect our quarterly tax rate to be around 37.3%, with the exception of the third quarter when we expect that tax rate of approximately 36.2% as we adjust for the tolling of certain tax periods. These estimated rates are subject to the resolution of open tax periods under audit and our success in qualifying for existing job tax credit programs.
Now we'll move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results and our expectations for 2015. For the year, we generated free cash flow of $760 million, which exceeded our beginning of the year estimate of $570 million to $620 million. I'll spend some time to discuss the main factors driving our free cash flow results.
Inventory per store at the end of the year was $585,000, which was an increase of 2.6%. We had expected to keep per store inventory flat from 2013. However, we ended the year with a spike in December DC inventory. For 2015, we expect our per store inventory to increase a little less than 1% per store. Our ongoing goal is to ensure we're growing per store inventory at a lower rate than the comparable store sales growth we generate. We accomplished that goal in 2014 and expect to continue our success of efficiently deploying inventory in 2015.
Our AP to inventory ratio finished the year at 94.6%. This was substantially better than the beginning of the year estimate of approaching 90%, and this strong improvement, combined with net income over plan, were the main drivers to our better-than-expected free cash flow. In 2015, we expect the growth of this ratio to slow substantially as we approach a yet to be determined ceiling and are projecting the year end 2015 AP to inventory ratio of 97%.
For the year, capital expenditures were $430 million, which was above the range we established at the beginning of the year of $390 million to $420 million. This above expectations result was driven by an increased percent of owned versus leased properties under development for opening in 2015, resulting in a higher investment for these new stores in the books at year end than we expected.
For 2015, we're setting our CapEx guidance at $400 million to $430 million. The decrease is the result from the completion of our loss related to DC openings, offset in part by the higher mix of owned new stores versus leased. Given these factors, we're setting our 2015 full year free cash flow guidance of $675 million to $725 million.
This moves us along to our capital structure. Yes, we're still below our target debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2x to 2.25x. During the year, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio actually decreased from 1.9x to 1.7x. However, we continue to believe our stated range is appropriate for our business. We will continue to look for the appropriate time to take on additional borrowings and enter a range knowing that we remain very committed to prudently managing our debt levels, so that we can maintain or improve our investment-grade ratings, which are a critical factor to the success of our vendor financing program. On this point, we are very pleased by the recent action of Standard & Poor's to raise our corporate credit rating and the ratings on our bonds from BBB flat to BBB+.
We continue to execute our share repurchase program, and in the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $152.05 per share for a total investment of $179 million. Subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter through -- yesterday, we repurchased an additional 0.1 million shares at an average price of $183.20 per share, for an additional $9 million investment.
For fiscal 2014, we repurchased 5.7 million shares for a total investment of $866 million. We continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning available cash to our shareholders after we take advantage of the opportunities to invest in our business at a higher rate of return, and we'll continue to prudently execute our program with an emphasis on maximizing long-term returns to our shareholders.
For the first quarter, we're establishing diluted earnings per share guidance of $1.89 to $1.93. And for the year, our EPS guidance is $8.20 to $8.30 per share. As a reminder, our diluted EPS guidance for both the first quarter and full year take into account the shares repurchased through yesterday, but do not reflect the impact of any potential future share repurchases.
In closing, I'd like to once again thank the entire Team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to the company's success. Congratulations on another record-setting year.
This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I'd like to ask Vanessa, the operator, to return to the line, and we'd be happy to answer your questions."

They're very high-quality private label products, and our efforts are just to have a little more control of the way the product is managed, keeping that out of our competitor stores to some degree, but our private label strategy is a little bit different than many and that we're putting high-quality products in the boxes, in many cases, we're using brands that are recognized, in some cases, by the customers, and especially the professional customers as being brands that have been prevalent at some point in the past. So and we do this very strategically and surgically, I would say. We're very careful about what products we put in private label boxes. And very simply, we carry many brands that are just not good brands to move into a private label box, because the brands are so prevalent and we have excellent relationships with many of our suppliers and simply want to support their brands. So some of the brands that we carry, right now I would say, we've never plan to move those into private label, but others where the brands aren't as prevalent and it makes sense for us to put them in our own packages, we do that, with the key being that we're putting in the box a product that's of high enough quality that our professional customers would consider it equal, at least equal with the branded product that it may be competing with. And so it's a slow-moving strategy, but we're somewhere in the mid-30% range of liquid oils and so forth in our private label mix."

Those are typically or, generally speaking, the VIP stores, although we have there a few new stores up there. Those are doing great. And we've -- it's been a big transition up there with the stores having previously been operated as VIP with shops attached to them and I think most customers viewing stores as purely retail stores that devote service and parts. And then, of course, we've had the headwind of convincing some of our professional customers that we're not part of VIP and that we're not their competitor and that we are a great supplier partner for our professional customers. So this past year has been a good year for us and we've comped really well on the -- in those stores in general, and a big portion of that comp has been on the do-it-for-me side. And in Florida, we've been very fortunate as we've grown down there to have had a incredibly strong team of individuals down there that are very good on the professional side of the business. And I would say that our new store growth down there, year 1, year 2, year 3, a bigger portion of our sales in those stores has been on the do-it-for-me side and would be typical because of the strength of our team down there on the professional side. So we've been very pleased with our growth on the professional side down there."

We also have the tailwind of unemployment, which is lower and down, which is good both from a consumer pocketbook standpoint but also on our business from miles driven standpoint as commuter miles increase. As we said throughout last year after we had the tough winter last winter, it's hard to ever really know the impact that you had on your business, although we did see by category some of the categories that we would speculate to be affected by harsh weather performed very well, and they continue to. Our business, so far this quarters, I said, has been good and we see no reason for that to change. I think the thing that we all need to keep in mind is that the car population we've given you yesterday is an older population, and these higher mileage cars, while they're very reliable from a engine, transmission, differential or transactional perspective, and they're capable of being kept on the road for a long time, they still require maintenance, and at higher mileages they require more maintenance and these aren't catastrophic, mechanical failures that would cause the car to be retired, but they are things that can be reasonably expensive. So I think that those things are contributing to our industry's growth and I think part of that, part of what we all saw of last year, when we had a relatively strong year was not purely weather-related; it was vehicle age related, combined with the weather, which is helpful. So it's hard for me to predict the impact of the consumers having more money in their pocket as a result of the gas prices and employment being a little better and the effect that maybe a milder winter so far, we saw some winter last, so we'll see what happens. But we're expecting, we feel confident in the comp store sales range, we gave for the year. And like I said, January has started off good for us, so we're hopeful that we'll continue on that trend."

And the percentage of the total business that we have, even though we feel reasonably dominant in many marketplaces, if you look at the whole U.S. and the percentage of the do-it-for-me business that we're doing, there's a lot of upside there. So we see a lot of opportunity on both. So I think it would be hard for me to say that there's more opportunity on one side than the other or in CSK. I think that we're getting pretty reasonably mature out in the Western part of the country, but there's a lot of business out there that we don't have. I will say that the past couple of years, our do-it-for-me business has grown a little more faster than our DIY. And I think for reasons that have been discussed a lot in the past relative to vehicle complexity and things like that, that we'll continue to see that trend, although that trend is somewhat mitigated by our efforts to grow on the DIY side.

Our hub store strategy really kind of plays into our DC strategy, because typically where we put hubs is where we don't have DC service that would put us in a position to where we would have access in our spoke stores or regular stores to a larger inventory. I don't have a number as far as the number of hubs that we'll add this year, but we consistently add hub stores and evaluate markets where we might benefit from having access to a larger inventory, and our strategy for a long, long time, long before they were even called hub stores, we had these larger inventory stores that serviced other stores from a hot shot delivery standpoint, and your customer needed a part and we made it available through a hub. We've never used our hubs as replenishment. We've used them only for availability purposes on a same-day basis, and we'll continue to use that strategy, especially up in the Northeast as we expand and we move into markets outside of Boston, for instance, where we wouldn't be able to have enough same-day drops out of our Boston DC to those areas, which there's a very dense population up there. We will have -- have to have good access to inventory. So our strategy from this point forward will continue to be as it has been for a number of years, to use hub stores as a means of augmenting our coverage in markets where we don't have a distribution center."

David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman; Ted Wise, our Executive Vice President of Expansion; and Greg Johnson, our Executive Vice President of Supply Chain, are also present.
I'd like to begin our call today by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another great quarter, which closes out a very successful year. Our team's ability to consistently grow market share by providing excellent customer service, day in and day out, is highlighted by our comparable store sales results, which exceeded 5% each quarter of 2014 and finished at 6% for the full year. Our goal is not just to grow our market share, but to grow it profitably. And again, our team's commitment to customer service drove exceptional results in 2014, as we set record high quarterly operating margins each quarter of the year. These consistently outstanding results are the result of the hard work and dedication of each of our Team Members, and I would like to thank our team for their relentless commitment to our ongoing success.
As we have seen the past 3 quarters, undercar repairs such as brakes, driveline, chassis and ride control were key contributors to our strong 6.3% comparable store sales increase for the fourth quarter, which exceeded our guidance of 3% to 5%. The strength in undercar categories, along with general strength in all hard parts categories, drove comparable store sales of 6% for the year, which exceeded our guidance from the beginning of the year of 3% to 5%.
For the year, we increased sales by $567 million to $7.2 billion, and we are especially proud of our team's ability to profitably grow market share, as we achieved another quarterly record operating profit of 17.2% in the fourth quarter, culminating in a record full year operating profit of 17.6% for 2014, which is 100 basis point increase over 2013.
Our ability to profitably grow market share, combined with the prudent expense control, yielded earnings per share growth of 26% for the quarter, representing our 24th consecutive quarter, with earnings per share growth in excess of 15%. For the year, earnings per share increased to $7.34 a share, which is a 22% increase over the prior year and represents the sixth consecutive year of EPS growth in excess of 21%.
For the quarter, our comparable store sales were a robust 6.3% on top of strong comps in the fourth quarter of 2014 of 5.4%. Sales volumes during the quarter were relatively consistent. However, comparable store sales percentages slowed somewhat in December as we faced our toughest comparisons. Both our DIY and our professional comparable store sales were strongly positive for both the quarter and for the year.
I would now like to discuss our comparable ticket count and average ticket size results, and how these factor into our view for 2015. For the quarter and full year, we consistently and robustly grew our professional comparable transaction count, as we very successfully grow in new and acquired markets. We expect to continue to aggressively grow our professional business throughout 2015.
On the DIY side of the business, we generated comparable traffic growth for both the quarter and for the year. Our improved DIY business is the combined result of our focus on opportunities on this side of the business, which Jeff will discuss in a moment, and the gradual improvement in the health of the DIY consumer.
During the year, the unemployment rate has dropped from 6.7% to 5.6%. This improvement has contributed to a consistent, yet somewhat modest, growth path in miles driven, and we are optimistic this trend, combined with lower gas prices, will be a tailwind to the DIY business in 2015.
Average ticket increases are due to an increased mix of hard parts sales and the increased parts complexity, which drives up the average repair cost. The increase in average ticket has been -- has not benefited from inflation for the past 2 years, and we have seen less than 0.5% of inflation on selling price of like parts. This recent trend is below historic norms and creates a headwind to the comp growth we expect in 2015. However, we expect to see continued growth in average transaction size, driven by increased parts complexity and cost of repair, which we firmly believe is a long-term driver in our industry.
For the first quarter of 2015 and the full year, we are establishing comparable store sales guidance of 3% to 5%. In developing our guidance, we expect miles driven will continue to increase at a moderate rate and benefit demand in our industry. We base this view on the improving health of the consumer and, for the time being, lower gas prices.
We further expect to see continued growth in miles driven, specifically in the population of out-of-warranty vehicles, as the better engineered and manufactured vehicles from the past 15 years are capable of being reliably driven at high mileages, if reasonably maintained. We believe this is an ongoing long-term trend that will benefit our industry for the foreseeable future.
Finally, our comparable store sales expectations assume pricing in the industry will remain rational, and as I previously noted, inflation will remain muted.
While we expect each of these factors to be tailwinds for our business in the coming year, we will face tough 2014 comparisons in every quarter of 2015. Ultimately, our ability to grow our comparable store sales in 2015 and beyond is based on our team's commitment of providing the highest levels of service in our industry, and I'm very confident that commitment is very strong. Not only has our team been able to increase our total sales by 8.5% over the prior year, but the sales increase represents sustainable profitable growth, which is reflected in our strong gross margin expansion.
For the year, our gross margin improved to 51.4% of sales, which was a 73 basis point improvement and at the top end of our beginning of the year gross margin guidance of 50.9% to 51.4%. During the year, our gross margin improvement was driven by significant product acquisition cost improvements and a growing mix of higher-margin hard parts as a percentage of our total sales mix.
Looking at 2015, we are setting our gross margin guidance at 51.8% to 52.2%. Our assumptions in developing this guidance are based on: the abatement of the LIFO impact we experienced in 2014, which Tom will discuss in more detail; continued rational industry pricing; and modest incremental improvements in the acquisition costs and distribution center efficiency.
Thanks to the dedication of our over 67,000 Team Members, we continue to aggressively grow our market share. We are very confident we will continue to execute our proven model at a very high level. And based on the strength of our team and our continued confidence in the long-term drivers of demand in our industry, we are establishing our operating margin guidance for 2015 at a range of 18.1% to 18.5%. We are also establishing our earnings per share guidance at $8.20 to $8.30.
January yielded solid results for us, so we feel like we're off to a good start in 2015. And to complete my comments, I would like to commend all of Team O'Reilly for our record-breaking performance in 2014 and their ongoing commitment to our continued success. Because of each of you, 2014 represents the 22nd consecutive year we have increased both our comparable store sales and our operating income every year our company has been publicly trading. Thanks to all of you for your excellent work. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Shaw."

I'd like to begin by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another outstanding quarter and year. Our industry-leading 6.3% fourth quarter comps and full year comps of 6% wouldn't be possible without the excellent, consistent customer service you provide our customers. Your relentless focus on outhustling and outservicing our competitors drives our success. And I'd like to thank you for your hard work and commitment. Today, I'm going to discuss our operational results for the quarter and year and provide color on some of our operational initiatives.
SG&A levered 23 basis points for the fourth quarter and 28 basis points for the year, driven by our strong comp performance. At the beginning of the year, we anticipated per-store SG&A would increase around 1.5% for the year, but actual results for the year were an increase of 3%. Early in the year, we made the decision to be more aggressive in our store staffing to capitalize on the favorable industry trends. As we've discussed on this call many times, we staff our stores to provide excellent customer service and to fuel the growth of our business. Based on our industry-leading comparable store sales results, we feel this decision to be more aggressive was warranted.
When we look at our business, we know we have a tremendous opportunity to improve our average DIY per-store volumes. I'd like to touch on 2 of the items we feel helped drive our strong DIY results for the year and feel that we will continue to drive our business going forward. First, as I mentioned, we were aggressive in our store staffing hours, while also increasing the flexibility of those hours. This allowed us to provide better levels of customer service, especially on nights and weekends, which are high-volume DIY times. Second, we continue to roll out enhanced weekend access to expanded inventories through our DC and hub networks. We began testing this in 2012 and began rolling it out in 2013 through 2014. This enhanced parts availability has been a strong driver to our weekend business. Based on our results in 2014, we feel we have our store staffing levels dialed in at the appropriate level to provide excellent customer service and drive sales growth. As a result, we expect to see a more moderate growth in average SG&A per store and are establishing guidance at an increase of 1.5% per store for 2015.
Touching on our distribution team. We successfully opened distribution centers in Lakeland, Florida; Chicago, Illinois; and Boston, Massachusetts during the year. Each of these DCs came online very smoothly and are now servicing all of the stores in their respective service areas.
With the addition of these 3 DCs, we're well positioned for expansion in new and existing markets, with capacity for an additional 800 stores across the country. Our ability to provide industry-leading parts availability while operating very cost effectively is a big driver of our sales and profitability growth, and I'd like to congratulate our DC teams on a great 2014.
For the year, we accomplished our goal of opening 200 net new stores. We continue to take advantage of new store opportunities across the country, with the most significant growth concentrated in the following regions: the Florida market, supported by our new Lakeland DC; California, as we backfill attractive markets not previously penetrated by CSK; the upper Great Lakes, as we ease growth constraints across multiple DCs with the opening of the new Chicago DC; and Texas, which continues to be a growing market for us.
For 2015, we expect to open 205 new stores. We will again open new stores across the country with areas of high concentration, similar to 2014, and additional growth ramping up in the Northeast supported by the Boston DC. We've been very pleased with the productivity of our new stores and believe the 2015 store class will produce another great year.
In closing, I would like to, again, thank all of our 67,000 Team Members for your hard work and dedication. Your focus on providing excellent customer service each and every day is the reason we had such a successful 2014 and it will be the driver to a great 2015.
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."
324289,280980976,756077,"O'Reilly Automotive Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I would also like to thank all Team O'Reilly for your continued dedication to excellent customer service, which drove our outstanding results. Now we'll take a closer look at our results and provide additional guidance for 2015.For the qua",1221,"Thanks, Jeff. I would also like to thank all Team O'Reilly for your continued dedication to excellent customer service, which drove our outstanding results. Now we'll take a closer look at our results and provide additional guidance for 2015.
For the quarter, sales increased $143 million, comprised of $100 million increase in comp store sales, a $42 million increase in noncomp store sales, a $2 million increase in noncomp nonstore sales and a $1 million decrease from closed stores. For the year, total sales are $7.2 billion, which represents an annual increase of 8.5% over the prior year and finished at the top end of our initial revenue guidance of $7 billion to $7.2 billion. For 2015, we're establishing our revenue guidance at $7.6 billion to $7.8 billion.
Our gross margin results of 51.4% this year were very strong, improving 73 basis points, as we were very successful in reducing acquisition costs. However, the impact of our LIFO accounting creates the need for additional color in this area. Our success in reducing our acquisition costs over time exhausted our LIFO reserve, with the result that additional cost decreases create onetime noncash headwinds to gross margin as we adjust our existing inventory on hand to the lower cumulative acquisition cost.
For the year, our gross margin of 51.4% included the LIFO headwind of $41 million. As Greg previously mentioned, our gross margin guidance for 2015 is 51.8% to 52.2%. This guidance assumes that we'll not experience additional LIFO headwinds. Said another way, we expect acquisition price decreases and increases to be about the same in 2015. To the extent we are successful in gaining net reductions, we will face more LIFO headwinds. However, if this does occur, we would expect a much smaller impact than we experienced in 2014 and our merchandise margins will see a corresponding benefit from the decreased cost. When we look at our quarterly gross margin, we expect our rate results to be relatively consistent quarter-to-quarter in 2015. This means we will see our largest year-over-year gross margin increase in the first quarter due to the significant LIFO headwinds we experienced in the first quarter of 2014.
Our effective tax rate for the year was 36.3%, which was better than our beginning-of-the-year estimate of 37%, as we benefited from better-than-expected job tax credits. When we look at the full year of 2015, we'd expect our tax rate to be approximately 37% of pretax income, as certain job tax credit programs have expired. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, we expect our quarterly tax rate to be around 37.3%, with the exception of the third quarter when we expect the tax rate of approximately 36.2% as we adjust for the tolling of certain tax periods. These estimated rates are subject to the resolution of open tax periods under audit and our success in qualifying for existing job tax credit programs.
Now we'll move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results and our expectations for 2015. For the year, we generated free cash flow of $760 million, which exceeded our beginning of the year estimate of $570 million to $620 million. I'll spend some time to discuss the main factors driving our free cash flow results.
Inventory per store at the end of the year was $585,000, which was an increase of 2.6%. We had expected to keep per store inventory flat from 2013. However, we ended the year with a spike in December DC inventory. For 2015, we expect our per-store inventory to increase a little less than 1% per store. Our ongoing goal is to ensure we're growing per-store inventory at a lower rate than the comparable store sales growth we generate. We accomplished that goal in 2014 and expect to continue our success of efficiently deploying inventory in 2015.
Our AP to inventory ratio finished the year at 94.6%. This was substantially better than the beginning of the year estimate of approaching 90%, and this strong improvement, combined with net income over plan, were the main drivers to our better-than-expected free cash flow. In 2015, we expect the growth of this ratio to slow substantially as we approach a yet to be determined ceiling and are projecting a year-end 2015 AP to inventory ratio of 97%.
For the year, capital expenditures were $430 million, which was above the range we established at the beginning of the year of $390 million to $420 million. This above-expectations result was driven by an increased percent of owned versus leased properties under development for opening in 2015, resulting in a higher investment for these new stores on the books at year end than we expected.
For 2015, we're setting our CapEx guidance at $400 million to $430 million. The decrease is the result from the completion of our last wave of DC openings, offset in part by the higher mix of owned new stores versus leased. Given these factors, we're setting our 2015 full year free cash flow guidance to $675 million to $725 million.
This moves us along to our capital structure. Yes, we're still below our targeted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2 to 2.25x. During the year, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio actually decreased from 1.9x to 1.7x. However, we continue to believe our stated range is appropriate for our business. We will continue to look for the appropriate time to take on additional borrowings, and in our range, knowing that we remain very committed to prudently managing our debt levels, so that we can maintain or improve our investment-grade ratings, which are a critical factor to the success of our vendor financing program. On this point, we were very pleased by the recent action of Standard & Poor's to raise our corporate credit rating and the ratings on our bonds from BBB flat to BBB+.
We continue to execute our share repurchase program, and in the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $152.05 per share for a total investment of $179 million. Subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter through yesterday, we repurchased an additional 0.1 million shares at an average price of $183.20 per share, for an additional $9 million investment.
For fiscal 2014, we repurchased 5.7 million shares for a total investment of $866 million. We continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning available cash to our shareholders after we take advantage of the opportunities to invest in our business at a higher rate of return, and we'll continue to prudently execute our program with an emphasis on maximizing long-term returns to our shareholders.
For the first quarter, we're establishing diluted earnings per share guidance of $1.89 to $1.93. And for the year, our EPS guidance is $8.20 to $8.30 per share. As a reminder, our diluted EPS guidance for both the first quarter and full year take into account the shares repurchased through yesterday, but do not reflect the impact of any potential future share repurchases.
In closing, I'd like to once again thank the entire Team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to the company's success. Congratulations on another record-setting year.
This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I'd like to ask Vanessa, the operator, to return to the line, and we'd be happy to answer your questions."

They're very high-quality private label products, and our efforts are just to have a little more control of the way the product is managed, keeping it out of our competitor stores to some degree. But our private label strategy is a little bit different than many in that we're putting high-quality products in the boxes. In many cases we're using brands that are recognized, in some cases, by the customers, and especially the professional customers as being brands that have been prevalent at some point in the past. So -- and we do this very strategically and surgically, I would say. We're very careful about what products we put in private label boxes. And very simply, we carry many brands that are just not good brands to move into a private label box, because the brands are so prevalent and we have excellent relationships with many of our suppliers and simply want to support their brands. So some of the brands that we carry, right now I would say we'd never plan to move those into private label. But others where the brands aren't as prevalent and it makes sense for us to put them in our own packages, we do that, but with the key being that we're putting in the box a product that's of high enough quality that our professional customers would consider it equal, at least equal with the branded product that it may be competing with.

We also have the tailwind of unemployment, which is lower and down, which is good both from a consumer pocketbook standpoint but also in our business from miles driven standpoint as commuter miles increase. As we said throughout last year after we had the tough winter last winter, it's hard to ever really know the impact that has on your business. Although we did see, by category, some of the categories that we would speculate to be affected by harsh weather performed very well, and they continue to. Our business, so far this quarter as I said, has been good and we see no reason for that to change. I think the thing that we all need to keep in mind is that the car population being driven in the U.S. today is an older population. And these higher mileage cars, while they're very reliable from a engine, transmission, differential or transaxle perspective, and they're capable of being kept on the road for a long time, they still require maintenance, and at higher mileages they require more maintenance. And these aren't catastrophic mechanical failures that would cause the car to be retired, but they are things that can be reasonably expensive. So I think that those things are contributing to our industry's growth. And I think part of that, part of what we all saw of last year, when we had a relatively strong year was not purely weather-related; it was vehicle age related, combined with the weather, which is helpful. So it's hard for me to predict the impact of the consumers having more money in their pocket as a result of the gas prices and employment being a little better and the effect that maybe a milder winter so far, we still have some winter left, so we'll see what happens. But we're expecting -- we feel confident in the comp store sales range we gave for the year. And like I said, January has started off good for us, so we're hopeful that we'll continue on that trend."

I think that we're getting pretty reasonably mature out in the Western part of the country, but there's a lot of business out there that we don't have. I will say that the past couple of years our do-it-for-me business has grown a little faster than our DIY.

Our hub store strategy really kind of plays into our DC strategy, because typically where we put hubs is where we don't have DC service that would put us in a position to where we would have access in our spoke stores or regular stores to a larger inventory. I don't have a number as far as the number of hubs that we'll add this year, but we consistently add hub stores and evaluate markets where we might benefit from having access to a larger inventory, and our strategy for a long, long time, long before they were even called hub stores, we had these larger inventory stores that serviced other stores from a hot shot delivery standpoint. When a customer needed a part and we made it available through a hub. We've never used our hubs as replenishment. We've used them only for availability purposes on a same-day basis, and we'll continue to use that strategy, especially up in the Northeast as we expand and we move into markets outside of Boston, for instance, where we wouldn't be able to have enough same-day drops out of our Boston DC to those areas, which there's a very dense population up there.

Welcome to the O'Reilly Auto-Parts First Quarter Conference Call. Participating on the call with me today is morning, is of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Shaw, our Executive Vice Preside",1291,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the O'Reilly Auto-Parts First Quarter Conference Call. Participating on the call with me today is morning, is of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Shaw, our Executive Vice President of Store Operations and Sales. David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman; and Greg Johnson, our Executive Vice President of supply chain, are also present. 
It's my pleasure to begin our call today by congratulating team O'Reilly on another record-breaking quarter and am very successful start to 2015. Once again, our team's relentless focus on providing consistently high levels of service to our customers generated top line growth which exceeded our expectations. And I would like to take this opportunity to thank our over 69,000 dedicated Team Members for their hardwork and unwavering commitment to providing excellent customer service each day in every store across the country.
Through steadfast dedication to delivering the O'Reilly culture is the reason for our consistently strong performance, and I can not thank you enough for your continued contributions to our long-term success.
We established our comparable store sales guidance of 3% to 5% for the first quarter on the heels of the strong demand trends we experienced throughout 2014, tempered by the difficult comparisons represented by the high bar we set in the first quarter last year.
However, we continue to capitalize on the positive momentum throughout the first quarter, generating a 7.2% increase in comparable store sales, easily exceeding the top end of our guidance range.
This strong performance is on top of an excellent 6.3% increase in the first quarter of 2014 and represents our sixth consecutive quarter of comparable store sales increases, exceeding 5%. More importantly, our commitment to profitable growth translated these impressive top line results into another record first quarter operating margin of 18.4%.
Our ability to consistently grow our business profitably is the result of our teams commitment to providing exceptional customer service and our dedication to investing in the tools our Team Members need to build lasting relationships with our customers.
Overall, for the first quarter, sales increased 10% to $1.9 billion. And as we've seen over the past year, categories such as brakes, driveline, Chassis, drive control and batteries were key contributors to our growth. We view this sustained growth in these key categories as a view indicator of our customers continued focus on maintaining and repairing their existing vehicles, which bodes well for long-term demand in our business. 
Availability in these important SKU-intensive maintenance and repair categories is critical. And our proficiency in delivering parts to our customers faster than our competitors is a key advantage and an important driver in our ability to continue to profitably grow our market share. 
These gains, combined with prudent expense control, drove our record 18.4% operating margin, which was 180 basis points improvement over first quarter of 2014.
Last year's first quarter operating profit was negatively impacted by a $23 million LIFO charge. And by comparison, we saw a smaller but still meaningful $8 million LIFO charge in the first quarter of this year.
Tom will discuss these charges in more detail in a few minutes, but excluding the LIFO impact from both quarters, our operating profit improved by 92 basis points.
This profitable growth yielded a 28% increase in diluted earnings per share, which represents our 25th consecutive quarter with earnings per share growth in excess of 15%.
I would now like to take a few minutes and add some color to our comparable store sales results for the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we generated a very robust 7.2% increase in comparable store sales on top of a strong 6.3% increase in the first quarter of 2014. Sales trends were strong throughout the quarter, although they were a little softer in February on a relative basis.
Consistent with what we saw in 2014, both the DIY and professional sides of our business were strong contributors to our comp store growth, with professional again slightly outpacing DIY. On both sides of our business, ticket average and traffic count both contributed to the comp growth.
As we've seen for the past 2 years, inflation has not been a driver of our comparable store sales, with an inflation tailwind of less than 50 basis points over that period. And we continue to expand that we will not see material benefit from inflation in the foreseeable future. 
As we've seen for some time now, the growth in average ticket has been driven by increasing parts complexity rather than inflation or pricing, which has remained very rational in the industry.
As we build our book of professional business, especially in our less mature markets, traffic continues to be the main driver of our professional comps, where we have seen very strong ticket count increases over the last 2 years. On the DIY side of our business, we also saw solid increase in traffic, as DIY consumers recover from the difficult macroeconomic headwinds they have faced in recent years, and our internal initiatives focused on our DIY customers continued to gain traction. 
Unemployment in the U.S. being down to 5.5%, and year-over-year gas prices being down 33% are definitely tailwinds for the business, especially for our DIY customers who have been under significant economic pressure for an extended period of time.
To the extent unemployment continues to improve and prices at the pump remain low, we expect our business to continue to benefit. In addition, the primary driver for demand in our business is miles driven. And as we saw at the end of 2014, in January, miles driven has strongly increased, contributing to the continued strong demand for our products.
Our second quarter is off to a strong start. However, we are just entering the critical Spring selling season, and we have experienced volatility in the months of May and June at times in the past. We also faced another quarter of strong results from the prior year, with a 5.1% second quarter 2014 comp comparison. Based on these factors, we are establishing our second quarter comparable store sales guidance at a range of 3% to 5%.
Turning to our gross margin results, as I mentioned earlier, the impact of LIFO accounting makes the comparisons to the prior year difficult. Excluding the LIFO charges in both years, our gross margin increased 21 basis points, which was in line with our expectations. We continue to realize incremental improvements in our acquisition cost and pricing in our industry remains rational.
Based on these factors, we are leaving our full year gross margin guidance unchanged at a range of 51.8% to 52.2% of sales. However, we are raising our full year operating margin guidance from a range of 18.1% to 18.5% of sales to a range of 18.3% to 18.7% of sales. The increase in our operating margin guidance range for the full year is driven by our stronger than expected first quarter results both flow through to the full year.
We are also increasing our full year earnings per share guidance from a range of $8.20 to $8.30 to a range of $8.42 to $8.52.
This updated guidance includes the strong first quarter results and shares repurchased through yesterday and excludes any additional potential share repurchases. 
Before I finish my prepared comments, I would like to thank our team for these record-breaking first quarter results. We remain very confident in the long-term drivers for demand in our industry, and we believe our team is very well-positioned to capitalize on this demand by consistently providing exceptional service to our customers every day. 
Again, congratulations to the Team O'Reilly to a very strong start to 2015. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff Shaw. Jeff?"

I'd like to begin today by echoing Greg's comments and congratulating Team O'Reilly on another outstanding quarter. 
I couldn't be more proud of our team's execution in the level of consistent top-notch service that we continue to provide our customers day in and day out. 7.2% comparable store sales growth doesn't happen by accident, especially when it sits on top of a 6.3% increase the prior year.
Our industry-leading performance is the direct result of our team's commitment to out-hustling and outservicing the competition each and every day. Our team, once again rolled up their sleeves and executed our proven business model, delivering another quarter of record-breaking results.
I want to thank each of our Team Members for their continued hard work and dedication to making O'Reilly Auto Parts the destination location for all of our customers auto parts needs. 
As Greg mentioned earlier, we're not just focused on top line growth -- rather, we are laser-focused on building long-term, win-win relationships with our customers which results in sustainable, profitable growth.
During the first quarter, our team did a great job of profitably gaining market share and at the same time kept a close on store and distribution center expenses.
For the quarter, SG&A leveraged 71 basis points on extremely strong comparable store sales and excellent expense control. Average per store SG&A increased 2.7%, which was higher than we originally expected for the quarter and was driven by higher-than-planned store payroll, commissions and incentive compensation, and exactly what we want to see when we have such strong sales and profitability results.
Our companywide compensation philosophy is focused on instilling within each of our Team Members the mentality that they should run the business like they own it. And they did exactly that during the first quarter.
When we generate strong top line results, we expect average SG&A per store to increase, while at the same time generating expense leverage. And this is what we did in the first quarter.
Although our first quarter average SG&A per store was slightly higher than planned, when we flow these results into the full year, we don't anticipate a material impact. And as such, we still expect our full year increase in average SG&A per store to be approximately 1.5%.
We successfully opened 67 new stores during the quarter and we continue to be pleased with the performance from our new stores. As we discussed on our last call, we will open new stores across our footprint with more significant growth concentrated in Florida, supported by our new distribution center in Lakeland, Florida; in California, as we backfill attractive markets not previously penetrated by CSK; in the upper Great lakes, as we free up capacity across multiple DCs, with opening of our new Chicago DC; and in Texas.
Speaking of Texas, this has been a growth market for us for many years and we see opportunity for continued profitable growth in the state in the future. However, at this point we're budding up against our distribution capacity. As Greg mentioned earlier, we're extremely focused on investing in the tools that give our team the ability to provide consistent top-notch service to our customers. To that end, we're excited to announce we acquired property in Selma, Texas where we plan to build our 27th distribution center.
Selma is a northeastern suburb of San Antonio, so we'll refer to it as our San Antonio DC and it's about an hour away from Austin. Both San Antonio and Austin are metro areas with rapid growth, and the new DC will allow us to open more stores and improve our parts availability in both of these substantial markets.
When the new DC opens, it will also free up much needed capacity at both our Dallas and Houston DCs, allowing those facilities to operate more efficiently while also creating capacity for future growth.
The San Antonio DC is planned to open in the second quarter of 2016 and will have the capacity to service approximately 225 stores. As we have proven in the past, our distribution operations team is extremely effective at planning, building and in opening new distribution centers, and we're confident that this project will roll out with the same degree of efficiency that our past projects have delivered.
I'd like to finish up today by thanking our store and distribution team for their relentless focus on providing consistent, top-notch customer service each and every day. Your hard work and dedication continues to drive our success.
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Now we'll take a closer look at our first quarter results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2015. For the quarter, sales increased $174 million, comprised of $122 [ph] million increase in comp store sales; a $50 million increase in noncomp store sales; a $3 million increase in noncomp, nonstore sales; and a $1 million decrease from closed stores. For 2015, we continue to expect our total revenue to be in the range of $7.6 billion to $7.8 billion.
Our gross margin results of [ph] 51.9% for the quarter is in line with our expectations. On a run-rate basis, gross margin improved 20 basis points over the fourth quarter, primarily based on better distribution leverage on higher sales.
On a year-over-year basis, gross margin improved 109 basis points. However, as Greg mentioned earlier, this comparison is skewed by the impact of our LIFO accounting. As we've discussed over the past 1.5 year, our success to reducing our acquisition cost over time has exhausted our LIFO reserve. The result of that initial cost decreases create onetime noncash headwinds to gross margin as we adjust our existing inventory on hand to the lower cumulative acquisition cost.
For the first quarter of 2015, we experienced a LIFO headwind of $8 [ph] million compared to a headwind of $23 million in the first quarter of 2014. Excluding both of these headwinds, year-over-year gross margin rates increased 21 basis points.
As we look forward to the rest of the year, we expect to continue to see moderate LIFO headwinds as we incrementally approve acquisition costs. However, we remain comfortable with our gross margin guidance of 51.8% to 52.2% of sales.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 37%, which was slightly better than our expectations of 37.3% and was driven by the realization of more job tax credits than originally expected.
When we look at the full year 2015, we still expect our tax rate to be approximately 37% of pretax income. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, we expect our quarterly tax rate to be around 37.3% for the second and fourth quarters, if the third quarter expectation of 36.2% as we adjust for the totaling of certain tax periods.
These estimated rates are subject to the resolution of open tax periods under audit and our success in qualifying for existing job tax credit programs.
I will move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results in the first quarter and our updated guidance expectations for the full year of 2015. Free cash flow for the quarter is $315 million. And we're revising our full year guidance for free cash flow to a range of $700 million to $750 million, reflecting an increase from our previous range of $675 million to $725 million as a result of the strong operating income results in the first quarter.
Inventory per store at the end of the quarter was $570,000, which was a 2.5% decrease from the end of 2014. Our ongoing goal is to ensure we grow per store inventory at a slower rate than the comparable store sales growth we generate. We definitely accomplished that goal in the first quarter. However, this decrease is primarily timing as a result of the very strong sales during the quarter. And we're actually a little lighter on inventory than we'd like to be. 
For the year, we continue to expect our per store inventory to increase a little less than 1% per store. 
Our AP inventory ratio finished the first quarter at 97.4%. The spike in this ratio is also related to the extremely strong sales during the first quarter. For 2015, we continue to expect the year end AP inventory ratio to be around 97%. 
Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $91 million, which is a little less than we planned. But we still expect our 2015 CapEx to be within the range of $400 million to $430 million inclusive of the San Antonio DC.
Moving on to debt. We finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio 1.7x, still well below our targeted ratio of 2 [ph] to 2.25 [ph]. We continue to believe our stated range is the appropriate amount of our business and we will move into this range when the timing is appropriate.
We continued to execute our share repurchase program. And year-to-date, we repurchased 1 million shares of our stock at an average cost of $210.74 per share for a total investment of $210 million.
We continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning available cash to our shareholders after we take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business at a high rate of return.
We will continue to prudently execute our program, with an emphasis on maximizing long-term returns to our shareholders.
For the second quarter, we're establishing diluted earnings per share guidance of $2.17 to $2.21. Based on our above planned results in the first quarter and additional shares repurchased since our last call, for the full year, we are raising our guidance to $8.42 to [ph] $8.52 per share, representing an increase of $0.22 per share from our previously announced guidance. As a reminder, our diluted earnings per share guidance for both the second quarter and full year, taking into account the shares repurchased for yesterday do not reflect the impact of any future share repurchases.
Finally, I'd like to once again thank the entire O'Reilly team for their continued dedication in the company's success. Congratulations on an outstanding start to 2015. 
This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I'd like to ask Ellen, the operator, to return to the line and we'll be happy to answer your questions."

We went up against some tougher comparison, February, sorry our 2 years stack stay consistent. But the comp number for this year was slightly lower than it was in January and March. Yes, I would say it was more related to kind of some late winter weather which in the longer term is generally good for us. But in the short-term when people are eyes in and not driving and those kinds of things, it's been creating some softness in business for a short period of time and I think that was probably the primary factor with this year in February.

Well, from a competitor standpoint, we've got tough competitors all over. I would tell you that the competitive landscape, from our perspective, is at least as strong as it's ever been and probably stronger since more of our competitors compete on both sides of the business than they did 5 or 10 years ago. It's hard to know for sure where the business that we gained in market share, gains come from. But I would say it's a mix of both. We have good competitors that are publicly traded. Good competitors that are private. Good competitors that do businesses, what we call two-step distribution, which are just kind of off of that type of undercar houses and they can be very strong competitors. We really focus on establishing a relationship with the best customers in the market. And then overtime, every customer in the market and just working our way up the ladder, improving our ability to provide service that exceeds our competitors. In many cases, having competitive prices. And we really don't see a big price response as we come into the market. I think that most in our industry have realized that price is not the primary reason that a shop buys from a parts store. It's service and relationships and their ability to work with a parts supplier to make sure that they have the right return products, they pick up the car for warranty, the occasional labor claim, the relationship that come into helping those guys become successful in their businesses. From a people standpoint, we sometimes transplant people. We move them from one market to another. In many cases, we will hire them from competitors who are doing a lot of business down there. Many times, they're not our retail, publicly traded competitors. They might be our wholesale competitors or undercar competitors. But as we expand into new markets, we look around to see who's falling apart. And if we have a chance to give someone an opportunity with a company that's going to grow in that market and put them in a position to improve their career and become part of our team here at O'Reilly, we do that. But in many cases, we're able to move people and promote people from within as we expand. And in Florida, it's been a mix of both. We've hired some people that have helped us and we've developed and promoted some people from within, so it's a combination."

We have a great team in the field and they're supported by a great team here in our headquarters. I can't help if you like some of the things that we've done over the past 2 [ph] years, which have improved our availability to products. We've increased the number of times that we touch a store each day. And as you know, product availability is a huge factor in driving the success in auto parts business, simply because if you can get the parts faster than your competitor can, that's a big factor. I think some of the retail things we've done, as far as improving the services that we do, maybe helping a customer pull the meaning of a check engine light that's on, or a wiper blade, or the occasional battery, stuff like that. I mentioned before there was a time that we were pretty reluctant to do those kinds of thing simply because we didn't want to infringe on our professional customers business and operations. But over time, we realized that those kinds of things, for most part, they were unable to charge a customer for most it anyway and they didn't mind us doing those things, so we've done that. That's a contributor to our DIY business. As much as anything, we just got a really, really strong management team in the field that is incredibly focused on making sure that we out-hustle and provide a service level to our customers that's greater than what our competitors do. And while that's not something that today they start doing that, grows your business instantly. It's something that over time has a very positive effect. And I think over the past 2 or 3 years, we put a renewed emphasis on the importance of outservicing our competitors and making sure our customers experience, the service level with us is greater than what they would experience than any of our competitors.

Where we had coverages, we had full line coverage in a brand and then we had short line coverage in a private label, it was putting us at a disadvantage. So we expanded our private-label product offering to many hard parts categories. And as a result, that availability has shown us that a lot of customers simply prefer those products.

David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman; and Greg Johnson, our Executive Vice President of Supply Chain, are also present. 
It's my pleasure to begin our call today by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another record-breaking quarter and a very successful start to 2015. Once again, our team's relentless focus on providing consistently high levels of service to our customers generated top line growth which exceeded our expectations. 
And I would like to take this opportunity to thank our over 69,000 dedicated Team Members for their hard work and unwavering commitment to providing excellent customer service each day in every store across the country. Your steadfast dedication delivering the O'Reilly culture is the reason for our consistently strong performance, and I cannot thank you enough for your continued contributions to our long-term success.
We established our comparable store sales guidance of 3% to 5% for the first quarter on the heels of the strong demand trends we experienced throughout 2014, tempered by the difficult comparisons represented by the high bar we set in the first quarter last year.
However, we continue to capitalize on the positive momentum throughout the first quarter, generating a 7.2% increase in comparable store sales, easily exceeding the top end of our guidance range. This strong performance is on top of an excellent 6.3% increase in the first quarter of 2014 and represents our sixth consecutive quarter of comparable store sales increases, exceeding 5%. 
More importantly, our commitment to profitable growth translated these impressive top line results into another record first quarter operating margin of 18.4%.
Our ability to consistently grow our business profitably is the result of our team's commitment to providing exceptional customer service and our dedication to investing in the tools our Team Members need to build lasting relationships with our customers.
Overall, for the first quarter, sales increased 10% to $1.9 billion. And as we've seen over the past year, categories such as brakes, driveline, chassis, ride control and batteries were key contributors to our growth. We view the sustained growth in these key categories as a good indicator of our customers' continued focus on maintaining and repairing their existing vehicles, which bodes well for long-term demand in our business. 
Availability in these important SKU-intensive maintenance and repair categories is critical. And our proficiency in delivering parts to our customers faster than our competitors is a key advantage and an important driver in our ability to continue to profitably grow our market share. 
These gains, combined with prudent expense control, drove our record 18.4% operating margin, which was 180 basis points improvement over first quarter of 2014.
Last year's first quarter operating profit was negatively impacted by a $23 million LIFO charge. And by comparison, we saw a smaller but still meaningful $8 million LIFO charge in the first quarter of this year. Tom will discuss these charges in more detail in a few minutes, but excluding the LIFO impact from both quarters, our operating profit improved by 92 basis points.
This profitable growth yielded a 28% increase in diluted earnings per share, which represents our 25th consecutive quarter with earnings per share growth in excess of 15%.
I would now like to take a few minutes and add some color to our comparable store sales results for the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we generated a very robust 7.2% increase in comparable store sales on top of a strong 6.3% increase in the first quarter of 2014. Sales trends were strong throughout the quarter although they were a little softer in February on a relative basis.
Consistent with what we saw in 2014, both the DIY and professional sides of our business were strong contributors to our comp store growth, with professional again slightly outpacing DIY. On both sides of our business, ticket average and traffic count both contributed to the comp growth.
As we've seen for the past 2 years, inflation has not been a driver of our comparable store sales, with an inflation tailwind of less than 50 basis points over that period. And we continue to expect that we will not see material benefit from inflation in the foreseeable future. 
As we've seen for some time now, the growth in average ticket has been driven by increasing parts complexity rather than inflation or pricing, which has remained very rational in the industry.
As we build our book of professional business, especially in our less mature markets, traffic continues to be the main driver of our professional comps where we have seen very strong ticket count increases over the last 2 years. 
On the DIY side of our business, we also saw solid increase in traffic as DIY consumers recover from the difficult macroeconomic headwinds they have faced in recent years, and our internal initiatives focused on our DIY customers continue to gain traction. 
Unemployment in the U.S. being down to 5.5% and year-over-year gas prices being down 33% are definitely tailwinds for the business, especially for our DIY customers who have been under significant economic pressure for an extended period of time. To the extent unemployment continues to improve and prices at the pump remain low, we expect our business to continue to benefit. 
In addition, the primary driver for demand in our business is miles driven. And as we saw at the end of 2014, in January, miles driven strongly increased, contributing to the continued strong demand for our products.
Our second quarter is off to a strong start. However, we are just entering the critical spring selling season, and we have experienced volatility in the months of May and June at times in the past. We also face another quarter of strong results from the prior year, with a 5.1% second quarter 2014 comp comparison. Based on these factors, we are establishing our second quarter comparable store sales guidance at a range of 3% to 5%.
Turning to our gross margin results. As I mentioned earlier, the impact of LIFO accounting makes the comparisons to the prior year difficult. Excluding the LIFO charges in both years, our gross margin increased 21 basis points, which was in line with our expectations. We continue to realize incremental improvements in our acquisition cost, and pricing in our industry remains rational.
Based on these factors, we are leaving our full year gross margin guidance unchanged at a range of 51.8% to 52.2% of sales. However, we are raising our full year operating margin guidance from a range of 18.1% to 18.5% of sales to a range of 18.3% to 18.7% of sales. The increase in our operating margin guidance range for the full year is driven by our stronger-than-expected first quarter results flow through to the full year. We are also increasing our full year earnings per share guidance from a range of $8.20 to $8.30 to a range of $8.42 to $8.52. 
This updated guidance includes the strong first quarter results and shares repurchased through yesterday and excludes any additional potential share repurchases. 
Before I finish my prepared comments, I would like to thank our team for these record-breaking first quarter results. We remain very confident in the long-term drivers for demand in our industry, and we believe our team is very well positioned to capitalize on this demand by consistently providing exceptional service to our customers every day. 
Again, congratulations to the Team O'Reilly for a very strong start to 2015. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Shaw. Jeff?"

I'd like to begin today by echoing Greg's comments and congratulating Team O'Reilly on another outstanding quarter. 
I couldn't be more proud of our team's execution and the level of consistent topnotch service that we continue to provide to our customers day in and day out. 7.2% comparable store sales growth doesn't happen by accident, especially when it sits on top of a 6.3% increase the prior year.
Our industry-leading performance is the direct result of our team's commitment to outhustling and outservicing the competition each and every day. Our team once again rolled up their sleeves and executed our proven business model, delivering another quarter of record-breaking results.
I want to thank each of our Team Members for their continued hard work and dedication to making O'Reilly Auto Parts the destination location for all of our customers' auto parts needs. As Greg mentioned earlier, we're not just focused on top line growth. Rather, we are laser-focused on building long-term, win-win relationships with our customers, which results in sustainable, profitable growth.
During the first quarter, our team did a great job of profitably gaining market share and, at the same time, kept a close eye on store and distribution center expenses.
For the quarter, SG&A leveraged 71 basis points on extremely strong comparable store sales and excellent expense control. Average per-store SG&A increased 2.7%, which was higher than we originally expected for the quarter and was driven by higher-than-planned store payroll, commissions and incentive compensation and exactly what we want to see when we have such strong sales and profitability results.
Our companywide compensation philosophy is focused on instilling within each of our Team Members the mentality that they should run the business like they own it. And they did exactly that during the first quarter. When we generate strong top line results, we expect average SG&A per store to increase while, at the same time, generating impressive expense leverage. And this is what we did in the first quarter.
Although our first quarter average SG&A per store was slightly higher than planned, when we flow these results into the full year, we don't anticipate a material impact. And as such, we still expect our full year increase in average SG&A per store to be approximately 1.5%.
We successfully opened 67 new stores during the quarter, and we continue to be pleased with the performance from our new stores. As we discussed on our last call, we will open new stores across our footprint, with more significant growth concentrated in Florida, supported by our new distribution center in Lakeland, Florida; in California as we backfill attractive markets not previously penetrated by CSK; in the Upper Great Lakes as we freed up capacity across multiple DCs with the opening of our new Chicago DC; and in Texas.
Speaking of Texas, this has been a growth market for us for many years, and we see opportunity for continued profitable growth in the state in the future. However, at this point, we're budding up against our distribution capacity. As Greg mentioned earlier, we're extremely focused on investing in the tools that give our team the ability to provide consistent topnotch service to our customers. 
To that end, we're excited to announce we've acquired property in Selma, Texas where we plan to build our 27th distribution center. Selma is a northeastern suburb of San Antonio, so we'll refer to it as our San Antonio DC, and it's about an hour away from Austin. Both San Antonio and Austin are metro areas with rapid growth, and the new DC will allow us to open more stores and improve our parts availability in both of these substantial markets. When the new DC opens, it will also free up much needed capacity at both our Dallas and Houston DCs, allowing those facilities to operate more efficiently while also creating capacity for future growth.
The San Antonio DC is planned to open in the second quarter of 2016 and will have the capacity to service approximately 225 stores. As we have proven in the past, our distribution operations team is extremely effective at planning, building and opening new distribution centers. And we're confident that this project will roll out with the same degree of efficiency that our past projects have delivered.
I'd like to finish up today by thanking our store and distribution teams for their relentless focus on providing consistent topnotch customer service each and every day. Your hard work and dedication continues to drive our success.
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Our gross margin results of 51.9% for the quarter is in line with our expectations. On a run rate basis, gross margin improved 20 basis points over the fourth quarter, primarily based on better distribution leverage on higher sales.
On a year-over-year basis, gross margin improved 109 basis points. However, as Greg mentioned earlier, this comparison is skewed by the impact of our LIFO accounting. As we've discussed over the past 1.5 years, our success to reducing our acquisition cost over time has exhausted our LIFO reserve, with the result that initial cost decreases create onetime noncash headwinds to gross margin as we adjust our existing inventory on hand to the lower cumulative acquisition cost.
For the first quarter of 2015, we experienced a LIFO headwind of $8 million compared to a headwind of $23 million in the first quarter of 2014. Excluding both of these headwinds, year-over-year gross margin rates increased 21 basis points.
As we look forward to the rest of the year, we expect to continue to see moderate LIFO headwinds as we incrementally improve acquisition costs. However, we remain comfortable with our gross margin guidance of 51.8% to 52.2% of sales.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 37%, which was slightly better than our expectations of 37.3% and was driven by the realization of more job tax credits than originally expected. When we look at the full year of 2015, we still expect our tax rate to be approximately 37% of pretax income. 
On a quarter-to-quarter basis, we expect our quarterly tax rate to be around 37.3% for the second and fourth quarters, with the third quarter expectation of 36.2% as we adjust for the totaling of certain tax periods. These estimated rates are subject to the resolution of open tax periods under audit and our success in qualifying for existing job tax credit programs.
Now we move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results in the first quarter and our updated guidance expectations for the full year of 2015. Free cash flow for the quarter is $315 million. And we're revising our full year guidance for free cash flow to a range of $700 million to $750 million, reflecting an increase from our previous range of $675 million to $725 million as a result of the strong operating income results in the first quarter.
Inventory per store at the end of the quarter was $570,000, which was a 2.5% decrease from the end of 2014. Our ongoing goal is to ensure we grow per-store inventory at a slower rate than the comparable store sales growth we generate. We definitely accomplished that goal in the first quarter. However, this decrease is primarily timing as a result of the very strong sales during the quarter, and we're actually a little lighter on inventory than we'd like to be. 
For the year, we continue to expect our per-store inventory to increase a little less than 1% per store. 
Our AP-to-inventory ratio finished the first quarter at 97.7%. The spike in this ratio is also related to the extremely strong sales during the first quarter. For 2015, we continue to expect the year-end AP-to-inventory ratio to be around 97%. 
Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $91 million, which is a little less than we planned. But we still expect our 2015 CapEx to be within the range of $400 million to $430 million, inclusive of the San Antonio DC.
Moving on to debt. We finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.7x, still well below our targeted ratio of 2 to 2.25. We continue to believe our stated range is the appropriate amount for our business, and we will move into this range when the timing is appropriate.
We continue to execute our share repurchase program. And year-to-date, we've repurchased 1 million shares of our stock at an average cost of $210.74 per share for a total investment of $210 million. We continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning available cash to our shareholders after we take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business at a high rate of return. We will continue to prudently execute our program with an emphasis on maximizing long-term returns to our shareholders.
For the second quarter, we're establishing diluted earnings per share guidance of $2.17 to $2.21. Based on our above-planned results in the first quarter and additional shares repurchased since our last call, for the full year, we're raising our guidance to $8.42 to $8.52 per share, representing an increase of $0.22 per share from our previously announced guidance. 
As a reminder, our diluted earnings per share guidance for both the second quarter and full year take into account the shares repurchased through yesterday but do not reflect the impact of any potential future share repurchases.
Finally, I'd like to once again thank the entire O'Reilly team for their continued dedication to the company's success. Congratulations on an outstanding start to 2015. 
This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I'd like to ask Ellen, the operator, to return to the line. And we'll be happy to answer your questions."

Well, from a competitor standpoint, we've got tough competitors all over. I would tell you that the competitive landscape, from our perspective, is at least as strong as it's ever been and probably stronger since more of our competitors compete on both sides of the business than did just 5 or 10 years ago. It's hard to know for sure where the business that we gain and market share gains come from. But I would say it's a mix of both. We have good competitors that are publicly traded, good competitors that are private, good competitors that do business as a what we call 2-step distribution, which are just kind of off the beat and have type of undercar warehouses, and they can be very strong competitors. We really focus on establishing a relationship with the best customers in the market and then, over time, every customer in the market and just working our way up the ladder, improving our ability to provide service that exceeds our competitors and, in many cases, having competitive prices. We really don't see a big price response as we come into the market. I think that most in our industry have realized that price is not the primary reason that a shop buys from a parts store. It's service and relationships and their ability to work with a parts supplier to make sure that they have the right to return products, that they pick up a car for warranty, the occasional labor claim, just all the relationship things that go into helping partner with those guys to be successful in their businesses. From a people standpoint, we sometimes transplant people. We'll move them from one market to another. In many cases, we will hire them from competitors who are doing a lot of business down there. Many times, they're not our retail, publicly traded competitors. They might be our wholesale competitors or undercar type competitors. But as we expand into the new markets, we, of course, look around and see who's selling the parts. And if we have a chance to give someone an opportunity with a company that's going to grow in that market and put them in a position to improve their career and become part of our team here at O'Reilly, we do that. But in many cases, we're able to move people and promote people from within as we expand. And in Florida, it's been a mix of both. We've hired some people that have helped us, and then we've developed and promoted some people from within. So it's a combination."

We have a great team in the field, and they're supported by a great team here at our headquarters. I can't help but feel like some of the things that we've done over the past few years, which have improved our availability to products, we've increased the number of times that we touch a store each day. And as you know, product availability is a huge factor in driving the success in auto parts business simply because if you can get the parts faster than your competitor can, that's a big factor. I think some of the retail things we've done as far as improving the services that we do, maybe helping a customer pull the meaning of a check engine light that's on or installing a wiper blade or the occasional battery, stuff like that. I've mentioned before that there was a time that we were pretty reluctant to do those kinds of things simply because we didn't want to infringe on our professional customers' business and operations. But over time, we've realized that those kinds of things, for the most part, they were unable to charge a customer for it anyway, and they didn't mind us doing those things. So we've done that. I think that's been a contributor to our DIY business. As much as anything, we just got a really, really strong management team in the field that is incredibly focused on making sure that we outhustle and provide a service level to our customers that's greater than what our competitors do. And while that's not something that the day you start doing that, it grows your business instantly, it's something that, over time, has a very positive effect. And I think that over the past 2 or 3 years, we've put a renewed emphasis on the importance of outservicing our competitors and making sure our customers' experience and service levels with us is greater than they would experience with any of our competitors. And I think that that's probably the biggest factor driving our performance."

And we felt the effect of that to some degree although it was tempered by the fact that people were -- hung on to their cars longer in the tougher economy and maybe doing more repairs in the event that [indiscernible]. I guess what I would say is that right now, with gas prices having come down as much as they have, the feeling of the business is very robust. And I -- it's hard to quantify that. I would say that the magnitude of the effect of that, I would reflect simply in the miles driven. And the important thing in the last driven miles, it's driven increase significantly. If I have my number right, I don't have it in front of me, but I think in January, miles driven were up 4.9%. And that's pretty significant. So to me, the measurement of the effect of miles driven in the gas prices is reflective of miles driven. And miles driven, of course, has a very positive effect on us. Now one of the contributors to miles driven, of course, is the fact that unemployment rates have come down and commuter miles are up. And we view that as a positive force, too. So both those things are significant contributors, we feel like, to our business as well as many retail businesses that might not do as well and -- when consumers don't have cash and might defer some of the things that they would otherwise do."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts First Quarter Conference Call. Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Shaw, our Executive Vice President of Store Operations and Sales. David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman; and Greg Johnson, our Executive Vice President of Supply Chain, are also present. 
It's my pleasure to begin our call today by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another record-breaking quarter and a very successful start to 2015. Once again, our team's relentless focus on providing consistently high levels of service to our customers generated top line growth which exceeded our expectations. 
And I would like to take this opportunity to thank our over 69,000 dedicated Team Members for their hard work and unwavering commitment to providing excellent customer service each day in every store across the country. Your steadfast dedication delivering the O'Reilly culture is the reason for our consistently strong performance, and I cannot thank you enough for your continued contributions to our long-term success.
We established our comparable store sales guidance of 3% to 5% for the first quarter on the heels of the strong demand trends we experienced throughout 2014, tempered by the difficult comparisons represented by the high bar we set in the first quarter of last year.
However, we continue to capitalize on the positive momentum throughout the first quarter, generating a 7.2% increase in comparable store sales, easily exceeding the top end of our guidance range. This strong performance is on top of an excellent 6.3% increase in the first quarter of 2014 and represents our sixth consecutive quarter of comparable store sales increases exceeding 5%. 
More importantly, our commitment to profitable growth translated these impressive top line results into another record first quarter operating margin of 18.4%.
Our ability to consistently grow our business profitably is the result of our team's commitment to providing exceptional customer service and our dedication to investing in the tools our Team Members need to build lasting relationships with our customers.
Overall, for the first quarter, sales increased 10% to $1.9 billion. And as we've seen over the past year, categories such as brakes, drivelines, chassis, ride control and batteries were key contributors to our growth. We view the sustained growth in these key categories as a good indicator of our customers' continued focus on maintaining and repairing their existing vehicles, which bodes well for long-term demand in our business. 
Availability in these important SKU-intensive maintenance and repair categories is critical. And our proficiency in delivering parts to our customers faster than our competitors is a key advantage and an important driver in our ability to continue to profitably grow our market share. 
These gains, combined with prudent expense control, drove our record 18.4% operating margin, which was a 180 basis points improvement over first quarter of 2014.
Last year's first quarter operating profit was negatively impacted by a $23 million LIFO charge. And by comparison, we saw a smaller but still meaningful $8 million LIFO charge in the first quarter of this year. Tom will discuss these charges in more detail in a few minutes, but excluding the LIFO impact from both quarters, our operating profit improved by 92 basis points.
This profitable growth yielded a 28% increase in diluted earnings per share, which represents our 25th consecutive quarter with earnings per share growth in excess of 15%.
I would now like to take a few minutes and add some color to our comparable store sales results for the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we generated a very robust 7.2% increase in comparable store sales on top of a strong 6.3% increase in the first quarter of 2014. Sales trends were strong throughout the quarter, although they were a little softer in February on a relative basis.
Consistent with what we saw in 2014, both the DIY and professional sides of our business were strong contributors to our comp store growth, with professional again slightly outpacing DIY. On both sides of our business, ticket average and traffic count both contributed to the comp growth.
As we've seen for the past 2 years, inflation has not been a driver of our comparable store sales, with an inflation tailwind of less than 50 basis points over that period. And we continue to expect that we will not see material benefit from inflation in the foreseeable future. 
As we've seen for some time now, the growth in average ticket has been driven by increasing parts complexity rather than inflation or pricing, which has remained very rational in the industry.
As we build our book of professional business, especially in our less mature markets, traffic continues to be the main driver of our professional comps, where we have seen very strong ticket count increases over the last 2 years. 
On the DIY side of our business, we also saw solid increase in traffic as DIY consumers recover from the difficult macroeconomic headwinds they have faced in recent years and our internal initiatives focused on our DIY customers continue to gain traction. 
Unemployment in the U.S. being down to 5.5% and year-over-year gas prices being down 33% are definitely tailwinds for the business, especially for our DIY customers, who have been under significant economic pressure for an extended period of time. To the extent unemployment continues to improve and prices at the pump remain low, we expect our business to continue to benefit. 
In addition, the primary driver for demand in our business is miles driven. And as we saw at the end of 2014, in January, miles driven strongly increased, contributing to the continued strong demand for our products.
Our second quarter is off to a strong start. However, we are just entering the critical spring selling season, and we have experienced volatility in the months of May and June at times in the past. We also face another quarter of strong results from the prior year with a 5.1% second quarter 2014 comp comparison. Based on these factors, we are establishing our second quarter comparable store sales guidance at a range of 3% to 5%.
Turning to our gross margin results. As I mentioned earlier, the impact of LIFO accounting makes the comparisons to the prior year difficult. Excluding the LIFO charges in both years, our gross margin increased 21 basis points, which was in line with our expectations. We continue to realize incremental improvements in our acquisition cost, and pricing in our industry remains rational.
Based on these factors, we are leaving our full year gross margin guidance unchanged at a range of 51.8% to 52.2% of sales. However, we are raising our full year operating margin guidance from a range of 18.1% to 18.5% of sales to a range of 18.3% to 18.7% of sales. The increase in our operating margin guidance range for the full year is driven by our stronger-than-expected first quarter results flowed through to the full year. We are also increasing our full year earnings per share guidance from a range of $8.20 to $8.30 to a range of $8.42 to $8.52. 
This updated guidance includes the strong first quarter results and shares repurchased through yesterday and excludes any additional potential share repurchases. 
Before I finish my prepared comments, I would like to thank our team for these record-breaking first quarter results. We remain very confident in the long-term drivers for demand in our industry, and we believe our team is very well positioned to capitalize on this demand by consistently providing exceptional service to our customers every day. 
Again, congratulations to Team O'Reilly for a very strong start to 2015. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Shaw. Jeff?"

I'd like to begin today by echoing Greg's comments and congratulating Team O'Reilly on another outstanding quarter. 
I couldn't be more proud of our team's execution and the level of consistent topnotch service that we continue to provide to our customers day in and day out. 7.2% comparable store sales growth doesn't happen by accident, especially when it sits on top of a 6.3% increase the prior year.
Our industry-leading performance is the direct result of our team's commitment to outhustling and outservicing the competition each and every day. Our team once again rolled up their sleeves and executed our proven business model, delivering another quarter of record-breaking results.
I want to thank each of our Team Members for their continued hard work and dedication to making O'Reilly Auto Parts the destination location for all of our customers' auto parts needs. As Greg mentioned earlier, we're not just focused on top line growth. Rather, we are laser-focused on building long-term, win-win relationships with our customers, which results in sustainable, profitable growth.
During the first quarter, our team did a great job of profitably gaining market share and, at the same time, kept a close eye on store and distribution center expenses.
For the quarter, SG&A leveraged 71 basis points on extremely strong comparable store sales and excellent expense control. Average per-store SG&A increased 2.7%, which was higher than we originally expected for the quarter and was driven by higher-than-planned store payroll, commissions and incentive compensation and exactly what we want to see when we have such strong sales and profitability results.
Our company-wide compensation philosophy is focused on instilling within each of our Team Members the mentality that they should run the business like they own it. And they did exactly that during the first quarter. When we generate strong top line results, we expect average SG&A per store to increase while at the same time generating impressive expense leverage. And this is what we did in the first quarter.
Although our first quarter average SG&A per store was slightly higher than planned, when we flow these results into the full year, we don't anticipate a material impact. And as such, we still expect our full year increase in average SG&A per store to be approximately 1.5%.
We successfully opened 67 new stores during the quarter, and we continue to be pleased with the performance from our new stores. As we discussed on our last call, we will open new stores across our footprint, with more significant growth concentrated in Florida, supported by our new distribution center in Lakeland, Florida; in California as we backfill attractive markets not previously penetrated by CSK; in the Upper Great Lakes as we free up capacity across multiple DCs with the opening of our new Chicago DC; and in Texas.
Speaking of Texas, this has been a growth market for us for many years, and we see opportunity for continued profitable growth in the state in the future. However, at this point, we're butting up against our distribution capacity. As Greg mentioned earlier, we're extremely focused on investing in the tools that give our team the ability to provide consistent topnotch service to our customers. 
To that end, we're excited to announce we've acquired property in Selma, Texas, where we plan to build our 27th distribution center. Selma is a northeastern suburb of San Antonio, so we'll refer to it as our San Antonio DC, and it's about an hour away from Austin. Both San Antonio and Austin are metro areas with rapid growth, and the new DC will allow us to open more stores and improve our parts availability in both of these substantial markets. When the new DC opens, it will also free up much-needed capacity at both our Dallas and Houston DCs, allowing those facilities to operate more efficiently while also creating capacity for future growth.
The San Antonio DC is planned to open in the second quarter of 2016 and will have the capacity to service approximately 225 stores. As we have proven in the past, our distribution operations team is extremely effective at planning, building and opening new distribution centers. And we're confident that this project will roll out with the same degree of efficiency that our past projects have delivered.
I'd like to finish up today by thanking our store and distribution teams for their relentless focus on providing consistent topnotch customer service each and every day. Your hard work and dedication continues to drive our success.
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

I'd also like to thank all of Team O'Reilly on another outstanding quarter. Now we'll take a closer look at our first quarter results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2015.

Now we'll take a closer look at our first quarter results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2015. 
For the quarter, sales increased $174 million, comprised of a $122 million increase in comp store sales; a $50 million increase in non-comp store sales; a $3 million increase in non-comp, non-store sales; and a $1 million decrease from closed stores. For 2015, we continue to expect our total revenue to be in the range of $7.6 billion to $7.8 billion.
Our gross margin results of 51.9% for the quarter are in line with our expectations. On a run rate basis, gross margin improved 20 basis points over the fourth quarter, primarily based on better distribution leverage on higher sales.
On a year-over-year basis, gross margin improved 109 basis points. However, as Greg mentioned earlier, this comparison is skewed by the impact of our LIFO accounting. As we've discussed over the past 1.5 years, our success to reducing our acquisition cost over time has exhausted our LIFO reserve with the result that initial cost decreases create onetime noncash headwinds to gross margin as we adjust our existing inventory on hand to the lower cumulative acquisition cost.
For the first quarter of 2015, we experienced a LIFO headwind of $8 million compared to a headwind of $23 million in the first quarter of 2014. Excluding both of these headwinds, year-over-year gross margin rates increased 21 basis points.
As we look forward to the rest of the year, we expect to continue to see moderate LIFO headwinds as we incrementally improve acquisition costs. However, we remain comfortable with our gross margin guidance of 51.8% to 52.2% of sales.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 37%, which was slightly better than our expectations of 37.3% and was driven by the realization of more job tax credits than originally expected. When we look at the full year of 2015, we still expect our tax rate to be approximately 37% of pretax income. 
On a quarter-to-quarter basis, we expect our quarterly tax rate to be around 37.3% for the second and fourth quarters with the third quarter expectation of 36.2% as we adjust for the tooling of certain tax periods. These estimated rates are subject to the resolution of open tax periods under audit and our success in qualifying for existing job tax credit programs.
Now we'll move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results in the first quarter and our updated guidance expectations for the full year of 2015. Free cash flow for the quarter was $315 million. And we're revising our full year guidance for free cash flow to a range of $700 million to $750 million, reflecting an increase from our previous range of $675 million to $725 million as a result of the strong operating income results in the first quarter.
Inventory per store at the end of the quarter was $570,000, which was a 2.5% decrease from the end of 2014. Our ongoing goal is to ensure we grow per-store inventory at a slower rate than the comparable store sales growth we generate. We definitely accomplished that goal in the first quarter. However, this decrease was primarily timing as a result of the very strong sales during the quarter, and we're actually a little lighter on inventory than we'd like to be. 
For the year, we continue to expect our per-store inventory to increase a little less than 1% per store. 
Our AP-to-inventory ratio finished the first quarter at 97.7%. The spike in this ratio is also related to the extremely strong sales during the first quarter. For 2015, we continue to expect the year-end AP-to-inventory ratio to be around 97%. 
Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $91 million, which is a little less than we planned, but we still expect our 2015 CapEx to be within the range of $400 million to $430 million, inclusive of the San Antonio DC.
Moving on to debt. We finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.7x, still well below our targeted ratio of 2 to 2.25. We continue to believe our stated range is the appropriate amount for our business, and we will move into this range when the timing is appropriate.
We continue to execute our share repurchase program. And year-to-date, we've repurchased 1 million shares of our stock at an average cost of $210.74 per share for a total investment of $210 million. We continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning available cash to our shareholders after we take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business at a high rate of return. We will continue to prudently execute our program with an emphasis on maximizing long-term returns to our shareholders.
For the second quarter, we're establishing diluted earnings per share guidance of $2.17 to $2.21. Based on our above-plan results in the first quarter and additional shares repurchased since our last call, for the full year, we're raising our guidance to $8.42 to $8.52 per share, representing an increase of $0.22 per share from our previously announced guidance. 
As a reminder, our diluted earnings per share guidance for both the second quarter and full year take into account the shares repurchased through yesterday but do not reflect the impact of any potential future share repurchases.
Finally, I'd like to once again thank the entire O'Reilly team for their continued dedication to the company's success. Congratulations on an outstanding start to 2015. 
This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I'd like to ask Ellen, the operator, to return to the line. And we'll be happy to answer your questions."

And I guess, to speak to your question about our work with existing customers, we have a significant effort, as do our competitors, to do more business with national accounts and -- competitors that are chains of shops. And we continue to do well and expect to continue to do well in the future. A big driver of our just transaction increase is the continued opportunity we have in some of our newer markets, and specifically the West Coast markets, as we continue to gain traction out there and become more of a first-call status or maybe move ourselves from third call to second call with some existing customers and then also new customers as we continue to expand our professional programs in the stores that we acquired from CSK years ago. We still -- and I know we're years down the road now, but we have a lot of runway in front of us as far as the amount of business that we can be doing out there per store on the professional side as well as the DIY side. And we've seen some really good results in the last several months out there on both the professional and the DIY side."

Well, from a competitor standpoint, we've got tough competitors all over. I would tell you that the competitive landscape, from our perspective, is at least as strong as it's ever been and probably stronger since more of our competitors compete on both sides of the business than did just 5 or 10 years ago. It's hard to know for sure where the business that we gain and market share gains come from. But I would say it's a mix of both. We have good competitors that are publicly traded; good competitors that are private; good competitors that do business as a what we call 2-step distribution, which are just kind of off the beaten path type of undercar warehouses, and they can be very strong competitors. We really focus on establishing a relationship with the best customers in a market and then, over time, every customer in a market and just working our way up the ladder, improving our ability to provide service that exceeds our competitors', in many cases, having competitive prices. We really don't see a big price response as we come into the market. I think that most in our industry have realized that price is not the primary reason that a shop buys from a parts store. It's service and relationships and their ability to work with a parts supplier to make sure that they have the right to return products if they take off a car for warranty, the occasional labor claim, just all the relationship things that go into helping partner with those guys to be successful in their businesses. From a people standpoint, we sometimes transplant people. We'll move them from one market to another. In many cases, we will hire them from competitors who are doing a lot of business down there. Many times, they're not our retail, publicly traded competitors. They might be our wholesale competitors or undercar type competitors. But as we expand into new markets, we of course look around and see who's selling the parts. And if we have a chance to give someone an opportunity with a company that's going to grow in that market and put them in a position to improve their career and become part of our team here at O'Reilly, we do that. But in many cases, we're able to move people and promote people from within as we expand. And in Florida, it's been a mix of both. We've hired some people that have helped us, and then we've developed and promoted some people from within. So it's a combination."

We have a great team in the field, and they're supported by a great team here at our headquarters. I can't help but feel like some of the things that we've done over the past few years, which have improved our availability to products, we've increased the number of times that we touch a store each day. And as you know, product availability is a huge factor in driving the success in auto parts business simply because if you can get the parts faster than your competitor can, that's a big factor. I think some of the retail things we've done as far as improving the services that we do, maybe helping a customer pull the meaning of a check engine light that's on or installing a wiper blade or the occasional battery, stuff like that. I've mentioned before that there was a time that we were pretty reluctant to do those kinds of things simply because we didn't want to infringe on our professional customers' business and operations. But over time, we've realized that those kinds of things, for the most part, they were unable to charge a customer for anyway, and they didn't mind us doing those things. So we've done that. I think that's been a contributor to our DIY business. As much as anything, we've just got a really, really strong management team in the field that is incredibly focused on making sure that we outhustle and provide a service level to our customers that's greater than what our competitors do. And while that's not something that the day you start doing that, it grows your business instantly, it's something that, over time, has a very positive effect. And I think that over the past 2 or 3 years, we've put a renewed emphasis on the importance of outservicing our competitors and making sure our customers' experience the service levels with us is greater than they would experience with any of our competitors. And I think that that's probably the biggest factor driving our performance."

And we have the ability to lever it further if we want to. Right now, we feel like that the service levels that we're able to provide are a notch above our best competitors.

Well, we've seen the impact from gas prices really more on the increasing side as they've -- as they increased back some years ago. And we've felt the effect of that to some degree, although it was tempered by the fact that people were hanging on to their cars longer in the tougher economy and maybe doing more repairs and we've had that benefit, I guess. I guess what I would say is that right now, with gas prices having come down as much as they have, the feeling of the business is very robust. And I -- it's hard to quantify that. I would say that the magnitude of the effect of that I would reflect simply in the miles driven. And the important thing, in the last year, miles driven increased significantly. If I have my number right, I don't have it in front of me, but I think in January, miles driven were up 4.9%. And that's pretty significant. So to me, the measurement of the effect of miles driven in the gas prices is reflective of miles driven. And miles driven, of course, has a very positive effect on us. Now one of the contributors to miles driven, of course, is the fact that unemployment rates have come down and commuter miles are up. And we view that as a positive force, too.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts second quarter conference call.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts second quarter conference call. 
Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Shaw, our Executive Vice President and Store Operations and Sales; David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman; and Greg Johnson, our Executive Vice President of Supply Chain are also present. 
It is once again my pleasure to begin our quarterly call by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another record-breaking quarter and an extremely successful first half of 2015. With our team of over 71,000 dedicated team members keenly focused on providing consistently high level of service to our customers, we generated second quarter comparable sales store sales growth of 7.2%. 
Our year-to-date comparable store sales also increased 7.2% on top of a healthy 5.7% increase last year. These market share gains are the direct result of our team's dedication to living the O'Reilly culture, while providing outstanding service to our customers, and I cannot thank our team enough for their continued contributions to our company's long-term success.
The 7.2% increase we generated in the second quarter represents the 7th straight quarter we have generated at comparable store sales increased in excess of 5%. We remain steadfast in our commitment to sustainable, profitable growth, demonstrated by our total sales increase of 10.2%, driving a gross margin dollar increase of 11.3% over the second quarter of 2014.
The resulting operating profit dollar increase of 14.7%, while solid is somewhat subdued related to an unusual adverse event that I'd like to take a moment to explain.
As a result of an adverse verdict in a long-term contract dispute with the former service provider, we recorded a $19 million reserve to cover all the potential cost associated with the litigation. This reserve increased our SG&A expense by 93 basis points. Absent the charge, our second quarter operating profit, as a percent of sales, would have increased 167 basis points to 19.9% and operating profit dollars would have increased 20.3% over the second quarter of 2014. 
Our earnings per share of $2.29 for the second quarter is an increase of 20% over last year. While this quarter does represent the 26th consecutive quarter of earnings per share growth in excess of 15%, our EPS would have increased 26% to $2.40 absent this charge. 
In regards to this event, we'll continue to aggressively pursue all available options to reduce our ultimate cost. 
Okay. Now back to our auto-parts business. Our comparable store sales increase of 7.2% for both the second quarter and the year strongly exceeded our comparable store sales guidance of 3% to 5%. The composition of the comparable store sales growth in the second quarter was also very similar to the first quarter. Both the professional and DIY side of the business were strong contributors to our comparable store sales growth, with professional being slightly higher. 
Increases in comparable transaction count and ticket averages contributed equally to the growth. Professional transaction count growth continues to outpace DIY transaction count growth, however, DIY transaction count growth was a strong contributor to our comparable store sales increase. 
Average ticket growth on both sides of the business continues to be driven by parts complexity with little to no help from increases in selling price as inflation remains muted. 
Our performance for the quarter, as we've seen over the past 1.5 years, was driven by key hard part categories, such as breaks, chassis, driveline and rotating electrical. Through May, the latest data available miles-driven were up 3.4% year-to-date, and we feel this increase, driven by relatively low gas prices and improving employment, has been an important factor in our comparable store sales growth. 
[indiscernible] system throughout the quarter with May being the softest month as cool and wet conditions over much of the central and northern part of the country hurt air conditioning-related sales. 
In recent weeks, summer has taken hold across the country, which should be a positive tailwind for our business and our third quarter is off to a strong start. Based on moderate but slightly increasing gas prices and tough comparisons from the third quarter of 2014, we are setting our third quarter comparable store sales guidance at a range of 3% to 5%. And based on our strong first half of the year performance, we are increasing our full year guidance -- comparable store sales guidance to a range of 4% to 6%. 
We are maintaining our full year operating margin guidance at a range of 18.3% to 18.7% of sales. It reflects our very strong first half of the year results, but also includes the negative impact of the litigation charge I discussed earlier. We are increasing our full year earnings per share guidance from a range of $8.42 to $8.52 to a range of $8.59 and  $8.69.
This updated guidance includes the strong first half results and shares repurchased through yesterday and excludes any potential future share repurchases. 
Before I finish up my prepared comments, I would like to again thank our team for these record-breaking second quarter results. We remain very confident in our long-term drivers for demand in our industry, and we believe our team is very well positioned to capitalize on this demand by consistently providing incredible levels of service to our customers each day.  Again, congratulations to Team O'Reilly for a very strong second quarter and year-to-date results. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Shaw. Jeff?"

I'd like to begin today by echoing Greg's comments and congratulating Team O'Reilly on another outstanding quarter. Everyday, our focus is to come to work, roll up our sleeves and outhustle our competition to earn our customers' business. While we always have areas where we know we can improve, I couldn't be more proud of our team's performance this quarter and year-to-date.
Our industry-leading comparable store sales growth of 7.2%, both the second quarter and the first half of the year, is a testament to our team of 71,000-plus team members who are committed to providing consistent, top-notch customer service, and I'd like to send you a heartfelt thank you. 
For the quarter, we grew total revenue 10.2% and total gross margin dollars by 11.3%, proving yet again that our ability to provide exceptional service, a wide product offering at competitive prices and superior parts availability allows us to generate sustainable profitable growth.  This growth doesn't happen without the dedication of our store, distribution center and office support teams. 
Including the litigation event that Gregg mentioned earlier, we were still able to leverage SG&A 20 basis points in the quarter. However, I'll speak to our SG&A results, excluding that item as it is a very unusual event for us and is not indicative of our store operating performance. Excluding the unfortunate event, SG&A leverage 113 basis points on our strong sales performance, an average SG&A increase 1.4%.  This per store increase was higher-than-expected, primarily driven by more aggressive store staffing and incentive compensation. 
On the store staffing front, we've been more aggressive putting hours into the stores, and that decision has continued to enhance our store level customer service and is a key driver of our robust market share gains. As we've discussed on recent calls, all of our company compensation programs are designed to incentivize our team members to run their business like they own it. As a result, when we drive strong financial results, as we did again this quarter, we spend more payroll dollars at every level of the organization that generate strong leverage. 
Based on our year-to-date performance and our expectation for the remainder of the year, we're increasing our expected SG&A growth per store the range of 1.5% to 2%, excluding the litigation event. We feel this level of expense dollars is appropriate given the current environment to maximize our results. 
We successfully opened 99 net new stores in the first half of 2015, and we continue to be pleased with the performance from our new stores. As we discussed on our last call, we'll open new stores across our footprint with more significant growth concentrated in Florida, supported by our new distribution center in Lakeland. 
In California, as we backfill attractive markets not previously penetrated by CSK, in the Upper Great Lakes, as we freed up capacity across multiple DCs with the opening of our new Chicago DC and in Texas. These markets represented 21 of our 34 openings during the second quarter. 
Year-to-date, we strongly exceeded our expected sales volumes, and I'd like to take time to thank the members of our supply chain for their outstanding work keeping our stores in stock to meet the robust demand we've experienced the past several quarters. We continually evaluate stocking levels, extradited product with planned sales, building in on back order product, adjusting routes to handle higher freight volumes and continually modifying our hub, DC city counter and weekend routes to ensure we have the best availability in each market we serve. The knowledge, dedication and effectiveness of our supply chain team continues to be a critical component to -- of our success, and I cannot thank them enough for their contributions to our company's ongoing success.
Looking forward to the third quarter and beyond, we know that key to our success is providing exceptional customer service as well as the best parts availability in the industry, and we strongly feel our team continues to be up to that challenge. I'm very proud and thankful to work with such a great team. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

I'd also like to begin today by thanking Team O'Reilly for another very successful quarter.

And I'd like to thank each of our store, DC and support team members for their commitment to making O'Reilly Auto Parts our customers' first choice for auto parts.
Now I'll take a closer look at our second quarter results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2015. For the quarter, sales increased $188 million, comprised of $130 million increase in comp store sales; of $59 million increase in non-comp store sales;  a $1 million increase in non-comp, nonstore sales; and a $2 million decrease from closed stores. 
Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we're raising our full year total revenue guidance to a range of $7.75 billion to $7.85 billion. 
For the quarter, gross margin is 52% of sales, an improvement of 54 basis points over the prior year. This was a little diluted expected due to  the larger-than-expected LIFO headwind during the quarter. 
As we've discussed over the past 2 years, our success of reducing our acquisition costs over time has exhausted our LIFO reserve. As a result, should additional cost decreases take one-time noncash headwinds to gross margin as we adjust our existing inventory on hand to the lower cumulative acquisition costs. 
For the quarter, our LIFO charges about $1 million, which was about double the charge we saw in the second quarter of 2014. Excluding LIFO from both years, gross margin increased 79 basis points. However, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our full year gross margin guidance of 51.8% to 52.2% of sales.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.3% of pretax income and in line with our expectations. 
Looking at the full year of 2015, we still expect our tax rate will be approximately 37% of pretax income. as typical in most years, we anticipate our third quarter tax rate to be lower to approximately 36.2% of pretax income. As we adjust for the expected tooling uncertain struggle tax periods and with the fourth quarter returning to a more normal rate of 37.3% of pretax income. This estimated rates are subject to the resolution of open tax periods under audits and our success in qualifying for existing job tax credit programs. 
Now I'd like to provide some color on our free cash flow results and provide updated guidance for full year expectations. We generated $197 million of free cash flow during the second quarter, which is relatively flat with the prior year. Year-to-date, we generated $512 million in free cash flow compared to $461 million in the prior year. And based on our strong year-to-date operating income performance, we're raising our full year free cash flow guidance from a range up $700 million to $750 million to the range of $725 million to $775 million. 
Inventory per store at the end of the second quarter was $574,000, which is a 2% decrease from the end of 2014. Our ongoing goal is to ensure we grow per store inventory at the lower rate than the comparable store sales growth we generated, and we accomplished that goal through the first half of 2015. We continue to make great progress on reducing slow-moving and overstocked product and replacing that with additional store level inventory made up of products that are entering higher demand cycles.
However, part of this year-to-date decrease is timing related, driven by the very strong sales during the first half of the year. And we continue to expect our average inventory per store will increase a little less than 1% for the full year. 
Our inventory ratio finish the second quarter at 99%, up from 97.7% at the end of the first quarter this year. The rise in the ratio is related to seasonality and the extremely strong first-half sales. During the second half of the year, we believe this ratio will come down slightly and we continue expect the year-end AP inventory ratio will be around 97%. 
Capital expenditures for the first 6 months of 2015 were $187 million, which is a little less than we planned, but we still expect our 2015 CapEx to be within the range of $400 million to $430 million. 
Moving on to debt. We finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.63x, down from 1.66x as the -- as of the end of the first quarter, driven by a very strong trailing 12-month operating income performance. 
We are still well below our targeted ratio of 2x to 2.25x, however, we continue to believe our stated range is appropriate for our long-term business, and we'll move into this range when the timing is appropriate.
During the second quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares of our stock at an average cost of $221.50 per share. Year-to-date through yesterday, we repurchased approximately 2.9 million shares of our stock at an average cost of $219.13 per share for a total investment of $630 million. We continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning available cash for our shareholders after we take advantage of opportunities to reinvest in our business at a higher rate of return. 
Currently, we have 649 million remaining under our current authorization, and we'll continue to prudently execute our program with an emphasis on maximizing long-term returns to our shareholders. 
For the third quarter, we are establishing diluted earnings per share guidance at the range of $2.29 to $2.33. Based on our above planned results during the first half of the year and additional shares repurchases since our last call, for the full year, we're raising our earnings per share guidance to a range of $8.59 to $8.69 per share, representing an increase of $0.17 per share from the annual guidance we provided on our first quarter conference call in April and $0.39 per share from the initial annual guidance we provided at the beginning of the year.
As a reminder, our diluted earnings per share guidance for both the third quarter and full year take into account the shares we purchased through yesterday. It do not reflect the impact of any potential future share repurchases. 
Before I turn the call over to our analyst for questions, I'd like to once again thank the entire O'Reilly team for their continued hard work and dedication to providing consistently high level of customer service. Congratulations on another record-breaking quarter. 
This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I'd like to ask John, the operator, to return to the line, and we'll be happy to answer your questions."

I think that to the extent that we're talking to parts that are increasing in complexity, which is a big part of our business, absent the things that we carry in our display force because the types of products that are being used that are electronic branded, more sensors. Vehicles are in the process now going to direct injection, both diesel and gas. Ignition parts are going to the 1 coil per cylinder as oppose to 1 coil for the car. And then vehicles have all these life safety sensors, and so forth, that add complexity. We see that driving the cost of repair incrementally up over time. It's hard to forecast what that increase will look like, but that will continue to happen. Net -- all of the things that I just mentioned tend to make us believe and make others believe that the professional business will grow a little better in the coming years than what the DIY business simply because this complexity is a challenge for DIY customers. Although, as I said many times before and as cars originally started having a more computer images sensors, and so forth, I think that the DIY customer economic necessity very adaptable and there's a lot of companies that are out there providing information and tools to help DIY customers be able to work on cars. They have more sensors and more electronics. And for that reason, there's many that would bet the DIY business is going to do pretty well. So that's my comment on that."

We're delivering first of the vendor we did store specialist to focus solely on that business relationship with them, and then also our territory sales managers and our regional sales managers, store managers, and so forth. So I think we have a lot business to gain on both sides, and we're less restrictive in the aggressive position that we take on the DIY side now than we ever have been simply because I think that most shops now realized that customers are going to buy parts from someone if they want to work on their own car. They're either going to buy them from one of our competitors or us or maybe even on the Internet, and that we're going to be completely supportive of them driving successful businesses for them and making parts available for them. And that there's just a lot of business that they've got out there to take, and to the extent that they provide service level that satisfying to their customers and our customers, in effect, they'll be successful. I think that most of them are less concerned now than ever about the fact that people can buy parts and do their own work that they want to, but that they can drive a great business by providing this service levels that are necessary to be successful in the Service business today."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts second quarter conference call.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts second quarter conference call. 
Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Shaw, our Executive Vice President of Store Operations and Sales; David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman; and Greg Johnson, our Executive Vice President of Supply Chain, are also present.
It is once again my pleasure to begin our quarterly call by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another record-breaking quarter and an extremely successful first half of 2015. With our team of over 71,000 dedicated team members keenly focused on providing consistently high level of service to our customers, we generated second quarter comparable sales store sales growth of 7.2%. 
Our year-to-date comparable store sales also increased 7.2% on top of a healthy 5.7% increase last year. These market share gains are the direct result of our team's dedication to living the O'Reilly culture of providing outstanding service to our customers, and I cannot thank our team enough for their continued contributions to our company's long-term success.
The 7.2% increase we generated in the second quarter represents the seventh straight quarter we have generated at comparable store sales increased in excess of 5%. We remain steadfast in our commitment to sustainable, profitable growth, demonstrated by our total sales increase of 10.2%, driving a gross margin dollar increase of 11.3% over the second quarter of 2014.
The resulting operating profit dollar increase of 14.7%, while solid is somewhat subdued related to an unusual adverse event that I'd like to take a moment to explain.
As a result of an adverse verdict in a long-term contract dispute with the former service provider, we recorded a $19 million reserve to cover all the potential cost associated with the litigation. This reserve increased our SG&A expense by 93 basis points. Absent the charge, our second quarter operating profit, as a percent of sales, would have increased 167 basis points to 19.9% and operating profit dollars would have increased 20.3% over the second quarter of 2014.
Our earnings per share of $2.29 for the second quarter is an increase of 20% over last year. While this quarter does represent the 26th consecutive quarter of earnings per share growth in excess of 15%, our EPS would have increased 26% to $2.40 absent this charge.
In regards to this event, we'll continue to aggressively pursue all available options to reduce our ultimate cost.
Okay. Now back to our auto-parts business. Our comparable store sales increased to 7.2% for both the second quarter and the year strongly exceeded our comparable store sales guidance of 3% to 5%. The composition of the comparable store sales growth in the second quarter was also very similar to the first quarter. Both the professional and DIY sides of the business were strong contributors to our comparable store sales growth, with professional being slightly higher.
Increases in comparable transaction count and ticket averages contributed equally to the growth. Professional transaction count growth continues to outpace DIY transaction count growth, however, DIY transaction count growth was a strong contributor to our comparable store sales increase.
Average ticket growth on both sides of the business continues to be driven by parts complexity with little to no help from increases in selling price as inflation remains muted.
Our performance for the quarter, as we've seen over the past 1.5 years, was driven by key hard part categories, such as breaks, chassis, driveline and rotating electrical. Through May, the latest data available miles-driven were up 3.4% year-to-date, and we feel this increase, driven by relatively low gas prices and improving employment, has been an important factor in our comparable store sales growth. 
Sales were relatively consistent throughout the quarter with May being the softest month as cool and wet conditions over much of the central and northern part of the country hurt air conditioning-related sales.
In recent weeks, summer has taken hold across the country, which should be a positive tailwind for our business and our third quarter is off to a strong start. Based on moderate but slightly increasing gas prices and tough comparisons from the third quarter of 2014, we are setting our third quarter comparable store sales guidance at a range of 3% to 5%. And based on our strong first half of the year performance, we are increasing our full year guidance -- comparable store sales guidance to a range of 4% to 6%.
We are maintaining our full year operating margin guidance at a range of 18.3% to 18.7% of sales. Which reflects our very strong first half of the year results, but also includes the negative impact of the litigation charge I discussed earlier. We are increasing our full year earnings per share guidance from a range of $8.42 to $8.52 to a range of $8.59 and $8.69.
This updated guidance includes the strong first half results and shares repurchased through yesterday and excludes any potential future share repurchases.
Before I finish up my prepared comments, I would like to again thank our team for these record-breaking second quarter results. We remain very confident in our long-term drivers for demand in our industry, and we believe our team is very well positioned to capitalize on this demand by consistently providing incredible levels of service to our customers each day.  Again, congratulations to Team O'Reilly for a very strong second quarter and year-to-date results.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Shaw. Jeff?"

I'd like to begin today by echoing Greg's comments and congratulating Team O'Reilly on another outstanding quarter. Everyday, our focus is to come to work, roll up our sleeves and outhustle our competition to earn our customers' business. While we always have areas where we know we can improve, I couldn't be more proud of our team's performance this quarter and year-to-date.
Our industry-leading comparable store sales growth of 7.2% for both the second quarter and the first half of the year, is a testament to our team of 71,000-plus team members who are committed to providing consistent, top-notch customer service, and I'd like to send you a heartfelt thank you.
For the quarter, we grew total revenue 10.2% and total gross margin dollars by 11.3%, proving yet again that our ability to provide exceptional service, a wide product offering at competitive prices and superior parts availability allows us to generate sustainable profitable growth.  This growth doesn't happen without the dedication of our store, distribution center and office support teams.
Including the litigation event that Greg mentioned earlier, we were still able to leverage SG&A 20 basis points in the quarter. However, I'll speak to our SG&A results, excluding that item as it is a very unusual event for us and is not indicative of our store operating performance. Excluding the unfortunate event, SG&A leveraged to 113 basis points on our strong sales performance and average SG&A increased to 1.4%.  This per store increase was higher-than-expected, primarily driven by more aggressive store staffing and incentive compensation. 
On the store staffing front, we've been more aggressive putting hours into the stores, and that decision has continued to enhance our store level customer service and is a key driver of our robust market share gains. As we've discussed on recent calls, all of our company compensation programs are designed to incentivize our team members to run their business like they own it. As a result, when we drive strong financial results, as we did again this quarter, we spend more payroll dollars at every level of the organization that generate strong leverage. 
Based on our year-to-date performance and our expectation for the remainder of the year, we're increasing our expected SG&A growth per store to a range of 1.5% to 2%, excluding the litigation event. We feel this level of expense dollars is appropriate given the current environment to maximize our results.
We successfully opened 99 net new stores in the first half of 2015, and we continue to be pleased with the performance from our new stores. As we discussed on our last call, we'll open new stores across our footprint with more significant growth concentrated in Florida, supported by our new distribution center in Lakeland.
In California, as we backfill attractive markets not previously penetrated by CSK, in the Upper Great Lakes, as we freed up capacity across multiple DCs with the opening of our new Chicago DC and in Texas. These markets represented 21 of our 34 openings during the second quarter.
Year-to-date, we strongly exceeded our expected sales volumes, and I'd like to take time to thank the members of our supply chain for their outstanding work keeping our stores in stock to meet the robust demand we've experienced in the past several quarters. We continually evaluate stocking levels, expediting product with higher than planned sales, building in on back order product, adjusting routes to handle higher freight volumes and continually modifying our hub, DC city counter and weekend routes to ensure we have the best availability in each market we serve. The knowledge, dedication and effectiveness of our supply chain team continues to be a critical component to -- of our success, and I cannot thank them enough for their contributions to our company's ongoing success.
Looking forward to the third quarter and beyond, we know that key to our success is providing exceptional customer service as well as the best parts availability in the industry, and we strongly feel our team continues to be up to that challenge. I'm very proud and thankful to work with such a great team.
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

We're very proud of our record-breaking performance, which is a direct result of our team's dedication and hard work. And I'd like to thank each of o",1124,"Thanks, Jeff. I'd also like to begin today by thanking Team O'Reilly for another very successful quarter. We're very proud of our record-breaking performance, which is a direct result of our team's dedication and hard work. And I'd like to thank each of our store, DC and support team members for their commitment to making O'Reilly Auto Parts our customers' first choice for auto parts.
Now I'll take a closer look at our second quarter results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2015. For the quarter, sales increased to $188 million, comprised of $130 million increase in comp store sales; of $59 million increase in non-comp store sales;  a $1 million increase in non-comp, nonstore sales; and a $2 million decrease from closed stores.
Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we're raising our full year total revenue guidance to a range of $7.75 billion to $7.85 billion. 
For the quarter, gross margin is 52% of sales, an improvement of 54 basis points over the prior year. This was a little lighter than we expected due to  the larger-than-expected LIFO headwind during the quarter.
As we've discussed over the past 2 years, our success of reducing our acquisition costs over time has exhausted our LIFO reserve. With the result, should additional cost decreases take onetime noncash headwinds to gross margin as we adjust our existing inventory on hand to the lower cumulative acquisition costs.
For the quarter, our LIFO charges about $1 million, which was about double the charge we saw in the second quarter of 2014. Excluding LIFO from both years, gross margin increased 79 basis points. However, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our full year gross margin guidance of 51.8% to 52.2% of sales.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.3% of pretax income and in line with our expectations.
Looking at the full year of 2015, we still expect our tax rate will be approximately 37% of pretax income. As this is typical in most years, anticipate our third quarter tax rate to be lower at approximately 36.2% of pretax income. As we adjust for the expected tooling and certain historical tax periods and with the fourth quarter returning to a more normal rate of 37.3% of pretax income. These estimated rates are subject to the resolution of open tax periods under audit and our success in qualifying for existing job tax credit programs.
Now I'd like to provide some color on our free cash flow results and provide updated guidance for full year expectations. We generated $197 million of free cash flow during the second quarter, which is relatively flat with the prior year. Year-to-date, we generated $512 million in free cash flow compared to $461 million in the prior year. And based on our strong year-to-date operating income performance, we're raising our full year free cash flow guidance from a range of $700 million to $750 million to a range of $725 million to $775 million.
Inventory per store at the end of the second quarter was $574,000, which is a 2% decrease from the end of 2014. Our ongoing goal is to ensure we grow per store inventory at a lower rate than the comparable store sales growth we generated, and we accomplished that goal through the first half of 2015. We continue to make great progress on reducing slow-moving and overstocked product and replacing that with additional store level inventory made up of products that are entering higher demand cycles.
However, part of this year-to-date decrease is timing related, driven by the very strong sales during the first half of the year. And we continue to expect our average inventory per store will increase a little less than 1% for the full year. 
Our AP to inventory ratio finished the second quarter at 99%, up from 97.7% at the end of the first quarter of this year. The rise in the ratio is related to seasonality and the extremely strong first-half sales. During the second half of the year, we believe this ratio will come down slightly and we continue to expect the year-end AP to inventory ratio will be around 97%.
Capital expenditures for the first 6 months of 2015 were $187 million, which is a little less than we planned, but we still expect our 2015 CapEx to be within the range of $400 million to $430 million. 
Moving on to debt. We finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.63x, down from 1.66x as the -- as of the end of the first quarter, driven by a very strong trailing 12-month operating income performance.
We are still well below our targeted ratio of 2x to 2.25x, however, we continue to believe our stated range is appropriate for our long-term business, and we'll move into this range when the timing is appropriate.
During the second quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares of our stock at an average cost of $221.50 per share. Year-to-date through yesterday, we repurchased approximately 2.9 million shares of our stock at an average cost of $219.13 per share for a total investment of $630 million. We continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning available cash to our shareholders after we take advantage of opportunities to reinvest in our business at a higher rate of return. 
Currently, we have 649 million remaining under our current authorization, and we'll continue to prudently execute our program with an emphasis on maximizing long-term returns to our shareholders.
For the third quarter, we are establishing diluted earnings per share guidance at a range of $2.29 to $2.33. Based on our above planned results during the first half of the year and additional shares repurchases since our last call, for the full year, we're raising our earnings per share guidance to a range of $8.59 to $8.69 per share, representing an increase of $0.17 per share from the annual guidance we provided on our first quarter conference call in April and $0.39 per share from the initial annual guidance we provided at the beginning of the year.
As a reminder, our diluted earnings per share guidance for both the third quarter and full year take into account the shares repurchased through yesterday but do not reflect the impact of any potential future share repurchases.
Before I turn the call over to our analyst for questions, I'd like to once again thank the entire O'Reilly team for their continued hard work and dedication to providing consistently high level of customer service. Congratulations on another record-breaking quarter.
This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I'd like to ask John, the operator, to return to the line. And we'll be happy to answer your questions."

I think that to the extent that we're talking to parts that are increasing in complexity, which is a big part of our business, absent the things that we carry in our display force because the types of products that are being used that are electronic branded, more sensors. Vehicles are in the process now going to direct injection, both diesel and gas. Ignition parts are going to one coil per cylinder as oppose to one coil for the car. And then newer vehicles have all these life safety sensors, and so forth, that add complexity. We see that driving the cost of repair incrementally up over time. It's hard to forecast what that increase will look like, but that will continue to happen. Net -- all of the things that I just mentioned tend to make us believe and make others believe that the professional business will grow a little better in the coming years than what the DIY business will, simply because this complexity is a challenge for DIY customers. Although, as I've said many times before and as cars originally started having a more computer images sensors, and so forth, I think that the DIY customer had a economic necessity very adaptable and there's a lot of companies that are out there providing information and tools to help DIY customers be able to work on cars. They have more sensors and more electronics. And for that reason, there's many with best of the DIY business is going to do pretty well. So that's my comment on that."

We're delivering the parts to them and they're dealing with an installer service specialist who focus solely on that business relationship with them, and then also our territory sales managers and regional field sales managers, store managers, and so forth. So I think we have a lot of business to gain on both sides, and we're less restrictive in the aggressive position that we take on the DIY side now than we ever have been simply because I think that most shops now realized that customers are going to buy parts from someone if they want to work on their own car. They're either going to buy them from one of our competitors or us or maybe even in the -- on the Internet, and that we're going to be completely supportive of them in driving successful businesses for them and making parts available for them. And that there's just a lot of business that they've got out there to take, and to the extent that they provide a service level that's satisfying to their customers and on our customers, in effect, they'll be successful. I think that most of them are less concerned now than ever about the fact that people can buy parts and do their own work that they want to, but they can drive a great business by providing these service levels that are necessary to be successful in the Service business today."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts second quarter conference call. 
Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Shaw, our Executive Vice President of Store Operations and Sales; David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman; and Greg Johnson, our Executive Vice President of Supply Chain, are also present.
It is once again my pleasure to begin our quarterly call by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another record-breaking quarter and an extremely successful first half of 2015. With our team of over 71,000 dedicated team members keenly focused on providing consistently high level of service to our customers, we generated second quarter comparable-store sales growth of 7.2%. 
Our year-to-date comparable store sales also increased 7.2% on top of a healthy 5.7% increase last year. These market share gains are the direct result of our team's dedication to living the O'Reilly culture of providing outstanding service to our customers, and I cannot thank our team enough for their continued contributions to our company's long-term success.
The 7.2% increase we generated in the second quarter represents the seventh straight quarter we have generated at comparable-store sales increased in excess of 5%. We remain steadfast in our commitment to sustainable, profitable growth, demonstrated by our total sales increase of 10.2%, driving a gross margin dollar increase of 11.3% over the second quarter of 2014.
The resulting operating profit dollar increase of 14.7%, while solid is somewhat subdued related to an unusual adverse event that I'd like to take a moment to explain.
As a result of an adverse verdict in a long-term contract dispute with a former service provider, we recorded a $19 million reserve to cover all the potential costs associated with the litigation. This reserve increased our SG&A expense by 93 basis points. Absent the charge, our second quarter operating profit, as a percent of sales, would have increased 167 basis points to 19.9%, and operating profit dollars would have increased 20.3% over the second quarter of 2014.
Our earnings per share of $2.29 for the second quarter is an increase of 20% over last year. While this quarter does represent the 26th consecutive quarter of earnings per share growth in excess of 15%, our EPS would have increased 26% to $2.40 absent this charge.
In regards to this event, we'll continue to aggressively pursue all available options to reduce our ultimate cost.
Okay. Now back to our auto parts business. Our comparable store sales increase to 7.2% for both the second quarter and the year strongly exceeded our comparable-store sales guidance of 3% to 5%. The composition of the comparable-store sales growth in the second quarter was also very similar to the first quarter. Both the professional and DIY sides of the business were strong contributors to our comparable-store sales growth, with professional being slightly higher.
Increases in comparable-transaction count and ticket averages contributed equally to the growth. Professional transaction count growth continues to outpace DIY transaction count growth, however, DIY transaction count growth was a strong contributor to our comparable-store sales increase.
Average ticket growth on both sides of the business continues to be driven by parts complexity with little to no help from increases in selling price as inflation remains muted.
Our performance for the quarter, as we've seen over the past 1.5 years, was driven by key hard part categories, such as breaks, chassis, driveline and rotating electrical. Through May, the latest data available, miles-driven were up 3.4% year-to-date, and we feel this increase, driven by relatively low gas prices and improving employment, has been an important factor in our comparable-store sales growth. 
Sales were relatively consistent throughout the quarter with May being the softest month as cool and wet conditions over much of the central and northern part of the country hurt air conditioning-related sales.
In recent weeks, summer has taken hold across the country, which should be a positive tailwind for our business and our third quarter is off to a strong start. But based on moderate but slightly increasing gas prices and tough comparisons from the third quarter of 2014, we are setting our third quarter comparable-store sales guidance at a range of 3% to 5%. And based on our strong first half of the year performance, we are increasing our full year -- comparable-store sales guidance to a range of 4% to 6%.
We are maintaining our full year operating margin guidance at a range of 18.3% to 18.7% of sales, which reflects our very strong first half of the year results, but also includes the negative impact of the litigation charge I discussed earlier. We are increasing our full year earnings per share guidance from a range of $8.42 to $8.52 to a range of $8.59 and $8.69.
This updated guidance includes the strong first half results and shares repurchased through yesterday and excludes any potential future share repurchases.
Before I finish up my prepared comments, I would like to again thank our team for these record-breaking second quarter results. We remain very confident in the long-term drivers for demand in our industry, and we believe our team is very well positioned to capitalize on this demand by consistently providing incredible levels of service to our customers each day.  Again, congratulations to Team O'Reilly for our very strong second quarter and year-to-date results.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Shaw. Jeff?"

I'd like to begin today by echoing Greg's comments and congratulating Team O'Reilly on another outstanding quarter. Every day, our focus is to come to work, roll up our sleeves and outhustle our competition to earn our customers' business. While we always have areas where we know we can improve, I couldn't be more proud of our team's performance this quarter and year-to-date.
Our industry-leading comparable-store sales growth of 7.2% for both the second quarter and the first half of the year, is a testament to our team of 71,000-plus team members who are committed to providing consistent, top-notch customer service, and I'd like to send you a heartfelt thank you.
For the quarter, we grew total revenue 10.2% and total gross margin dollars by 11.3%, proving yet again that our ability to provide exceptional service, a wide product offering at competitive prices and superior parts availability allows us to generate sustainable profitable growth.  This growth doesn't happen without the dedication of our store, distribution center and office support teams.
Including the litigation event that Greg mentioned earlier, we were still able to leverage SG&A 20 basis points in the quarter. However, I'll speak to our SG&A results excluding that item as it is a very unusual event for us and is not indicative of our store operating performance. Excluding the unfortunate event, SG&A leveraged 113 basis points on our strong sales performance and average SG&A increased 1.4%.  This per store increase was higher than expected, primarily driven by more aggressive store staffing and incentive compensation. 
On the store staffing front, we've been more aggressive putting hours into the stores, and that decision has continued to enhance our store level customer service and is a key driver of our robust market share gains. As we've discussed on recent calls, all of our company compensation programs are designed to incentivize our team members to run their business like they own it. As a result, when we drive strong financial results, as we did again this quarter, we spend more payroll dollars at every level of the organization that generates strong leverage. 
Based on our year-to-date performance and our expectation for the remainder of the year, we're increasing our expected SG&A growth per store to a range of 1.5% to 2%, excluding the litigation event. We feel this level of expense dollars is appropriate given the current environment to maximize our results.
We successfully opened 99 net new stores in the first half of 2015, and we continue to be pleased with the performance from our new stores. As we discussed on our last call, we'll open new stores across our footprint with more significant growth concentrated in Florida, supported by our new distribution center in Lakeland.
In California, as we backfill attractive markets not previously penetrated by CSK, in the Upper Great Lakes, as we freed up capacity across multiple DCs with the opening of our new Chicago DC and in Texas. These markets represented 21 of our 34 openings during the second quarter.
Year-to-date, we strongly exceeded our expected sales volumes, and I'd like to take time to thank the members of our supply chain for their outstanding work keeping our stores in stock to meet the robust demand we've experienced in the past several quarters. We continually evaluate stocking levels, expediting product with higher-than-planned sales; filling in on back ordered product; adjusting routes to handle higher freight volumes and continually modifying our hub, DC city counter and weekend routes to ensure we have the best availability in each market we serve. The knowledge, dedication and effectiveness of our supply chain team continues to be a critical component to -- of our success, and I cannot thank them enough for their contributions to our company's ongoing success.
Looking forward to the third quarter and beyond, we know that key to our success is providing exceptional customer service as well as the best parts availability in the industry, and we strongly feel our team continues to be up to that challenge. I'm very proud and thankful to work with such a great team.
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

I'd also like to begin today by thanking Team O'Reilly for another very successful quarter.

And I'd like to thank each of our store, DC and support team members for their commitment to making O'Reilly Auto Parts our customers' first choice for auto parts.
Now I'll take a closer look at our second quarter results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2015. For the quarter, sales increased to $188 million, comprised of $130 million increase in comp-store sales; of $59 million increase in non-comp-store sales; a $1 million increase in non-comp, nonstore sales and a $2 million decrease from closed stores.
Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we're raising our full year total revenue guidance to a range of $7.75 billion to $7.85 billion. 
For the quarter, gross margin is 52% of sales, an improvement of 54 basis points over the prior year. This was a little lighter than we expected due to a larger-than-expected LIFO headwind during the quarter.
As we've discussed over the past 2 years, our success at reducing our acquisition costs over time has exhausted our LIFO reserve. With the result, should additional cost decreases take onetime noncash headwinds to gross margin as we adjust our existing inventory on hand to the lower cumulative acquisition costs.
For the quarter, our LIFO charge is $11 million, which was about double the charge we saw in the second quarter of 2014. Excluding LIFO from both years, gross margin increased 79 basis points. However, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our full year gross margin guidance of 51.8% to 52.2% of sales.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.3% of pretax income and in line with our expectations.
Looking at the full year of 2015, we still expect our tax rate will be approximately 37% of pretax income. As is typical in most years, anticipate our third quarter tax rate to be lower at approximately 36.2% of pretax income. As we adjust for the expected tolling of certain historical tax periods and with the fourth quarter returning to a more normal rate of 37.3% of pretax income. These estimated rates are subject to the resolution of open tax periods under audit and our success in qualifying for existing job tax credit programs.
Now I'd like to provide some color on our free cash flow results and provide updated guidance for full year expectations. We generated $197 million of free cash flow during the second quarter, which is relatively flat with the prior year. Year-to-date, we generated $512 million in free cash flow compared to $461 million in the prior year. And based on our strong year-to-date operating income performance, we're raising our full year free cash flow guidance from a range of $700 million to $750 million to a range of $725 million to $775 million.
Inventory per store at the end of the second quarter was $574,000, which is a 2% decrease from the end of 2014. Our ongoing goal is to ensure we grow per store inventory at a lower rate than the comparable-store sales growth we generated, and we accomplished that goal through the first half of 2015. We continue to make great progress on reducing slow-moving and overstocked product and replacing it with additional store-level inventory made up of products that are entering higher demand cycles.
However, part of this year-to-date decrease is timing related, driven by the very strong sales during the first half of the year. And we continue to expect our average inventory per store will increase a little less than 1% for the full year. 
Our AP to inventory ratio finished the second quarter at 99%, up from 97.7% at the end of the first quarter of this year. The rise in the ratio is related to seasonality and the extremely strong first half sales. During the second half of the year, we believe this ratio will come down slightly, and we continue to expect the year-end AP-to-inventory ratio will be around 97%.
Capital expenditures for the first 6 months of 2015 were $187 million, which is a little less than we planned, but we still expect our 2015 CapEx to be within the range of $400 million to $430 million. 
Moving on to debt. We finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.63x, down from 1.66x as the -- as of the end of the first quarter, driven by a very strong trailing 12-month operating income performance.
We are still well below our targeted ratio of 2 to 2.25x, however, we continue to believe our stated range is appropriate for our long-term business, and we'll move into this range when the timing is appropriate.
During the second quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares of our stock at an average cost of $221.50 per share. Year-to-date through yesterday, we repurchased approximately 2.9 million shares of our stock at an average cost of $219.13 per share for a total investment of $630 million. We continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning available cash to our shareholders after we take advantage of opportunities to reinvest in our business at a higher rate of return. 
Currently, we have 649 million remaining under our current authorization, and we'll continue to prudently execute our program with an emphasis on maximizing long-term returns to our shareholders.
For the third quarter, we are establishing diluted earnings per share guidance at a range of $2.29 to $2.33. Based on our above planned results during the first half of the year and additional shares repurchases since our last call, for the full year, we're raising our earnings per share guidance to a range of $8.59 to $8.69 per share, representing an increase of $0.17 per share from the annual guidance we provided on our first quarter conference call in April and $0.39 per share from the initial annual guidance we provided at the beginning of the year.
As a reminder, our diluted earnings per share guidance for both the third quarter and full year take into account the shares repurchased through yesterday but do not reflect the impact of any potential future share repurchases.
Before I turn the call over to our analyst for questions, I'd like to once again thank the entire O'Reilly team for their continued hard work and dedication to providing consistently high levels of customer service. Congratulations on another record-breaking quarter.
This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I'd like to ask John, the operator, to return to the line, and we'll be happy to answer your questions."

I think that to the extent that we're talking to parts that are increasing in complexity, which is a big part of our business, absent the things that we carry in our display floors, because the types of products that are being used that are electronic oriented, more sensors. Vehicles are in the process now going to direct injection, both diesel and gas. Ignition parts are going to 1 coil per cylinder as oppose to 1 coil for the car. And then newer vehicles have all these life safety sensors, and so forth, that add complexity. We see that driving the cost of repair incrementally up over time. It's hard to forecast what that increase will look like, but that will continue to happen. Net -- all of the things that I just mentioned tend to make us believe and make others believe that the professional business will grow a little better in the coming years than what the DIY business will, simply because this complexity is a challenge for DIY customers. Although, as I've said many times before and as cars originally started having onboard computers, sensors and so forth, I think that the DIY customer out of economic necessity is very adaptable and there's a lot of companies that are out there providing information and tools to help DIY customers be able to work on cars. They have more sensors and more electronics. And for that reason, there's many that bet that the DIY business is going to do pretty well. So that's my comment on that."

And I think that some of the things that we've done over the past 3 or 4 years to put ourselves in a better position to compete on a equivalent service level perspective with the best retailers in the business, I think is attributed to our growth in the DIY business and will continue to do so. The way I view this is we had this big opportunity to do more DIY business just as we have this big opportunity to do more on the do-it-for-me side. Although we, as you've stated, underperformed some of our biggest competitors on the DIY side on a per store basis. And the way I look at this is just like going up a staircase. You take it one step at a time. And we've made a lot of positive changes that I feel like are attributing to our DIY growth, and we'll continue to benefit from those changes. As we see opportunities for things that we might be able to do to grow our DIY business better without infringing on our do-it-for-me business, we'll continue to do that. I think that there's a lot of reasons that we have an opportunity here, partly based on the team members that we have that are just really good parts people. They know cars, they know parts, they know customer service. I think that our availability of product is unsurpassed in our industry, and I think that as DIY customers who maybe did business with one of our competitors previously and maybe you can come into our store lately, I think as they realize that we have this fantastic availability model, I think that just bodes well for us in the future. So I look forward to DIY business to continue to be a significant part of our growth even with the headwind of parts complexity that I was talking about earlier. And as we see things that we need to adjust to make sure we continue to take market share in that side of the business, we'll continue to do so."

So I think we have a lot of business to gain on both sides, and we're less restrictive in the aggressive position that we take on the DIY side now than we ever have been simply because I think that most shops now realize that customers are going to buy parts from someone if they want to work on their own car. They're either going to buy them from one of our competitors or us or maybe even in the -- on the Internet, and that we're going to be completely supportive of them in driving successful businesses for them and making parts available for them.

It's my pleasure to again begin our quarterly call by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another record-breaking quarter, and an extremely successful first three quarters of 2015.
Our team of over 72,000 dedicated team members continues to win business and take market share by providing consistently excellent customer service, evidenced by our third quarter 7.9% comparable store sales increase. In all three quarters of 2015, we've generated comparable store sales growth in excess of 7%, and these results were on top of difficult comparisons as our team has generated a remarkable 8 straight quarters of comparable store sales growth in excess of 5%. This consistently robust top line performance is the direct result of our team's dedication to living the O'Reilly culture of providing incredible levels of service to each of our valued customers. And I want to thank each of our team members for their continued contributions to our company's long-term success.
For the third quarter, we robustly grew our total sales by 10.8%, and with our focus on growing sales profitably and controlling our expenses, we generated our first-ever 20% operating profit quarter. During the quarter, we resolved a historic tax item, which added $0.11 to our quarterly EPS of $2.64. This resolution, while very positive for the company, is not part of our ongoing business so I think the more appropriate number to focus on is an adjusted third quarter EPS of $2.53, which represents, an increase of 23% over the prior year.
I couldn't be more pleased with the consistent efforts of our team members to provide unsurpassed service levels to our customers, as the third quarter of 2015 represents the 27th consecutive quarter of EPS growth in excess of 15%.
The comparable store sales increased 7.9%, strongly exceeded our comparable store sales guidance of 3% to 5%, and our performance was relatively consistent on a month-to-month basis.
The composition of our comparable store sales growth in the third quarter was also very similar to the first two quarters of the year. Both our professional and DIY sides of the business were strong contributors to our comparable store sales growth with professional being slightly higher.
Increases in our comparable transaction count and ticket average contributed equally to our growth, with a larger contribution from our professional ticket count, although, our DIY ticket count growth continues to be strong. The increase in average ticket continues to be driven by the secular industry driver of parts complexity with little-to-no help from increases in selling price as the inflation remains muted.
Our performance for the third quarter, as we've seen over the past 1.5 years, was driven by key categories, such as breaks, driveline, and ride control. Additionally, as some are heated up in July, we were very pleased with our heat-related category, such as HVAC or control, batteries and rotating electrical. Through July, the latest data available, miles driven were up 3.6% through the year, representing 17 straight months of year-over-year increases.  We feel this increase driven by relatively low gas prices and improving employment has been an important factor in fueling our robust comparable store sales growth.
In our business, the fourth quarter can be highly variable based on weather, especially in the second half as consumers focus on holiday shopping. Therefore, we feel it's appropriate to establish our fourth quarter comparable store sales guidance at a range of 3% to 5%. And reflecting on our strong year-to-date sales results, we're increasing our full year comparable store sales guidance to a range of 6.5% to 7.5%.
Based on the strength of our first three quarters results, we're raising our full year operating margin guidance to a range of 18.3% to 18.7% of sales to the range of 18.6% to 18.9% of sales. This guidance range includes the negative impact of the $19 million litigation charge from the second quarter, which we discussed during last quarter's conference call.
We're establishing our fourth quarter earnings per share guidance at a range of $1.97 to $2.01. And based on strong year-to-date results, we're increasing our full year earnings per share guidance from a range of $8.59 to $8.69 to a range of $8.97 to $9.01.
This full year guidance range includes the negative impact of the second quarter litigation charge as well as the positive impact in the third quarter from the resolution of the historical tax item, I discussed earlier, which on a net basis potentially offset 
Before I finish up my prepared comments, I'd like to again thank our team for our record-breaking third quarter results. We remain very confident in the long-term drivers for demand in our industry. And we believe we're very well-positioned to capitalize on this demand by consistently providing industry-leading service to our customers every day at every store.
Again, congratulations to Team O'Reilly for the very strong year-to-date results and the solid start we have to our fourth quarter through this point in October.
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Shaw. Jeff?"

I'd like to begin today by echoing Greg's comments and congratulating Team O'Reilly on another outstanding quarter. I couldn't be more proud of our teams get-it-done attitude that they roll up their sleeves everyday with the focus of providing top-notch customer service and wining our customers business.
Our industry-leading comparable store sales growth of 7.9% for the quarter and 7.4% for the first three quarters of 2015 is a testament to our team of 72,000-plus team members, who are committed to providing consistently excellent customer service as we worked tirelessly to make sure that we've the and most knowledgeable parts stored in every market we serve.
For the quarter, we grew total revenues 10.8% and total gross margin dollars by 12.5% proving yet again that our ability to provide exceptional service, a wide product offering at comparative prices and superior parts availability allows us to generate sustainable, profitable growth. This growth doesn't have without the dedication of our store, D.C. and office support teams.
For the quarter, SG&A 87 basis points on our strong sales performance and average SG&A per store increased 2.9%. For the year, SG&A per store, excluding the unusual litigation item in the second quarter increased 2.3%. As we discussed on the last few calls, our average per store SG&A spend has been higher than we planned at the beginning of the year, however, we've seen the opportunities add hours to the stores to accelerate our share gain.
Based on our strong year-to-date results, we're very pleased with the direction we've taken, but we continue to closely monitor our sales volumes though we'll make the appropriate adjustments to ensure store payroll levels adds to business.
With our strong sales and profitability results, we've also seen a corresponding increase in variable composition throughout the organization as we reward Team Members at every level --

Now we'll take a closer look at our quarterly results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2015. For the quarter, sales increased $203 million, comprised of $145 million increase in comp store sales, $58 million increase in non-comp store sales, $2 million increase in non-comp non-store sales and $2 million decrease from closed stores.
Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we're raising our full year total revenue guidance to a range of $7.85 billion to $7.95 billion. For the quarter, gross margin was 52.4% of sales, and improved 78 basis points over the prior year. This was in line with expectations as positive mix from leverage on distribution costs, offset a higher-than-expected LIFO charge of $5 million, which was a 10 basis -- excuse me, which as 10 basis points less than last year.
Based on our year-to-date results, we're -- our full year gross margin guidance from a range of 51.8% to 52.2% of sales to a range of 52.0% to 52.2% of sales.
Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 33.6% pretax income. During the third quarter of each year, we typically experienced a lower tax rate as we adjust our tax reserves for closed tax period. As Greg mentioned earlier, we had a non-typical tax reserve adjustment this year related to a previous acquisitions. This non-typical adjustment is a non-recurring noncash item, which added $0.11 to our quarterly EPS and lowered our effective tax rate by 2.7% pretax income. Excluding this item, our effective tax rate would have been 36.3%, which is where we thought we would be.  For the fourth quarter, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 37.3% of pretax income.
Now moving on to free cash flow for the components that drove our results from the quarter and our updated guidance and expectations for the full year of 2015. Free cash flow for the quarter was $254 million. Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we're revising our full year guidance for free cash flow to the range of $800 million to $850 million, reflecting an increase of $75 million on both ends of the range.
Inventory per store at the end of the quarter was 576,000, which is 1.5% decrease from the end of 2014. Our ongoing goal is to ensure we grow per store inventory at a lower rate than the  comparable store sales growth generate, and we definitely accomplish that goal through the first three quarters in 2015.
We continue to make great progress in reducing slow-moving and overstock product, and are replacing it with the additional store level inventory of products that are entering the higher demand cycles. However, part of this decrease is timing related to the very strong sales during the first three quarters of the year, and we continue to expect our per-store inventory to increase a little less than 1% per store for the full year.
Our AP to inventory ratio finished the third quarter at 101%. This is the first time our net inventory investment has been negative. We're excited about the accomplishment, but this ratio was aided by seasonality in our extremely strong sales.  As a result, we expect to finish up 2015 at an AP to inventory ration just under 100%.
Capital expenditures for the first 9 months were $296 million, which is a little less than we plan, but we still expect our 2015 CapEx to be within that range of $400 million to $430 million.
Moving on to debt, we finished the third quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.6x, still well below our targeted ratio of 2x to 2.25x. We continue to believe our stated range is appropriate level for our business. And we'll move into this range when the timing is appropriate.
We continue to execute our share repurchase program and from July 1st through yesterday, we repurchased 1.3 million shares of our stock at an average cost of $239.81 per share for a total investment of $305 million. We continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning available cash to shareholders after we take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business at a higher rate of return.  And we'll prudently execute our program with an emphasis on long-term returns for our shareholders.
For the fourth quarter, we're establishing diluted earnings per share guidance of $1.97 to $2.01. Based on our above planned results thus far in 2015, and additional shares as we've purchased since our last call, for the full year, we're raising our guidance to $8.97 to $9.01 per share, representing an increase of $0.35 per share to midpoint from our previously announced guidance.
As a reminder, our diluted earnings per share guidance for both the fourth quarter and full year taking into account, the shares we purchased through yesterday, but did not reflect the impact of any potential future share repurchase.
Finally, I'd like to once again thank the entire O'Reilly team for their continued dedication to the company's success. Congratulations on another outstanding performance in the third quarter.
This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I'd like to ask, the operator return the line, and we'll be happy to answer your questions."

Example would be -- and we were talking about this internally the other day when it comes to vehicle ignitions, for instance, cars just a few years ago, had distributor caps with a -- and each cylinder had a ignition wire, and today most vehicles have a ignition coil on each spark plug. And while the ignition coils are replacing as part of normal vehicle maintenance during a tuneup and the cap and rotor and the ignition wires would have been when those coils fail, they are very expensive. And at higher milages, they fail and -- the trade-off is that we sell a lot fewer units and maybe the frequency of the sale is less. But when we do sell a coil, it's a much more expensive sale. And since there is one on each cylinder, there is several other car. And that kind of thing exists in several -- fuel pumps, used to cars shed in mechanical fuel pumps or a in-line fuel pump going up to the carburetor or throttle body injection, today vehicles have an in-tank fuel pump that acts as not only the fuel pump, but also the fuel gate sending in it. Down in the fuel pumps is a very technical part, they sell for average maybe a couple of hundred dollars a piece, where as the older fuel pumps might sell for $20 to $40 a piece.

And really looking back 3 years, we really didn't spend much time even talking about this, as we've got bigger it's become a little more of a factor with our geographic expansion and so forth. This fall -- most markets have not had really very cold weather yet, and some of -- periods that we compared to you last year, we've cool snaps that might drive short-term demand for batteries or something like that. We not really have that yet in most markets. So that's yet to come. What I would say is that if we have a mild winter, some of the demand that would be created by the a more extreme winter would be for going to be next year if there were parts that were going to fail in the wintertime, or pressure that was put on parts that were -- fail anyway at some point, but didn't have the pressure put on by the cold weather, so that might be kick down the road to maybe the winter of '16 or something like that. So as we've always said, extreme weather is generally good for us. Real cold or real hot causes parts to fail more premature than they would typically, but they're still going to fail. So it's just mid-May push some of the down the road a little bit that we might gain during more extreme weather. I think the -- this year has been pretty normal weather, I think the summer started pretty -- but it turned out being pretty hot in most markets, so we did well in some of the heat-related categories, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks. I think that the gives it average winner, I don't think it was extreme in most markets, and I don't think we benefited as we typically would from the damage that the cars in the extreme cold. And I'd expect in many markets would have some version of a cold winter this year, although, I know that there's could be some effort from this So that would be my comment. I don't think it's a major factor to consider. I think it -- the economic issues that we discussed relative to gas prices, miles driven, the health of the consumer and as pointed rates improving or powerful typically been what the weather would be."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts Third Quarter Conference Call.

David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman; and Greg Johnson, our Executive Vice President of Supply Chain, are also present.
It's my pleasure to again begin our quarterly call by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another record-breaking quarter, and an extremely successful first 3 quarters of 2015.
Our team of over 72,000 dedicated team members continues to win business and take market share by providing consistently excellent customer service, evidenced by our third quarter 7.9% comparable store sales increase. 
In all 3 quarters of 2015, we have generated comparable store sales growth in excess of 7%, and these results were on top of difficult comparisons as our team has generated a remarkable 8 straight quarters of comparable store sales growth in excess of 5%. 
This consistently robust top line performance is the direct result of our team's dedication to living the O'Reilly culture of providing incredible levels of service to each of our valued customers, and I want to thank each of our team members for their continued contributions to our company's long-term success.
For the third quarter, we robustly grew our total sales by 10.8%, and with our focus on growing sales profitably and controlling our expenses, we generated our first-ever 20% operating profit quarter. 
During the quarter, we resolved a historic tax item, which added $0.11 to our quarterly EPS of $2.64. This resolution, while very positive for the company, is not part of our ongoing business so I think the more appropriate number to focus on is an adjusted third quarter EPS of $2.53, which represents, an increase of 23% over the prior year.
I couldn't be more pleased with the consistent efforts of our team members to provide unsurpassed service levels to our customers, as the third quarter of 2015 represents the 27th consecutive quarter of EPS growth in excess of 15%.
The comparable store sales increase of 7.9% strongly exceeded our comparable store sales guidance of 3% to 5%, and our performance was relatively consistent on a month-to-month basis.
The composition of our comparable store sales growth in the third quarter was also very similar to the first 2 quarters of the year. Both our professional and DIY sides of the business were strong contributors to our comparable store sales growth with professional being slightly higher.
Increases in our comparable transaction count and ticket average contributed equally to our growth, with a larger contribution from our professional ticket count, although, our DIY ticket count growth continues to be strong. The increase in average ticket continues to be driven by the secular industry driver of parts complexity with little to no help from increases in selling price as the inflation remains muted.
Our performance for the third quarter, as we've seen over the past 1.5 years, was driven by key hard part categories, such as brakes, driveline, chassis and ride control. Additionally, as some are heated up in July, we were very pleased with our heat-related category, such as HVAC or temp control, batteries and rotating electrical. 
Through July, the latest data available, miles driven were up 3.6% for the year, representing 17 straight months of year-over-year increases. We feel this increase driven by relatively low gas prices and improving employment has been important factors in fueling our robust comparable store sales growth.
In our business, the fourth quarter can be highly variable based on weather, especially in the second half as consumers focus on holiday shopping. Therefore, we feel it's appropriate to establish our fourth quarter comparable store sales guidance at a range of 3% to 5%. And reflecting on our strong year-to-date sales results, we are increasing our full year comparable store sales guidance to a range of 6.5% to 7%.
Based on the strength of our first 3 quarters results, we are raising our full year operating margin guidance from a range of 18.3% to 18.7% of sales to a range of 18.6% to 18.9% of sales. This guidance range includes the negative impact of the $19 million litigation charge from the second quarter, which we discussed during last quarter's conference call.
We are establishing our fourth quarter earnings per share guidance at a range of $1.97 to $2.01. And based on our strong year-to-date results, we are increasing our full year earnings per share guidance from a range of $8.59 to $8.69 to a range of $8.97 to $9.01.
This full year guidance range includes the negative impact of the second quarter litigation charge as well as the positive impact in the third quarter from the resolution of the historical tax item I discussed earlier, which on a net basis essentially offset one another.
Before I finish up my prepared comments, I would like to again thank our team for our record-breaking third quarter results. We remain very confident in the long-term drivers for demand in our industry, and we believe we are very well-positioned to capitalize on this demand by consistently providing industry-leading service to our customers every day at every store.
Again, congratulations to Team O'Reilly for the very strong year-to-date results and the solid start we have to our fourth quarter through this point in October.
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Shaw. Jeff?"

I would like to begin today by echoing Greg's comments and congratulating Team O'Reilly on another outstanding quarter. I couldn't be more proud of our team's get-it-done attitude that they roll up their sleeves everyday with the focus of providing top-notch customer service and wining our customers business.
Our industry-leading comparable store sales growth of 7.9% for the quarter and 7.4% for the first 3 quarters of 2015 is a testament to our team of 72,000-plus team members, who are committed to providing consistently excellent customer service as we worked tirelessly to make sure that we're the friendliest and most knowledgeable parts store in every market we serve.
For the quarter, we grew total revenues 10.8% and total gross margin dollars by 12.5% proving yet again that our ability to provide exceptional service, a wide product offering at comparative prices and superior parts availability allows us to generate sustainable, profitable growth. This growth doesn't happen without the dedication of our store, DC and office support teams.
For the quarter, SG&A levered; 87 basis points on our strong sales performance and average SG&A per store increased 2.9%. For the year, SG&A per store, excluding the unusual litigation item in the second quarter increased 2.3%. As we discussed on the last few calls, our average per store SG&A spend has been higher than we planned at the beginning of the year, however, we've seen the opportunities add hours to the stores to accelerate our share gain.
Based on our strong year-to-date results, we're very pleased with the direction we've taken, but we continue to closely monitor our sales volumes and we'll make the appropriate adjustments to ensure store payroll levels adds to business.
With our strong sales and profitability results, we've also seen a corresponding increase in variable compensation throughout the organization as we reward team members at every level of the company for running their business like they own it. For the year, we now expect average SG&A per store to increase approximately 2.25%.
We successfully opened 58 net new stores during the quarter, and we continue to be very pleased with the performance from our new stores. During the quarter, we'll be opening stores in 27 different states, with the highest concentration in the Great Lakes area, which is primarily based on the weather maintaining development time frames.
For the year, we're confident we'll hit our target of 205 net new stores. For 2016, we expect to open 210 net new stores spread across our existing footprint and in new markets.
Our ability to provide consistently excellent service at the stores is supported by our industry-leading parts availability, and I'd like to thank our supply chain groups for the great service levels they provide to our stores.
We're constantly evaluating stocking levels, expediting product and higher-than-planned sales,  filling in on backorder product, modifying routes to handle higher freight volumes, and continually monitoring and adjusting our hub, DC city counter and weekend routes to ensure we have the best availability in each market we serve. 
The knowledge and dedication of our supply chain team is a critical contributor to our 7.4% year-to-date comparable store sales gain and is critical to our future ability to continue to grow market share. On that front, we continue to be on pace to open our San Antonio, Texas DC in the second quarter of 2016.
We've had a great year so far and we are well-positioned to continue to provide our customers exceptional service levels and the best parts availability in the industry, so that we finish up the year strong. 
That said, we could never rest on our past successes and we have to go out and earn the business each and every day by out-hustling and out-servicing our competitors, and I'm confident in our team's ability to do just that. Great job, Team O'Reilly.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Now, we'll take a closer look at our quarterly results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2015. For the quarter, sales increased $203 million, comprised of $145 million increase in comp store sales, a $58 million increase in non-comp store sales, a $2 million increase in non-comp non-store sales and a $2 million decrease from closed stores.
Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we are raising our full year total revenue guidance to a range of $7.85 billion to $7.95 billion. For the quarter, gross margin was 52.4% of sales, and improved 78 basis points over the prior year. This was in line with our expectations as positive mix from leverage on distribution costs, offset a higher-than-expected LIFO charge of $5 million, which was a 10 basis -- excuse me, which was 10 basis points less than last year.
Based on our year-to-date results, we're tightening our full year gross margin guidance from a range of 51.8% to 52.2% of sales to a range of 52.0% to 52.2% of sales.
Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 33.6% pretax income. During the third quarter of each year, we typically experience a lower tax rate as we adjust our tax reserves for the disclosed tax period. And as Greg mentioned earlier, we had a non-typical tax reserve adjustment this year related to a previous acquisition. 
This non-typical adjustment is a non-recurring noncash item, which added $0.11 to our quarterly EPS and lowered our effective tax rate by 2.7% pretax income. Excluding this item, our effective tax rate would have been 36.3%, which is where we thought we would be. For the fourth quarter, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 37.3% of pretax income.
Now moving on to free cash flow for the components that drove our results from the quarter and our updated guidance expectations for the full year of 2015. Free cash flow for the quarter was $254 million. Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we are revising our full year guidance for free cash flow to a range of $800 million to $850 million, reflecting an increase of $75 million on both ends of the range.
Inventory per store at the end of the quarter was $576,000, which is 1.5% decrease from the end of 2014. Our ongoing goal is to ensure we grow per store inventory at a lower rate than the  comparable store sales growth we generate, and we definitely accomplished that goal through the first 3 quarters in 2015.
We continue to make great progress in reducing slow-moving and overstock product, and are replacing it with additional store level inventory of products that are entering the higher demand cycles. 
However, part of this decrease is timing related to the very strong sales during the first 3 quarters of the year, and we continue to expect our per-store inventory to increase a little less than 1% per store for the full year.
Our AP to inventory ratio finished the third quarter at 101%. This is the first time our net inventory investment has been negative. We're excited about the accomplishment, but this ratio was aided by seasonality in our extremely strong sales. As a result, we expect to finish up 2015 at an AP to inventory ratio just under 100%.
Capital expenditures for the first 9 months were $296 million, which is a little less than we planned, but we still expect our 2015 CapEx to be within the range of $400 million to $430 million.
Moving on to debt, we finished the third quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.6x, still well below our targeted ratio of 2x to 2.25x. We continue to believe our stated range is the appropriate level for our business, and we will move into this range when the timing is appropriate.
We continue to execute our share repurchase program, and from July 1 through yesterday, we repurchased 1.3 million shares of our stock at an average cost of $239.81 per share for a total investment of $305 million. 
We continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning available cash to our shareholders after we take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business at a higher rate of return, and we will prudently execute our program with an emphasis on long-term returns for our shareholders.
For the fourth quarter, we're establishing diluted earnings per share guidance of $1.97 to $2.01. Based on our above planned results thus far in 2015 and additional shares as repurchased since our last call, for the full year, we're raising our guidance to $8.97 to $9.01 per share, representing an increase of $0.35 per share at the midpoint from our previously announced guidance.
As a reminder, our diluted earnings per share guidance for both the fourth quarter and full year taking into account the shares repurchased through yesterday, but do not reflect the impact of any potential future share repurchases.
Finally, I'd like to once again thank the entire O'Reilly team for their continued dedication to the company's success. Congratulations on another outstanding performance in the third quarter.
This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I'd like to ask Ethan, the operator, to return to the line, and we'll be happy to answer your questions."

An example would be -- and we were talking about this internally the other day when it comes to vehicle ignitions. For instance, cars, just a few years ago, had distributor caps with a rotor and each cylinder had a ignition wire. And today, most vehicles have a ignition coil on each spark plug. And while the ignition coils aren't replaced as a part of normal vehicle maintenance during a tune-up and the cap and rotor and the ignition wires would have been, when those coils fail, they're very expensive, and at higher milages they fail and -- the trade-off is that we sell a lot fewer units and maybe the frequency of the sale is less. But when we do sell a coil, it's a much more expensive sale. And since there's one on each cylinder, there is several of them on a car. And that kind of thing exists in several different areas. Fuel pumps used to -- cars had mechanical fuel pumps or a in-line fuel pump going up to the carburetor or throttle body injection. Today, vehicles have an in-tank fuel pump that acts as not only the fuel pump, but also the fuel gauge sending unit down in the fuel pump. It's a very technical part. They sell for, on average, maybe a couple of hundred dollars a piece, whereas the older fuel pumps might sell for $20 to $40 a piece. So while they are good products, maybe don't fail as often as the old mechanical pumps or the in-line pumps. They're more expensive when they do."

So we have -- we hadn't posted the extremely strong comps that we have then we wouldn't have that ratio. When we look at long term, we continue to have some opportunities to extend some of our suppliers, but I think the key for us now is to really focus on what our inventory turns are as we talked about in the prepared remarks to make sure: a, that we have the right products in the stores that are moving to provide direct customer service tiered throughout our layers to optimize that, but really to work on to where do we have inventory deployed that we're not getting a return, and how do we adjust that.

It's become a little more of a factor with our geographic expansion and so forth. This fall, most markets have not had really very cold weather yet, and some of the periods that we compared to you last year, we have cold snaps that might drive short-term demand for batteries or something like that. We not really had that yet in most markets so that's yet to come. What I would say is that if we have a mild winter, some of the demand that would be created by the -- a more extreme winter would be deferred a little bit. It would go into maybe next year if there were parts that were going to fail in the wintertime or pressure that was put on parts that were going to fail anyway at some point, but didn't have the pressure put on by the cold weather, so that might be kicked down the road to maybe the winter of '16 or something like that. So as we've always said, extreme weather is generally good for us. Real cold, real hot causes parts to fail more premature than they would typically, but they're still going to fail. So it's just may push some of it down the road a little bit that we might gain during more extreme weather. I think the -- this year has been pretty normal weather, I think that the summer started out pretty mild, but it turned out being pretty hot in most markets, so we did well in some of the heat-related categories as I mentioned in our prepared remarks. I think that the average winter, I don't think it was extreme in most markets, and I think we benefited as we typically would from the damage that's done to cars in the extreme cold. And I would expect that many markets would have some version of a cold winter this year, although, I know that there's -- there could be some effect from this El Niño. So that would be my comment. I don't think it's a major factor to consider. And I think that the economic issues that we discussed relative to gas prices, miles driven, the health of the consumer, employment rates improving are more powerful typically than what the weather would be."

And then, of course, the O'Rewards program, which we now have over 18 million enrolled customers, and we're averaging 120, 125 a week new enrollees. So all those things are contributors. And then, of course, the economy improving, miles driven are improving our big contributors also to just the demand for parts retail. It's really hard for us to know.

I think the services that we provide that we didn't provide previously, it's -- I'm glad we're providing them now. We probably should have done a little earlier. And the staffing is just something that we've focused on for a long time and we've just gotten better and better at it.

All of this are subject to just the macro backdrop and the business that the automotive aftermarket is doing, and right now, it's pretty robust. So some portion of the 7.9% comp and the 7.4% comp we've had for the year is a result of the market being pretty robust.

Our distribution is pretty highly variable, but there will be pressure on those fixed costs. When we look at the store cost, it's a difficult question to answer. When we look at what our SG&A was per store with high sales volumes, we're staffed up to meet that. We're probably running overtime because of the amount of business we have. We have a higher achievement of variable compensation and we're running a lot more trucks, burning a lot more fuel, so all of those costs are very variable. But obviously, there's some portion of payroll and there's occupancy costs that are fixed that we're levering. So at a lower comp, we're not going to -- all other things equal, we're not going to put up the operating profit we did this quarter.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts Third Quarter Conference Call. Participating on the call with me this morning is, of course, Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Shaw, our Executive Vice President of Store Operations and Sales. David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman; and Greg Johnson, our Executive Vice President of Supply Chain, are also present.
It's my pleasure to again begin our quarterly call by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another record-breaking quarter, and an extremely successful first 3 quarters of 2015.
Our team of over 72,000 dedicated team members continues to win business and take market share by providing consistently excellent customer service, evidenced by our third quarter 7.9% comparable store sales increase. 
In all 3 quarters of 2015, we have generated comparable store sales growth in excess of 7%, and these results are on top of difficult comparisons as our team has generated a remarkable 8 straight quarters of comparable store sales growth in excess of 5%. 
This consistently robust top line performance is the direct result of our team's dedication to living the O'Reilly culture of providing incredible levels of service to each of our valued customers, and I want to thank each of our team members for their continued contributions to our company's long-term success.
For the third quarter, we robustly grew our total sales by 10.8%, and with our focus on growing sales profitably and controlling our expenses, we generated our first-ever 20% operating profit quarter. 
During the quarter, we resolved a historic tax item, which added $0.11 to our quarterly EPS of $2.64. This resolution, while very positive for the company, is not part of our ongoing business so I think the more appropriate number to focus on is an adjusted third quarter EPS of $2.53, which represents, an increase of 23% over the prior year.
I couldn't be more pleased with the consistent efforts of our team members to provide unsurpassed service levels to our customers, as the third quarter of 2015 represents the 27th consecutive quarter of EPS growth in excess of 15%.
The comparable store sales increase of 7.9% strongly exceeded our comparable store sales guidance of 3% to 5%, and our performance was relatively consistent on a month-to-month basis.
The composition of our comparable store sales growth in the third quarter was also very similar to the first 2 quarters of the year. Both our professional and DIY sides of the business were strong contributors to our comparable store sales growth with professional being slightly higher.
Increases in our comparable transaction count and ticket average contributed equally to our growth, with a larger contribution from our professional ticket count, although, our DIY ticket count growth continues to be strong. The increase in average ticket continues to be driven by the secular industry driver of parts complexity with little to no help from increases in selling price as inflation remains muted.
Our performance for the third quarter, as we've seen over the past 1.5 years, was driven by key hard part categories, such as brakes, driveline, chassis and ride control. Additionally, as summer heated up in July, we were very pleased with our heat-related category, such as HVAC or temp control, batteries and rotating electrical. 
Through July, the latest data available, miles driven were up 3.6% for the year, representing 17 straight months of year-over-year increases. We feel this increase driven by relatively low gas prices and improving employment has been important factors in fueling our robust comparable store sales growth.
In our business, the fourth quarter can be highly variable based on weather, especially in the second half as consumers focus on holiday shopping. Therefore, we feel it's appropriate to establish our fourth quarter comparable store sales guidance at a range of 3% to 5%. And reflecting on our strong year-to-date sales results, we are increasing our full year comparable store sales guidance to a range of 6.5% to 7%.
Based on the strength of our first 3 quarters results, we are raising our full year operating margin guidance from a range of 18.3% to 18.7% of sales to a range of 18.6% to 18.9% of sales. This guidance range includes the negative impact of the $19 million litigation charge from the second quarter, which we discussed during last quarter's conference call.
We are establishing our fourth quarter earnings per share guidance at a range of $1.97 to $2.01. And based on our strong year-to-date results, we are increasing our full year earnings per share guidance from a range of $8.59 to $8.69 to a range of $8.97 to $9.01.
This full-year guidance range includes the negative impact of the second quarter litigation charge as well as the positive impact in the third quarter from the resolution of the historical tax item I discussed earlier, which on a net basis essentially offset one another.
Before I finish up my prepared comments, I would like to again thank our team for our record-breaking third quarter results. We remain very confident in the long-term drivers for demand in our industry, and we believe we are very well-positioned to capitalize on this demand by consistently providing industry-leading service to our customers every day at every store.
Again, congratulations to Team O'Reilly for the very strong year-to-date results and the solid start we have to our fourth quarter through this point in October.
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Shaw. Jeff?"

I would like to begin today by echoing Greg's comments and congratulating Team O'Reilly on another outstanding quarter. I couldn't be more proud of our team's get-it-done attitude that they roll up their sleeves everyday with the focus of providing top-notch customer service and wining our customers business.
Our industry-leading comparable store sales growth of 7.9% for the quarter and 7.4% for the first 3 quarters of 2015 is a testament to our team of 72,000-plus team members, who are committed to providing consistently excellent customer service as we worked tirelessly to make sure that we're the friendliest and most knowledgeable parts store in every market we serve.
For the quarter, we grew total revenues 10.8% and total gross margin dollars by 12.5% proving yet again that our ability to provide exceptional service, a wide product offering at comparative prices and superior parts availability allows us to generate sustainable, profitable growth. This growth doesn't happen without the dedication of our store, DC [ph] and office support teams.
For the quarter, SG&A levered 87 basis points on our strong sales performance and average SG&A per store increased 2.9%. For the year, SG&A per store, excluding the unusual litigation item in the second quarter, increased 2.3%. As we discussed on the last few calls, our average per store SG&A spend has been higher than we planned at the beginning of the year, however, we've seen the opportunities add hours to the stores to accelerate our share gain.
Based on our strong year-to-date results, we're very pleased with the direction we've taken, but we continue to closely monitor our sales volumes and we'll make the appropriate adjustments to ensure store payroll levels adds to business.
With our strong sales and profitability results, we've also seen a corresponding increase in variable compensation throughout the organization as we reward team members at every level of the company for running their business like they own it. For the year, we now expect average SG&A per store to increase approximately 2.25%.
We successfully opened 58 net new stores during the quarter, and we continue to be very pleased with the performance from our new stores. During the quarter, we opened stores in 27 different states, with the highest concentration in the Great Lakes area, which is primarily based on the weather maintaining development time frames.
For the year, we're confident we'll hit our target of 205 net new stores. For 2016, we expect to open 210 net new stores spread across our existing footprint and in new markets.
Our ability to provide consistently excellent service at the stores is supported by our industry-leading parts availability, and I'd like to thank our supply chain groups for the great service levels they provide to our stores.
We're constantly evaluating stocking levels, expediting product and higher-than-planned sales,  filling in on backorder product, modifying routes to handle higher freight volumes, and continually monitoring and adjusting our hub, DC city counter and weekend routes to ensure we have the best availability in each market we serve. 
The knowledge and dedication of our supply chain team is a critical contributor to our 7.4% year-to-date comparable store sales gain and is critical to our future ability to continue to grow market share. On that front, we continue to be on pace to open our San Antonio, Texas DC in the second quarter of 2016.
We've had a great year so far and we are well-positioned to continue to provide our customers exceptional service levels and the best parts availability in the industry, so that we finish up the year strong. 
That said, we could never rest on our past successes and we have to go out and earn the business each and every day by out-hustling and out-servicing our competitors, and I'm confident in our team's ability to do just that. Great job, Team O'Reilly.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Now, we'll take a closer look at our quarterly results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2015. For the quarter, sales increased $203 million, comprised of $145 million increase in comp store sales, a $58 million increase in non-comp store sales, a $2 million increase in non-comp non-store sales and a $2 million decrease from closed stores.
Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we are raising our full year total revenue guidance to a range of $7.85 billion to $7.95 billion. For the quarter, gross margin was 52.4% of sales, and improved 78 basis points over the prior year. This was in line with our expectations as positive mix from leverage on distribution costs, offset a higher-than-expected LIFO charge of $5 million, which was a 10 basis -- excuse me, which was 10 basis points less than last year.
Based on our year-to-date results, we're tightening our full year gross margin guidance from a range of 51.8% to 52.2% of sales to a range of 52.0% to 52.2% of sales.
Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 33.6% pretax income. During the third quarter of each year, we typically experience a lower tax rate as we adjust our tax reserves for the disclosed tax period. And as Greg mentioned earlier, we had a non-typical tax reserve adjustment this year related to a previous acquisition. 
This non-typical adjustment is a non-recurring noncash item, which added $0.11 to our quarterly EPS and lowered our effective tax rate by 2.7% of pretax income. Excluding this item, our effective tax rate would have been 36.3%, which is where we thought we would be. For the fourth quarter, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 37.3% of pretax income.
Now moving on to free cash flow for the components that drove our results from the quarter and our updated guidance expectations for the full year of 2015. Free cash flow for the quarter was $254 million. Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we are revising our full year guidance for free cash flow to a range of $800 million to $850 million, reflecting an increase of $75 million on both ends of the range.
Inventory per store at the end of the quarter was $576,000, which is 1.5% decrease from the end of 2014. Our ongoing goal is to ensure we grow per store inventory at a lower rate than the  comparable store sales growth we generate, and we definitely accomplished that goal through the first 3 quarters in 2015.
We continue to make great progress in reducing slow-moving and overstock product, and replacing it with additional store level inventory of products that are entering the higher demand cycles. 
However, part of this decrease is timing related to the very strong sales during the first 3 quarters of the year, and we continue to expect our per-store inventory to increase a little less than 1% per store for the full year.
Our AP to inventory ratio finished the third quarter at 101%. This is the first time our net inventory investment has been negative. We're excited about the accomplishment, but this ratio was aided by seasonality in our extremely strong sales. As a result, we expect to finish up 2015 at an AP to inventory ratio just under 100%.
Capital expenditures for the first 9 months were $296 million, which is a little less than we planned, but we still expect our 2015 CapEx to be within the range of $400 million to $430 million.
Moving on to debt, we finished the third quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.6x, still well below our targeted ratio of 2x to 2.25x. We continue to believe our stated range is the appropriate level for our business, and we will move into this range when the timing is appropriate.
We continue to execute our share repurchase program, and from July 1 through yesterday, we repurchased 1.3 million shares of our stock at an average cost of $239.81 per share for a total investment of $305 million. 
We continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning available cash to our shareholders after we take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business at a higher rate of return, and we will prudently execute our program with an emphasis on long-term returns for our shareholders.
For the fourth quarter, we're establishing diluted earnings per share guidance of $1.97 to $2.01. Based on our above planned results thus far in 2015 and additional shares as repurchased since our last call, for the full year, we're raising our guidance to $8.97 to $9.01 per share, representing an increase of $0.35 per share at the midpoint from our previously announced guidance.
As a reminder, our diluted earnings per share guidance for both the fourth quarter and full year taking into account the shares repurchased through yesterday, but do not reflect the impact of any potential future share repurchases.
Finally, I'd like to once again thank the entire O'Reilly team for their continued dedication to the company's success. Congratulations on another outstanding performance in the third quarter.
This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I'd like to ask Ethan, the operator, to return to the line, and we'll be happy to answer your questions."

Cars continue to increase in complexity. There's a lot of technology that's being deployed in cars that wasn't a few years ago, and I would expect that continue -- to continue to increase. An example would be -- and we were talking about this internally the other day when it comes to vehicle ignitions. For instance, cars, just a few years ago, had distributor caps with a rotor and each cylinder had an ignition wire. And today, most vehicles have an ignition coil on each spark plug. And while the ignition coils aren't replaced as a part of normal vehicle maintenance during a tune-up and the cap and rotor and the ignition wires would have been, when those coils fail, they're very expensive, and at higher milages they fail and -- the trade-off is there we sell a lot fewer units and maybe the frequency of the sale is less. But when we do sell a coil, it's a much more expensive sale. And since there's one on each cylinder, there is several of them on a car. And that kind of thing exists in several different areas. Fuel pumps used to be cars had mechanical fuel pumps or a in-line fuel pump going up to the carburetor or throttle body injection. Today, vehicles have an in-tank fuel pump that acts as not only the fuel pump, but also the fuel gauge sending unit down in the fuel pump. It's a very technical part. They sell for, on average, maybe a couple of hundred dollars a piece, whereas the older fuel pumps might sell for $20 to $40 a piece. So while they are good products, maybe don't fail as often as the old mechanical pumps or the in-line pumps, they're more expensive when they do."

It's become a little more of a factor with our geographic expansion and so forth. This fall, most markets have not had really very cold weather yet, and some of the periods that we compared to last year, we have cold snaps that might drive short-term demand for batteries or something like that. We've not really had that yet in most markets so that's yet to come. What I would say is that if we have a mild winter, some of the demand that would be created by the -- a more extreme winter would be deferred a little bit. It would go into maybe next year if there were parts that were going to fail in the wintertime or pressure that was put on parts that were going to fail anyway at some point, but didn't have the pressure put on by the cold weather, so that might be kicked down the road to maybe the winter of '16 or something like that. So as we've always said, extreme weather is generally good for us. Real cold, real hot causes parts to fail more premature than they would typically, but they're still going to fail. So it just may push some of it down the road a little bit that we might gain during more extreme weather. I think the -- this year has been pretty normal weather, I think that the summer started out pretty mild, but it turned out being pretty hot in most markets, so we did well in some of the heat-related categories as I mentioned in our prepared remarks. I think that the average winter, I don't think it was extreme in most markets, and I think we benefited as we typically would from the damage that's done to cars in the extreme cold. And I would expect that many markets would have some version of a cold winter this year, although, I know that there's -- there could be some effect from this El Niño. So that would be my comment. I don't think it's a major factor to consider. And I think that the economic issues that we discussed relative to gas prices, miles driven, the health of the consumer, employment rates improving are more powerful typically than what the weather would be."

So we're always -- because of our history and our experience in all the fourth quarters that we've lived through, we know that fourth quarter is the most variable. And for that reason, we're -- we generally are pretty conservative, but -- and we even put more emphasis on our conservatism going into the fourth quarter as a result of the knowledge we have of the potential variability coming into the holiday season."

Well, what I would tell you is that when we assessed the IP, we were pretty skeptical and concerned of having stores with shops that joined, and we kind of worked out how we would do that, and to this point, we've been pleased with our results. It was certainly a challenge because our competitors use the fact that we're attached to a shop as a means to imply that there's some partnerships that might be unfair to the other professional customers that we provide parts to, which is not the case, and we make it very transparent and clear that that's not the case. But VIP, and John Corp, the owner, they've been great partners of ours, and I think both businesses have done well, and we're reasonably comfortable there. I can tell you that our business continues to grow robustly in those stores. We're coming off from a small base, but if you look to the percentages, boy, it's -- you'd be impressed if I told you what it was, which I'm not going to. But the -- talking about Pep Boys, I think that it's a lot different situation because of the size of it for one thing, but then also the amount of square feet, but what I would say is that if given the opportunity to look at that, we would assess that in due course just like we would any other opportunity and decide whether it made sense for us and what parts of it worked and what parts of it didn't and all those things.

When we look at what our SG&A was per store with high sales volumes, we're staffed up to meet that. We're probably running overtime because of the amount of business we have. We have a higher achievement of variable compensation and we're running a lot more trucks, burning a lot more fuel, so all of those costs are very variable.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts Third Quarter Conference Call.

David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman; and Greg Johnson, our Executive Vice President of Supply Chain, are also present.
It's my pleasure to again begin our quarterly call by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another record-breaking quarter, and an extremely successful first 3 quarters of 2015.
Our team of over 72,000 dedicated team members continues to win business and take market share by providing consistently excellent customer service, evidenced by our third quarter 7.9% comparable store sales increase. 
In all 3 quarters of 2015, we have generated comparable store sales growth in excess of 7%, and these results are on top of difficult comparisons as our team has generated a remarkable 8 straight quarters of comparable store sales growth in excess of 5%. 
This consistently robust top line performance is the direct result of our team's dedication to living the O'Reilly culture of providing incredible levels of service to each of our valued customers, and I want to thank each of our team members for their continued contributions to our company's long-term success.
For the third quarter, we robustly grew our total sales by 10.8%, and with our focus on growing sales profitably and controlling our expenses, we generated our first-ever 20% operating profit quarter. 
During the quarter, we resolved a historic tax item, which added $0.11 to our quarterly EPS of $2.64. This resolution, while very positive for the company, is not part of our ongoing business so I think the more appropriate number to focus on is an adjusted third quarter EPS of $2.53, which represents, an increase of 23% over the prior year.
I couldn't be more pleased with the consistent efforts of our team members to provide unsurpassed service levels to our customers, as the third quarter of 2015 represents the 27th consecutive quarter of EPS growth in excess of 15%.
The comparable store sales increase of 7.9% strongly exceeded our comparable store sales guidance of 3% to 5%, and our performance was relatively consistent on a month-to-month basis.
The composition of our comparable store sales growth in the third quarter was also very similar to the first 2 quarters of the year. Both our professional and DIY sides of the business were strong contributors to our comparable store sales growth with professional being slightly higher.
Increases in our comparable transaction count and ticket average contributed equally to our growth, with a larger contribution from our professional ticket count, although, our DIY ticket count growth continues to be strong. The increase in average ticket continues to be driven by the secular industry driver of parts complexity with little to no help from increases in selling price as  inflation remains muted.
Our performance for the third quarter, as we've seen over the past 1.5 years, was driven by key hard part categories, such as brakes, driveline, chassis and ride control. Additionally, as summer  heated up in July, we were very pleased with our heat-related category, such as HVAC or temp control, batteries and rotating electrical. 
Through July, the latest data available, miles driven were up 3.6% for the year, representing 17 straight months of year-over-year increases. We feel this increase driven by relatively low gas prices and improving employment has been important factors in fueling our robust comparable store sales growth.
In our business, the fourth quarter can be highly variable based on weather, especially in the second half as consumers focus on holiday shopping. Therefore, we feel it's appropriate to establish our fourth quarter comparable store sales guidance at a range of 3% to 5%. And reflecting on our strong year-to-date sales results, we are increasing our full year comparable store sales guidance to a range of 6.5% to 7%.
  Based on the strength of our first 3 quarters results, we are raising our full year operating margin guidance from a range of 18.3% to 18.7% of sales to a range of 18.6% to 18.9% of sales. This guidance range includes the negative impact of the $19 million litigation charge from the second quarter, which we discussed during last quarter's conference call.
We are establishing our fourth quarter earnings per share guidance at a range of $1.97 to $2.01. And based on our strong year-to-date results, we are increasing our full year earnings per share guidance from a range of $8.59 to $8.69 to a range of $8.97 to $9.01.
This full-year  guidance range includes the negative impact of the second quarter litigation charge as well as the positive impact in the third quarter from the resolution of the historical tax item I discussed earlier, which on a net basis essentially offset one another.
Before I finish up my prepared comments, I would like to again thank our team for our record-breaking third quarter results. We remain very confident in the long-term drivers for demand in our industry, and we believe we are very well-positioned to capitalize on this demand by consistently providing industry-leading service to our customers every day at every store.
Again, congratulations to Team O'Reilly for the very strong year-to-date results and the solid start we have to our fourth quarter through this point in October.
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Shaw. Jeff?"

I would like to begin today by echoing Greg's comments and congratulating Team O'Reilly on another outstanding quarter. I couldn't be more proud of our team's get-it-done attitude that they roll up their sleeves every day with the focus of providing top-notch customer service and winning our customers business.
Our industry-leading comparable store sales growth of 7.9% for the quarter and 7.4% for the first 3 quarters of 2015 is a testament to our team of 72,000-plus team members, who are committed to providing consistently excellent customer service as we worked tirelessly to make sure that we're the friendliest and most knowledgeable parts store in every market we serve.
For the quarter, we grew total revenues 10.8% and total gross margin dollars by 12.5% proving yet again that our ability to provide exceptional service, a wide product offering at competitive prices and superior parts availability allows us to generate sustainable, profitable growth. This growth doesn't happen without the dedication of our store, DC [ph] and office support teams.
For the quarter, SG&A levered 87 basis points on our strong sales performance and average SG&A per store increased 2.9%. For the year, SG&A per store, excluding the unusual litigation item in the second quarter, increased 2.3%. As we discussed on the last few calls, our average per store SG&A spend has been higher than we planned at the beginning of the year, however, we've seen the opportunities to add hours to the stores to accelerate our share gain.
Based on our strong year-to-date results, we're very pleased with the direction we've taken, but we continue to closely monitor our sales volumes and we'll make the appropriate adjustments to ensure store payroll levels adds to business.
With our strong sales and profitability results, we've also seen a corresponding increase in variable compensation throughout the organization as we reward team members at every level of the company for running their business like they own it. For the year, we now expect average SG&A per store to increase approximately 2.25%.
We successfully opened 58 net new stores during the quarter, and we continue to be very pleased with the performance from our new stores. During the quarter, we opened  stores in 27 different states, with the highest concentration in the Great Lakes area, which is primarily based on the weather-dictating development time frames.
For the year, we're confident we'll hit our target of 205 net new stores. For 2016, we expect to open 210 net new stores spread across our existing footprint and in new markets.
Our ability to provide consistently excellent service at the stores is supported by our industry-leading parts availability, and I'd like to thank our supply chain groups for the great service levels they provide to our stores.
We're constantly evaluating stocking levels, expediting products with higher-than-planned sales,  filling in on backorder product, modifying routes to handle higher freight volumes, and continually monitoring and adjusting our hub, DC city counter and weekend routes to ensure we have the best availability in each market we serve. 
The knowledge and dedication of our supply chain team is a critical contributor to our 7.4% year-to-date comparable store sales gain and is critical to our future ability to continue to grow market share. On that front, we continue to be on pace to open our San Antonio, Texas DC in the second quarter of 2016.
  We've had a great year so far and we are well-positioned to continue to provide our customers exceptional service levels and the best parts availability in the industry, so that we finish up the year strong. 
That said, we could never rest on our past successes and we have to go out and earn the business each and every day by out-hustling and out-servicing our competitors, and I'm confident in our team's ability to do just that. Great job, Team O'Reilly.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom."
324289,312658341,919383,"O'Reilly Automotive Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff.

Now, we'll take a closer look at our quarterly results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2015. For the quarter, sales increased $203 million, comprised of $145 million increase in comp store sales, a $58 million increase in non-comp store sales, a $2 million increase in non-comp non-store sales and a $2 million decrease from closed stores.
Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we are raising our full year total revenue guidance to a range of $7.85 billion to $7.95 billion. For the quarter, gross margin was 52.4% of sales, and improved 78 basis points over the prior year. This was in line with our expectations as positive mix and leverage on distribution costs, offset a higher-than-expected LIFO charge of $5 million, which was a 10 basis -- excuse me, which was 10 basis points less than last year.
Based on our year-to-date results, we're tightening our full year gross margin guidance from a range of 51.8% to 52.2% of sales to a range of 52.0% to 52.2% of sales.
Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 33.6% pretax income. During the third quarter of each year, we typically experience a lower tax rate as we adjust our tax reserves for a closed tax period. And as Greg mentioned earlier, we had a non-typical tax reserve adjustment this year related to a previous acquisition. 
This non-typical adjustment is a non-recurring noncash item, which added $0.11 to our quarterly EPS and lowered our effective tax rate by 2.7% of pretax income. Excluding this item, our effective tax rate would have been 36.3%, which is where we thought we would be. For the fourth quarter, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 37.3% of pretax income.
Now moving on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results from the quarter and our updated guidance expectations for the full year of 2015. Free cash flow for the quarter was $254 million. Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we are revising our full year guidance for free cash flow to a range of $800 million to $850 million, reflecting an increase of $75 million on both ends of the range.
Inventory per store at the end of the quarter was $576,000, which is 1.5% decrease from the end of 2014. Our ongoing goal is to ensure we grow per store inventory at a lower rate than the  comparable store sales growth we generate, and we definitely accomplished that goal through the first 3 quarters in 2015.
We continue to make great progress in reducing slow-moving and overstock product, and  replacing it with additional store level inventory of products that are entering the higher demand cycles. 
However, part of this decrease is timing related to the very strong sales during the first 3 quarters of the year, and we continue to expect our per-store inventory to increase a little less than 1% per store for the full year.
Our AP to inventory ratio finished the third quarter at 101%. This is the first time our net inventory investment has been negative. We're excited about the accomplishment, but this ratio was aided by seasonality in our extremely strong sales. As a result, we expect to finish up 2015 at an AP to inventory ratio just under 100%.
Capital expenditures for the first 9 months were $296 million, which is a little less than we planned, but we still expect our 2015 CapEx to be within the range of $400 million to $430 million.
Moving on to debt, we finished the third quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.6x, still well below our targeted ratio of 2x to 2.25x. We continue to believe our stated range is the appropriate level for our business, and we will move into this range when the timing is appropriate.
We continue to execute our share repurchase program, and from July 1 through yesterday, we repurchased 1.3 million shares of our stock at an average cost of $239.81 per share for a total investment of $305 million. 
We continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning available cash to our shareholders after we take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business at a higher rate of return, and we will prudently execute our program with an emphasis on long-term returns for our shareholders.
  For the fourth quarter, we're establishing diluted earnings per share guidance of $1.97 to $2.01. Based on our above planned results thus far in 2015 and additional shares as repurchased since our last call, for the full year, we're raising our guidance to $8.97 to $9.01 per share, representing an increase of $0.35 per share at the midpoint from our previously announced guidance.
As a reminder, our diluted earnings per share guidance for both the fourth quarter and full year taking into account the shares repurchased through yesterday, but do not reflect the impact of any potential future share repurchases.
Finally, I'd like to once again thank the entire O'Reilly team for their continued dedication to the company's success. Congratulations on another outstanding performance in the third quarter.
This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I'd like to ask Ethan, the operator, to return to the line, and we'll be happy to answer your questions."

Cars continue to increase in complexity. There's a lot of technology that's being deployed in cars that wasn't a few years ago, and I would expect that continue -- to continue to increase. An example would be -- and we were talking about this internally the other day when it comes to vehicle ignitions. For instance, cars, just a few years ago, had distributor caps with a rotor and each cylinder had an ignition wire. And today, most vehicles have an ignition coil on each spark plug. And while the ignition coils aren't replaced as a part of normal vehicle maintenance during a tune-up and the cap and rotor and the ignition wires would have been, when those coils fail, they're very expensive, and at higher mileages they fail and -- the trade-off is there we sell a lot fewer units and maybe the frequency of the sale is less. But when we do sell a coil, it's a much more expensive sale. And since there's one on each cylinder, there is several of them on a car. And that kind of thing exists in several different areas. Fuel pumps used to be cars had mechanical fuel pumps or a in-line fuel pump going up to the carburetor or throttle body injection. Today, vehicles have an in-tank fuel pump that acts as not only the fuel pump, but also the fuel gauge sending unit down in the fuel pump. It's a very technical part. They sell for, on average, maybe a couple of hundred dollars a piece, whereas the older fuel pumps might sell for $20 to $40 a piece. So while they are good products, maybe don't fail as often as the old mechanical pumps or the in-line pumps, they're more expensive when they do."

It's become a little more of a factor with our geographic expansion and so forth. This fall, most markets have not had really very cold weather yet, and some of the periods that we compared to  last year, where you had cold snaps that might drive short-term demand for batteries or something like that. We've not really had that yet in most markets so that's yet to come. What I would say is that if we have a mild winter, some of the demand that would be created by the -- a more extreme winter would be deferred a little bit. It would go into maybe next year if there were parts that were going to fail in the wintertime or pressure that was put on parts that were going to fail anyway at some point, but didn't have the pressure put on them by the cold weather, so that might be kicked down the road to maybe the winter of '16 or something like that. So as we've always said, extreme weather is generally good for us. Real cold, real hot causes parts to fail more premature than they would typically, but they're still going to fail. So it just may push some of it down the road a little bit that we might gain during more extreme weather. I think the -- this year has been pretty normal weather, I think that the summer started out pretty mild, but it turned out being pretty hot in most markets, so we did well in some of the heat-related categories as I mentioned in our prepared remarks. I think that the average winter, I don't think it was extreme in most markets, and I think we benefited as we typically would from the damage that's done to cars in the extreme cold. And I would expect that many markets would have some version of a cold winter this year, although, I know that there's -- there could be some effect from this El Niño. So that would be my comment. I don't think it's a major factor to consider. And I think that the economic issues that we discussed relative to gas prices, miles driven, the health of the consumer, employment rates improving are more powerful typically than what the weather would be."

There is just things that can happen related to weather interception in some markets and doesn't in some markets, and that can be a significant driver of early demand. And then also the holiday shopping season is always a unknown and the effect of that on our business is always a little bit of an unknown. So we're always -- because of our history and our experience in all the fourth quarters that we've lived through, we know that fourth quarter is the most variable. And for that reason, we're -- we generally are pretty conservative, but -- and we even put more emphasis on our conservatism going into the fourth quarter as a result of the knowledge we have of the potential variability coming into the holiday season."

Well, what I would tell you is that when we assessed the IP, we were pretty skeptical and concerned of having stores with shops adjoined, and we kind of worked out how we would do that, and to this point, we've been pleased with our results. It was certainly a challenge because our competitors use the fact that we're attached to a shop as a means to imply that there's some partnerships that might be unfair to the other professional customers that we provide parts to, which is not the case, and we make it very transparent and clear that that's not the case. But VIP, and John Quirk, the owner, they've been great partners of ours, and I think both businesses have done well, and we're reasonably comfortable there. I can tell you that our business continues to grow robustly in those stores. We're coming off from a small base, but if you look to the percentages, boy, it's -- you'd be impressed if I told you what it was, which I'm not going to. But the -- talking about Pep Boys, I think that it's a lot different situation because of the size of it for one thing, but then also the amount of square feet, but what I would say is that if given the opportunity to look at that, we would assess that in due course just like we would any other opportunity and decide whether it made sense for us and what parts of it worked and what parts of it didn't and all those things. But I can tell you, we probably wouldn't be scared of the fact that there's a shop attached. And Tom has a comment also."

Our distribution is pretty highly variable, but there will be pressure on those fixed costs. When we look at the store costs, it's a difficult question to answer. When we look at what our SG&A was per store with high sales volumes, we're staffed up to meet that. We're probably running overtime because of the amount of business we have. We have a higher achievement of variable compensation and we're running a lot more trucks, burning a lot more fuel, so all of those costs are very variable. But obviously, there's some portion of payroll and there's occupancy costs that are fixed that we're levering. So at a lower comp, we're not going to -- all other things equal, we're not going to put up the operating profit we did this quarter. But we're going make adjustments to fine tune the variable part of our business to match what the business is that's out there."
