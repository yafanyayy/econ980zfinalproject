Chad came to the IR position 3 years ago as a rising star in our Strategy and M&A group at the time when we decided that our company and our investors were best served by an IR head who would've been deeply and directly involved in the business of the company. In the ensuing years, Chad has worked tirelessly to explain the complexities of NRG to our current and hopefully future investors. But Chad has been more than that. He's been a trusted adviser to Kirk,, Mauricio and myself and the rest of the executive leadership team. As he moves to a critically important finance position in Home Solar, our loss becomes Kelcy Pegler and Steve's again. We wish him well in his new position. And for your part as investors in the NRG Group of companies, I think you should expect to encounter him again. Chad's successor, Matt Orendor, who, like Chad before him rises out of our strategy and M&A group, is similarly a rising star deeply immersed in and familiar with the key initiatives of the company. But I will wait to say other good things about him until he proves himself in his new position. 
As always, joining me today are Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Operating Officer and President of NRG business. Additionally, in making his first appearance on earnings call, I'm pleased to have Steve McTeague, President of NRG Home, with us as. Additionally and available for questions are Chris Moser, Head of Commercial Operations; Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Home Retail; and Kelcy Pegler, Jr., Head of NRG Home Solar. 
Before I begin, I just want to thank everyone for participating in our investor event just 6 weeks ago and since our strategy hasn't changed appreciably in the intervening weeks and since there have been no strategy alternative intervening events since then, I will keep my prepared remarks as brief as possible. So let's get to it. Turning to Slide 3, as we've discussed over the past 2 quarters, our core power markets experienced quite a roller coaster ride in 2014, with a particularly severe winter and an extraordinarily mild summer. I'm pleased to report today that due to faultless execution across our core wholesale and retail platforms, we successfully delivered on our fiscal year 2014 financial guidance as revised on last year's third quarter call. Further, and as we indicated at our Investor Day, even in the face of continued softening of our core commodity prices, we again are reaffirming our 2015 financial guidance with its prospect of year-over-year growth from 2014. There has been concern about softening commodity prices in the early days of this year, but our excellent operational execution over the past 2 months, combined with the benefits of our diversification away from 100% reliance on conventional wholesale generation, makes this possible for NRG, makes reaffirming guidance possible in a way that is not always possible of our pure play IPP peer group.  Building on that game and turning to Slide 4, our strategic actions in 2014 continue to lay the foundation for NRG as we build the future of our company in response to the transition that we now believe to be clearly underway in our industry -- by the way, I'm still on Slide 3. Following the strategic blueprint provided to us by the winners in the telecom revolution, we have been in successful consolidator in the conventional power power while pushing forward into the key phases of the new more distributed sustained, more sustainable and carbon-constrained world of personal power. We deliver on all of our integration targets for our 2 most significant 2014 acquisitions and did so more quickly than we originally thought possible. We enhanced NRG Yield and we began the process through Energy Carbon 360 of providing a long-term future for our younger coal plants, even in a decarbonizing world. 
Now you should turn to Slide 4. Furthermore, we've been on a strategic path since 2010 to diversify our financial performance away from pure commodity risk. Back in 2007 or 2008, if you would ask me to explain in the most simple terms what NRG did to make money, I would've told you that we sell coal and uranium at natural gas prices. And while I still believe that for the most part in most markets, it's preferable to sell coal and uranium at natural gas prices than it is say to sell natural gas and natural gas prices. NRG has in the ensuing 5 years become so much more than just a natural gas commodity play. As illustrated on Slide 4, we have grown our economic gross margin by 70% over those 5 years all in a relentlessly subdued natural gas price environment while reducing the contribution of natural gas exposed margin by roughly 30%. This is a trend both in terms of growing gross margin and reducing natural gas price correlation that we are working hard to perpetuate. So in a market like we have seen over the past 2 months where natural gas has again declined to under $3 per million BTU, we remind you that NRG is not just a natural gas story but is increasingly an investment in the clean energy future which means among other attributes that we are built to weather volatility and gas prices while preserving the upside in the power markets when they materialize. 
Moving to Slide 5, because I've referenced at our Investor Day and recognize that not all of you are able to join us in Houston, let me close my reiterating what we took 7 hours to tell you down there into 70 seconds. Here's my pitch, and hopefully this becomes your NRG investment thesis. Our industry is in the but unmistakable stage of technology driven disruption of historic proportions. This disruption ultimately is going to end in a radically transformed energy industry where the winners are going to be those who offer their customers whether they be commercial, industrial or individual customers, a seamless energy solution that is safer, cleaner, more reliable, more convenient and increasingly wireless. And I might add just generally more personalized in what is currently being offered to energy consumers through our current command-and-control centralized one-size-fits-all wire and wooded fall system embedded by [indiscernible] and seemingly last improved upon in his era. NRG through our multiple initiatives in the smart home with Home Solar, distributed generation reliability solutions, micro grids, electric vehicle charging and portable solar and energy storage products is positioning itself to win this long-term future in a way that no other power company is attempting. In the short to medium-term, we continue to execute across our consolidated and unrivaled as a platform in a manner that will allow us to win in the next few years as the power plants of the post-World War II era, create a retirement tsunami washing across our core markets that will benefit us as one of the last men standing, thanks to our substantial investment in environmental remediation over the past 10 years. 
With that, I will turn it over to Mauricio."

The extreme market conditions that prevailed in 2014 highlighted some of the strengths of our integrated platform. Our diverse lead in the Northeast benefited from the severe cold weather early in the year and our integrated wholesale retail platform, combined with our commercial and operational performance helped mitigate the impact of a very mild summer and allowed us to deliver our 2014 financial results. Perhaps more relevant to you today is the fact that we aggressively hedged the portfolio for 2015 during the fourth quarter allowing us to reaffirm guidance. While it's still early in the year, I'm pleased to say that we are off to again start with a solid performance during the most recent cold front. 
Slide 7 presents the goals that I provided to you last year. And as you can see, we delivered across the board on our safety, operational and commercial metrics. We successfully integrated Edison Mission's [indiscernible] portfolio, delivered on operational synergies and announced a comprehensive asset organization plan for the Midwest fleet at attractive economics. On our distributed generation efforts, we successfully integrated the Omaha District Energy System and we're awarded a contract for 178 megawatts of preferred resources in California. We now have a full suite of distributed solutions for businesses. These, combined with our commercial wholesale platform and access to low-cost capital to NRG Yield, positions the growth for a significant growth in 2015. You will hear more about this effort in the months to come. A critical part of our strategy is the repositioning of our portfolio to outsurvive the current wave of retirements and benefits from changes in capacity markets and repowering opportunities. 
Slide 8 provides a summary of our comprehensive asset optimization and development plan. We currently have close to 12,000 megawatts of generation targeted for fuel conversions, environmental retrofits or repowering opportunities. These initiatives are consistent with our goals of streamlining cost, maintaining or expanding fuel diversity, reducing the environmental footprint of our portfolio and extending the economic life of assets. The projects are progressing as planned, but seems some of them are driven primarily by capacity revenues, the outcome of the upcoming capacity performance option in PJM could change our plans going forward. 
Turning to our operational metrics on Slide 9 and beginning with our most important metric, safety, I want to take a moment to thank all of my colleagues for another great year of safety performance, finishing in the top quartile. We have 128 out of 151 [ph] facilities without a recordable injury. This is an outstanding result considering the significant winter conditions in the East and the Edison Mission integration efforts beginning in April. It was the second best performance in the last 8 years at a rate of 0.73. While our fleet continues to grow in size and diversity, the one constant continues to be our strong safety performance. I want to recognize our distributed group for a perfect safety record with 0 recordable injuries. Well done. Our overall generation was [indiscernible] year-on-year on a normalized basis despite the lack of summer demand. The increase was driven primarily by higher generation in the West, the record production year at STP unit 2 and the higher [indiscernible] experience during the polar vortex in the East. This highlights the importance of our well-diversified portfolio. We continue to balance operational performance with margin-at-risk and overall spend throughout this low commodity price environment. Our coal and nuclear availability was down year-over-year to 82%. However, the fleet showed strong performance during peak pricing periods. This is evident in the improved year-over-year coal and nuclear reliability performance. In the third and final year of the current FORNRG program, we leveraged best practices from the operational synergies efforts in the GenOn facilities and expanded that through the rest of the organization. We achieved an outstanding result of $198 million for the year compared to a goal of $100 million. This success was driven primarily by improvements delivered by plant operations in Texas Retail. Thank you to you all of our colleagues who provide a commitment and execution behind our continuous improvement culture. We're confident we can continue to deliver the same value to our shareholders in the next iteration of the FORNRG program. 
Moving to our market update on Slide 10, I want to start with natural gas given the recent decline in prices. As David mentioned, we have been very successful in diversifying our margins away from natural gas, but it continues to be an important driver. So let me share a few thoughts. Since the start of the Shell Gas revolution 6 years ago, the industry has focused almost exclusively on the amount of supply flooding the market. While impressive by any standard, there have been very few catalysts on the demand side until now. Over the next few years, [indiscernible] will likely see a change coming primarily from 4 sources, the power industry, LNG, exports to Mexico and industrial demand. This incremental demand could come as early as this year, with additional coal to gas switching and implementation of more stringent environmental regulations that will drive coal and oil retirements. Our current head position allow us to weather this low commodity cycle and be ready for a more favorable market environment. 
Turning to the East markets, the ISOs are redefining the capacity products and requiring generators to perform during shortage conditions. The changes will allow for higher compensation but will also hold them to higher penalties for non-performance. As a generator with a large diverse portfolio, strong operational track record and fuel on site, we support and welcome these improvements. The result from the recent New England capacity auction for 18 19 were quite encouraging, with prices increasing significant year-over-year. PJM still awaiting resolution from FERC on its proposal which is expected to happen sometime in April. We are excited about our prospects for our portfolio of 17  gigawatts of generation in the region not only for the May auction but also for the transition auctions for the year that have already cleared. The recent cold front in the Northeast once again proved the value of our diversified portfolio where, unlike gas generation, our coal and oil assets benefited from spiking gas and power prices. Our strategies to extend the life of our assets and maintain a cheap option on energy that can benefit from short term dislocation in the market like the ones we experienced in the past 2 winters. 
Now moving on to Texas on Slide 11, demand grew by 2.4% on a weather normalized basis in 2014 driven primarily by the residential and commercial sectors. While low oil prices will undoubtedly have an impact in the Texas economy, this would be somewhat muted by the diversification that Texas has been able to achieve in recent years. A lot has been said about the robust demand in Texas and the need to build new generation, but given the implementation of new environmental programs like MATS, Casper and EPA's proposed regional [indiscernible] for Texas, it is important to talk about the potential impact to the supply stock. Make no mistake, we expect coal to be impacted by these regulations, but as you can see in the payroll, our portfolio is well-positioned to comply with these rules and not only outsurvive the competition, but benefit from the retirement of other units. 
That leads me to the forward market where prices seem to reflect very little risk premium for the next few summers as you can see on the upper right-hand chart. For the past 3 years, we have experienced scarcity pricing despite having single-digit operational reserve margins every year. From our perspective, Texas fundamentals remained robust, and it will not take much change in the supply demand balance to lead to scarcity pricing in the near term. 
Turning to our hedge disclosures on Slide 12, we increased our hedges prior to the winter which insulated us from the recent drop in natural gas prices. 2015 is well-hedged leaving us in good shape to weather the current downturn. We expect to see some coal to gas switching, but the financial impact will be muted for us. Just like we did in 2012, we're diligently working with fuel and transportation suppliers to ensure that our coal plants remain competitive during this extreme low natural gas price environment. 
Finally, our goal for 2015 are pretty clear. Execute on our asset optimization and development plan and grow our distributed generation business by leveraging our wholesale portfolio. With that, I will turn it over to Steve for the NRG Home Review."

As we discussed recently at our investor conference in Houston and as David mentioned this morning in his remarks, it's our view in NRG of the traditional centralized energy model is significantly at risk. We believe that the future eventually will belong to demand-driven, decentralized models of service that empower individual consumers through sustainable energy solutions that are affordable, personalized, convenient and reliable. NRG Home will continue to serve our customers through our robust traditional retail electric service franchise while at the same time position the business to win in a world where we believe a growing share of the market is going to want and expect to generate and manage a larger share of their own energy. 
As you can see from the data on Page 14, our strong performance in 2014 positions us well to achieve both our near and longer-term strategic and financial objectives. Our home retail platform delivered at the upper end of our original financial guidance with adjusted EBITDA of $604 million enabled in part by customer and product growth as well as our ongoing commitment to continuous operational improvements that drove material reduction both in per customer cost and in bad debt. Our recurring customer count grew by 28% driven primarily by the Dominion acquisition, which included customer contracts in the Northeast as well as the Sierra business in Texas. We're pleased with the success of the Dominion acquisition which [indiscernible] earnings and customer count delivered in 2014. We expect to continue to report the Dominion customer contacts -- excuse me, contracts, separately through 2015, as many of the Northeast customers will roll off during the year's purchase term contracts expire. Our customer growth also positions our Retail business to accelerate and deepen cross-selling of new products and services that will strengthen our business going forward. In that regard, we're excited that our home retail platform, which currently provides retail electricity and home solar would be in the market with new offerings this year that include portable power solutions, new battery products and a variety of additional home services. In 2014, NRG home also established NRG Home Solar, a leading residential platform formed through the combination of NRG's legacy residential solar solutions team and the acquisition of RDS and of pure energies. We ended the year with over 13,000 Home Solar customers. Our success in ramping this business was a result of rapid and successful integration of our new and legacy home solar businesses, our strong kitchen table and telephone sales capabilities, our ability to leverage our key strategic partnerships and our ability to integrate additional NRG home services into our conventional Home Solar offer. We also demonstrated early cross-selling success between Home Solar and Home Retail, with about 50% of eligible Home Solar customers supplementing their solar production with NRG's retail electricity. The strong foundation established for our residential solar business in 2014 positions us to be a top tier player in this rapidly growing space in 2015 and beyond. 
If you flip to Page 15, I'll quickly highlight our priorities for 2015 before turning it over to Kirk. In 2015, we are confident that we will deliver in our home retail financial expectation and we will establish our home solar businesses as Tier 1 player in the rapidly growing residential solar market. We will also operationalize the NRG Home platform toward our longer-term goal of strengthening per customer EBITDA by further accelerating cross-sell systems that increase tenure and by establishing common operating systems wherever we can to continue to incrementally reduce cost structure. And we will seek and pursue opportunities to scale our organic customer advantage and to enrich our existing product portfolio as we position NRG Home to become the dominant brand for clean and sustainable personal power solutions and services. 
Thank you very much for time this morning, and with that, we'll turn it over to Kirk."

Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 17, NRG is reporting fourth quarter 2014 adjusted EBITDA of $625 million with $382 million from business and renew, $165 million from home retail, a $34 million negative contribution from Home Solar as we continue to position that business for growth and $114 million from NRG Yield. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA totaled $3.128 billion with $2.134 billion from business and renew combined, $604 million from Home retail, a full year of negative contribution from Home Solar of $65 million and $455 million from NRG Yield. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, business in renew performance was down $26 million primarily from [indiscernible] weather, but partially offset by the acquisition of the EME assets, full commercial operation of CDSR and Ivanpah in 2014 and lower operating costs across the fleet. Retail EBITDA was lower by $15 million, also driven by milder weather, which was partially offset from the incremental margin from increased customers following the Dominion acquisition. Yield results improved by $21 million, driven by the acquisition of the Ultra wind assets while we increased our investment in Home Solar by $32 million in the fourth quarter as compared to 2013.  Free cash flow before growth totaled $951 million for the full year, with $139 million in flow in the fourth quarter. 
Turning your attention to our 2015 guidance, and as discussed at our Investor Day, given our hedge level, we're again reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion, which now excludes the expected negative contribution of $100 million from investment in our growing Home Solar business. Free cash flow before growth guidance is also reaffirmed as we continue to expect between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion in 2015. 
Turning to the Slide 18, I'd like to review a shareholder proposal by NRG Yield which is contained in the preliminary proxy statement filed by Yield last evening. This proposal, which has been recommended by the NRG Yield independent directors and has the full support of NRG, involves an important recapitalization of NRG Yield intended to achieve 2 important objectives. First, to preserve and maintain the strong strategic support of NRG Yield by NRG, and second, to enhance NRG Yield's flexibility to efficiently access capital to fund growth without the need for capital allocation by NRG towards additional investment in NRG Yield. This proposal, which requires the vote of a majority of the Class A shares of NRG Yield, involves the creation of 2 classes of low vote NRG Yield stock, which will be issued through a recapitalization of Yield's equity. NRG Yield would intend to use of this new low vote stock as its primary means of raising equity capital to fund growth going forward. Basically, the proposed recapitalization will take the form of a 2-for-1 stock split of both classes of NRG Yield stock. The Class A stock, which is held by the public, as well as the Class B stock, which is held by NRG, thereby doubling the total number of NRG Yield shield shares outstanding. The new [indiscernible] of shares will be issued in 2 distinct classes due to the 2 classes of stock currently held by NRG and the public shareholders. NRG, which holds approximately 42.7 million Class B shares, will receive an equal number of Class B shares each with a 1/100 [ph] voting right. As NRG's economic interest is held exclusively through its direct interest in NRG Yield, LLC, the new low vote Class B shares to be issued in NRG will have no economic rates. Each Class A shares held by the public will receive 1 share of Class C stock with the same economic rights as the Class A stock and a 1/100 [ph] voting right. Immediately following the stock split, each shareholder will, through their combined ownership of the classes of stock have the exact same economic and voting rights as they do today. Going forward, NRG Yield will be able to issue third-party equity using C shares to fund the acquisitions without the need for investment by NRG as these types of acquisitions are best-suited for NRG Yield while the focus of NRG's capital allocation to fund growth is focused on other core areas. The enhanced flexibility this provides is consistent with the rationale behind the original creation of NRG Yield and preserves the important strategic partnership. NRG's economic ownership will be diluted through future issuances of Class C shares by NRG Yield to help fund growth. However, the proposed plan will allow for approximately $21 billion of equity to be issued based on today's share price before NRG's voting interest would fall below 50%, providing substantial headroom for additional equity capital. In addition to the proposed recapitalization plan, NRG has agreed to add additional assets to the right of first offer agreement. This expanded ROFO pipeline, provide additional disability in NRG Yield's long-term dividend growth and total return in order to preserve its low cost of capital advantage. The assets added to the expanded ROFO pipeline include NRG's Carlsbad and Mandalay repowering projects recently awarded in the ongoing RFO's for new contract degeneration in California. Following CPUC approval, NRG will develop and construct these assets which at COD may be offered to NRG Yield, providing additional asset diversity in the years beyond the expected completion of the original ROFO pipeline. These types of projects enabled by and a testament to the strength of the NRG-NRG Yield partnership underscore the need for enhanced flexibility the proposed recapitalization will provide. In terms of next steps, NRG Yield expects to file and distribute a definitive proxy statement on or about March 26. NRG Yield has conditioned the proposals so it does require the approval of a majority of the Class A shareholders at its annual meeting on May 5 of this year. NRG strongly supports the proposal as approved by the independent directors of NRG Yield and we ask for the support of the public shareholders of NRG Yield in this important step in building on the tremendous success of the NRG-NRG Yield relationship. 
Finally, updating our capital allocation progress on Slide 19, NRG ended 2014 with an excess cash balance of $1.26 billion. This excess cash balance, which is net of minimum cash at NRG, GenOn and NRG Yield, when combined with NRG's increased 2015 free cash flow before growth investments guidance, leads to $2.46 billion in consolidated cash available for allocation during 2015. Of this amount, we have committed nearly $1.7 billion of capital, including $250 million or approximately 20% of our 2015 free cash flow to be returned to shareholders through the combination of our recently completed stock buyback program announced last December and a 4% increase in our annual dividend. Our growth investments guidance of $900 million for 2015 is primarily driven by operational improvement initiatives across the fleet. Approximately $150 million of investment in Home Solar installations, as well as continued investments in solar, Carbon 360 and [indiscernible]. $800 million in remaining cash available for allocation, which is prior to any proceeds from NRG Yield drop downs in 2015 consist of $600 million at the GenOn level which is intended to fund our ongoing fuel conversion initiatives, with the remaining $200 million at the NRG level. Importantly, this balance does not reflect the impact of NRG Yield drop downs in 2015. As we intend to offer NRG Yield the next portfolio of ROFO assets, which we expect to consist with the remaining wind assets from the EME acquisition during the first half of 2015, the capital replenishment from this transaction will further increase NRG's excess capital. Specifically, when combined with the residential solar [indiscernible] struck down currently under evaluation at NRG Yield, the proceeds from the wind assets are expected to generate between $250 million and $300 million in cash to NRG. Once this drop down is finalized in the first half of the year, we will revisit further capital allocation decisions based on conditions and opportunities at that time which may be further augmented by a second ROFO portfolio like the remaining stake in CBSR in late 2015. 
With that, I'll turn it back to David for his closing remarks."

And while we recogniz",388,"Sure, the first part of your question, as a think you know, largely due to the successful equity issuance to fund the Ulta Wind acquisition, that being a third-party acquisition, our current ownership stake in NRG Yield is about 55%. And while we recognize the possibility at the outset that when we dropped down assets into NRG Yield, we may take some portion of that consideration in time, it is a different proposition entirely to consider the possibility of incremental cash investment in NRG Yield to help support that ownership relationship. What I mean by that is if you extrapolate it forward on a potential third party acquisition, the size of Ulta Wind, for example, in order to put NRG to remain -- to maintain its 50 plus percent ownership, that would require NRG to actually allocate capital and invest in yield equity, effectively investing in those types of projects over the long run. And while certainly those projects are financially compelling, it was the very motivation behind the creation of NRG Yield to separate those kind of investments so that they reside in a vehicle that's properly positioned for that kind of risk and return profile. So because those assets are high EBITDA multiple, that will be tantamount to NRG investing capital or allocating capital towards high yield double [ph]. This allows us to allocate that capital appropriately towards the types of investments, conventional and the like, and towards some of the growth initiatives at NRG that are more appropriately our core focus. I think on the second part of your question, although I think we've outlined the structure within the relationship between NRG and NRG Yield, the important distinction here is we plan on tax equity financing, primarily the tax attributes from residential solar leases as their drop-down in NRG Yield. NRG Yield's participation in that is actually investing in the residual equity after-tax equity. So NRG Yield is not providing tax equity and using tax equity allows us to manage effectively the duration of that tax holiday or that tax runway, if you will. We have the flexibility from time-to-time to drop-down assets without tax attributes given NRG segment the ability to augment its tax yielding ability. But I think given the nature of the broader portfolio, we use tax equity to help manage that."

But as I've said a number of times, our primary goal is to ensure that NRG Yield has a maximum competitive advantage and low cost to capital. And from our perspective, the best means to do that is for NRG Yield to realize the maximum incremental potential CASD without the drag, if you will, of on IDR. The other element of that is at the NRG level, because the IDR would basically be cash flow or EBITDA back to NRG, which obviously goes back to an entity with a lower EBITDA multiple, we wanted to maximize that portion of the cash flows that was associated with those contracted plans to ensure that it traded at a higher valuation. And we think the absence of an IDR addresses that issue, as well as the fact it ensures that NRG Yield can be more competitive or have a competitive advantage from a realization of accretion relative to some of the other competitors out there whose IDR's can deter or detract from the accretion when we compete for assets and third-party market."

And thank you, Chad.
And even before I go through the familiar ritual of introducing my colleagues, I want to draw your attention to the latter part of today's earnings release, where we announced that Chad Plotkin is stepping down from being Head of Investor Relations for both NRG and NRG Yield in order to take up a position as Head of Finance for NRG Home Solar. Chad came to the IR position 3 years ago as a rising star in our Strategy and M&A Group at a time when we decided that our company and our investors were best served by an IR Head who had been deeply and directly involved in the business of the company. In the ensuing years, Chad has worked tirelessly to explain the complexities of NRG to our current and, hopefully, future investors, but Chad has been more than that. During his tenure, he's been a trusted adviser to Kirk, Mauricio, myself and the rest of the executive leadership team. As he moves to a critically important finance position in home solar, our loss becomes Kelcy Pegler and Steve McBee's gain. For our part, we wish him well in his new position. And for your part as investors in the NRG Group of Companies, I think you should expect to encounter him again.
Chad's successor, Matt Orendorff, who like Chad before him, rises out of our Strategy & M&A Group, is similarly a rising star deeply immersed in and familiar with the key initiatives of the company, but I will wait to say other good things about him until he proves himself in his new position.
As always, joining me today are Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Operating Officer and President of NRG Business. Additionally, in making his first appearance on an earnings call, I'm pleased to have Steve McBee, President of NRG Home, with us as well. Additionally and available for questions are Chris Moser, Head of Commercial Operations; Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Home Retail; and Kelcy Pegler, Jr., Head of NRG Home Solar.
Before I begin, I first want to thank everyone for participating in our investor event just 6 weeks ago. And since our strategy hasn't changed appreciably in the intervening weeks and since there have been no strategy-altering intervening events since then, I will keep my prepared remarks as brief as possible.
So let's get to it, turning to Slide 3.
As we've discussed over the past few quarters, our core power markets experienced quite a roller coaster ride in 2014 with a particularly severe winter and an extraordinarily mild summer. I'm pleased to report today that due to faultless execution across our core wholesale and retail platforms, we successfully delivered on our fiscal year 2014 financial guidance as revised on last year's Third Quarter Call. Further and as we indicated at our Investor Day, even in the face of continued softening of our core commodity prices, we again are reaffirming our 2015 financial guidance with its prospect of year-over-year growth from 2014. There has been concern about softening commodity prices in the early days of this year, but our excellent operational execution over the past 2 months, combined with the benefits of our diversification away from a 100% reliance on conventional wholesale generation, makes this possible for NRG, makes reaffirming guidance possible in a way that is not always possible of our pure-play IPP peer group.
Building on that theme and turning to Slide 4. Our strategic actions in 2014 continued to lay the foundation for NRG as we build the future of our company in response to the transition that we now believe to be clearly underway in our industry -- oh yes, by the way, I'm still on Slide 3. Following the strategic blueprint provided to us by the winners in the telecom revolution, we have been a big and successful consolidator in the conventional power sector while pushing forward into key phases of the new, more distributed, more sustainable and carbon-constrained world of personal power. We delivered on all of our integration targets for our 2 most significant 2014 acquisitions and did so more quickly than we originally thought possible. We enhanced NRG Yield. And we began the process, through NRG Carbon 360, of providing a long-term future for our younger coal plants even in a decarbonizing world.
Now you should turn to Slide 4. Furthermore, we have been on a strategic path, at least since 2010, to diversify our financial performance away from pure commodity risk. Back in 2007 or 2008, if you would ask me to explain in the most simple terms what NRG did to make money, I would have told you that we sell coal and uranium at natural gas prices. And while I still believe that, for the most part in most markets, it's preferable to sell coal and uranium at natural gas prices than it is, say, to sell natural gas at natural gas prices, NRG has, in the ensuing 5 years, become so much more than just a natural gas commodity play. As illustrated on Slide 4, we have grown our economic gross margin by 70% over those 5 years, all in a relentlessly subdued natural gas price environment, while reducing the contribution of natural-gas-exposed margin by roughly 30%. This is a trend both in terms of growing gross margin and reducing natural gas price correlation that we are working hard to perpetuate. So in a market like we have seen over the past 2 months where natural gas, as again, declined to under $3 per million Btu, we remind you that NRG is not just a natural gas story but is increasingly in investment in the clean energy future, which means, among other attributes, that we are built to weather volatility and gas prices while preserving the upside in the power markets when they materialize.
Moving to Slide 5. Because I've referenced our Investor Day and recognize that not all of you were able to join us in Houston, let me close by reiterating what we took 7 hours to tell you down there into 70 seconds. Here is my pitch, and hopefully, this becomes your NRG investment thesis: Our industry is in the early but unmistakable stage of a technology-driven disruption of historic proportions. This disruption ultimately is going to end in a radically transformed energy industry where the winners are going to be those who offer their customers, whether they be commercial, industrial or individual customers, a seamless energy solution that is safer, cleaner, more reliable, more convenient and increasingly wireless; and I might add, just generally more personalized in what is currently being offered to energy consumers through our current command-and-control, centralized ""one size fits all"" wire and wooden old system invented by Thomas Edison and seemingly last improved upon in his era.
NRG, through our multiple initiatives in the smart home with home solar, distributed generation, reliability solutions, microgrid, electric vehicle charging and portable solar and energy storage products, is positioning itself to win in this long-term future in a way that no other power company is attempting. In the short to medium term, we continue to execute across our consolidated and unrivaled asset platform in a manner that will allow us to win in the next few years as the power plants of the post-World War II era create a retirement tsunami washing across our core markets that will benefit us as one of the last men standing, thanks to our substantial investment in environmental remediation over the past 10 years.
With that, I will turn it over to Mauricio."

And good morning, everyone.The extreme market conditions that prevailed in 2014 highlighted some of the strengths of our integrated platform.

The extreme market conditions that prevailed in 2014 highlighted some of the strengths of our integrated platform. Our diverse suite in the Northeast benefited from the severe cold weather earlier in the year, and our integrated wholesale/retail platform, combined with our commercial and operational performance, helped mitigate the impact of a very mild summer and allowed us to deliver our 2014 financial results. Perhaps more relevant to you today is the fact that we aggressively hedged the portfolio for 2015 during the fourth quarter, allowing us to reaffirm guidance. While it's still early in the year, I am pleased to say that we're off to a good start with a solid performance during the most recent cold front.
Slide 7 presents the goals that I provided to you last year. And as you can see, we delivered across the board on our safety, operational and commercial metrics. We successfully integrated Edison Mission's 8 gigawatt portfolio, delivered on operational synergies and announced a comprehensive asset optimization plan for the Midwest fleet at attractive economics. On our distributed generation efforts, we successfully integrated the Omaha district energy system and were awarded a contract for 178 megawatts of preferred resources in California. We now have a full suite of distributed solutions for businesses. This, combined with our commercial and wholesale platform and access to low-cost capital through NRG Yield, positions the group for a significant growth in 2015. You will hear more about this effort in the months to come.
A critical part of our strategy is the repositioning of our portfolio to out-survive the current wave of retirements and benefits from changes in capacity markets and repowering opportunities. Slide 8 provides a summary of our comprehensive asset optimization and development plan. We currently have close to 12,000 megawatts of generation targeted for fuel conversions, environmental retrofits or repowering opportunities. These initiatives are consistent with our goals of streamlining cost, maintaining or expanding fuel diversity, reducing the environmental footprint of our portfolio and extending the economic life of assets. The projects are progressing as planned, but since some of them are driven primarily by capacity revenues, the outcome of the upcoming capacity performance auction in PJM could change our plans going forward.
Turning to our operational metrics on Slide 9 and beginning with our most important metric, safety. I want to take a moment to thank all of my colleagues for another great year of safety performance, finishing in the top quartile. We had 128 out of 161 facilities without a recordable injury. This is an outstanding result considering the significant winter conditions in the East and the Edison Mission integration efforts beginning in April. It was the second best performance in the last 8 years at a rate of 0.73. While our fleet continues to grow in size and diversity, the one constant continues to be our strong safety performance. I want to recognize our distributed group for a perfect safety record with 0 recordable injuries. Well done.
Our overall generation was up 4% year-over-year on a normalized basis despite the lack of summer demand. The increase was driven primarily by higher generation in the West, a record production year at STP Unit 2 and the higher rounds experienced during the polar vortex in the East. This highlights the importance of a well-diversified portfolio. We continue to balance operational performance with margin at-risk and overall spend throughout this low commodity price environment.
Our coal and nuclear availability was down year-over-year to 82%. However, the fleet showed strong performance during peak pricing periods. This is evidenced in the improved year-over-year coal and nuclear reliability performance.
In the third and final year of the current FORNRG program, we leveraged best practices from the operational synergies efforts in the GenOn facilities and expanded that through the rest of the organization. We achieved an outstanding result of $198 million for the year compared to a goal of $100 million. This success was driven primarily by improvements delivered by plant operations in Texas retail. Thank you to you, all of our colleagues, who provide a commitment and execution behind our continuous improvement culture. We're confident we can continue to deliver the same value to our shareholders in the next iteration of the FORNRG program.
Moving to our market update on Slide 10.
I want to start with natural gas given the recent decline in prices. As David mentioned, we have been very successful in diversifying our margins away from natural gas, but it continues to be an important driver, so let me share a few thoughts. Since the start of the shale gas revolution 6 years ago, the industry has focused almost exclusively on the amount of supply flooding the market. While impressive by any standard, there have been very few catalysts on the demand side until now. Over the next few years, gas demand will likely see a step-change coming primarily from 4 sources: the power industry, LNG, exports to Mexico and industrial demand. This incremental demand could come as early as this year, with additional coal-to-gas switching and implementation of more stringent environmental regulations that will drive coal and oil retirements. Our current head position allow us to weather this low commodity cycle and be ready for a more favorable market environment.
Turning to the East markets. The ISOs are redefining the capacity products and requiring generators to perform during shortage conditions. The changes will allow for higher compensation but will also hold them to higher penalties for non-performance. As a generator with a large diversed portfolio, strong operational track record and fuel on-site, we support and welcome these improvements. The result from the recent New England capacity auction for '18, '19 were quite encouraging, with prices increasing significantly year-over-year. PJM is still awaiting resolution from FERC on its proposal, which is expected to happen sometime in early April. We're excited about our prospects for our portfolio of 17 gigawatts of generation in the region not only for the May auction but also for the transition auctions for the year that have already cleared.
The recent cold front in the Northeast once again proved the value of our diversified portfolio, where unlike gas generation, our coal and oil assets benefited from spikes in gas and power prices. Our strategy is to extend the life of our assets and maintain a cheap option on energy that can benefit from short-term dislocations in the market like the ones we experienced the past 2 winters.
Now moving on to Texas, on Slide 11. Demand grew by 2.4% on a weather-normalized basis in 2014, driven primarily by the residential and commercial sectors. While low oil prices will undoubtedly have an impact on the Texas economy, this will be somewhat muted by the diversification that Texas has been able to achieve in recent years.
A lot has been said about the robust demand in Texas and the need to build new generation, but given the implementation of new environmental programs like MATS, CSAPR and EPA's proposed regional haze rule for Texas, it is important to talk about the potential impact to the supply stack. Make no mistakes, we expect coal to be impacted by these regulations, but as you can see in the table, our portfolio is well positioned to comply with these rules and not only out-survive the competition but benefit from the retirement of other units.
That leads me to the forward market, where prices seem to reflect very little risk premium for the next few summers, as you can see on the upper right-hand chart. For the past 3 years, we have experienced no scarcity pricing despite having single-digit operational reserve margins every year. From our perspective, Texas fundamentals remain robust, and it will not take much change in the supply-demand balance to lead to scarcity pricing in the near term.
Turning to our hedge disclosures on Slide 12. We increased our hedges prior to the winter, which insulated us from the recent drop in natural gas prices. 2015 is well hedged, leaving us in good shape to weather the current downturn. We expect to see some coal-to-gas switching, but the financial impact will be muted for us. Just like we did in 2012, we're diligently working with fuel and transportation suppliers to ensure that our coal plants remain competitive during this extreme low natural gas price environment.
Finally, our goals for 2015 are pretty clear: execute on our asset optimization and development plan and grow our distributed generation business by leveraging our wholesale portfolio.
With that, I will turn it over to Steve for the NRG Home review."

And good morning, everyone.
As we've discussed recently at our investor conference in Houston and as David mentioned this morning in his remarks, it's our view at NRG that traditional, centralized energy service models are significantly at risk. We believe that the future eventually will belong to demand-driven, decentralized models of service that empower individual consumers through sustainable energy solutions that are affordable, personalized, convenient and reliable. NRG Home will continue to serve our customers through our robust, traditional retail electric service franchise while, at the same time, position the business to win in a world where we believe a growing share of the market is going to want and expect, generate and manage a larger share of their own energy.
As you can see from the data on Page 14, our strong performance in 2014 positions us well to achieve both our nearer- and longer-term strategic and financial objectives. Our home retail platform delivered at the upper end of our original financial guidance with adjusted EBITDA of $604 million, enabled in part by customer and product growth as well as by our ongoing commitment to continuous operational improvements that drove material reductions both in per-customer cost and in bad debt.
Our recurring customer count grew by 28%, driven primarily by the Dominion acquisition, which included customer contracts in the Northeast as well as the share of business in Texas. We're pleased with the success of the Dominion acquisition, which beat estimates of earnings and customer count delivered in 2014. We expect to continue to report the Dominion customer contacts -- excuse me, contracts, separately through 2015, as many of the Northeast customers will roll off during the year as the purchase term contracts expire.
Our customer growth also positions our retail business to accelerate and deepen cross-selling of new products and services that will strengthen our business going forward. In that regard, we're excited that our home retail platform, which currently provides retail electricity and home solar, will be in the market with new offerings this year that include portable power solutions, new battery products and a variety of additional home services.
In 2014, NRG Home also established NRG Home Solar, a leading residential platform formed through the combination of NRG's legacy residential solar solutions team and the acquisition of RDS and of Pure Energy's. We ended the year with over 13,000 home solar customers.
Our success in ramping this business was a result of rapid and successful integration of our new and legacy home solar businesses, our strong kitchen table and telephone sales capabilities, our ability to leverage our key strategic partnerships and our ability to integrate additional NRG home services into our conventional home solar offerings. We also demonstrated early cross-selling success between home solar and home retail, with about 50% of eligible home solar customers supplementing their solar productions with NRG's retail electricity. The strong foundation established for our residential solar business in 2014 positions us to be a top-tier player in this rapidly growing space in 2015 and beyond.
If you flip to Page 15, I'll quickly outline our priorities for 2015 before turning it over to Kirk.
In 2015, we are confident that we will deliver on our home retail financial expectations and that we will establish our home solar business as Tier 1 player in the rapidly growing residential solar market. We will also operationalize the NRG Home platform toward our longer-term goal of strengthening per-customer EBITDA by further accelerating cross-sell systems that increase tenure and by establishing common operating systems wherever we can to continue to incrementally reduce cost structure. And we will seek and pursue opportunities to scale our organic customer advantage and to enrich our existing product portfolio as we position NRG Home to become the dominant brand for clean and sustainable personal power solutions and services.
Thank you very much for your time this morning. And with that, we'll turn it over to Kirk."

Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 17.
NRG is reporting fourth quarter 2014 adjusted EBITDA of $625 million (sic) [$627 million], with $382 million from business and renew, $165 million from home retail, a $34 million negative contribution from home solar as we continue to position that business for growth and $114 million from NRG Yield. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA totaled $3.128 billion, with $2.134 billion from business and renew combined, $604 million from home retail, a full year of negative contribution from home solar of $65 million and $455 million from NRG Yield.
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, business and renew performance was down $26 million, primarily from milder weather, but partially offset by the acquisition of the EME assets, full commercial operation of CVSR and Ivanpah in 2014 and lower operating costs across the fleet. Retail EBITDA was lower by $15 million, also driven by milder weather, which was partially offset from the incremental margin from increased customers following the Dominion acquisition. Yield results improved by $21 million, driven by the acquisition of the Alta Wind assets, while we increased our investment in home solar by $32 million in the fourth quarter, as compared to 2013.
Free cash flow before growth totaled $951 million for the full year, with a $139 million inflow in the fourth quarter.
Turning your attention to our 2015 guidance. And as discussed at our Investor Day, given our hedge level, we're again reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion, which now excludes the expected negative contribution of $100 million from investment in our growing home solar business. Free cash flow before growth guidance is also reaffirmed, as we continue to expect between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion in 2015.
Turning to Slide 18, I'd like to review a shareholder proposal by NRG Yield, which is contained in the preliminary proxy statement filed by Yield last evening. This proposal, which has been recommended by the NRG Yield independent directors and has the full support of NRG, involves an important recapitalization of NRG Yield intended to achieve 2 important objectives: first, to preserve and maintain the strong strategic support of NRG Yield by NRG; and second, to enhance NRG Yield's flexibility to efficiently access capital to fund growth without the need for capital allocation by NRG towards additional investment in NRG Yield.
This proposal, which requires the vote of a majority of the Class A shares of NRG Yield, involves the creation of 2 classes of low-vote NRG Yield stock, which will be issued through a recapitalization of Yield's equity. NRG Yield would intend to use this new low-vote stock as its primary means of raising equity capital to fund growth going forward. Basically, the proposed recapitalization will take the form of a 2-for-1 stock split of both classes of NRG Yield stock: the Class A stock, which is held by the public; as well as the Class B stock, which is held by NRG, thereby doubling the total number of NRG Yield's shares outstanding.
The new low-vote shares will be issued in 2 distinct classes due to the 2 classes of stock currently held by NRG and the public shareholders. NRG, which holds approximately 42.7 million Class B shares, will receive an equal number of Class B shares each with a 1/100 voting right. As NRG's economic interest is held exclusively through its direct interest in NRG Yield LLC, the new low-vote Class B shares to be issued at NRG will have no economic rights. Each Class A shares held by the public will receive 1 share of Class C stock, with the same economic rights as the Class A stock and a 1/100 voting right. Immediately following the stock split, each shareholder will, through their combined ownership of the classes of stock, have the exact same economic and voting rights as they do today.
Going forward, NRG Yield will be able to issue third-party equity using C shares to fund acquisitions without the need for investment by NRG, as these types of acquisitions are best suited for NRG Yield, while the focus of NRG's capital allocation to fund growth is focused on other core areas. The enhanced flexibility this provides is consistent with the rationale behind the original creation of NRG Yield and preserves the important strategic partnership. NRG's economic ownership will be diluted through future issuances of Class C shares by NRG Yield to help fund growth. However, the proposed plan will allow for approximately $21 billion of equity to be issued, based on today's share price, before NRG's voting interest would fall below 50%, providing substantial headroom for additional equity capital.
In addition to the proposed recapitalization plan, NRG has agreed to add additional assets to the ""right of first offer"" agreement. This expanded ROFO pipeline provides additional visibility in NRG Yield's long-term dividend growth and total return in order to preserve its ""low cost of capital"" advantage. The assets added to the expanded ROFO pipeline include NRG's Carlsbad and Mandalay repowering projects recently awarded in the ongoing RFOs for new contracted generation in California. Following CPUC approval, NRG will develop and construct these assets, which at COD may be offered to NRG Yield, providing additional asset diversity in the years beyond the expected completion of the original ROFO pipeline.
These types of projects enabled by and a testament to the strength of the NRG-NRG Yield partnership underscore the need for the enhanced flexibility the proposed recapitalization will provide. In terms of next steps, NRG Yield expects to file and distribute a definitive proxy statement on or about March 26. NRG Yield has conditioned the proposal so that it does require the approval of a majority of the Class A shareholders at its annual meeting on May 5 of this year. NRG strongly supports the proposal as approved by the independent directors of NRG Yield, and we ask for the support of the public shareholders of NRG Yield in this important step in building on the tremendous success of the NRG-NRG Yield relationship.
Finally, updating our capital allocation progress on Slide 19.
NRG ended 2014 with an excess cash balance of $1.26 billion. This excess cash balance, which is net of minimum cash at NRG, GenOn and NRG Yield, when combined with NRG's increased 2015 free cash flow before growth investments guidance, leads to $2.46 billion in consolidated cash available for allocation during 2015. Of this amount, we have committed nearly $1.7 billion of capital, including $250 million or approximately 20% of our 2015 free cash flow to be returned to shareholders through the combination of our recently completed stock buyback program announced last December and a 4% increase in our annual dividend.
Our growth investments guidance of $900 million for 2015 is primarily driven by operational improvement initiatives across the fleet: approximately $150 million of investment in home solar installations; as well as continued investments in solar, Carbon 360 and eVgo.
$800 million in remaining cash available for allocation, which is prior to any proceeds from NRG Yield drop-downs in 2015, consists of $600 million at the GenOn level, which is intended to fund our ongoing fuel conversion initiatives, with the remaining $200 million at the NRG level. Importantly, this balance does not reflect the impact of NRG Yield drop-downs in 2015. As we intend to offer NRG Yield the next portfolio of ROFO assets, which we expect to consist of the remaining wind assets from the EME acquisition, during the first half of 2015, the capital replenishment from this transaction will further increase NRG's excess capital. Specifically, when combined with the residential solar lease drop-down currently under evaluation at NRG Yield, the proceeds from the wind assets are expected to generate between $250 million and $300 million in cash to NRG. Once this drop-down is finalized in the first half of the year, we will revisit further capital allocation decisions based on conditions and opportunities at that time, which may be further augmented by a second ROFO portfolio, likely the remaining stake in CVSR, in late 2015.
With that, I'll turn it back to David for his closing remarks."

And while we r",389,"Sure. Angie, the first part of your question, as I think you know, largely due to the successful equity issuance to fund the Alta Wind acquisition, that being a third-party acquisition, our current ownership stake in NRG Yield is about 55%. And while we recognize the possibility at the outset that, when we drop down assets into NRG Yield, we may take some portion of that consideration in kind, it is a different proposition entirely to consider the possibility of incremental cash investment in NRG Yield to help support that ownership relationship. And what I mean by that is, if you extrapolate it forward on a potential third-party acquisition the size of Alta Wind, for example, in order to put NRG to remain -- to maintain its 50-plus-percent ownership, that would require NRG to actually allocate capital and invest in Yield's equity, effectively investing in those types of projects over the long run. And while certainly those projects are financially compelling, it was the very motivation behind the creation of NRG Yield to separate those kind of investments so that they reside in a vehicle that's properly positioned for that kind of risk in a return profile. So because those assets are high EBITDA multiples, that will be tantamount to NRG investing capital or allocating capital towards a high-yield gamble [ph]. This allows us to allocate that capital appropriately towards the types of investments, conventional and the like, and towards some of the growth initiatives at NRG that are more appropriately our core focus. I think, on the second part of your question, although I think we've outlined the structure within the relationship between NRG and NRG Yield, the important distinction here is we plan on tax equity financings, primarily the tax attributes from residential solar leases as they're dropped down to NRG Yield. NRG Yield's participation in that is actually investing in the residual equity, after-tax equity, so NRG Yield is not providing tax equity. And using tax equity allows us to manage effectively the duration of that tax holiday or that tax runway, if you will. We have the flexibility, from time to time, to drop-down assets without tax attributes, giving NRG the ability to augment its tax-yielding ability, but I think, given the nature of the broader portfolio, we'd use tax equity to help manage that."

But as I've said a number of times, our primary goal is to ensure that NRG Yield has a maximum competitive advantage and low cost of capital. And from our perspective, the best means to do that is for NRG Yield to realize the maximum incremental potential CAFD without the drag, if you will, of an IDR. The other element of that is, at the NRG level, because the IDR would basically be cash flow or EBITDA back to NRG, which obviously goes back to an entity with a lower EBITDA multiple, we wanted to maximize that portion of the cash flows that was associated with those contracted plans to ensure that it traded at the higher valuation. And we think the absence of an IDR addresses that issue, as well as the fact it ensures that NRG Yield can be more competitive and/or have a competitive advantage from a realization of accretion relative to some of the other competitors out there whose IDRs can deter or detract from the accretion when we compete for assets in the third-party market."

But I would tell you in general terms, when it comes to YieldCos, we monitor closely all the activity in the general YieldCo market. And it seems to me, and you probably could tell me -- you could certainly tell me better if this is true or not, that the market is now to the point where, as opposed to buying every YieldCo that comes up, it's trying to differentiate between quality YieldCos and lesser quality. And we are committed at NRG that NRG Yield is going to be a top-quality YieldCo. So on every basic metric that the yield community is looking at, we want ours to be in the top tier. And so we're constantly following the situation. And that's our goal and we're going to stick to it."

And thank you, Chad.
And even before I go through the familiar ritual of introducing my colleagues, I want to draw your attention to the latter part of today's earnings release, where we announced that Chad Plotkin is stepping down from being Head of Investor Relations for both NRG and NRG Yield in order to take up a position as Head of Finance for NRG Home Solar. Chad came to the IR position 3 years ago as a rising star in our Strategy and M&A Group at a time when we decided that our company and our investors were best served by an IR Head who had been deeply and directly involved in the business of the company. In the ensuing years, Chad has worked tirelessly to explain the complexities of NRG to our current and, hopefully, future investors, but Chad has been more than that. During his tenure, he's been a trusted adviser to Kirk, Mauricio, myself and the rest of the executive leadership team. As he moves to a critically important finance position in home solar, our loss becomes Kelcy Pegler and Steve McBee's gain. For our part, we wish him well in his new position. And for your part as investors in the NRG Group of Companies, I think you should expect to encounter him again.
Chad's successor, Matt Orendorff, who like Chad before him, rises out of our Strategy & M&A Group, is similarly a rising star deeply immersed in and familiar with the key initiatives of the company, but I will wait to say other good things about him until he proves himself in his new position.
As always, joining me today are Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mauricio Gutierrez, as our Chief Operating Officer and President of NRG Business. Additionally, in making his first appearance on an earnings call, I'm pleased to have Steve McBee, President of NRG Home, with us as well. Additionally and available for questions are Chris Moser, Head of Commercial Operations; Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Home Retail; and Kelcy Pegler, Jr., Head of NRG Home Solar.
Before I begin, I first want to thank everyone for participating in our investor event just 6 weeks ago. And since our strategy hasn't changed appreciably in the intervening weeks and since there have been no strategy-altering intervening events since then, I will keep my prepared remarks as brief as possible.
So let's get to it, turning to Slide 3.
As we've discussed over the past few quarters, our core power markets experienced quite a roller coaster ride in 2014 with a particularly severe winter and an extraordinarily mild summer. I'm pleased to report today that due to faultless execution across our core wholesale and retail platforms, we successfully delivered on our fiscal year 2014 financial guidance as revised on last year's Third Quarter Call. Further and as we indicated at our Investor Day, even in the face of continued softening of our core commodity prices, we again are reaffirming our 2015 financial guidance with its prospect of year-over-year growth from 2014. There has been concern about softening commodity prices in the early days of this year, but our excellent operational execution over the past 2 months, combined with the benefits of our diversification away from a 100% reliance on conventional wholesale generation, makes this possible for NRG, makes reaffirming guidance possible in a way that is not always possible for our pure-play IPP peer group.
Building on that theme and turning to Slide 4. Our strategic actions in 2014 continue to lay the foundation for NRG as we build the future of our company in response to the transition that we now believe to be clearly underway in our industry -- oh yes, by the way, I'm still on Slide 3. Following the strategic blueprint provided to us by the winners in the telecom revolution, we have been a big and successful consolidator in the conventional power sector while pushing forward into key phases of the new, more distributed, more sustainable and carbon-constrained world of personal power. We delivered on all of our integration targets for our 2 most significant 2014 acquisitions and did so more quickly than we originally thought possible. We enhanced NRG Yield. And we began the process, through NRG Carbon 360, of providing a long-term future for our younger coal plants even in a decarbonizing world.
Now you should turn to Slide 4. Furthermore, we have been on a strategic path, at least since 2010, to diversify our financial performance away from pure commodity risk. Back in 2007 or 2008, if you would ask me to explain in the most simple terms what NRG did to make money, I would have told you that we sell coal and uranium at natural gas prices. And while I still believe that, for the most part in most markets, it's preferable to sell coal and uranium at natural gas prices than it is, say, to sell natural gas at natural gas prices, NRG has, in the ensuing 5 years, become so much more than just a natural gas commodity play. As illustrated on Slide 4, we have grown our economic gross margin by 70% over those 5 years, all in a relentlessly subdued natural gas price environment, while reducing the contribution of natural-gas-exposed margin by roughly 30%. This is a trend both in terms of growing gross margin and reducing natural gas price correlation that we are working hard to perpetuate. So in a market like we have seen over the past 2 months where natural gas, as again, declined to under $3 per million Btu, we remind you that NRG is not just a natural gas story but is increasingly an investment in the clean energy future, which means, among other attributes, that we are built to weather volatility and gas prices while preserving the upside in the power markets when they materialize.
Moving to Slide 5. Because I've referenced our Investor Day and recognize that not all of you were able to join us in Houston, let me close by reiterating what we took 7 hours to tell you down there into 70 seconds. Here is my pitch, and hopefully, this becomes your NRG investment thesis: Our industry is in the early but unmistakable stage of a technology-driven disruption of historic proportions. This disruption ultimately is going to end in a radically transformed energy industry where the winners are going to be those who offer their customers, whether they be commercial, industrial or individual customers, a seamless energy solution that is safer, cleaner, more reliable, more convenient and increasingly wireless; and I might add, just generally more personalized in what is currently being offered to energy consumers through our current command-and-control, centralized ""one size fits all"" wire and wooden coal system invented by Thomas Edison and seemingly last improved upon in his era.
NRG, through our multiple initiatives in the smart home with home solar, distributed generation, reliability solutions, microgrid, electric vehicle charging and portable solar and energy storage products, is positioning itself to win this long-term future in a way that no other power company is attempting. In the short to medium term, we continue to execute across our consolidated and unrivaled asset platform in a manner that will allow us to win the next few years as the power plants of the post-World War II era create a retirement tsunami washing across our core markets that will benefit us as one of the last men standing, thanks to our substantial investment in environmental remediation over the past 10 years.
With that, I will turn it over to Mauricio."

The extreme market conditions that prevailed in 2014 highlighted some of the strengths of our integrated platform. Our diverse suite in the Northeast benefited from the severe cold weather earlier in the year, and our integrated wholesale/retail platform, combined with our commercial and operational performance, helped mitigate the impact of a very mild summer and allowed us to deliver our 2014 financial results. Perhaps more relevant to you today is the fact that we aggressively hedged the portfolio for 2015 during the fourth quarter, allowing us to reaffirm guidance. While it's still early in the year, I am pleased to say that we're off to a good start with a solid performance during the most recent cold front.
Slide 7 presents the goals that I provided to you last year. And as you can see, we delivered across the board on our safety, operational and commercial metrics. We successfully integrated Edison Mission's 8 gigawatt portfolio, delivered on operational synergies and announced a comprehensive asset optimization plan for the Midwest fleet at attractive economics. On our distributed generation efforts, we successfully integrated the Omaha district energy system and were awarded a contract for 178 megawatts of preferred resources in California. We now have a full suite of distributed solutions for businesses. This, combined with our commercial wholesale platform and access to low-cost capital through NRG Yield, positions the group for a significant growth in 2015. You will hear more about this effort in the months to come.
A critical part of our strategy is the repositioning of our portfolio to out-survive the current wave of retirements and benefits from changes in capacity markets and repowering opportunities. Slide 8 provides a summary of our comprehensive asset optimization and development plan. We currently have close to 12,000 megawatts of generation targeted for fuel conversions, environmental retrofits or repowering opportunities. These initiatives are consistent with our goals of streamlining cost, maintaining or expanding fuel diversity, reducing the environmental footprint of our portfolio and extending the economic life of assets. The projects are progressing as planned, but since some of them are driven primarily by capacity revenues, the outcome of the upcoming capacity performance auction in PJM could change our plans going forward.
Turning to our operational metrics on Slide 9 and beginning with our most important metric, safety. I want to take a moment to thank all of my colleagues for another great year of safety performance, finishing in the top quartile. We had 128 out of 161 facilities without a recordable injury. This is an outstanding result considering the significant winter conditions in the East and the Edison Mission integration efforts beginning in April. It was the second best performance in the last 8 years at a rate of 0.73. While our fleet continues to grow in size and diversity, the one constant continues to be our strong safety performance. I want to recognize our distributed group for a perfect safety record with 0 recordable injuries. Well done.
Our overall generation was up 4% year-over-year on a normalized basis despite the lack of summer demand. The increase was driven primarily by higher generation in the West, a record production year at STP Unit 2 and the higher rounds experienced during the polar vortex in the East. This highlights the importance of a well-diversified portfolio. We continue to balance operational performance with margin at-risk and overall spend throughout this low commodity price environment.
Our coal and nuclear availability was down year-over-year to 82%. However, the fleet showed strong performance during peak pricing periods. This is evidenced in the improved year-over-year coal and nuclear reliability performance.
In the third and final year of the current FORNRG program, we leveraged best practices from the operational synergies efforts in the GenOn facilities and expanded that through the rest of the organization. We achieved an outstanding result of $198 million for the year compared to a goal of $100 million. This success was driven primarily by improvements delivered by plant operations and Texas retail. Thank you to you all, of our colleagues, who provide a commitment and execution behind our continuous improvement culture. We're confident we can continue to deliver the same value to our shareholders in the next iteration of the FORNRG program.
Moving to our market update on Slide 10.
I want to start with natural gas given the recent decline in prices. As David mentioned, we have been very successful in diversifying our margins away from natural gas, but it continues to be an important driver, so let me share a few thoughts. Since the start of the shale gas revolution 6 years ago, the industry has focused almost exclusively on the amount of supply flooding the market. While impressive by any standard, there have been very few catalysts on the demand side until now. Over the next few years, gas demand will likely see a step-change coming primarily from 4 sources: the power industry, LNG, exports to Mexico and industrial demand. This incremental demand could come as early as this year, with additional coal-to-gas switching and implementation of more stringent environmental regulations that will drive coal and oil retirements. Our current head position allows us to weather this low commodity cycle and be ready for a more favorable market environment.
Turning to the East markets. The ISOs are redefining the capacity products and requiring generators to perform during shortage conditions. The changes will allow for higher compensation but will also hold them to higher penalties for non-performance. As a generator with a large diverse portfolio, strong operational track record and fuel on-site, we support and welcome these improvements. The result from the recent New England capacity auction for '18, '19 were quite encouraging, with prices increasing significantly year-over-year. PJM is still awaiting resolution from FERC on its proposal, which is expected to happen sometime in early April. We're excited about our prospects for our portfolio of 17 gigawatts of generation in the region not only for the May auction but also for the transition auctions for the year that have already cleared.
The recent cold front in the Northeast once again proved the value of our diversified portfolio, where unlike gas generation, our coal and oil assets benefited from spikes in gas and power prices. Our strategy is to extend the life of our assets and maintain a cheap option on energy that can benefit from short-term dislocations in the market like the ones we experienced the past 2 winters.
Now moving on to Texas, on Slide 11. Demand grew by 2.4% on a weather-normalized basis in 2014, driven primarily by the residential and commercial sectors. While low oil prices will undoubtedly have an impact on the Texas economy, this will be somewhat muted by the diversification that Texas has been able to achieve in recent years.
A lot has been said about the robust demand in Texas and the need to build new generation, but given the implementation of new environmental programs like MATS, CSAPR and EPA's proposed regional haze rule for Texas, it is important to talk about the potential impact to the supply stack. Make no mistakes, we expect coal to be impacted by these regulations, but as you can see in the table, our portfolio is well positioned to comply with these rules and not only out-survive the competition but benefit from the retirement of other units.
That leads me to the forward market, where prices seem to reflect very little risk premium for the next few summers, as you can see on the upper right-hand chart. For the past 3 years, we have experienced no scarcity pricing despite having single-digit operational reserve margins every year. From our perspective, Texas fundamentals remain robust, and it will not take much change in the supply-demand balance to lead to scarcity pricing in the near term.
Turning to our hedge disclosures on Slide 12. We increased our hedges prior to the winter, which insulated us from the recent drop in natural gas prices. 2015 is well hedged, leaving us in good shape to weather the current downturn. We expect to see some coal-to-gas switching, but the financial impact will be muted for us. Just like we did in 2012, we're diligently working with fuel and transportation suppliers to ensure that our coal plants remain competitive during this extreme low natural gas price environment.
Finally, our goals for 2015 are pretty clear: execute on our asset optimization and development plan and grow our distributed generation business by leveraging our wholesale portfolio.
With that, I will turn it over to Steve for the NRG Home review."

And good morning, everyone.
As we've discussed recently at our investor conference in Houston and as David mentioned this morning in his remarks, it's our view at NRG that traditional, centralized energy service models are significantly at risk. We believe that the future eventually will belong to demand-driven, decentralized models of service that empower individual consumers through sustainable energy solutions that are affordable, personalized, convenient and reliable. NRG Home will continue to serve our customers through our robust, traditional retail electric service franchise while, at the same time, position the business to win in a world where we believe a growing share of the market is going to want and expect to generate and manage a larger share of their own energy.
As you can see from the data on Page 14, our strong performance in 2014 positions us well to achieve both our nearer- and longer-term strategic and financial objectives. Our home retail platform delivered at the upper end of our original financial guidance with adjusted EBITDA of $604 million, enabled in part by customer and product growth as well as by our ongoing commitment to continuous operational improvements that drove material reductions both in per-customer cost and in bad debt.
Our recurring customer count grew by 28%, driven primarily by the Dominion acquisition, which included customer contracts in the Northeast as well as the CERA business in Texas. We're pleased with the success of the Dominion acquisition, which beat estimates of earnings and customer count delivered in 2014. We expect to continue to report the Dominion customer contacts -- excuse me, contracts, separately through 2015, as many of the Northeast customers will roll off during the year as the purchase term contracts expire.
Our customer growth also positions our retail business to accelerate and deepen cross-selling of new products and services that will strengthen our business going forward. In that regard, we're excited that our home retail platform, which currently provides retail electricity and home solar, will be in the market with new offerings this year that include portable power solutions, new battery products and a variety of additional home services.
In 2014, NRG Home also established NRG Home Solar, a leading residential platform formed through the combination of NRG's legacy residential solar solutions team and the acquisition of RDS and of Pure Energy's. We ended the year with over 13,000 home solar customers.
Our success in ramping this business was a result of rapid and successful integration of our new and legacy home solar businesses, our strong kitchen table and telephone sales capabilities, our ability to leverage our key strategic partnerships and our ability to integrate additional NRG home services into our conventional home solar offerings. We also demonstrated early cross-selling success between home solar and home retail, with about 50% of eligible home solar customers supplementing their solar productions with NRG's retail electricity. The strong foundation established for our residential solar business in 2014 positions us to be a top-tier player in this rapidly growing space in 2015 and beyond.
If you flip to Page 15, I'll quickly outline our priorities for 2015 before turning it over to Kirk.
In 2015, we are confident that we will deliver on our home retail financial expectations and that we will establish our home solar business as a Tier 1 player in the rapidly growing residential solar market. We will also operationalize the NRG Home platform toward our longer-term goal of strengthening per-customer EBITDA by further accelerating cross-sell systems that increase tenure and by establishing common operating systems wherever we can to continue to incrementally reduce cost structure. And we will seek and pursue opportunities to scale our organic customer advantage and to enrich our existing product portfolio as we position NRG Home to become the dominant brand for clean and sustainable personal power solutions and services.
Thank you very much for your time this morning. And with that, we'll turn it over to Kirk."

Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 17.
NRG is reporting fourth quarter 2014 adjusted EBITDA of $625 million (sic) [$627 million], with $382 million from business and renew, $165 million from home retail, a $34 million negative contribution from home solar as we continue to position that business for growth and $114 million from NRG Yield. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA totaled $3.128 billion, with $2.134 billion from business and renew combined, $604 million from home retail, a full year of negative contribution from home solar of $65 million and $455 million from NRG Yield.
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, business and renew performance was down $26 million, primarily from milder weather, but partially offset by the acquisition of the EME assets, full commercial operation of CVSR and Ivanpah in 2014 and lower operating costs across the fleet. Retail EBITDA was lower by $15 million, also driven by milder weather, which was partially offset from the incremental margin from increased customers following the Dominion acquisition. Yield results improved by $21 million, driven by the acquisition of the Alta Wind assets, while we increased our investment in home solar by $32 million in the fourth quarter, as compared to 2013.
Free cash flow before growth totaled $951 million for the full year, with $139 million inflow in the fourth quarter.
Turning your attention to our 2015 guidance. And as discussed at our Investor Day, given our hedge levels, we're again reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion, which now excludes the expected negative contribution of $100 million from investment in our growing home solar business. Free cash flow before growth guidance is also reaffirmed, as we continue to expect between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion in 2015.
Turning to Slide 18, I'd like to review a shareholder proposal by NRG Yield, which is contained in the preliminary proxy statement filed by Yield last evening. This proposal, which has been recommended by the NRG Yield independent directors and has the full support of NRG, involves an important recapitalization of NRG Yield intended to achieve 2 important objectives: first, to preserve and maintain the strong strategic support of NRG Yield by NRG; and second, to enhance NRG Yield's flexibility to efficiently access capital to fund growth without the need for capital allocation by NRG towards additional investment in NRG Yield.
This proposal, which requires the vote of a majority of the Class A shares of NRG Yield, involves the creation of 2 classes of low-vote NRG Yield stock, which will be issued through a recapitalization of Yield's equity. NRG Yield would intend to use this new low-vote stock as its primary means of raising equity capital to fund growth going forward. Basically, the proposed recapitalization will take the form of a 2-for-1 stock split of both classes of NRG Yield stock: the Class A stock, which is held by the public; as well as the Class B stock, which is held by NRG, thereby doubling the total number of NRG Yield's shares outstanding.
The new low-vote shares will be issued in 2 distinct classes due to the 2 classes of stock currently held by NRG and the public shareholders. NRG, which holds approximately 42.7 million Class B shares, will receive an equal number of Class D shares each with a 1/100 voting right. As NRG's economic interest is held exclusively through its direct interest in NRG Yield LLC, the new low-vote Class B shares to be issued at NRG will have no economic rights. Each Class A shares held by the public will receive 1 share of Class C stock, with the same economic rights as the Class A stock and a 1/100 voting right. Immediately following the stock split, each shareholder will, through their combined ownership of the classes of stock, have the exact same economic and voting rights as they do today.
Going forward, NRG Yield will be able to issue third-party equity using C shares to fund acquisitions without the need for investment by NRG, as these types of acquisitions are best suited for NRG Yield, while the focus of NRG's capital allocation to fund growth is focused on other core areas. The enhanced flexibility this provides is consistent with the rationale behind the original creation of NRG Yield and preserves the important strategic partnership. NRG's economic ownership will be diluted through future issuances of Class C shares by NRG Yield to help fund growth. However, the proposed plan will allow for approximately $21 billion of equity to be issued, based on today's share price, before NRG's voting interest would fall below 50%, providing substantial headroom for additional equity capital.
In addition to the proposed recapitalization plan, NRG has agreed to add additional assets to the ""right of first offer"" agreement. This expanded ROFO pipeline provides additional visibility in NRG Yield's long-term dividend growth and total return in order to preserve its ""low cost of capital"" advantage. The assets added to the expanded ROFO pipeline include NRG's Carlsbad and Mandalay repowering projects recently awarded in the ongoing RFOs for new contracted generation in California. Following CPUC approval, NRG will develop and construct these assets, which at COD may be offered to NRG Yield, providing additional asset diversity in the years beyond the expected completion of the original ROFO pipeline.
These types of projects enabled by and a testament to the strength of the NRG-NRG Yield partnership underscore the need for the enhanced flexibility the proposed recapitalization will provide. In terms of next steps, NRG Yield expects to file and distribute a definitive proxy statement on or about March 26. NRG Yield has conditioned the proposal so that it does require the approval of a majority of the Class A shareholders at its annual meeting on May 5 of this year. NRG strongly supports the proposal as approved by the independent directors of NRG Yield, and we ask for the support of the public shareholders of NRG Yield in this important step in building on the tremendous success of the NRG-NRG Yield relationship.
Finally, updating our capital allocation progress on Slide 19.
NRG ended 2014 with an excess cash balance of $1.26 billion. This excess cash balance, which is net of minimum cash at NRG, GenOn and NRG Yield, when combined with NRG's increased 2015 free cash flow before growth investments guidance, leads to $2.46 billion in consolidated cash available for allocation during 2015. Of this amount, we have committed nearly $1.7 billion of capital, including $250 million or approximately 20% of our 2015 free cash flow to be returned to shareholders through the combination of our recently completed stock buyback program announced last December and a 4% increase in our annual dividend.
Our growth investments guidance of $900 million for 2015 is primarily driven by operational improvement initiatives across the fleet: approximately $150 million of investment in home solar installations; as well as continued investments in solar, Carbon 360 and eVgo.
$800 million in remaining cash available for allocation, which is prior to any proceeds from NRG Yield drop-downs in 2015, consists of $600 million at the GenOn level, which is intended to fund our ongoing fuel conversion initiatives, with the remaining $200 million at the NRG level. Importantly, this balance does not reflect the impact of NRG Yield drop-downs in 2015. As we intend to offer NRG Yield the next portfolio of ROFO assets, which we expect to consist of the remaining wind assets from the EME acquisition, during the first half of 2015, the capital replenishment from this transaction will further increase NRG's excess capital. Specifically, when combined with the residential solar lease drop-down currently under evaluation at NRG Yield, the proceeds from the wind assets are expected to generate between $250 million and $300 million in cash to NRG. Once this drop-down is finalized in the first half of the year, we will revisit further capital allocation decisions based on conditions and opportunities at that time, which may be further augmented by a second ROFO portfolio, likely the remaining stake in CVSR, in late 2015.
With that, I'll turn it back to David for his closing remarks."

Angie, the first part of your question, as I think you know, largely due to the successful equity issuance to fund the Alta Wind acquisition, that being a third-party acquisition, our current ownership stake in NRG Yield is about 55%. And while we recognize the possibility at the outset that, when we drop down assets into NRG Yield, we may take some portion of that consideration in kind, it is a different proposition entirely to consider the possibility of incremental cash investment in NRG Yield to help support that ownership relationship. And what I mean by that is, if you extrapolate it forward on a potential third-party acquisition the size of Alta Wind, for example, in order to put NRG to remain -- to maintain its 50-plus-percent ownership, that would require NRG to actually allocate capital and invest in Yield's equity, effectively investing in those types of projects over the long run. And while certainly those projects are financially compelling, it was the very motivation behind the creation of NRG Yield to separate those kinds of investments so that they reside in a vehicle that's properly positioned for that kind of risk in a return profile. So because those assets are high EBITDA multiples, that will be tantamount to NRG investing capital or allocating capital towards a high-yield gamble [ph]. This allows us to allocate that capital appropriately towards the types of investments, conventional and the like, and towards some of the growth initiatives at NRG that are more appropriately our core focus. I think on the second part of your question, although I think we've outlined the structure within the relationship between NRG and NRG Yield, the important distinction here is we plan on tax equity financings, primarily the tax attributes from residential solar leases as they're dropped down to NRG Yield. NRG Yield's participation in that is actually investing in the residual equity, after-tax equity, so NRG Yield is not providing tax equity. And using tax equity allows us to manage effectively the duration of that tax holiday or that tax runway, if you will. We have the flexibility, from time to time, to drop-down assets without tax attributes, giving NRG Yield the ability to augment its tax-yielding ability, but I think, given the nature of the broader portfolio, we'd use tax equity to help manage that."

But as I've said a number of times, our primary goal is to ensure that NRG Yield has a maximum competitive advantage and low cost of capital. And from our perspective, the best means to do that is for NRG Yield to realize the maximum incremental potential CAFD without the drag, if you will, of an IDR. The other element of that is, at the NRG level, because the IDR would basically be cash flow or EBITDA back to NRG, which obviously goes back to an entity with a lower EBITDA multiple, we wanted to maximize that portion of the cash flows that was associated with those contracted plans to ensure that it traded at the higher valuation. And we think the absence of an IDR addresses that issue, as well as the fact it ensures that NRG Yield can be more competitive and/or have a competitive advantage from a realization of accretion relative to some of the other competitors out there whose IDRs can deter or detract from the accretion when we compete for assets in the third-party market."

Somewhat usually, we're actually communicating with you from multiple locations, so if we run into some technological issues, please bear with us. 
We've got a lot of great new to update you on today and I realize we're starting slightly later than normal and during market hours, so we're going to get right into it and try and get through it as quickly as we can giving you all the information you need.
Starting on Slide 3 of the presentation. The story of NRG's First Quarter 2015 is quite simple. Record financial performance. $840 million of adjusted EBITDA, breaking our previous record, which was set just last year. This achievement is truly remarkable given that, that previous high in 2014 had received a substantial boost from the polar vortex, which occurred in January of that year. But what's even more remarkable is that we beat the existing record in the face of a very, very soft wholesale pricing in our core market. Average on-peak prices in PJM in the first quarter of 2015 were just 50% of what they were in the first quarter of 2014. In Arcot in the first quarter, the average on-peak prices were just 40% of what they were last year. In my mind and hopefully in yours, this is proof positive of the superiority of our integrated wholesale retail business lines. But of course, the right business model only gets you to the starting line. Our record first quarter performance is an entirely attributable did a superb execution of our planned operations and commercial operations teams from the first day of the quarter to the last, so I want to publicly thank Mauricio, Chris Moser, Frank Sullivan and their respective teams for a quarter very well done. And I especially want to thank Elizabeth Killinger and her entire team at NRG retail for simply hitting the ball out of the park with a stunning $166 million of adjusted EBITDA.
Moving to Slide 4. I want to note a couple of critical issues on the slide that Mauricio and Kirk will cover more completely in their sections of the presentation. We realized that we're talking amidst of a persistently challenging price environment and NRG's conventional businesses are, for the most part, exposed to commodity price curve base valuations. For that reason, it has been a comment in the market over the past several years for analysts to evaluate businesses like ours on an open EBITDA basis. While I have no particular problem intellectually or otherwise with open EBITDA analysis, it obviously fails to take into account the value of a savvy-hedging program well executed on a timely basis. And that is what we have at NRG and that is what we've demonstrated.
For years, it's been the strategy of NRG to smooth out as much of the downward price curve volatility as we can through this active baseload hedging program. This quarter has been no exception. I'm very pleased with what our hedging team has accomplished, both with respect to the balance of 2015 and into 2016.
As you all know, spot natural gas prices are indeed very low in particular, but we have seen this movie before back in 2012. We did okay then and I'm confident we will do okay again now and we'll navigate our way through this trial successfully, thanks to the significant part to the hedging program that Mauricio will shine some light on later.
The other topic I'll address on this slide, which also will be touched upon by both the Mauricio and Kirk, is cash flow and capital expenditures. NRG always has been a cash flow generative machine and indeed, from the beginning of the new NRG era in 2003, I told our investor that we always would manage NRG forecasts and that has not changed. It has, however, been obscured recently by the fact that we are right in the middle of the 3-year spike in our CapEx, arising largely out of the GenOn and EME acquisitions as we spent an unusually large amount on major maintenance, environmental remediation, fuel conversions and repowerings of our expanded fleet. While we're not yet quite at the end of the tunnel with respect to this program, we are almost over the hump. Mauricio will show how the reinvestment program wraps up in 2016. And come 2017, NRG shareholders will experience the twin benefit both of the EBITDA generated by those repowering and converted assets and also the substantially greater free cash available for other allocations.
Since we do expect to have substantially more capital to allocate, I think it's long past time that we, and particularly me, provide you with some simplified clarity as to how we think about capital allocation at NRG in the past and into the foreseeable future. 
So if you turn to Slide 5, you will see 2 simple ways to think about capital allocation at NRG. What we call the SMI 2010 principal and the 1/3 rule or the thirds rule.
First, with respect to 70, 20, 10. Since NRG embarked on its present strategic course 4 to 5 years ago, namely to continue to consolidate and flourish in the conventional power sector while positioning ourselves as an early mover on green clean energy, we settled on a rough rule of thumb for our capital expenditures. 70%, reinvestment in the assets and businesses that generate the preponderance of our current cash flow; 20%, invested as equity capital and contracted assets that constitute the best and most realizable growth opportunities for NRG in the post-merchant area; and 10%, invested into more speculative early mover projects and businesses that have the potential out to meaningfully expand the universe of opportunities for our business.
When describing the 70, 20, 10 rule internally, which is something we actually do a lot, it's not uncommon for us to draw the analogy to allocation of labor and agriculture. 70% of the time spent on harvesting; 20% of the time spent growing; and 10%, planting seeds. While 70, 20, 10 is more a guideline for us than a hard and fast rule, it's a good metric and we believe this us served us and our shareholders well in terms of the current positioning of the company and we plan to continue with it. We introduce it to you here to help you understand how we are thinking about reinvesting this cash-generative business over the next few years.
On the bottom half of Slide 5, I'd turn to a more recent and high-quality phenomena, what to do with the substantial amount of cash proceeds to be returned NRG as a result of asset drop downs to NRG Yield. This is highly relevant issue as we expect roughly $600 million of drop-down -- drop-downs NRG Yield to be announced over the balance of 2015. The way we think about this is that the removal on an unconsolidated basis of NRG's contracted and non-commodity exposed cash generative assets over time from NRG's balance sheet do NRG Yield's balance sheet requires us to think about the pro forma NRG balance sheet left supporting the merchant, i.e., commodity exposed side of our business. Without the contracted assets, it seems to us that the prudent thing to do is some rightsizing of that pro forma balance sheet. With such rightsizing involving both voluntary debt reduction and equity retirement. We also of course, have to allocate some drop-down proceeds to restocking the pipeline of contracted assets for future drop-downs. As such, and Kirk will explain this further, we're announcing today a third, a third, a third rule associated with the receipt of future drop-down proceeds.
On a final note and to amplify something I said on this topic when we announced the $100 million Phase II of our share buyback program in March, was that we believe, given how much the company's businesses have evolved over the past several years, there remains a significant disconnect in distortion between the companies performance and prospects on one hand and the commodity price curve lens through which Wall Street views us and anticipates our future performance on the other hand.
for example, the fact that we can be announcing here a record first quarter projecting a full year result well in excess of $3 billion of adjusted EBITDA and clearly becoming a real player in the red-hot home solar space. And our stock is down some 50% since last summer, largely I believe because we exist in sub-$3 natural gas price environment. Surely, there have been other contributing factors contributing to our abysmal share price performance. Some of our own making, some of my own making, but this gas price environment looms largest notwithstanding its demonstrably reduced relevance to our near-term financial performance.
With the $80 million we added to the buyback bucket today and the $200 million of drop-down proceeds connected from buybacks that we expected we charge the buyback program as the year goes on, I want to reiterate that we fully intend to enter the market to snap up our stock when it could be had that the exceptional bar again and current price levels.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mauricio."

We're off to a good start in 2015 with our integrated platform performing exceptionally well during the quarter.

We're off to a good start in 2015 with our integrated platform performing exceptionally well during the quarter. A combination of higher retail loads in Texas, opportunistic hedging and solid operational performance allowed us to once again report record financial results for the quarter, but more importantly, reaffirm guidance for the year.
Keep in mind, these results were achieved despite the fact that wholesale power prices were 50% lower than last year. Underscoring the importance of our integrated platform that performs under multiple price and weather scenarios.
During the quarter, we also significantly increased our hedges in 2016, effectively protecting our earnings for the next 2 years given our concerns on lower gas prices for this summer. In addition, our wholesale asset optimization and development program, which I will discuss in more detail in a few slides, remains largely on track.
Moving to our wholesale operation on metrics on Slide 7. We had another quarter of top quartile safety performance with 147 out of 167 facilities without a single recordable injury. Total generation was down 12% for the quarter on a pro forma basis, driven primarily by lower generation in the East where power prices were 50% lower than last year.
In the Gulf, generation was flat as nuclear and gas generation offset lower coal production. And in the West, generation was impacted by the retirement of our Coldwater plant.
Reliability improved during the quarter, demonstrating our effort to ensure that our units are available when it matters the most, during peak price periods. Over time, these metrics will become more relevant on the new capacity performance construct. The operational steam remains focused on executing our spring outage season with nearly 173 planned outages, a significant logistical task when you have more than 150 sites across your portfolio.
Turning to home operations on Slide 8. I am pleased to report that our retail business had another strong quarter, delivering $166 million in adjusted EBITDA, exceeding last year's first quarter by $51 million. These results were driven by effective margin and risk management, combined with colder-than-normal weather and lower supply costs. Margins were strong and consistent with last year's quarterly performance, despite the addition of lower margin Dominion load. One year later, we continue to achieve better-than-expected results from the Dominion acquisition on both customer count and EBITDA. Our customer count is performing in line with plan given the anticipated Dominion contract expirations, which we expect to be complete by year-end.
Additionally, we continue to make progress across our Home Solar segment. During the fourth quarter, our customer base increased to over 16,000 customers, an increase of 21% since the end of 2014. More importantly, however, during the month of April, we entered into a new partnership with NRG Yield and executed on addition tax financings to help facilitate our growth through the end of the year. Kirk will discuss this in more detail.
Moving on to our market update on Slide 9, and starting with the Northeast as the most immediate opportunity for our generation portfolio. As you can see in the left-hand chart, we're seeing very robust forward energy prices in PGM, the supply tightens due to stricter environmental regulations benefiting our entire 17 gigawatts portfolio. In the medium term, the opportunity turns from energy to capacity margins with implementation of capacity reforms in PJM and New England, which focuses on high reliability during shortage conditions. These premium capacity products will most likely result in higher prices in exchange for higher penalties for nonperformance. As a generator with a large and diverse portfolio of fuel on site, we welcome these changes. Furthermore, our field conversion and compliance strategy enabled us capitalize on this opportunity.
Turning to our costs. I want to highlight the value of our integrated platform as a key differentiator versus solid generators. Not only were we able to outperform during a period of very low commodity prices, but in a time of lower liquidity in the market, we have a natural hedge between our wholesale portfolio and our retail franchise. In the medium term, we believe our portfolio is well positioned to benefit for a very fragile situation in Texas. Currently, there are 2 divergent views in the market. ERCOT recently released their latest CDR report where they see reserve margins expanding by 5% in 2018 and beyond and putting them well above target reserve margins. This outlook, from our perspective, is a best case scenario, requiring 3 assumptions to happen at the same time. Low, low growth, incremental new supply and Seo retirements. We're skeptical about this. Over the past few years, load grew at an average of 2% on a weather-normalized basis. We expect less than forecasted new builds as participants respond rationally to a very depressed or market and we expect greater than steel retirements given the challenging price environment and stricter environmental rules.
When we do not see us apply rationalization, our Texas fleet of surviving: And gas units will be well positioned to capture additional value.
Moving to our hedging disclosure on Slide 10. We have turned our focus to 2016 where we have increased significantly our hedge level to roughly 75%, effectively reducing our commodity risk and cash flow variation for the next 2 years. This is particularly important as we progress through to higher-than-average CapEx years for our wholesale portfolio.
I want to take a moment and briefly explain the 2015 hedge levels of 109%. Remember that this percentage represents the amount of hedges sold against our currently expected generation. And I emphasized the world expected. There will be times when the expected generation decreases due to market changes and unless we immediately buyback our hedges, these will result in a hedge level about 100%. It is not that we over hedged the portfolio for rather, a timing issue on when we report results and when we by some of our hedges back.
On the fuel side, we have seen significant decreases in commodity, fuel surcharges and transportation costs this year. We're working closer with our coal supply chain partners to layer in additional hedges to balance our para sales.
Finally, on Slide 11 is a summary of our asset optimization and development plan that I discussed with you on our last earnings call. I want to highlight 3 points that may not be fully appreciated. First, we're deploying this capital at very attractive returns. contracted opportunities are good NRG Yield candidates where capital can be replenished at a premium. And the assets revitalization program in days is done at very low multiples compared to new build economics.
Second, and as David mentioned in his remarks, this plan represents a significant commitment to our conventional business given the borrowing opportunities that we see and the changes in capacity markets.
And finally, as you can see in the bottom right-hand chart, this plan is frontloaded in 2015 and 2016. Beyond that, there is very little incremental environmental CapEx to comply with existing regulations. Of course, as we identify new opportunities or senior environmental regulations, the outlook can change. But for now, there is a significant decrease in committed capital beyond 2016 that translates into additional free cash flow for the company.
As we turn our attention to the summer months, I want to reassure you that we are focused on executing on near-term market opportunities, repositioning our generation portfolio and leveraging our integrated platform.
With that, I will turn it over to Kirk."
413857,292558398,808192,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 08, 2015",2015-05-08,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the financial summary on Slide 13. For the first 3 months of 2015, adjusted EBITDA totaled $840 million, which is an increase of $23 million over the same period in 2014. NRG's record adjusted EB",1578,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the financial summary on Slide 13. For the first 3 months of 2015, adjusted EBITDA totaled $840 million, which is an increase of $23 million over the same period in 2014. NRG's record adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2015 was achieved, thanks to outstanding results from our wholesale and retail businesses and augmented by contributions from the assets acquired in EME, Win and Dominion transactions, which combined to more than offset the impact of extreme weather first quarter last year. For the first quarter, free cash flow before growth totaled $364 million.
Supported by our substantial hedge position and the strong start to the year, we are once again reaffirming both EBITDA and free cash flow guidance with our expectations continuing to track to the upper quartile of those ranges. 
NRG also made substantial progress during the quarter on a number of fronts. Earlier this week, the public shareholders of NRG Yield improved -- approved the proposal to create 2 new share classes via a stock split, providing both ongoing capital refection for NRG and substantial funding capacity for yield without the need for further NRG investment. With this important step now behind us, we are pleased to announce a new framework for the allocation of a portion of NRG's excess capital equivalent to future drop-down proceeds to be committed towards the balance of share repurchases, corporate debt reduction and reinvestment in future NRG Yield eligible projects.
Going forward, we expect residential solar leases to represent a meaningful portion of future drop-downs, thanks to a newly established partnership with NRG Yield, which will promote our Home Solar business to benefit by accessing a more competitive cost of capital while providing a new source of CAFB growth per yield. And having meaningfully expanded our Home Solar tax equity run rate with 2 new facilities, we have the 2 key pieces in place to realize value at NRG today in excess of the capital requirements of this fast-growing business. 
We have also established a similar a new $100 million partnership with NRG Yield for future drop-downs of EG Solar assets, which we expect to occur with the balance of 2015, providing further value realization at NRG and expanded growth for Yield. We will provide more details on this important partnership in the next quarter as we initiate our first Digi solar drop-down. 
Finally, having completed $56 million of the $100,000,000 second phase of our 2015 share buyback program, we are pleased to announce an increase of $81 million to this second phase, thereby increasing remaining capacity to $125 million, providing us additional repurchasing power, which will be further augmented by future repurchases enabled by the NRG Yield drop-down 1/3 rule David mentioned earlier.
Turning to Slide 14, I'd like to provide a few highlights of the recently approved NRG Yield recapitalization, which provides significant benefits to both companies.
The creation of the 1/100 [ph] both class C shares provides NRG Yield a substantial source of equity growth funding without reliance on NRG capital. These new C shares will be the primary source of future equity in NRG Yield and the low growth structure to yield the ability to raise over $20 billion in new public equity without jeopardizing the strategic relationship with NRG. The 2-for-1 stock split at NRG Yield will be effective May 14, with no change in total dividends paid. As a result, we have now also expanded the pipeline of assets to include 900 megawatts consisting primarily of the EME wind assets, which we expect to offer NRG Yield later this quarter. The expended pipeline now also includes up to 250 million in residential, solar and Digi portfolios and 800 megawatts of long-term contracted gas comprised of our Carlsbad and Mandalay projects in California expected to reach COD in 2017 and 2020.
On Slide 15 is a summary of the expected impact of our tax equity facilities and new NRG Yield partnership in realizing the key objective I first introduced at Investor Day in January. Monetizing leases at value to NRG today. Partnering with Yield provides Home Solar access to competitively advantage capital while enhancing NRG Yield's CF growth. We've already dropped down approximately 2,000 existing leases to NRG Yield for $26 million in proceeds. And in addition, the $150 million equity commitment from NRG Yield and the associated tax equity proceeds provides capacity to monetize approximately 13,000 additional leases at value in excess of our expected capital requirements leading to $100 million in near-term value to be realized by NRG in 2015.
This should also put us well along the path to realize total value, which also exceeds G&A and marketing expenses for all of 2015 as we expect to seek future authorization to fund our ongoing leasing efforts over the balance of the year. NRG Yield will benefit from a targeted 7.5% CAFB yield over the least term, which equates to approximately $11 million in annual CAFB from its initial $150 million investment.
Turning to Slide 16. I'd like to provide some additional details on the 70, 20, 10 capital expenditure guideline David mentioned earlier. The chart shows capital expenditures by year, which includes maintenance and environmental CapEx as well as the growth investments portion of capital allocation. These are categorized by conventional, which is primarily wholesale and retail; proven growth, our contracted assets; and high-growth opportunities. To provide some historical perspective, I've included 2013 and 2014.
Turning to 2015, NRG has committed $1.7 billion in capital expenditures. Approximately 70% is reinvestment in our conventional businesses, which provide the bulk of NRG's cash generative power and is largely comprised of our asset optimization projects, environmental capital to includes the Midwest Gen assets and maintenance to ensure reliability across the fleet. We've committed 20% to yield-eligible contracted assets including residential solar and Digi solar and approximately 10% to E be go and our Carbon 360 project.
In 2016, we expect $1.6 billion in total CapEx consistent with 70, 20, 10 as we complete our environmental and asset optimization programs and bring Carbon 360 to COD in early 2017. We expect to continue our yield eligible investment program in 2016  indiscernible] 1/3 Rule, which will then include spend in Iraq California contracted gas plants.
Beyond 2016, as I mentioned on Investor Day, having completed our environmental programs that bring the fleet to current lines, we expect a significant reduction in currently committed capital of over $500 million, which is also aided by the completion of the Carbon 360 project and the reduction in maintenance CapEx. This should provide significant capital allocation flexibility and help ensure the continued delivery of robust free cash flow.
Turning to Slide 17. NRG expects to offer assets do NRG Yield over the remainder of 2015 with anticipated equity proceeds totaling approximately $600 million. These drop-down proceeds are expected to be realized in 2 equal structures to be offered in the second and fourth quarter of the year, with the first consisting primarily of the EME wind assets and the second anchored remaining stake in CVSR currently held by NRG.
We also expect the drop-down residential solar and Digi portfolios over the course of the year. In order to provide greater clarity, maintain our target ratios and continue to return capital to shareholders, we are announcing a new plan as a part of capital allocation based on future drop-down proceeds. We will allocate capital and amount consistent with these proceeds in thirds toward share purchases, corporate debt reduction and investment in future yield eligible projects.
The application to debt reduction is sized to offset the impact on corporate EBITDA from the portion of CAFB, which will support dividends paid to NRG Yield's public shareholders, thereby allowing us to maintain our key credit metrics following each drop-down.
Sizing our capital allocation to share purchases should help further clarify the direct benefit of NRG Yield to our shareholders. These future buyback allocations our incremental to the expansion of Phase II of our buyback program we announced today. Recycling the remaining proceeds helps replenish the drop-down pipeline with greater capital efficiency.
Turning to Slide 18. By adding the expected proceeds from drop-down offerings over the remainder of 2015, NRG's gross capital available for allocation is just over $3 billion this year. Inclusive of the impact of the 1 thirds plan and the expanded Phase II buyback program, we have committed $2.2 billion of this capital, nearly half of which is allocated to preserving balance sheet strength and returning capital to our shareholders.
Committed growth of $960 million represents the growth component of the 70, 20, 10 capital expenditures guideline I reviewed earlier. Of the $860 million in excess capital then remaining in 2015, $500 million resides at the GenOn level, a portion of which will fund the completion of our operational improvement program there in 2016.
NRG level excess capital is $360 million, which includes the portion of the 1 thirds plan earmarked for future NRG Yield eligible investment.
And in summary on Slide 19, in addition to our excellent quarterly performance, our enhanced capital allocation program, NRG Yield recap and new NRG Yield partnerships, place NRG on firm footing to ensure continued balance sheet strength and expanded return of shareholder capital while harnessing the power of the NRG Yield Costa capital. The benefit are growing home solar, DG and contracted assets initiatives.
With that, I'll turn it back to David for his closing remarks."

Thank you for joining us.

Additionally and available for questions are Chris Moser, who heads our Commercial Operations; Elizabeth Killinger, who's the Head of Home Retail; and Kelcy Pegler, Jr., who's the Head of Home Solar. Somewhat unusually, we're actually communicating with you from multiple locations, so if we run into some technological issues, please bear with us. 
We've got a lot of great news to update you on today, and I realize we're starting slightly later than normal and during market hours, so we're going to get right into it and try and get through it as quickly as we can, giving you all the information you need.
Starting on Slide 3 of the presentation. The story of NRG's first quarter 2015 is quite simple. Record financial performance. $840 million of adjusted EBITDA, breaking our previous record, which was set just last year. This achievement is truly remarkable given that previous high in 2014 had received a substantial boost from the polar vortex, which occurred in January of that year. But what's even more remarkable is that we beat the existing record in the face of a very, very soft wholesale pricing in our core market. Average on-peak prices in PJM in the first quarter of 2015 were just 50% of what they were in the first quarter of 2014. In ERCOT in the first quarter, the average on-peak prices were just 40% of what they were last year. 
In my mind and hopefully in yours, this is proof positive of the superiority of our integrated wholesale retail business model. But of course, the right business model only gets you to the starting line. Our record first quarter performance is entirely attributable to the superb execution of our plant operations and commercial operations teams from the first day of the quarter to the last, so I want to publicly thank Mauricio, Chris Moser, Fran Sullivan and their respective teams for a quarter very well done. And I especially want to thank Elizabeth Killinger and her entire team at NRG Retail for simply hitting the ball out of the park with a stunning $166 million of adjusted EBITDA.
Moving to Slide 4. I want to note a couple of critical issues on this slide that Mauricio and Kirk will cover more completely in their sections of the presentation. We realize that we're talking amidst of a persistently challenging commodity price environment, and NRG's conventional businesses are, for the most part, exposed to commodity price curve-based valuation. For that reason, it has become common in the market over the past several years for analysts to evaluate businesses like ours on an open EBITDA basis. While I have no particular problem intellectually or otherwise with open EBITDA analysis, it obviously fails to take into account the value of a savvy hedging program well executed on a timely basis. And that is what we have at NRG, and that's what we've demonstrated.
For years, it's been the strategy of NRG to smooth out as much of the downward price curve volatility as we can through this active baseload hedging program. This quarter has been no exception, and I'm very pleased with what our hedging team has accomplished, both with respect to the balance of 2015 and into 2016.
As you all know, spot natural gas prices are indeed very low, in particular, but we have seen this movie before back in 2012. We did okay then, and I'm confident we will do okay again now and we'll navigate our way through this trial successfully, thanks to significant parts of the hedging program that Mauricio will shine some light on later.
The other topic I'd address on this slide, which also will be touched upon by both Mauricio and Kirk, is cash flow and capital expenditures. NRG always has been a cash flow-generative machine, and indeed, from the beginning of the new NRG era in 2003, I told our investors that we always would manage NRG forecast, and that has not changed. It has, however, been obscured recently by the fact that we are right in the middle of the 3-year spike in our CapEx, arising largely out of the GenOn and EME acquisitions as we spend an unusually large amount on major maintenance, environmental remediation, fuel conversions and repowerings of our expanded fleet. While we're not yet quite at the end of the tunnel with respect to this program, we are almost over the hump. Mauricio will show how the reinvestment program wraps up in 2016, and come 2017, NRG shareholders will experience the twin benefit both of the EBITDA generated by those repowered and converted assets and also of the substantially greater free cash available for other allocations.
Since we do expect to have substantially more capital to allocate, I think it's long past time that we, and particularly me, provide you with some simplified clarity as to how we think about capital allocation at NRG in the past and into the foreseeable future. So if you turn to Slide 5, you will see 2 simple ways to think about capital allocation at NRG, what we call the 70-20-10 principle and the 1/3 rule or the 1/3s rule.
First, with respect to 70-20-10. Since NRG embarked on its present strategic course 4 to 5 years ago, namely to continue to consolidate and flourish in the conventional power sector while positioning ourselves as an early mover on clean energy, we settled on a rough rule of thumb for our capital expenditures: 70% reinvestment in the assets and businesses that generate the preponderance of our current cash flow; 20% invested as equity capital and contracted assets that constitute the best and most realizable growth opportunities for NRG in the post-merchant area; and 10% invested into more speculative early-mover projects and businesses that have the potential to meaningfully expand the universe of opportunities for our business.
When describing the 70-20-10 rule internally, which is something we actually do a lot, it's not uncommon for us to draw the analogy to allocation of labor and agriculture: 70% of the time spent on harvesting, 20% of the time spent growing and 10% planting seeds. While 70-20-10 is more a guideline for us than a hard-and-fast rule, it's a good metric, and we believe it has served us and our shareholders well in terms of the current positioning of the company, and we plan to continue with it. We introduce it to you here to help you understand how we are thinking about reinvesting this cash-generative business over the next few years.
On the bottom half of Slide 5, I'd turn to a more recent and high-quality phenomenon, what to do with the substantial amount of cash proceeds to be returned to NRG as a result of asset drop-downs to NRG Yield. This is highly relevant issue as we expect roughly $600 million of drop-down -- drop-downs NRG Yield to be announced over the balance of 2015. The way we think about this is that the removal on an unconsolidated basis of NRG's contracted and non-commodity-exposed, cash-generative assets over time from NRG's balance sheet to NRG Yield's balance sheet requires us to think about the pro forma NRG balance sheet left supporting the merchant, i.e. commodity-exposed side of our business. Without the contracted assets, it seems to us that the prudent thing to do is some rightsizing of that pro forma balance sheet, with such rightsizing involving both voluntary debt reduction and equity retirement. We also, of course, have to allocate some drop-down proceeds to restocking the pipeline of contracted assets for future drop-downs. As such, and Kirk will explain this further, we are announcing today 1/3-1/3-1/3 rule associated with the receipt of future drop-down proceeds.
On a final note and to amplify something I said on this topic when we announced the $100 million Phase 2 of our share buyback program in March was that we believe, given how much the company's businesses have evolved over the past several years, there remains a significant disconnect and distortion between the company's performance and prospects on one hand and the commodity price curve lens through which Wall Street views us and anticipates our future performance on the other hand.
Witness, for example, the fact that we can be announcing here a record first quarter, projecting a full year result well in excess of $3 billion of adjusted EBITDA and clearly becoming a real player in the red-hot home solar space, and our stock is down some 50% since last summer, largely, I believe, because we exist in a sub-$3 natural gas price environment. Surely, there have been other contributing factors contributing to our abysmal share price performance, some of our own making, some of my own making, but this gas price environment looms largest notwithstanding its demonstrably reduced relevance to our near-term financial performance.
With the $80 million we added to the buyback bucket today and the $200 million of drop-down proceeds connected from buybacks that we expect to recharge the buyback program as the year goes on, I want to reiterate that we fully intend to enter the market to snap up our stock when it can be had at the exceptional bargain of buying at current price levels.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mauricio."

We're off to a good start in 2015 with our integrated platform performing exceptionally well during the quarter. A combination of higher retail loads in Texas, opportunistic hedging and solid operational performance allowed us to once again report record financial results for the quarter but more importantly, reaffirm guidance for the year. Keep in mind, these results were achieved despite the fact that wholesale power prices were 50% lower than last year, underscoring the importance of our integrated platform that performs under multiple price and weather scenarios.
During the quarter, we also significantly increased our hedges in 2016, effectively protecting our earnings for the next 2 years given our concerns on lower gas prices for this summer. In addition, our wholesale asset optimization and development program, which I will discuss in more detail in a few slides, remains largely on track.
Moving to our wholesale operational metrics on Slide 7. We had another quarter of top-quartile safety performance, with 147 out of 167 facilities without a single recordable injury. Total generation was down 12% for the quarter on a pro forma basis, driven primarily by lower generation in the East, where power prices were 50% lower than last year.  In the Gulf, generation was flat as nuclear and gas generation offset lower coal production. And in the West, generation was impacted by the retirement of our Coldwater plant.
Reliability improved during the quarter, demonstrating our effort to ensure that our units are available when it matters the most, during peak price periods. Over time, this metric will become more relevant under the new capacity performance contract. The operations team remains focused on executing our spring outage season with nearly 173 planned outages, a significant logistical task when you have more than 150 sites across your portfolio.
Turning to Home operations on Slide 8. I am pleased to report that our Retail business had another strong quarter, delivering $166 million in adjusted EBITDA, exceeding last year's first quarter by $51 million. These results were driven by effective margin and risk management combined with colder-than-normal weather and lower supply costs. Margins were strong and consistent with last year's quarterly performance despite the addition of lower-margin Dominion load. One year later, we continue to achieve better-than-expected results from the Dominion acquisition on both customer count and EBITDA. Our customer count is performing in line with plan given the anticipated Dominion contract expirations, which we expect to be complete by year-end.
Additionally, we continue to make progress across our Home Solar segment. During the first quarter, our customer base increased to over 16,000 customers, an increase of 21% since the end of 2014. More importantly, however, during the month of April, we entered into a new partnership with NRG Yield and executed on addition tax equity financings to help facilitate our growth through the end of the year. Kirk will discuss this in more detail.
Moving on to our market update on Slide 9 and starting with the Northeast as the most immediate opportunity for our generation portfolio. As you can see in the left-hand chart, we're seeing very robust forward energy prices in PJM as supply tightens due to stricter environmental regulations, benefiting our entire 17 gigawatt portfolio. In the medium term, the opportunity turns from energy to capacity margins with the implementation of capacity reforms in PJM and New England, which focuses on higher reliability during shortage conditions. These premium capacity products will most likely result in higher prices in exchange for higher penalties for nonperformance. As a generator with a large and diverse portfolio with fuel on site, we welcome these changes. Furthermore, our fuel conversion and compliance strategy enable us to capitalize on this opportunity.
Turning to our costs. I want to highlight the value of our integrated platform as a key differentiator versus solar generators. Not only were we able to outperform during a period of very low commodity prices, but in a time of lower liquidity in the market, we have a natural hedge between our wholesale portfolio and our retail franchise. In the medium term, we believe our portfolio is well positioned to benefit from a very fragile situation in Texas. Currently, there are 2 divergent views in the market. ERCOT recently released their latest CDR report, where they see reserve margins expanding by 5% in 2018 and beyond and putting them well above target reserve margins. This outlook, from our perspective, is a best-case scenario, requiring 3 assumptions to happen at the same time: low load growth, incremental new supply and 0 retirements. We're skeptical about this. Over the past few years, load grew at an average of 2% on a weather-normalized basis. We expect less-than-forecasted new builds as participants respond rationally to a very depressed forward market, and we expect greater than 0 retirements given the challenging price environment and stricter environmental rules. When we do see a supply rationalization, our Texas fleet of surviving coal and gas units will be well positioned to capture additional value.
Moving to our hedging disclosures on Slide 10. We have turned our focus to 2016, where we have increased significantly our hedge levels to roughly 75%, effectively reducing our commodity risk and cash flow variation for the next 2 years. This is particularly important as we progress through higher-than-average CapEx years for our wholesale portfolio.
I want to take a moment and briefly explain the 2015 hedge levels of 109%. Remember that this percentage represents the amount of hedges sold against our currently expected generation, and I emphasize the world expected. There will be times when the expected generation decreases due to market changes, and unless we immediately buy back our hedges, this will result in a hedge level about 100%. It is not that we over-hedged the portfolio but rather a timing issue on when we report results and when we buy some of our hedges back.
On the fuel side, we have seen significant decreases in commodity, fuel surcharges and transportation costs this year. We're working closely with our coal supply chain partners to layer in additional hedges to balance our power sales.
Finally, on Slide 11 is a summary of our asset optimization and development plan that I discussed with you on our last earnings call. I want to highlight 3 points that may not be fully appreciated. First, we're deploying this capital at very attractive returns. Contracted repowering opportunities are good NRG Yield candidates, where capital can be replenished at a premium. And the asset revitalization program in this is done at very low multiples compared to new-build economics.  Second, and as David mentioned in his remarks, this plan represents a significant commitment to our conventional business given the repowering opportunities that we see and the changes in capacity markets. 
And finally, as you can see in the bottom right-hand chart, this plan is front-loaded in 2015 and 2016. Beyond that, there is very little incremental environmental CapEx to comply with existing regulations. Of course, as we identify new opportunities or see new environmental regulations, the outlook can change. But for now, there is a significant decrease in committed capital beyond 2016 that translates into additional free cash flow for the company.
As we turn our attention to the summer months, I want to reassure you that we are focused on executing on near-term market opportunities, repositioning our generation portfolio and leveraging our integrated platform.
With that, I will turn it over to Kirk."
413857,292558398,808627,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 08, 2015",2015-05-08,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the financial summary on Slide 13. For the first 3 months of 2015, adjusted EBITDA totaled $840 million, which is an increase of $23 million over the same period in 2014. NRG's record adjusted EB",1570,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the financial summary on Slide 13. For the first 3 months of 2015, adjusted EBITDA totaled $840 million, which is an increase of $23 million over the same period in 2014. NRG's record adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2015 was achieved, thanks to outstanding results from our wholesale and retail businesses and augmented by contributions from the assets acquired in the EME, Alta Wind and Dominion transactions, which combined to more than offset the impact of the extreme weather in first quarter of last year. For the first quarter, free cash flow before growth totaled $364 million.  Supported by our substantial hedge position and the strong start to the year, we are once again reaffirming both EBITDA and free cash flow guidance, with our expectations continuing to track to the upper quartile of those ranges. 
NRG also made substantial progress during the quarter on a number of fronts. Earlier this week, the public shareholders of NRG Yield approved the proposal to create 2 new share classes via a stock split, providing both ongoing capital replenishment for NRG and substantial funding capacity for Yield without the need for further NRG investment. With this important step now behind us, we are pleased to announce a new framework for the allocation of the portion of NRG's excess capital equivalent to future drop-down proceeds to be committed towards the balance of share repurchases, corporate debt reduction and reinvestment in future NRG Yield eligible projects.
Going forward, we expect Residential Solar leases to represent a meaningful portion of future drop-downs, thanks to a newly established partnership with NRG Yield, which will permit our Home Solar business to benefit by accessing a more competitive cost of capital while providing a new source of CAFD growth for Yield. And having meaningfully expanded our Home Solar tax equity runway with 2 new facilities, we have the 2 key pieces in place to realize value at NRG today in excess of the capital requirements of this fast-growing business. 
We have also established a similar new $100 million partnership with NRG Yield for future drop-downs of DG Solar assets, which we expect to occur with the balance of 2015, providing further value realization at NRG and expanded growth for Yield. We will provide more details on this important partnership in the next quarter as we initiate our first DG Solar drop-down. 
Finally, having completed $56 million of the $100 million second phase of our 2015 share buyback program, we are pleased to announce an increase of $81 million to this second phase, thereby increasing remaining capacity to $125 million, providing us additional repurchasing power, which will be further augmented by future repurchases enabled by the NRG Yield drop-down 1/3 rule David mentioned earlier.
Turning to Slide 14. I'd like to provide a few highlights of the recently approved NRG Yield recapitalization, which provides significant benefits to both companies. The creation of the 1/100th vote class C shares provides NRG Yield a substantial source of equity growth funding without reliance on NRG capital. These new C shares will be the primary source of future equity at NRG Yield, and the low-vote structure gives Yield the ability to raise over $20 billion in new public equity without jeopardizing the strategic relationship with NRG. The 2-for-1 stock split at NRG Yield will be effective May 14 with no change in total dividends paid. As a result, we have now also expanded the pipeline of ROFO assets to include 900 megawatts, consisting primarily of the EME wind assets, which we expect to offer NRG Yield later this quarter. The expended pipeline now also includes up to $250 million in residential, solar and DG portfolios and 800 megawatts of long-term contracted gas comprised of our Carlsbad and Mandalay projects in California, expected to reach COD in 2017 and 2020.
On Slide 15 is a summary of the expected impact of our tax equity facilities and new NRG Yield partnership in realizing the key objective I first introduced at Investor Day in January. Monetizing leases at value to NRG today. Partnering with Yield provides Home Solar access to competitively advantaged capital while enhancing NRG Yield's CAFD growth. We've already dropped down approximately 2,000 existing leases to NRG Yield for $26 million in proceeds. And in addition, the $150 million equity commitment from NRG Yield and the associated tax equity proceeds provide capacity to monetize approximately 13,000 additional leases at value in excess of our expected capital requirements, leading to $100 million in near-term value to be realized by NRG in 2015. This should also put us well along the path to realize total value which also exceeds G&A and marketing expenses for all of 2015 as we expect to seek future authorization to fund our ongoing leasing efforts over the balance of the year. NRG Yield will benefit from a targeted 7.5% CAFD yield over the lease term, which equates to approximately $11 million in annual CAFD from its initial $150 million investment.
Turning to Slide 16. I'd like to provide some additional details on the 70-20-10 capital expenditure guideline David mentioned earlier. The chart shows capital expenditures by year, which include maintenance and environmental CapEx as well as the growth investments portion of capital allocation. These are categorized by conventional, which is primarily wholesale and retail; proven growth or contracted assets; and high-growth opportunities. To provide some historical perspective, I've included 2013 and 2014.
Turning to 2015, NRG has committed $1.7 billion in capital expenditures. Approximately 70% is reinvestment in our conventional businesses, which provide the bulk of NRG's cash-generative power and is largely comprised of our asset optimization projects; environmental capital, which includes the Midwest Gen assets; and maintenance to ensure reliability across the fleet. We've committed 20% to Yield-eligible contracted assets, including Residential Solar and DG Solar, and approximately 10% to eVgo and our Carbon 360 project.
In 2016, we expect $1.6 billion in total CapEx consistent with 70-20-10 as we complete our environmental and asset optimization programs and bring Carbon 360 to COD in early 2017. We expect to continue our Yield-eligible investment program in 2016, fueled by our 1/3 rule, which will then include spend on our California contracted gas plants.
Beyond 2016, as I mentioned on Investor Day, having completed our environmental programs to bring the fleet to current compliance, we expect a significant reduction in currently committed capital of over $500 million, which is also aided by the completion of the Carbon 360 project and the reduction in maintenance CapEx. This should provide significant capital allocation flexibility and help ensure the continued delivery of robust free cash flow.
Turning to Slide 17. NRG expects to offer assets to NRG Yield over the remainder of 2015, with anticipated equity proceeds totaling approximately $600 million. These drop-down proceeds are expected to be realized in 2 equal tranches to be offered in the second and fourth quarter of the year, with the first consisting primarily of the EME wind assets and the second anchored by the remaining stake in CVSR currently held by NRG. We also expect to drop down Residential Solar and DG portfolios over the course of the year. 
In order to provide greater clarity, maintain our target ratios and continue to return capital to shareholders, we are announcing a new plan as a part of capital allocation based on future drop-down proceeds. We will allocate capital, an amount consistent with these proceeds, in 1/3s towards share purchases, corporate debt reduction and investment in future Yield-eligible projects. The allocation to debt reduction is sized to offset the impact on corporate EBITDA from the portion of CAFD, which will support dividends paid to NRG Yield's public shareholders, thereby allowing us to maintain our key credit metrics following each drop-down.  Sizing our capital allocation to share repurchases should help further clarify the direct benefit of NRG Yield to our shareholders. These future buyback allocations are incremental to the expansion of Phase 2 of our buyback program we announced today. Recycling the remaining proceeds helps replenish the drop-down pipeline with greater capital efficiency.
Turning to Slide 18. By adding the expected proceeds from drop-down offerings over the remainder of 2015, NRG's gross capital available for allocation is just over $3 billion this year. Inclusive of the impact of the 1/3s plan and the expanded Phase 2 buyback program, we have committed $2.2 billion of this capital, nearly half of which is allocated to preserving balance sheet strength and returning capital to our shareholders.
Committed growth of $960 million represents the growth component of the 70-20-10 capital expenditures guideline I reviewed earlier. Of the $860 million in excess capital then remaining in 2015, $500 million resides at the GenOn level, a portion of which will fund the completion of our operational improvement program there in 2016. NRG-level excess capital is $360 million, which includes the portion of the 1/3s plan earmarked for future NRG Yield-eligible investment.
And in summary on Slide 19, in addition to our excellent quarterly performance, our enhanced capital allocation program, NRG Yield recap and new NRG Yield partnerships place NRG on firm footing to ensure continued balance sheet strength and expanded return of shareholder capital while harnessing the power of the NRG Yield cost of capital. The benefit are growing Home Solar, DG and contracted asset initiatives.
With that, I'll turn it back to David for his closing remarks."

Thank you for joining us. As always, joining me today and participating in the presentation are Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Operating Officer and President of NRG Business. Additionally and available for questions are Chris Moser, who heads our Commercial Operations; Elizabeth Killinger, who's the Head of Home Retail; and Kelcy Pegler, Jr., who's the Head of Home Solar. Somewhat unusually, we're actually communicating with you from multiple locations, so if we run into some technological issues, please bear with us. 
We've got a lot of great news to update you on today, and I realize we're starting slightly later than normal and during market hours, so we're going to get right into it and try and get through it as quickly as we can, giving you all the information you need.
Starting on Slide 3 of the presentation. The story of NRG's first quarter 2015 is quite simple. Record financial performance. $840 million of adjusted EBITDA, breaking our previous record, which was set just last year. This achievement is truly remarkable given that previous high in 2014 had received a substantial boost from the polar vortex, which occurred in January of that year. But what's even more remarkable is that we beat the existing record in the face of a very, very soft wholesale pricing in our core market. Average on-peak prices in PJM in the first quarter of 2015 were just 50% of what they were in the first quarter of 2014. In ERCOT in the first quarter, the average on-peak prices were just 40% of what they were last year. 
In my mind and hopefully in yours, this is proof positive of the superiority of our integrated wholesale retail business model. But of course, the right business model only gets you to the starting line. Our record first quarter performance is entirely attributable to the superb execution of our plant operations and commercial operations teams from the first day of the quarter to the last, so I want to publicly thank Mauricio, Chris Moser, Fran Sullivan and their respective teams for a quarter very well done. And I especially want to thank Elizabeth Killinger and her entire team at NRG Retail for simply hitting the ball out of the park with a stunning $166 million of adjusted EBITDA.
Moving to Slide 4. I want to note a couple of critical issues on this slide that Mauricio and Kirk will cover more completely in their sections of the presentation. We realize that we're talking amidst of a persistently challenging commodity price environment, and NRG's conventional businesses are, for the most part, exposed to commodity price curve-based valuation. For that reason, it has become common in the market over the past several years for analysts to evaluate businesses like ours on an open EBITDA basis. While I have no particular problem intellectually or otherwise with open EBITDA analysis, it obviously fails to take into account the value of a savvy hedging program well executed on a timely basis. And that is what we have at NRG, and that's what we've demonstrated.
For years, it's been the strategy of NRG to smooth out as much of the downward price curve volatility as we can through this active baseload hedging program. This quarter has been no exception, and I'm very pleased with what our hedging team has accomplished, both with respect to the balance of 2015 and into 2016.
As you all know, spot natural gas prices are indeed very low, in particular, but we have seen this movie before back in 2012. We did okay then, and I'm confident we will do okay again now and we'll navigate our way through this trial successfully, thanks to significant parts of the hedging program that Mauricio will shine some light on later.
The other topic I'd address on this slide, which also will be touched upon by both Mauricio and Kirk, is cash flow and capital expenditures. NRG always has been a cash flow-generative machine, and indeed, from the beginning of the new NRG era in 2003, I told our investors that we always would manage NRG for cash, and that has not changed. It has, however, been obscured recently by the fact that we are right in the middle of the 3-year spike in our CapEx, arising largely out of the GenOn and EME acquisitions as we spend an unusually large amount on major maintenance, environmental remediation, fuel conversions and repowerings of our expanded fleet. While we're not yet quite at the end of the tunnel with respect to this program, we are almost over the hump. Mauricio will show how the reinvestment program wraps up in 2016, and come 2017, NRG shareholders will experience the twin benefit both of the EBITDA generated by those repowered and converted assets and also of the substantially greater free cash available for other allocations.
Since we do expect to have substantially more capital to allocate, I think it's long past time that we, and particularly me, provide you with some simplified clarity as to how we think about capital allocation at NRG in the past and into the foreseeable future. So if you turn to Slide 5, you will see 2 simple ways to think about capital allocation at NRG, what we call the 70-20-10 principle and the 1/3 rule or the 1/3s rule.
First, with respect to 70-20-10. Since NRG embarked on its present strategic course 4 to 5 years ago, namely to continue to consolidate and flourish in the conventional power sector while positioning ourselves as an early mover on clean energy, we settled on a rough rule of thumb for our capital expenditures: 70% reinvestment in the assets and businesses that generate the preponderance of our current cash flow; 20% invested as equity capital and contracted assets that constitute the best and most realizable growth opportunities for NRG in the post-merchant area; and 10% invested into more speculative early-mover projects and businesses that have the potential to meaningfully expand the universe of opportunities for our business.
When describing the 70-20-10 rule internally, which is something we actually do a lot, it's not uncommon for us to draw the analogy to allocation of labor and agriculture: 70% of the time spent on harvesting, 20% of the time spent growing and 10% planting seeds. While 70-20-10 is more a guideline for us than a hard-and-fast rule, it's a good metric, and we believe it has served us and our shareholders well in terms of the current positioning of the company, and we plan to continue with it. We introduce it to you here to help you understand how we are thinking about reinvesting this cash-generative business over the next few years.
On the bottom half of Slide 5, I'd turn to a more recent and high-quality phenomenon, what to do with the substantial amount of cash proceeds to be returned to NRG as a result of asset drop-downs to NRG Yield. This is highly relevant issue as we expect roughly $600 million of drop-down -- drop-downs NRG Yield to be announced over the balance of 2015. The way we think about this is that the removal on an unconsolidated basis of NRG's contracted and non-commodity-exposed, cash-generative assets over time from NRG's balance sheet to NRG Yield's balance sheet requires us to think about the pro forma NRG balance sheet left supporting the merchant, i.e. commodity-exposed side of our business. Without the contracted assets, it seems to us that the prudent thing to do is some rightsizing of that pro forma balance sheet, with such rightsizing involving both voluntary debt reduction and equity retirement. We also, of course, have to allocate some drop-down proceeds to restocking the pipeline of contracted assets for future drop-downs. As such, and Kirk will explain this further, we are announcing today 1/3-1/3-1/3 rule associated with the receipt of future drop-down proceeds.
On a final note and to amplify something I said on this topic when we announced the $100 million Phase 2 of our share buyback program in March was that we believe, given how much the company's businesses have evolved over the past several years, there remains a significant disconnect and distortion between the company's performance and prospects on one hand and the commodity price curve lens through which Wall Street views us and anticipates our future performance on the other hand.
Witness, for example, the fact that we can be announcing here a record first quarter, projecting a full year result well in excess of $3 billion of adjusted EBITDA and clearly becoming a real player in the red-hot home solar space, and our stock is down some 50% since last summer, largely, I believe, because we exist in a sub-$3 natural gas price environment. Surely, there have been other contributing factors contributing to our abysmal share price performance, some of our own making, some of my own making, but this gas price environment looms largest notwithstanding its demonstrably reduced relevance to our near-term financial performance.
With the $80 million we added to the buyback bucket today and the $200 million of drop-down proceeds connected from buybacks that we expect to recharge the buyback program as the year goes on, I want to reiterate that we fully intend to enter the market to snap up our stock when it can be had at the exceptional bargain of buying at current price levels.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mauricio."

We're off to a good start in 2015 with our integrated platform performing exceptionally well during the quarter. A combination of higher retail loads in Texas, opportunistic hedging and solid operational perfo",1247,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. We're off to a good start in 2015 with our integrated platform performing exceptionally well during the quarter. A combination of higher retail loads in Texas, opportunistic hedging and solid operational performance allowed us to once again report record financial results for the quarter but more importantly, reaffirm guidance for the year. Keep in mind, these results were achieved despite the fact that wholesale power prices were 50% lower than last year, underscoring the importance of our integrated platform that performs under multiple price and weather scenarios.
During the quarter, we also significantly increased our hedges in 2016, effectively protecting our earnings for the next 2 years given our concerns on lower gas prices for this summer. In addition, our wholesale asset optimization and development program, which I will discuss in more detail in a few slides, remains largely on track.
Moving to our wholesale operational metrics on Slide 7. We had another quarter of top-quartile safety performance, with 147 out of 167 facilities without a single recordable injury. Total generation was down 12% for the quarter on a pro forma basis, driven primarily by lower generation in the East, where power prices were 50% lower than last year.  In the Gulf, generation was flat as nuclear and gas generation offset lower coal production. And in the West, generation was impacted by the retirement of our Coldwater plant.
Reliability improved during the quarter, demonstrating our effort to ensure that our units are available when it matters the most, during peak price periods. Over time, this metric will become more relevant under the new capacity performance contract. The operations team remains focused on executing our spring outage season with nearly 173 planned outages, a significant logistical task when you have more than 150 sites across your portfolio.
Turning to Home operations on Slide 8. I am pleased to report that our Retail business had another strong quarter, delivering $166 million in adjusted EBITDA, exceeding last year's first quarter by $51 million. These results were driven by effective margin and risk management combined with colder-than-normal weather and lower supply costs. Margins were strong and consistent with last year's quarterly performance despite the addition of lower-margin Dominion load. One year later, we continue to achieve better-than-expected results from the Dominion acquisition on both customer count and EBITDA. Our customer count is performing in line with plan given the anticipated Dominion contract expirations, which we expect to be complete by year-end.
Additionally, we continue to make progress across our Home Solar segment. During the first quarter, our customer base increased to over 16,000 customers, an increase of 21% since the end of 2014. More importantly, however, during the month of April, we entered into a new partnership with NRG Yield and executed on addition tax equity financings to help facilitate our growth through the end of the year. Kirk will discuss this in more detail.
Moving on to our market update on Slide 9 and starting with the Northeast as the most immediate opportunity for our generation portfolio. As you can see in the left-hand chart, we're seeing very robust forward energy prices in PJM as supply tightens due to stricter environmental regulations, benefiting our entire 17 gigawatt portfolio. In the medium term, the opportunity turns from energy to capacity margins with the implementation of capacity reforms in PJM and New England, which focuses on higher reliability during shortage conditions. These premium capacity products will most likely result in higher prices in exchange for higher penalties for nonperformance. As a generator with a large and diverse portfolio with fuel on site, we welcome these changes. Furthermore, our fuel conversion and compliance strategy enables us to capitalize on this opportunity.
Turning to our costs. I want to highlight the value of our integrated platform as a key differentiator versus solar generators. Not only were we able to outperform during a period of very low commodity prices, but in a time of lower liquidity in the market, we have a natural hedge between our wholesale portfolio and our retail franchise. In the medium term, we believe our portfolio is well positioned to benefit from a very fragile situation in Texas. Currently, there are 2 divergent views in the market. ERCOT recently released their latest CDR report, where they see reserve margins expanding by 5% in 2018 and beyond and putting them well above target reserve margins. This outlook, from our perspective, is a best-case scenario, requiring 3 assumptions to happen at the same time: low load growth, incremental new supply and 0 retirements. We're skeptical about this. Over the past few years, load grew at an average of 2% on a weather-normalized basis. We expect less-than-forecasted new builds as participants respond rationally to a very depressed forward market, and we expect greater than 0 retirements given the challenging price environment and stricter environmental rules. When we do see a supply rationalization, our Texas fleet of surviving coal and gas units will be well positioned to capture additional value.
Moving to our hedging disclosures on Slide 10. We have turned our focus to 2016, where we have increased significantly our hedge levels to roughly 75%, effectively reducing our commodity risk and cash flow variation for the next 2 years. This is particularly important as we progress through higher-than-average CapEx years for our wholesale portfolio.
I want to take a moment and briefly explain the 2015 hedge levels of 109%. Remember that this percentage represents the amount of hedges sold against our currently expected generation, and I emphasize the word expected. There will be times when the expected generation decreases due to market changes, and unless we immediately buy back our hedges, this will result in a hedge level above 100%. It is not that we over-hedged the portfolio but rather a timing issue on when we report results and when we buy some of our hedges back.
On the fuel side, we have seen significant decreases in commodity, fuel surcharges and transportation costs this year. We're working closely with our coal supply chain partners to layer in additional hedges to balance our power sales.
Finally, on Slide 11 is a summary of our asset optimization and development plan that I discussed with you on our last earnings call. I want to highlight 3 points that may not be fully appreciated. First, we're deploying this capital at very attractive returns. Contracted repowering opportunities are good NRG Yield candidates, where capital can be replenished at a premium. And the asset revitalization program in this is done at very low multiples compared to new-build economics.  Second, and as David mentioned in his remarks, this plan represents a significant commitment to our conventional business given the repowering opportunities that we see and the changes in capacity markets. 
And finally, as you can see in the bottom right-hand chart, this plan is front-loaded in 2015 and 2016. Beyond that, there is very little incremental environmental CapEx to comply with existing regulations. Of course, as we identify new opportunities or see new environmental regulations, the outlook can change. But for now, there is a significant decrease in committed capital beyond 2016 that translates into additional free cash flow for the company.
As we turn our attention to the summer months, I want to reassure you that we are focused on executing on near-term market opportunities, repositioning our generation portfolio and leveraging our integrated platform.
With that, I will turn it over to Kirk."

For the first 3 months of 2015, adjusted EBITDA totaled $840 million, which is an increase of $23 million over the same period in 2014. NRG's record adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2015 was achieved, thanks to outstanding results from our wholesale and retail businesses and augmented by contributions from the assets acquired in the EME, Alta Wind and Dominion transactions, which combined to more than offset the impact of the extreme weather in first quarter of last year. For the first quarter, free cash flow before growth totaled $364 million.  Supported by our substantial hedge position and the strong start to the year, we are once again reaffirming both EBITDA and free cash flow guidance, with our expectations continuing to track to the upper quartile of those ranges. 
NRG also made substantial progress during the quarter on a number of fronts. Earlier this week, the public shareholders of NRG Yield approved the proposal to create 2 new share classes via a stock split, providing both ongoing capital replenishment for NRG and substantial funding capacity for Yield without the need for further NRG investment. With this important step now behind us, we are pleased to announce a new framework for the allocation of the portion of NRG's excess capital equivalent to future drop-down proceeds to be committed towards the balance of share repurchases, corporate debt reduction and reinvestment in future NRG Yield eligible projects.
Going forward, we expect Residential Solar leases to represent a meaningful portion of future drop-downs, thanks to a newly established partnership with NRG Yield, which will permit our Home Solar business to benefit by accessing a more competitive cost of capital while providing a new source of CAFD growth for Yield. And having meaningfully expanded our Home Solar tax equity runway with 2 new facilities, we have the 2 key pieces in place to realize value at NRG today in excess of the capital requirements of this fast-growing business. 
We have also established a similar new $100 million partnership with NRG Yield for future drop-downs of DG Solar assets, which we expect to occur with the balance of 2015, providing further value realization at NRG and expanded growth for Yield. We will provide more details on this important partnership in the next quarter as we initiate our first DG Solar drop-down. 
Finally, having completed $56 million of the $100 million second phase of our 2015 share buyback program, we are pleased to announce an increase of $81 million to this second phase, thereby increasing remaining capacity to $125 million, providing us additional repurchasing power, which will be further augmented by future repurchases enabled by the NRG Yield drop-down 1/3 rule David mentioned earlier.
Turning to Slide 14. I'd like to provide a few highlights of the recently approved NRG Yield recapitalization, which provides significant benefits to both companies. The creation of the 1/100th vote class C shares provides NRG Yield a substantial source of equity growth funding without reliance on NRG capital. These new C shares will be the primary source of future equity at NRG Yield, and the low-vote structure gives Yield the ability to raise over $20 billion in new public equity without jeopardizing the strategic relationship with NRG. The 2-for-1 stock split at NRG Yield will be effective May 14 with no change in total dividends paid. As a result, we have now also expanded the pipeline of ROFO assets to include 900 megawatts, consisting primarily of the EME wind assets, which we expect to offer NRG Yield later this quarter. The expended pipeline now also includes up to $250 million in residential, solar and DG portfolios and 800 megawatts of long-term contracted gas comprised of our Carlsbad and Mandalay projects in California, expected to reach COD in 2017 and 2020.
On Slide 15 is a summary of the expected impact of our tax equity facilities and new NRG Yield partnership in realizing the key objective I first introduced at Investor Day in January. Monetizing leases at value to NRG today. Partnering with Yield provides Home Solar access to competitively advantaged capital while enhancing NRG Yield's CAFD growth. We've already dropped down approximately 2,000 existing leases to NRG Yield for $26 million in proceeds. And in addition, the $150 million equity commitment from NRG Yield and the associated tax equity proceeds provide capacity to monetize approximately 13,000 additional leases at value in excess of our expected capital requirements, leading to $100 million in near-term value to be realized by NRG in 2015. This should also put us well along the path to realize total value which also exceeds G&A and marketing expenses for all of 2015 as we expect to seek future authorization to fund our ongoing leasing efforts over the balance of the year. NRG Yield will benefit from a targeted 7.5% CAFD yield over the lease term, which equates to approximately $11 million in annual CAFD from its initial $150 million investment.
Turning to Slide 16. I'd like to provide some additional details on the 70-20-10 capital expenditure guideline David mentioned earlier. The chart shows capital expenditures by year, which include maintenance and environmental CapEx as well as the growth investments portion of capital allocation. These are categorized by conventional, which is primarily wholesale and retail; proven growth or contracted assets; and high-growth opportunities. To provide some historical perspective, I've included 2013 and 2014.
Turning to 2015, NRG has committed $1.7 billion in capital expenditures. Approximately 70% is reinvestment in our conventional businesses, which provide the bulk of NRG's cash-generative power and is largely comprised of our asset optimization projects; environmental capital, which includes the Midwest Gen assets; and maintenance to ensure reliability across the fleet. We've committed 20% to Yield-eligible contracted assets, including Residential Solar and DG Solar, and approximately 10% to eVgo and our Carbon 360 project.
In 2016, we expect $1.6 billion in total CapEx consistent with 70-20-10 as we complete our environmental and asset optimization programs and bring Carbon 360 to COD in early 2017. We expect to continue our Yield-eligible investment program in 2016, fueled by our 1/3 rule, which will then include spend on our California contracted gas plants.
Beyond 2016, as I mentioned on Investor Day, having completed our environmental programs to bring the fleet to current compliance, we expect a significant reduction in currently committed capital of over $500 million, which is also aided by the completion of the Carbon 360 project and the reduction in maintenance CapEx. This should provide significant capital allocation flexibility and help ensure the continued delivery of robust free cash flow.
Turning to Slide 17. NRG expects to offer assets to NRG Yield over the remainder of 2015, with anticipated equity proceeds totaling approximately $600 million. These drop-down proceeds are expected to be realized in 2 equal tranches to be offered in the second and fourth quarter of the year, with the first consisting primarily of the EME wind assets and the second anchored by the remaining stake in CVSR currently held by NRG. We also expect to drop down Residential Solar and DG portfolios over the course of the year. 
In order to provide greater clarity, maintain our target ratios and continue to return capital to shareholders, we are announcing a new plan as a part of capital allocation based on future drop-down proceeds. We will allocate capital, an amount consistent with these proceeds, in 1/3s towards share purchases, corporate debt reduction and investment in future Yield-eligible projects. The allocation to debt reduction is sized to offset the impact on corporate EBITDA from the portion of CAFD, which will support dividends paid to NRG Yield's public shareholders, thereby allowing us to maintain our key credit metrics following each drop-down.  Sizing our capital allocation to share repurchases should help further clarify the direct benefit of NRG Yield to our shareholders. These future buyback allocations are incremental to the expansion of Phase 2 of our buyback program we announced today. Recycling the remaining proceeds helps replenish the drop-down pipeline with greater capital efficiency.
Turning to Slide 18. By adding the expected proceeds from drop-down offerings over the remainder of 2015, NRG's gross capital available for allocation is just over $3 billion this year. Inclusive of the impact of the 1/3s plan and the expanded Phase 2 buyback program, we have committed $2.2 billion of this capital, nearly half of which is allocated to preserving balance sheet strength and returning capital to our shareholders.
Committed growth of $960 million represents the growth component of the 70-20-10 capital expenditures guideline I reviewed earlier. Of the $860 million in excess capital then remaining in 2015, $500 million resides at the GenOn level, a portion of which will fund the completion of our operational improvement program there in 2016. NRG-level excess capital is $360 million, which includes the portion of the 1/3s plan earmarked for future NRG Yield-eligible investment.
And in summary on Slide 19, in addition to our excellent quarterly performance, our enhanced capital allocation program, NRG Yield recap and new NRG Yield partnerships place NRG on firm footing to ensure continued balance sheet strength and expanded return of shareholder capital while harnessing the power of the NRG Yield cost of capital to benefit are growing Home Solar, DG and contracted asset initiatives.
With that, I'll turn it back to David for his closing remarks."

Thank you for joining us an hour earlier, than our usually, our 9:00 scheduled time.
As always, joining me today are Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Operating Officer and President of NRG Business. Both of them will be giving presentation. Additionally, Chris Moser, the Head of Commercial Operations; Elizabeth Killinger, the Head of NRG Home Retail; and Kelcy Pegler, Jr., the Head of NRG Home Solar, joining me here, and will be available to answer your questions on to -- that pertains to their parts of our business.
So starting with the slide deck, on Slide 3. If you're following along with that, I'm pleased to announce today that NRG has continued a positive momentum starting in the first quarter of the year by reporting second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $729 million, which gives us $1.569 billion of adjusted EBITDA through the first half of 2015, and keeps us on track to achieve a full year result, comfortably, within our $3.2 million to $3.4 billion guidance range, notwithstanding the very challenging commodity price environment that we have been in for the entire year.
As noted in our press release, this favorable financial results has been spearheaded by our retail franchise, led by Elizabeth Killinger and her retail manager team, who have gone from strength to strength, not only preserving healthy retail margins but also, by retaining and acquiring customers at rates at that have exceeded both our expectations and previous year's performance.
Of course, this good financial news has been significantly tempered by the fact that today at least, our shareholders haven't benefited from our improvement in the year-on-year financial performance, as our share price like others in our industry, has really down since the beginning of the year, and since our second quarter 2014 call 12 months ago. What this means, of course, taking the liberty of converting our adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow off page, is that we are now trading at a price that implies a mid-teen free cash flow yield, actually 16% for 2015. And the good news is that given the consistency of our baseload hedging program and the strength of our core Wholesale retail combination, we are confident that where these share price were to persist, we will continue to be realizing mid-teen free cash flow yields, if not higher, for the remainder of the decade.
As we look ahead over the remainder of the year, we see more reasons for optimism and even bullishness, and these are also listed on this page. We expect significantly more proceeds from NRG Yield drop-downs, fueling more buybacks, more de-levering and more reinvestment attractive assets.
There's a long-awaited PJM option occurring in just a few days that places -- that under the new rules, places the financial premium on dependability, and should favor an operator like ours that operates a fleet, does so reliably and includes power generation facility not dependent on interruptible gas supply like many others in the market.
There's our Home Solar business, which is ramping up quickly our case -- our daily bookings is 90% higher at the end of the second quarter than the first quarter. And we're achieving almost all that having barely begun to scratch the all-important California Home Solar market. And finally, there's the fuel conversions and another fleet repositioning projects that are proceeding in pace and remain on track to come online over the balance of 2015 and calendar year 2016, with a significant drop off in capital spend to follow and the commensurate increase in free cash flow yield.
All in all, it's an optimistic picture for NRG that belies the market presentism arising out of the low commodity price environment currently dripping the entire NRG commodities complex.
Kirk and Mauricio will talk about these financial results and the stellar operating performance that underpins them. Plus, they will discuss what's the common terms of drop-downs, PJM auctions, Home Solar bookings and planned conversions. But before I turn it over to them, let me make this is just a couple more points.
Turning to Slide 4. Speaking today as we are 1 day after the President announcement of the power plant, it seems clear to us that the one true path running for encumbered provider provider like ours is to build in clean NRG technologies capabilities in assets on top of a rock solid foundation of multi-fuel, multimarket across the Meritor of conventional generation. In doing all of this, timing matters. We and the rest of the industry, continued to bear the responsibility for keeping the lights on in the short to medium term, which in turn, depends for the foreseeable future on the sustained excellence we have demonstrated in the reliable operations in maintenance of our conventional fleet.
But to prepare for the future as a 21st century energy company, there are 3 essential capabilities which we need to continue to strengthen and grow: First, there's Retail. There's simply is no substitute in the coming age of energy of choice and personal Energy Alternatives to having positive NRG relationship with the end-use NRG consumer. And the more end-use energy consumers we can have over relationship with, the better.
Second, renewables, and by renewables, I mean, mainly solar. As the future is going to be increasingly solar powered, and increasingly distributed. If you think about it, it's amazing how quickly we have gone from hearing help prohibited the expensive solar power is just a couple of years ago through how often we don't hear about how expensive it is now.
And third, there's the yield vehicle. Because even with the recent market Yield paper in the ensuing selloff, NRG Yield still provides us competitive cost of capital to deploy for contracted assets that our immediate competitors can not matched.
So while some of our competitors have taken steps in our direction and certainly, more will have to follow, if they wish to be relevant deeper into the 21st century. In NRG, we are building these capabilities for 6 years now, and are more equipped than anyone, to not only address the changes in the industry, but to make them our competitive advantage. We have had advances, and we have had setbacks. But as we sit here in the middle of 2015, I feel confident that we are advancing on all fronts, gathering momentum as we go. And as we go, our principal focus remains to ensure that our shareholders realize the value of what we have been building, and we'll continue to build in the months and years to come.
Finally, on Slide 5, I reiterate the principles articulated on our previous earnings call, quantifying how we are thinking about capital allocation in connection with building a clean energy business on the foundation of a conventional generation platform, we are, as Kirk will talk about later, on track this year to adhere to the 70-20-10 guidelines, which governs the balance of our capital investment and reinvestment strategy between reinvesting in our foundational stratum conventional generation assets, and investing in the newer customer-facing Clean Energy businesses that we have been building on top of our base. 
And so with that, I'll turn it over to Mauricio."

Following on the good start that we have for the year, our integrated portfolio delivered another quarter of strong results, allowing us to reaffirm guidance for the full year. This highlights the strength of our diverse generation of portfolio and complementary Wholesale retail model, in spite the fact that the commodity prices remain close to what they were last year.
The hedging program and risk management activities executed by our commercial team, protected the value of our Wholesale business, while our Retail business outperformance expectations through good margin management and lower supply costs. This quarter, in another example of how our complementary business model performs well on their adverse price and weather scenarios. 
During the quarter, we increased our hedge levels in 2016 and 2017, effectively protecting our earnings for the next 2 years. This is particularly important over the next 18 months, as we progress through higher than average CapEx years, while executing our asset enhancement strategy which I will cover in more detail in a minute.
This strategy positions our performance due to benefit from critical market developments, like PJM's capacity performance which will be implemented later this month. 
And moving on to our traditional operational metrics on Slide 7, we had another quarter of top quartile safety performance with 151 out over 167 facilities without a single recordable injury. Conventional generation was down 6% versus the same period last year, driven primarily by an unusually active planned outage season and soft commodity prices. The soft prices significantly influence the units dispatched throughout our fleet, resulting in an 18% decrease in to 2 baseload generation the relative to the same quarter last year.  This was partially offset that with a 52% increase in our gas and oil fleet output over the same period. 
On a regional basis, sector generation was 58% things to better performance by SPP on gas portfolio. While the east and south-central were lower due to some switching and environmental retrofit outages. 
The operational team remains focused throughout the spring, in completing 173 planned outages, including complex environmental compliance and requiring outages. Despite the reduction in generation of service hours, our baseload units availability improved, and performed when the market needs them.
Slide 8 provides a more detailed update on the progress made on our development on asset optimization efforts. It's been an an important 6 months. In the first quarter, we completed the red metal retrofits at Big Cajun, Harris, and livestock [ph]. This quarter, we completed the go-to [ph] gas conversion at Big Cajun 2 Unit 2, just in time for the important summer months, and the environmental retrofits at Waukegan 8, Sayreville in Gilbert. 
We also restored 388 [ph] megawatts of incremental capacity in the premium lower Hudson Valley capacity zone in New York at very attractive economics. This was the defect result the market required to have not only reliable capacity, but increased fuel certainty and fuel flexibility in the high demand zone. 
Turning to Slide 9. The second quarter was another strong quarter for NRG Home, where we delivered the best second quarter results for the Retail segment since NRG's purchase overlying retail in 2009. Total customer count was in line with expectations, with a decline of 18,000 customers, driven by less than expected attrition from the lower margin, Northeast Dominion customers that we acquired last year.  When excluding those contracts, the recurring customer count grew in Texas and this is by a total of 19,000 customers, demonstrating the continued strong momentum we achieved in attracting and retaining customers with innovative products and services.
One of the reasons for our strong retail performance has been the subdued Wholesale prices in ERCOT, our largest retail market. 
Very little has changed since the last update, as you can see on Slide 10. Demand in ERCOT remained strong, with close to 2.5% growth for the quarter despite lower oil prices, as you can see on the upper left chart. While we have tempered our expectations for the balance of the year, we have yet to see the impact of on-power demand. 
On the supply side, there are not many new projects beyond the ones announced on the back of potential capacity market and cost advantage Brownfield developments.
As you can see on the lower left-hand chart, both historical and forward sparks spreads, now expanding over 7 years, do not support the economics of even brownfield projects. These will not only make future projects less likely, but also put existing at risk of mothballed or shut down. This supply rationalization prompted by economics, and potential and future environmental rules could tighten the fundamentals even more so, and increase the probability of scarcity prices sooner rather than later. While our large, low-cost and environmentally controlled portfolio remains competitive and well hedged for the next 2 years, we will not hesitate in making the right economic decision on behalf of our shareholders if the market continues to be shaped in such an erratic way.
For now, all eyes on our next wave, with temperatures rising in Texas over 100 degrees for several consecutive days. 
Now moving to our hedging disclosures on Slide 11. We continue our focus towards the next 2 years, and has a significantly increased our hedge levels to 84% in 2016 and 40% in 2017, effectively reducing our commodity risk and cash flow variation for the next 2 years.
On the fuel side, we continue to see decreases in commodity costs, fuel surcharges and transportation costs. We continue to work closely with our coal supply chain partners to layer in additional hedges to balance our power sales.
Our commercial team has done a great job in insulating us from the recent drop in gas and power prices, and has contributed significant to our Retail outperformance by effectively managing supply costs. They are now focused on the remainder of the summer and getting ready for the upcoming PJM capacity performance option. So a few words of the PJM option on Slide 12. 
As you all know, for approved the PJM capacity performance proposal in June. While we were disappointed by the delays in the transition of auction, the FINELINE is now set for the base residual auction, with the traditional auctions likely to happen in early September.  We have listed some of the main variables that participants will take into consideration during these auctions, which could provide some direction on price expectations. 
We have not been shy on our support for stricter capacity market that ensures reliability. As we with any competitive market, there will be winners and losers. The characteristic of our portfolio in terms of fuel certainty, reliability and skill which allows us to better manage that penalty risk of under performance, puts us in a great position to significantly benefit from these necessary change in the market, and recognizes the value that our portfolio brings to the system.
So to closing, the prospects of improved capacity markets, a diverse and environmentally controlled portfolio, complemented by retail and opportunistic risk management activities, other foundations for strong results during these low commodity cycle, and sets us up to even stronger results in the medium to long run.
With that, I will turn it over to Kirk."
413857,307376874,847543,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2015",2015-08-04,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone.Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 14, NRG delivered a $729 million in adjusted EBITDA of the second quarter, and over $1.5 billion through the first half of the year. Our second quarter resul",1006,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone.
Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 14, NRG delivered a $729 million in adjusted EBITDA of the second quarter, and over $1.5 billion through the first half of the year. 
Our second quarter results were highlighted by a record $204 million in adjusted EBITDA from Home Retail, a 30% year-over-year increase, yet again, highlighting the success of the integrated business models, as results improved in favorable supply costs.
Business in renewed combined for $338 [ph] million in EBITDA for the quarter my was NRG Yield, which was impacted by historically wind speeds, which continued through quarter end, contributed $187 million. 
Despite the subdued summer power prices and a reduction in expected wind production over the balance of the year, thanks to strong Retail performance, combined with effective Wholesale hedging, we were again, reaffirming our guidance ranges of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA, and $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion in free cash flow before growth for 2015.
As the next outsourcing is achieving our objective of $600 million in dropdown offers to NRG Yield during 2015. On July 24, we offered Yield the opportunity to acquire a 75% stake in a portfolio of 12 Wind Projects, consisting primarily of assets suppliers as part of the EME transaction. Subject to approval by NRG Yield Independent Directors, we anticipate the 75% stake will close by the end of this quarter, with the remaining 25% to be offered in 2016.  We expect this transaction, combined with completed and ongoing drop-downs of business to business distributed solar and residential solar, to result in approximately $300 million in incremental proceeds from NRG Yield through September 30. 
Finally, during the quarter, NRG completed $107 million in additional share repurchases, which when combined with our quarterly dividend amounts to $156 million in capital return to shareholders during the quarter. We have $51 million in the remaining share repurchase authorization, which we expect to be augmented by an additional $200 million in repurchase capacity, or 1/3 of our targeted $600 million in drop-downs based in our previously announced capital allocation program for NRG Yield proceeds.
Turning to an update on 2015 NRG capital sources and uses on Slide 15. And moving from left to right, NRG expects approximately $3.8 billion in cash available to fund our capital expenditures, debt repayment, and return to shareholders during all of 2015. That cash basically consist of 3 components: First, excess cash at year end 2014, which is net of minimum cash reserve for liquidity; second, 2015 operating cash flow, which is basically, the midpoint of our free cash flow guidance, prior to deducting maintenance and environmental CapEx; and third, expected cash proceeds from NRG Yield, which we continue to expect to be approximately $600 million.
2015 capital expenditures, as shown in the second column, totaled approximately $1.7 billion, and includes both the maintenance and environmental CapEx, and as well as growth investments as a part of capital allocation. As we reviewed last quarter, about 70% of these capital expenditures represents reinvestment in our core generation fleet. This includes approximately $800 million in maintenance and environmental CapEx to ensure reliability in environ metal compliance across the fleet, while the remainder is allocated to a growth investments, primarily fuel position on GenOn, that hope ensure the ongoing eligibility for capacity payments and environmental compliance.
About 20% of 2015 CapEx is being invested in long-term contracted projects, which we expect, will ultimately be drop-down into yield. And finally, slightly less than 10% is allocated toward a high-growth investments like eVgo, and our Carbon 360 project in Texas.
The remaining $2.3 billion in 2015 capital funds the balance of capital allocation. Over $1.2 billion, or slightly more than half of this amount, is allocated equally towards debt reduction and return of capital to shareholders in 2015. This includes the expected impact from our capital allocation program relative to anticipated proceeds from yield.
Over $600 million is expected to be returned to shareholders during 2015, and represents more than half of NRG's 2015 free cash flow before growth guidance. This consists of NRG's $200 million annual dividend, nearly $190 million of shares already repurchased, with $51 million in the remaining authorizations, and up to $200 million in expected additional capacity related to the anticipated proceeds received from NRG Yield. We expect approximately $900 million of remaining excess capital. $500 million of this excess is at the GenOn level, which we expect will fund the completion of our fuel conversion projects across that part of the fleet beyond 2015. 
The remaining capital within NRG will be available either for additional allocation in 2015, or to help support capital commitments in 2016, towards the NRG portion of the 70-20-10 capital mix.
Turning to Slide 16. I provided an illustration to underscore a point we first raised during our Investor Day, and which has been an ongoing focus of discussions with many of you over the course of the year. In short, we expect the decline in NRG's maintenance and environmental CapEx over the next few years as we complete the Midwest Generation environmental projects, provides a powerful cushion to help sustain the robust free cash flow, which has long been a cornerstone of the NRG story.
In order to highlight this point, we have assumed consensus adjusted EBITDA estimates beyond 2015 for reference purposes only, which when, combined with interest payments remaining relatively constant and the expected substantial decline of over $400 million in annual maintenance and environmental CapEx by 2017, demonstrates NRG's ability to sustain robust free cash flow despite the near-term decline in EBITDA implied by these some assessments.
Importantly, our free cash flow is prior to the expected ongoing receipt of drop-down proceeds from NRG Yield, which based on over $165 million in remaining part of first offer CAFD and an illustrative 8% yield, implies over $2 billion in proceeds from future drop-downs, targeting significantly augment this compelling cash flow story.
With that, I'll turn it back to David for Q&A."

Just look at the second quarter as an example. I think you would agree with me that prices were significantly low with gas tinkering around $2.5 per MMBtu. I mean, our generation was hiring Texas quarter-over-quarter, from last year to this year. And if you dig deeper, our cogeneration was just slightly lower, I would say, less than 5%. So we really didn't see a lot of coal-to-gas switching in our coal fleet. On the other hand, our gas and oil units increased by 60% -- over 60% in Texas.

Building that volume of installations in order of magnitude so that the aggregate premium proceeds, if you want -- if you will, meet and then, ultimately, exceed that overhead cost. And our expectation is that will be the way that, that offset, or the positive cash flow ultimately comes to pass at NRG, especially as we move into 2016, and our volume and the installations move commensurately higher to offset and exceed that fixed overhead, including marketing and G&A."

I mean you sort of hit the question on the head. Yes, the first thing I would say is -- yes, I agree with you, that there's -- well, it may not be immediately apparent, there's actually industrial logic to keep in a conventional side of our business to get the renewables side -- together with the renewables side. And I tried to allude to that in my comments that the world of NRG is trending green at a very decisive pace. But the one thing that comes being green for everybody, is making sure that the lights stay on, making sure that you have electricity. And the best companies that can do that -- given the fundamentally intermittency of renewable power, companies that are doing both conventional and doing green. So the industrial logic to me, favors the path that NRG's on. But we are a public company, and we suffer -- whether you call it the conglomerate discount, or the constant refrain that we hear the -- more and more complex than some of the people, that Wall Street can invest in. So we have to -- value maximization for shareholders is being a public company is about. So I can't put a precise date on it, Greg. What I would tell you is it's a combination of when the us and it's become clear that -- Wall Street has difficulty digesting the idea that conventional company is going green. But the second half of the equation is having a green company within NRG, that not only can survive on its own feet as a public company, but can win the battlefield, can be as competitive as possible. So what we're about right now in 2015, and I think we're making great progress is building -- everything within our portfolio is strengthening everyday. And when we get to that point -- and I don't think we'll get to that point in 2015, and I would say, probably in 2016. If we have, as you say, the sum of the parts where each of the parts, or some combination of the parts is strong enough, and if that's the only -- if that's the path that is going to result in shareholder value maximization, then we'll take it at that time. So we're looking at it everyday, everything is on the table. But right now, the instruction within the company that everyone here at this table will say is -- the primary focus for everyone is building the strongest business that they possibly can, in the area that they compete in."

From what I can see now, probably, will be in the tens of millions, not in the hundreds of millions.

I'd say, there's actually, a third variable, Julian, which is how receptive is the company to let's call, a green NRG based on what we see with other companies out there, because obviously, there are pure play solar companies out there which sometimes, seem to be in great favor, and other times, would be seeing less favor.

Thank you for joining us an hour earlier than our usually 9:00 scheduled time.As always, joining me today are Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Operating Officer and",1207,"Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us an hour earlier than our usually 9:00 scheduled time.
As always, joining me today are Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Operating Officer and President of NRG Business. Both of them will be giving part of presentation. Additionally, Chris Moser, the Head of Commercial Operations; Elizabeth Killinger, the Head of NRG Home Retail; and Kelcy Pegler, Jr., the Head of NRG Home Solar, are joining me here and will be available to answer your questions on -- that pertain to their parts of our business.
So starting with the slide deck on Slide 3. If you're following along with that, I'm pleased to announce today that NRG has continued the positive momentum started in the first quarter of the year by reporting second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $729 million, which gives us $1.569 billion of adjusted EBITDA through the first half of 2015, and keeps us on track to achieve a full year result comfortably within our $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion guidance range, notwithstanding the very challenging commodity price environment that we have been in for the entire year.
As noted in our press release, this favorable financial results has been spearheaded by our retail franchise, led by Elizabeth Killinger and her retail manager team, who have gone from strength to strength, not only preserving healthy retail margins, but also by retaining and acquiring customers at rates that have exceeded both our expectations and previous year's performance.
Of course, this good financial news has been significantly tempered by the fact that today, at least, our shareholders haven't benefited from our improvement in the year-on-year financial performance as our share price, like others in our industry, is significantly really down since the beginning of the year and since our second quarter 2014 call 12 months ago.
What this means, of course, taking the liberty of converting our adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow off-page, is that we are now trading at a price that implies a mid-teen free cash flow yield, actually 16% for 2015. And the good news is that given the consistency of our base load hedging program and the strength of our core wholesale-retail combination, we are confident that, were these share prices to persist, we would continue to be realizing mid-teen free cash flow yields, if not higher, for the remainder of the decade.
As we look ahead over the remainder of the year, we see more reasons for optimism and even bullishness, and those are listed on this page. We expect significantly more proceeds from NRG Yield drop-downs, fueling more buybacks, more delevering and more reinvestment and contracted assets.
There's the long-awaited PJM auction occurring in just a few days that places -- that under the new rules places a financial premium on dependability and should favor an operator like ours that operates the fleet, does so reliably and includes power generation facility not dependent on an interruptible gas supply like many others in the market.
There's our Home Solar business which is ramping up quickly. Our case -- our daily bookings, 90% higher at the end of the second quarter than the first quarter. And we're achieving almost all that having barely begun to scratch the all-important California home solar market. And finally, there are the fuel conversions and another fleet repositioning projects that are proceeding at pace and remain on track to come online over the balance of 2015 and calendar year 2016, with a significant drop-off in capital spend to follow and the commensurate increase in free cash flow yield.
All in all, it's an optimistic picture for NRG that belies the market pessimism arising out of the low-commodity-price environment currently dripping the entire NRG commodities complex. Kirk and Mauricio will talk more about these financial results and the stellar operating performance that underpins them. Plus, they will discuss what's the common terms of drop-downs, PJM auctions, Home Solar bookings and planned conversions. But before I turn it over to them, let me make just a couple more points.
Turning to Slide 4. Speaking today as we are 1 day after the president's announcement of his Clean Power Plan. It seems clear to us that the one true path for an incumbent power provider like ours is to build an edifice of new clean energy technologies capabilities and assets on top of a rock-solid foundation of multifuel, multimarket across the mirador of conventional generation. In doing all of this, timing matters. We and the rest of the industry continue to bear the responsibility for keeping the lights on in the short to medium term which, in turn, depends for the foreseeable future on the sustained excellence we have demonstrated in the reliable operations and maintenance of our conventional fleet.
But to prepare for the future as a 21st century energy company, there are 3 essential capabilities which we need to continue to strengthen and grow. First, there's retail. There simply is no substitute in the coming age of energy choice and personal energy alternatives to having positive energy relationship with the end-use energy consumer. And the more end-use energy consumers we can have a relationship with, the better.
Second, renewables. And by renewables, I mean mainly solar, as the future is going to be increasingly solar-powered and increasingly distributed. If you think about it, it's amazing how quickly we have gone from hearing how prohibitively expensive solar power is just a couple of years ago through how often we don't hear about how expensive it is now.
And third, there's the yield vehicle. Because even market clot of yield paper in the ensuing selloff, NRG Yield still provides us competitive cost of capital to deploy for contracted assets that our immediate competitors cannot match. So while some of our competitors have taken steps in our direction, and certainly more will have to follow if they wish to be relevant deeper into the 21st century, at NRG, we have been building these capabilities for 6 years now and are more equipped than anyone to not only address the changes in the industry, but to make them our competitive advantage.
We have had advances and we have had setbacks. But as we sit here in the middle of 2015, I feel confident that we are advancing on all fronts, gathering momentum as we go. And as we go, our principal focus remains to ensure that our shareholders realize the value of what we have been building, and we'll continue to build in the months and years to come.
Finally, on Slide 5, I reiterate the principles articulated on our previous earnings call, quantifying how we are thinking about capital allocation in connection with building a clean energy business on the foundation of a conventional generation platform, we are, as Kirk will talk about later, on track this year to adhere to the 70-20-10 guidelines, which governs the balance of our capital investment and reinvestment strategy, between reinvesting in our foundational strength of conventional generation assets and investing in the newer customer-facing clean energy businesses that we have been building on top of our base. 
And so with that, I'll turn it over to Mauricio."

Following on the good start that we have for the year, our integrated portfolio delivered another quarter of strong results, allowing us to reaffirm guidance for the full year. These highlight the strength of our divers",1200,"Thank you, David, and good morning. Following on the good start that we have for the year, our integrated portfolio delivered another quarter of strong results, allowing us to reaffirm guidance for the full year. These highlight the strength of our diverse generation portfolio and complementary wholesale retail model, despite the fact that commodity prices remain close to comparable to what they were last year.
The hedging program and risk management activities, executed by our commercial team, protected the value of our wholesale business, while our retail business outperformed expectations through good margin management and lower supply cost. This quarter, is yet again another example of how our complementary business model performs well on their adverse price and weather scenarios. 
During the quarter, we increased our hedge levels in 2016 and 2017, effectively protecting our earnings for the next 2 years. This is particularly important over the next 18 months, as we progress through higher-than-average CapEx years, while executing our asset enhancement strategy, which I will cover in more detail in a minute. This strategy positions our portfolio to benefit from critical market developments, like PJM's capacity performance, which will be implemented later this month. 
Moving on to our traditional operational metrics on Slide 7, we had another quarter of top quartile safety performance with 151 out over 167 facilities without a single recordable injury. Conventional generation was down 6% versus the same period last year, driven primarily by an unusually active planned outage season and soft commodity prices. The soft prices significantly influence the units dispatched throughout our fleet, resulting in an 18% decrease to baseload generation relative to the same quarter last year. This was partially offset with a 52% increase in our gas and oil fleet output over the same period. 
On a regional basis, sector generation was higher by 8% thanks to better performance by SPP on gas portfolio, while the East and South Central were lower due to some coal-to-gas switching and environmental retrofit outages. The operations team remained focused throughout the spring completing 173 planned outages, including complex environmental compliance and recurring outages. Despite the reduction in generation of service hours, our base load unit's availability improved and performed when the market needs them.
Slide 8 provides a more detailed update on the progress made on our development and asset optimization efforts. It's been an important 6 months. In the first quarter, we completed the environmental retrofits at Big Cajun, Parish and Limestone. This quarter, we completed the coal-to-gas conversion at Big Cajun II Unit 2, just in time for the important summer months, and the environmental retrofits at Waukegan 8, Sayreville and Gilbert. 
We also restored 388 megawatts of incremental capacity in the premium Lower Hudson Valley capacity zone in New York at very attractive economics. This was the direct result of the market providing the right price signal required to add not only reliable capacity, but increased fuel certainty and fuel flexibility in a high-demand zone. 
Turning to Slide 9. The second quarter was another strong quarter for NRG Home, where we delivered the best second quarter results for the retail segment since NRG's purchase of Reliant retail in 2009. Total customer count was in line with expectations, with a decline of 18,000 customers, driven by less-than-expected attrition from the lower margin Northeast Dominion customers that we acquired last year.
When excluding those contracts, the recurring customer count grew in Texas and this by a total of 19,000 customers, demonstrating the continued strong momentum we achieved in attracting and retaining customers with innovative products and services. One of the reasons for our strong retail performance has been the subdued wholesale prices in ERCOT, our largest retail market.
Very little has changed since the last update, as you can see on Slide 10. Demand in ERCOT remained strong, with close to 2.5% growth for the quarter despite lower oil prices, as you can see on the upper left chart. While we have tempered our expectations for the balance of the year, we have yet to see the impact of on-power demand. On the supply side, there are not many new projects beyond the ones announced on the back of potential capacity market and cost advantage brownfield developments.
As you can see on the lower left-hand chart, both historical and forward spark spreads, now expanding over 7 years, do not support the economics of even brownfield projects. These will not only make future projects less likely, but also put existing plants at risk of mothball or shutdown. This supply rationalization prompted by economics and potential stricter environmental rules could tighten the fundamentals even more so and increase the probability of scarcity prices sooner rather than later. 
While our large, low-cost and environmentally controlled portfolio remains competitive and well hedged for the next 2 years, we will not hesitate in making the right economic decision on behalf of our shareholders if the market continues to behave in such an erratic way. For now, all eyes are on next week, with temperatures rising in Texas over 100 degrees for several consecutive days. 
Now moving to our hedging disclosures on Slide 11. We continue our focus towards the next 2 years and has a significantly increased our hedge levels to 84% in 2016 and 40% in 2017, effectively reducing our commodity risk and cash flow variation for the next 2 years.
On the fuel side, we continue to see decreases in commodity costs, fuel surcharges and transportation cost. We continue to work closely with our coal supply chain partners to layer in additional hedges to balance our power sales.
Our commercial team has done a great job in insulating us from the recent drop in gas and power prices, and has contributed significantly to our retail outperformance by effectively managing supply costs. They are now focused on the remainder of the summer and getting ready for the upcoming PJM capacity performance auction.
So a few words on the PJM option on Slide 12. As you all know, FERC approved the PJM capacity performance proposal in June. While we were disappointed by the delays in the transition of auction, the fine line is now set for the base residual auction, with the traditional auctions likely to happen in early September.  We have listed some of the main variables that participants will take into consideration during these auctions, which could provide some direction on price expectations. 
We have not been shy on our support for stricter capacity market that ensures reliability. As with any competitive market, there will be winners and losers. The characteristic of our portfolio, in terms of fuel certainty, reliability and scale, which allows us to better manage that penalty risk of underperformance, puts us in a great position to significantly benefit from these necessary change in the market and recognizes the value that our portfolio brings to the system.
So to close, the prospects of improved capacity markets, a diverse and environmentally controlled portfolio, complemented by retail and opportunistic risk management activities are the foundations for strong results during these low-commodity cycle and sets us up for even stronger results in the medium to long run.
With that, I will turn it over to Kirk."
413857,307376874,847876,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2015",2015-08-04,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone.Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 14, NRG delivered a total of $729 million in adjusted EBITDA of the second quarter, and over $1.5 billion through the first half of the year. Our second quar",1001,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone.
Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 14, NRG delivered a total of $729 million in adjusted EBITDA of the second quarter, and over $1.5 billion through the first half of the year. 
Our second quarter results were highlighted by a record $204 million in adjusted EBITDA from Home Retail, a 30% year-over-year increase, yet again highlighting the success of the integrated business model as results improved in favorable supply costs. Business & Renew for $338 million in EBITDA for the quarter, while NRG Yield, which was impacted by historically low wind speeds which continued through quarter end, contributed $187 million. 
Despite the subdued summer power prices and a reduction in expected wind production over the balance of the year, thanks to strong Home Retail performance, combined with effective wholesale hedging, we are again reaffirming our guidance ranges of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion in free cash flow before growth for 2015.
As the next step towards achieving our objective of $600 million in drop-down offers to NRG Yield during 2015, on July 24, we offered Yield the opportunity to acquire a 75% stake in a portfolio of 12 wind projects, consisting primarily of assets suppliers as part of the EME transaction. Subject to approval by NRG Yield independent directors, we anticipate the 75% stake will close by the end of this quarter, with the remaining 25% to be offered in 2016. We expect this transaction, combined with completed and ongoing drop-downs of business-to-business distributed solar and residential solar, to result in approximately $300 million in incremental proceeds from NRG Yield through September 30. 
Finally, during the quarter, NRG completed $107 million in additional share repurchases, which, when combined with our quarterly dividend, amounts to $156 million in capital returned to shareholders during the quarter. We have $51 million in the remaining share repurchase authorization, which we expect to be augmented by an additional $200 million in repurchase capacity, or 1/3 of our targeted $600 million in drop-downs based on our previously announced capital allocation program for NRG Yield proceeds.
Turning to an update on 2015 NRG capital sources and uses on Slide 15. And moving from left to right, NRG expects approximately $3.8 billion in cash available to fund our capital expenditures, debt repayment, and return to shareholders during all of 2015. That cash basically consists of 3 components: First, excess cash at year-end 2014, which is net of minimum cash reserve for liquidity; second, 2015 operating cash flow, which is basically the midpoint of our free cash flow guidance prior to deducting maintenance environmental CapEx; and third, expected cash proceeds from NRG Yield, which we continue to expect to be approximately $600 million.
2015 capital expenditures, as shown in the second column, totaled approximately $1.7 billion, and includes both maintenance and environmental CapEx as well as growth investments as a part of capital allocation. As we reviewed last quarter, about 70% of these capital expenditures represents reinvestment in our core generation fleet. This includes approximately $800 million in maintenance and environmental CapEx to ensure reliability and environmental compliance across the fleet, while the remainder is allocated toward growth investments, primarily fuel conversion to GenOn to help ensure both ongoing eligibility for capacity payments and environmental compliance.
About 20% of 2015 CapEx is being invested in long-term contracted projects, which we expect will ultimately be dropped down into yield. And finally, slightly less than 10% is allocated toward high-growth investments like eVgo and our Carbon 360 project in Texas. The remaining $2.3 billion in 2015 capital funds the balance of capital allocation. Over $1.2 billion, or slightly more than half of this amount, is allocated equally towards debt reduction and return of capital to shareholders in 2015. This includes the expected impact from our capital allocation program relative to anticipated proceeds from yield.
Over $600 million is expected to be returned to shareholders during 2015, and represents more than half of NRG's 2015 free cash flow before growth guidance. This consists of NRG's $200 million annual dividend, nearly $190 million of shares already repurchased, with $51 million in the remaining authorizations and up to $200 million in expected additional capacity related to the anticipated proceeds received from NRG Yield.
We expect approximately $900 million of remaining excess capital. $500 million of this excess is at the GenOn level, which we expect will fund the completion of our fuel conversion projects across that part of the fleet beyond 2015. The remaining capital at NRG will be available either for additional allocation in 2015 or to help support capital commitments in 2016, towards the NRG portion of the 70-20-10 capital mix.
Turning to Slide 16. I provided an illustration to help underscore a point we first raised during our Investor Day, and which has been an ongoing focus of discussions with many of you over the course of the year. In short, we expect the decline in NRG's maintenance and environmental CapEx over the next few years, as we complete the Midwest Generation environmental projects, provides a powerful cushion to help sustain the robust free cash flow, which has long been a cornerstone of the NRG story.
In order to highlight this point, we have assumed consensus-adjusted EBITDA estimates beyond 2015 for illustration [ph] purposes only, which, when combined with interest payments remaining relatively constant and the expected substantial decline of over $400 million in annual maintenance and environmental CapEx by 2017, demonstrates NRG's ability to sustain robust free cash flow despite the near-term decline in EBITDA implied by these consensus estimates.
Importantly, our free cash flow is prior to the expected ongoing receipt of drop-down proceeds from NRG Yield which, based on over $165 million in remaining right of first offer CAFD and an illustrious 8% yield, implies over $2 billion in proceeds from future drop-downs, serving to significantly augment this compelling cash flow story.

Just look at the second quarter as an example. I think you would agree with me that prices were significantly low with gas tinkering around $2.50 per MMBtu. I mean, our generation was higher in Texas quarter-over-quarter from last year to this year. And if you dig deeper, our cogeneration was just slightly lower, I would say less than 5%. So we really didn't see a lot of coal-to-gas switching in our coal fleet. On the other hand, our gas and oil units increased by 60% -- over 60% in Texas. So that tells you the strength of our portfolio and the competitive -- the cost competitive advantage that we have. So, and I guess my point is, look no further to Q2 to just give you a glimpse on how competitive our portfolio is vis-à-vis other portfolios.

I mean, you sort of hit the question on the head. The first thing I would say is I agree with you that there's -- well, it may not be immediately apparent, there's actually industrial logic to keeping a conventional side of our business to get the renewables side -- together with the renewables side. And I tried to allude to that in my comments that the world of NRG is trending green at a very decisive pace. But the one thing that trumps being green for everybody is making sure that the lights stay on, making sure that you have electricity. And the best companies that can do that, given the fundamentally intermittency of renewable power, are companies that are doing both conventional and doing green. So the industrial logic to me favors the path that NRG's on. But we are a public company and we suffer -- whether you call it the conglomerate discount or the constant refrain that we hear that we're more complex than some of the people that Wall Street can invest in. So we have to -- value maximization for shareholders is what being a public company is about. So I can't put a precise date on it, Greg. What I would tell you is it's a combination of when does it become clear that -- Wall Street has difficulty digesting the idea of a conventional company going green. But the second half of the equation is having a green company within NRG that not only can survive on its own feet as a public company, but can win the battlefield, can be as competitive as possible. So what we're about right now in 2015, and I think we're making great progress, is building -- everything within our portfolio is strengthening every day. And when we get to that point -- and I don't think we'll get to that point in 2015, and I would say, probably in 2016. If we have, as you say, the sum of the parts or each of the parts or some combination of the parts is strong enough, and if that's the only -- if that's the path that is going to result in shareholder value maximization, then we'll take it at that time. So we're looking at it everyday. Everything is on the table. But right now, the instruction within the company that everyone here at this table will say is the primary focus for everyone is building the strongest business that they possibly can in the area that they compete in."

From what I can see now, probably, will be in the tens of millions, not in the hundreds of millions.

So we are focused on building those volumes and demonstrating the ability that, that pace of installations is on a trajectory and a run rate that will allow us to demonstrate the ability to do exactly that.

A year ago, if you said who were the top tier players, they're probably the double-digit companies that were buying to be included in that.

So it's something that we are very focused on, and in fairness to the other people in our industry, they're very focused on as well. But the single biggest delay within that period is beyond the control of the solar installer. It's the time that the utility takes to interconnect. And there's been some recent study of that in the press that indicates at least one East Coast utility that's the worst at getting systems energized. And so the more that a light is shined on the fact that, that has a potential to hurt customer satisfaction, then I think that's important. I draw the analogy, it's like when you ask for the check at the restaurant, you're anxious to get home, and they take half an hour to give you the opportunity to pay for your meal. It's very frustrating to the customer. So that's probably the main thing within that time cycle we'd like to see shorted. And right now, it's beyond our control."

Thank you for joining us an hour earlier than our usually 9:00 scheduled time.As always, joining me today are Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Operating Officer and",1212,"Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us an hour earlier than our usually 9:00 scheduled time.
As always, joining me today are Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Operating Officer and President of NRG Business. Both of them will be giving part of the presentation. Additionally, Chris Moser, the Head of Commercial Operations; Elizabeth Killinger, the Head of NRG Home Retail; and Kelcy Pegler, Jr., the Head of NRG Home Solar, are joining me here and will be available to answer your questions on -- that pertain to their parts of our business.
So starting with the slide deck on Slide 3, if you're following along with that. I'm pleased to announce today that NRG has continued the positive momentum started in the first quarter of the year by reporting second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $729 million, which gives us $1.569 billion of adjusted EBITDA through the first half of 2015, and keeps us on track to achieve a full year result comfortably within our $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion guidance range, notwithstanding the very challenging commodity price environment that we have been in for the entire year.
As noted in our press release, this favorable financial results has been spearheaded by our retail franchise, led by Elizabeth Killinger and her retail management team, who have gone from strength to strength, not only preserving healthy retail margins, but also by retaining and acquiring customers at rates that have exceeded both our expectations and previous year's performance.
Of course, this good financial news has been significantly tempered by the fact that today, at least, our shareholders haven't benefited from our improvement in the year-on-year financial performance, as our share price, like others in our industry, is significantly really down since the beginning of the year and since our second quarter 2014 call 12 months ago.
What this means, of course, taking the liberty of converting our adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow off-page, is that we are now trading at a price that implies a mid-teen free cash flow yield, actually 16% for 2015. And the good news is that given the consistency of our base load hedging program and the strength of our core wholesale-retail combination, we are confident that were these share prices to persist, we would continue to be realizing mid-teen free cash flow yields, if not higher, for the remainder of the decade.
As we look ahead over the remainder of the year, we see more reasons for optimism and even bullishness, and those are listed on this page. We expect significantly more proceeds from NRG Yield drop-downs, fueling more buybacks, more delevering and more reinvestment and contracted assets.
There's the long-awaited PJM auction occurring in just a few days that places -- that under the new rules places a financial premium on dependability and should favor an operator like ours that operates the fleet, does so reliably and includes power generation facilities not dependent on an interruptible gas supply like many others in the market.
There's our Home Solar business, which is ramping up quickly. Our case -- our daily bookings, 90% higher at the end of the second quarter than the first quarter. And we're achieving almost all that having barely begun to scratch the all-important California home solar market. And finally, there are the fuel conversions and another fleet repositioning projects that are proceeding at pace and remain on track to come online over the balance of 2015 and calendar year 2016, with a significant drop-off in capital spend to follow and the commensurate increase in free cash flow yield.
All in all, it's an optimistic picture for NRG that belies the market pessimism arising out of the low-commodity-price environment currently dripping the entire NRG commodities complex. Kirk and Mauricio will talk more about these financial results and the stellar operating performance that underpins them. Plus, they will discuss what's the common terms of drop-downs, PJM auctions, Home Solar bookings and planned conversions. But before I turn it over to them, let me make just a couple more points.
Turning to Slide 4. Speaking today as we are 1 day after the president's announcement of his Clean Power Plan, it seems clear to us that the one true path for an incumbent power provider like ours is to build an edifice of new clean energy technologies, capabilities and assets on top of a rock-solid foundation of multifuel, multimarket across the mirador of conventional generation. In doing all of this, timing matters. We and the rest of the industry continue to bear the responsibility for keeping the lights on in the short to medium term, which, in turn, depends for the foreseeable future on the sustained excellence we have demonstrated in the reliable operations and maintenance of our conventional fleet.
But to prepare for the future as a 21st century energy company, there are 3 essential capabilities which we need to continue to strengthen and grow. First, there's retail. There simply is no substitute in the coming age of energy choice and personal energy alternatives to having a positive energy relationship with the end-use energy consumer. And the more end-use energy consumers we can have a relationship with, the better.
Second, renewables. And by renewables, I mean mainly solar, as the future is going to be increasingly solar-powered and increasingly distributed. If you think about it, it's amazing how quickly we have gone from hearing how prohibitively expensive solar power is just a couple of years ago to how often we don't hear about how expensive it is now.
And third, there's the yield vehicle. Because even with the recent market glut of yield paper in the ensuing selloff, NRG Yield still provides us competitive cost of capital to deploy for contracted assets that our immediate competitors cannot match. So while some of our competitors have taken steps in our direction, and certainly more will have to follow if they wish to be relevant deeper into the 21st century, at NRG, we have been building these capabilities for 6 years now and are more equipped than anyone to not only address the changes in the industry, but to make them our competitive advantage.
We have had advances and we have had setbacks. But as we sit here in the middle of 2015, I feel confident that we are advancing on all fronts, gathering momentum as we go. And as we go, our principal focus remains to ensure that our shareholders realize the value of what we have been building and we'll continue to build in the months and years to come.
Finally, on Slide 5, I reiterate the principles articulated on our previous earnings call, quantifying how we are thinking about capital allocation in connection with building a clean energy business on the foundation of a conventional generation platform, we are, as Kirk will talk about later, on track this year to adhere to the 70-20-10 guidelines, which governs the balance of our capital investment -- reinvestment strategy, between reinvesting in our foundational strength of conventional generation assets and investing in the newer customer-facing clean energy businesses that we have been building on top of our base. 
And so with that, I'll turn it over to Mauricio."

Following on the good start that we have for the year, our integrated portfolio delivered another quarter of strong results, allowing us to reaffirm guidance for the full year. This highlights the strength of our diverse generation portfolio and complementary wholesale retail model, despite the fact that commodity prices remain close to half of what they were last year.
The hedging program and risk management activities, executed by our commercial team, protected the value of our wholesale business, while our retail business outperformed expectations through good margin management and lower supply cost. This quarter, is yet again another example of how our complementary business model performs well on their adverse price and weather scenarios. 
During the quarter, we increased our hedge levels in 2016 and 2017, effectively protecting our earnings for the next 2 years. This is particularly important over the next 18 months, as we progress through higher-than-average CapEx years, while executing our asset enhancement strategy, which I will cover in more detail in a minute. This strategy positions our portfolio to benefit from critical market developments, like PJM's capacity performance, which will be implemented later this month. 
Moving on to our traditional operational metrics on Slide 7, we had another quarter of top quartile safety performance, with 151 out over 167 facilities without a single recordable injury. Conventional generation was down 6% versus the same period last year, driven primarily by an unusually active planned outage season and soft commodity prices. The soft prices significantly influenced the units dispatched throughout our fleet, resulting in an 18% decrease to baseload generation relative to the same quarter last year. This was partially offset with a 52% increase in our gas and oil fleet output over the same period. 
On a regional basis, sector generation was higher by 8% thanks to better performance by SPP on our gas portfolio, while the East and South Central were lower due to some coal-to-gas switching and environmental retrofit outages. The operations team remained focused throughout the spring completing 173 planned outages, including complex environmental compliance and recurring outages. Despite the reduction in generation of service hours, our base load unit's availability improved and performed when the market needs them.
Slide 8 provides a more detailed update on the progress made on our development and asset optimization efforts. It's been an important 6 months. In the first quarter, we completed the environmental retrofits at Big Cajun, Parish and Limestone. This quarter, we completed the coal-to-gas conversion at Big Cajun II Unit 2, just in time for the important summer months, and the environmental retrofits at Waukegan 8, Sayreville and Gilbert. 
We also restored 388 megawatts of incremental capacity in the premium Lower Hudson Valley capacity zone in New York at very attractive economics. This was the direct result of the market providing the right price signal required to add not only reliable capacity, but increased fuel certainty and fuel flexibility in a high-demand zone. 
Turning to Slide 9. The second quarter was another strong quarter for NRG Home, where we delivered the best second quarter results for the retail segment since NRG's purchase of Reliant retail in 2009. Total customer count was in line with expectations, with a decline of 18,000 customers, driven by less-than-expected attrition from the lower-margin Northeast Dominion customers that we acquired last year.
When excluding those contracts, the recurring customer count grew in Texas and this by a total of 19,000 customers, demonstrating the continued strong momentum we achieved in attracting and retaining customers with innovative products and services. One of the reasons for our strong retail performance has been the subdued wholesale prices in ERCOT, our largest retail market.
Very little has changed since the last update, as you can see on Slide 10. Demand in ERCOT remained strong, with close to 2.5% growth for the quarter despite lower oil prices, as you can see on the upper-left chart. While we have tempered our expectations for the balance of the year, we have yet to see the impact of on-power demand. On the supply side, there are not many new projects beyond the ones announced on the back of potential capacity market and cost advantage brownfield developments.
As you can see on the lower left-hand chart, both historical and forward spark spreads, now expanding over 7 years, do not support the economics of even brownfield projects. These will not only make future projects less likely, but also puts existing plants at risk of mothball or shutdown. This supply rationalization prompted by economics and potential stricter environmental rules could tighten the fundamentals even more so and increase the probability of scarcity prices sooner rather than later. 
While our large, low-cost and environmentally controlled portfolio remains competitive and well hedged for the next 2 years, we will not hesitate in making the right economic decision on behalf of our shareholders if the market continues to behave in such an erratic way. For now, all eyes are on next week, with temperatures rising in Texas over 100 degrees for several consecutive days. 
Now moving to our hedging disclosures on Slide 11. We continue our focus towards the next 2 years and have significantly increased our hedge levels to 84% in 2016 and 40% in 2017, effectively reducing our commodity risk and cash flow variation for the next 2 years.
On the fuel side, we continue to see decreases in commodity costs, fuel surcharges and transportation cost. We continue to work closely with our coal supply chain partners to layer in additional hedges to balance our power sales.
Our commercial team has done a great job in insulating us from the recent drop in gas and power prices, and has contributed significantly to our retail outperformance by effectively managing supply costs. They are now focused on the remainder of the summer and getting ready for the upcoming PJM capacity performance auction.
So a few words on the PJM auction on Slide 12. As you all know, FERC approved the PJM capacity performance proposal in June. While we were disappointed by the delays in the transitional auction, the fine line is now set for the base residual auction, with the transitional auctions likely to happen in early September.  We have listed some of the main variables that participants will take into consideration during these auctions, which could provide some direction on price expectations. 
We have not been shy on our support for stricter capacity market that ensures reliability. As with any competitive market, there will be winners and losers. The characteristic of our portfolio, in terms of fuel certainty, reliability and scale, which allows us to better manage the penalty risk of underperformance, puts us in a great position to significantly benefit from this necessary change in the market and recognizes the value that our portfolio brings to the system.
So to close, the prospects of improved capacity markets, a diverse and environmentally controlled portfolio, complemented by retail and opportunistic risk management activities are the foundations for strong results during this low-commodity cycle and sets us up for even stronger results in the medium to long run.
With that, I will turn it over to Kirk."

Our second quar",1000,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone.
Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 14, NRG delivered a total of $729 million in adjusted EBITDA of the second quarter, and over $1.5 billion through the first half of the year. 
Our second quarter results were highlighted by a record $204 million in adjusted EBITDA from Home Retail, a 30% year-over-year increase, yet again highlighting the success of the integrated business model as results improved due to favorable supply costs. Business & Renew for $338 million in EBITDA for the quarter, while NRG Yield, which was impacted by historically low wind speeds, which continued through quarter end, contributed $187 million. 
Despite the subdued summer power prices and a reduction in expected wind production over the balance of the year, thanks to strong Home Retail performance, combined with effective wholesale hedging, we are again reaffirming our guidance ranges of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion in free cash flow before growth for 2015.
As the next step towards achieving our objective of $600 million in drop-down offers to NRG Yield during 2015, on July 24, we offered Yield the opportunity to acquire a 75% stake in a portfolio of 12 wind projects, consisting primarily of assets suppliers as part of the EME transaction. Subject to approval by NRG Yield independent directors, we anticipate the 75% stake will close by the end of this quarter, with the remaining 25% to be offered in 2016. We expect this transaction, combined with completed and ongoing drop-downs of business-to-business distributed solar and residential solar, to result in approximately $300 million in incremental proceeds from NRG Yield through September 30. 
Finally, during the quarter, NRG completed $107 million in additional share repurchases, which, when combined with our quarterly dividend, amounts to $156 million in capital returned to shareholders during the quarter. We have $51 million in the remaining share repurchase authorization, which we expect to be augmented by an additional $200 million in repurchase capacity, or 1/3 of our targeted $600 million in drop-downs based on our previously announced capital allocation program for NRG Yield proceeds.
Turning to an update on 2015 NRG capital sources and uses on Slide 15. And moving from left to right, NRG expects approximately $3.8 billion in cash available to fund capital expenditures, debt repayment, and return to shareholders during all of 2015. That cash basically consists of 3 components: first, excess cash at year-end 2014, which is net of minimum cash reserve for liquidity; second, 2015 operating cash flow, which is basically the midpoint of our free cash flow guidance prior to deducting maintenance environmental CapEx; and third, expected cash proceeds from NRG Yield, which we continue to expect to be approximately $600 million.
2015 capital expenditures, as shown in the second column, totaled approximately $1.7 billion, and include both maintenance and environmental CapEx as well as growth investments as a part of capital allocation. As we reviewed last quarter, about 70% of these capital expenditures represents reinvestment in our core generation fleet. This includes approximately $800 million in maintenance and environmental CapEx to ensure reliability and environmental compliance across the fleet, while the remainder is allocated toward growth investments, primarily fuel conversion at GenOn to help ensure both ongoing eligibility for capacity payments and environmental compliance.
About 20% of 2015 CapEx is being invested in long-term contracted projects, which we expect will ultimately be dropped down into yield. And finally, slightly less than 10% is allocated toward high-growth investments like eVgo and our Carbon 360 project in Texas. The remaining $2.3 billion in 2015 capital funds the balance of capital allocation. Over $1.2 billion, or slightly more than half of this amount, is allocated equally towards debt reduction and return of capital to shareholders in 2015. This includes the expected impact from our capital allocation program relative to anticipated proceeds from yield.
Over $600 million is expected to be returned to shareholders during 2015, and represents more than half of NRG's 2015 free cash flow before growth guidance. This consists of NRG's $200 million annual dividend, nearly $190 million of shares already repurchased, with $51 million in remaining authorizations and up to $200 million in expected additional capacity related to the anticipated proceeds received from NRG Yield.
We expect approximately $900 million of remaining excess capital. $500 million of this excess is at the GenOn level, which we expect will help fund the completion of our fuel conversion projects across that part of the fleet beyond 2015. The remaining capital at NRG will be available either for additional allocation in 2015 or to help support capital commitments in 2016, towards the NRG portion of the 70-20-10 capital mix.
Turning to Slide 16. I provided an illustration to help underscore a point we first raised during our Investor Day, and which has been an ongoing focus of discussions with many of you over the course of the year. In short, we expect a decline in NRG's maintenance and environmental CapEx over the next few years, as we complete the Midwest Generation environmental projects, provides a powerful cushion to help sustain the robust free cash flow, which has long been a cornerstone of the NRG story.
In order to highlight this point, we have assumed consensus-adjusted EBITDA estimates beyond 2015 for illustrative purposes only, which, when combined with interest payments remaining relatively constant and the expected substantial decline of over $400 million in annual maintenance and environmental CapEx by 2017, demonstrates NRG's ability to sustain robust free cash flow despite the near-term decline in EBITDA implied by these consensus estimates.
Importantly, our free cash flow is prior to the expected ongoing receipt of drop-down proceeds from NRG Yield, which, based on over $165 million in remaining right of first offer CAFD and an illustrative 8% yield, implies over $2 billion in proceeds from future drop-downs, serving to significantly augment this compelling cash flow story.
With that, I'll turn it back to David for Q&A."

But specifically, in looking at more conventional or traditional investments that comport with kind of the core generation portfolio, we do and, in our discussions with the board, are informed by our current share price, which I've said in past conversations represents an opportunity cost. And so we look and proactively compare the risk-adjusted return on our own portfolio, as represented by the opportunity to deploy capital towards repurchases, relative to the risk-adjusted return we see in similar investments on growth investments. And that's exactly the way we think about that comparison on an apples-to-apples basis on growth investments versus repurchasing or expanding repurchases of our own stock."

We think that we are very -- pretty well positioned to weather these low-commodity-price scenario, and we expect to see other portfolios succumb to these very low prices. Just look at the second quarter as an example. I think you would agree with me that prices were significantly low, with gas tinkering around $2.50 per MMBtu. I mean, our generation was higher in Texas quarter-over-quarter from last year to this year. And if you dig deeper, our cogeneration was just slightly lower. I would say less than 5%. So we really didn't see a lot of coal-to-gas switching in our coal fleet. On the other hand, our gas and oil units increased by 60% -- over 60% in Texas. So that tells you the strength of our portfolio and the competitive -- the cost-competitive advantage that we have. So, and I guess my point is, look no further to Q2 to just give you a glimpse on how competitive our portfolio is vis-à-vis other portfolios. And yes, while the hedges gives us a runway for 2 years and protects the financial outlook of our portfolio, keep in mind that we dispatch our units against market prices, not necessarily against whatever hedges we put in place."

I mean, you sort of hit the question on the head. The first thing I would say is I agree with you that there's -- well, it may not be immediately apparent, there's actually industrial logic to keeping a conventional side of our business to get the renewables side -- together with the renewables side. And I tried to allude to that in my comments, that the world of NRG is trending green at a very decisive pace. But the one thing that trumps being green for everybody is making sure that the lights stay on, making sure that you have electricity. And the best companies that can do that, given the fundamentally intermittency of renewable power, are companies that are doing both conventional and doing green. So the industrial logic, to me, favors the path that NRG's on. But we are a public company and we suffer -- whether you call it the conglomerate discount or the constant refrain that we hear that we're more complex than some of the people that Wall Street can invest in. So we have to -- value maximization for shareholders is what being a public company is about. So I can't put a precise date on it, Greg. What I would tell you is it's a combination of when does it become clear that -- Wall Street has difficulty digesting the idea of a conventional company going green. But the second half of the equation is having a green company within NRG that not only can survive on its own feet as a public company, but can win the battlefield, can be as competitive as possible. So what we're about right now in 2015, and I think we're making great progress, is building -- everything within our portfolio is strengthening every day. And when we get to that point -- and I don't think we'll get to that point in 2015, and I would say, probably in 2016. If we have, as you say, the sum of the parts or each of the parts or some combination of the parts is strong enough, and if that's the only -- if that's the path that is going to result in shareholder value maximization, then we'll take it at that time.

And then number two, that we at NRG don't necessarily have final disposal of wet ash in the company. So I mean, it's hard to tell what would the impact of the ash rule right now. From what I can see now, probably, will be in the tens of millions, not in the hundreds of millions. But that's going to depend on the testing and the monitoring systems that we're going to put in place, or that we're going to go through in the next 2 to 3 years, before we need to put a compliance plan or remediation plan by 2018.

It's really hard to weigh those 2 since they're both important variables. I'd say, there's actually a third variable, Julien, which is how receptive is the company to, let's call it, a green NRG based on what we see with other companies out there. Because obviously, there are pure play solar companies out there which sometimes seem to be in great favor and other times would be seen in less favor. So it's really those 3 factors that we have to weigh all at once. I mean, for now -- I mean, from our perspective, the key is to get ourselves in the position where we have the option to do something like that in fairly short order and then see how it goes.

I think the past year, what we've seen is that the top-tier has really come into focus. A year ago, if you said who were the top tier players, there would probably the double-digit companies that were vying to be included in that. Today, I think what you've seen is this top-tier, which is 3 or 4 or 5 companies gain share, us included in that, and the rest of the space has moved backwards.

So it's something that we are very focused on, and in fairness to the other people in our industry, they're very focused on it as well. But the single biggest delay within that period is beyond the control of the solar installer. It's the time that the utility takes to interconnect. And there's been some recent study of that in the press that indicates at least one East Coast utility that's the worst at getting systems energized. And so the more that a light is shined on the fact that, that has a potential to hurt customer satisfaction, then I think that's important. I draw the analogy, it's like when you ask for the check at the restaurant, you're anxious to get home, and they take half an hour to give you the opportunity to pay for your meal.

Thank you for joining us an hour earlier than our usually 9:00 scheduled time.
As always, joining me today are Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Operating Officer and President of NRG Business. Both of them will be giving part of the presentation. Additionally, Chris Moser, the Head of Commercial Operations; Elizabeth Killinger, the Head of NRG Home Retail; and Kelcy Pegler, Jr., the Head of NRG Home Solar, are joining me here and will be available to answer your questions on -- that pertain to their parts of our business.
So starting with the slide deck on Slide 3, if you're following along with that. I'm pleased to announce today that NRG has continued the positive momentum started in the first quarter of the year by reporting second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $729 million, which gives us $1.569 billion of adjusted EBITDA through the first half of 2015, and keeps us on track to achieve a full year result comfortably within our $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion guidance range, notwithstanding the very challenging commodity price environment that we have been in for the entire year.
As noted in our press release, this favorable financial results has been spearheaded by our retail franchise, led by Elizabeth Killinger and her retail management team, who have gone from strength to strength, not only preserving healthy retail margins, but also by retaining and acquiring customers at rates that have exceeded both our expectations and previous year's performance.
Of course, this good financial news has been significantly tempered by the fact that today, at least, our shareholders haven't benefited from our improvement in the year-on-year financial performance, as our share price, like others in our industry, is significantly really down since the beginning of the year and since our second quarter 2014 call 12 months ago.
What this means, of course, taking the liberty of converting our adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow off-page, is that we are now trading at a price that implies a mid-teen free cash flow yield, actually 16% for 2015. And the good news is that given the consistency of our base load hedging program and the strength of our core wholesale-retail combination, we are confident that were these share prices to persist, we would continue to be realizing mid-teen free cash flow yields, if not higher, for the remainder of the decade.
As we look ahead over the remainder of the year, we see more reasons for optimism and even bullishness, and those are listed on this page. We expect significantly more proceeds from NRG Yield drop-downs, fueling more buybacks, more delevering and more reinvestment and contracted assets.
There's the long-awaited PJM auction occurring in just a few days that places -- that under the new rules places a financial premium on dependability and should favor an operator like ours that operates the fleet, does so reliably and includes power generation facilities not dependent on an interruptible gas supply like many others in the market.
There's our Home Solar business, which is ramping up quickly. Our case -- our daily bookings, 90% higher at the end of the second quarter than the first quarter. And we're achieving almost all that having barely begun to scratch the all-important California home solar market. And finally, there are the fuel conversions and another fleet repositioning projects that are proceeding at pace and remain on track to come online over the balance of 2015 and calendar year 2016, with a significant drop-off in capital spend to follow and the commensurate increase in free cash flow yield.
All in all, it's an optimistic picture for NRG that belies the market pessimism arising out of the low-commodity-price environment currently dripping the entire NRG commodities complex. Kirk and Mauricio will talk more about these financial results and the stellar operating performance that underpins them. Plus, they will discuss what's the common terms of drop-downs, PJM auctions, Home Solar bookings and planned conversions. But before I turn it over to them, let me make just a couple more points.
Turning to Slide 4. Speaking today as we are 1 day after the president's announcement of his Clean Power Plan, it seems clear to us that the one true path for an incumbent power provider like ours is to build an edifice of new clean energy technologies, capabilities and assets on top of a rock-solid foundation of multifuel, multimarket across the mirador of conventional generation. In doing all of this, timing matters. We and the rest of the industry continue to bear the responsibility for keeping the lights on in the short to medium term, which, in turn, depends for the foreseeable future on the sustained excellence we have demonstrated in the reliable operations and maintenance of our conventional fleet.
But to prepare for the future as a 21st century energy company, there are 3 essential capabilities which we need to continue to strengthen and grow. First, there's retail. There simply is no substitute in the coming age of energy choice and personal energy alternatives to having a positive energy relationship with the end-use energy consumer. And the more end-use energy consumers we can have a relationship with, the better.
Second, renewables. And by renewables, I mean mainly solar, as the future is going to be increasingly solar-powered and increasingly distributed. If you think about it, it's amazing how quickly we have gone from hearing how prohibitively expensive solar power is just a couple of years ago to how often we don't hear about how expensive it is now.
And third, there's the yield vehicle. Because even with the recent market glut of yield paper in the ensuing selloff, NRG Yield still provides us competitive cost of capital to deploy for contracted assets that our immediate competitors cannot match. So while some of our competitors have taken steps in our direction, and certainly more will have to follow if they wish to be relevant deeper into the 21st century, at NRG, we have been building these capabilities for 6 years now and are more equipped than anyone to not only address the changes in the industry, but to make them our competitive advantage.
We have had advances and we have had setbacks. But as we sit here in the middle of 2015, I feel confident that we are advancing on all fronts, gathering momentum as we go. And as we go, our principal focus remains to ensure that our shareholders realize the value of what we have been building and we'll continue to build in the months and years to come.
Finally, on Slide 5, I reiterate the principles articulated on our previous earnings call, quantifying how we are thinking about capital allocation in connection with building a clean energy business on the foundation of a conventional generation platform, we are, as Kirk will talk about later, on track this year to adhere to the 70-20-10 guidelines, which governs the balance of our capital investment -- reinvestment strategy, between reinvesting in our foundational strength of conventional generation assets and investing in the newer customer-facing clean energy businesses that we have been building on top of our base. 
And so with that, I'll turn it over to Mauricio."

Following on the good start that we have for the year, our integrated portfolio delivered another quarter of strong results, allowing us to reaffirm guidance for the full year. This highlights the strength of our divers",1197,"Thank you, David, and good morning. Following on the good start that we have for the year, our integrated portfolio delivered another quarter of strong results, allowing us to reaffirm guidance for the full year. This highlights the strength of our diverse generation portfolio and complementary wholesale retail model, despite the fact that commodity prices remain close to half of what they were last year.
The hedging program and risk management activities, executed by our commercial team, protected the value of our wholesale business, while our retail business outperformed expectations through good margin management and lower supply cost. This quarter, is yet again another example of how our complementary business model performs well on their adverse price and weather scenarios. 
During the quarter, we increased our hedge levels in 2016 and 2017, effectively protecting our earnings for the next 2 years. This is particularly important over the next 18 months, as we progress through higher-than-average CapEx years, while executing our asset enhancement strategy, which I will cover in more detail in a minute. This strategy positions our portfolio to benefit from critical market developments, like PJM's capacity performance, which will be implemented later this month. 
Moving on to our traditional operational metrics on Slide 7, we had another quarter of top quartile safety performance, with 151 out over 167 facilities without a single recordable injury. Conventional generation was down 6% versus the same period last year, driven primarily by an unusually active planned outage season and soft commodity prices. The soft prices significantly influenced the units dispatched throughout our fleet, resulting in an 18% decrease to baseload generation relative to the same quarter last year. This was partially offset with a 52% increase in our gas and oil fleet output over the same period. 
On a regional basis, sector generation was higher by 8% thanks to better performance by SPP on our gas portfolio, while the East and South Central were lower due to some coal-to-gas switching and environmental retrofit outages. The operations team remained focused throughout the spring completing 173 planned outages, including complex environmental compliance and recurring outages. Despite the reduction in generation of service hours, our base load unit's availability improved and performed when the market needs them.
Slide 8 provides a more detailed update on the progress made on our development and asset optimization efforts. It's been an important 6 months. In the first quarter, we completed the environmental retrofits at Big Cajun, Parish and Limestone. This quarter, we completed the coal-to-gas conversion at Big Cajun II Unit 2, just in time for the important summer months, and the environmental retrofits at Waukegan 8, Sayreville and Gilbert. 
We also restored 388 megawatts of incremental capacity in the premium Lower Hudson Valley capacity zone in New York at very attractive economics. This was the direct result of the market providing the right price signal required to add not only reliable capacity, but increased fuel certainty and fuel flexibility in a high-demand zone. 
Turning to Slide 9. The second quarter was another strong quarter for NRG Home, where we delivered the best second quarter results for the retail segment since NRG's purchase of Reliant retail in 2009. Total customer count was in line with expectations, with a decline of 18,000 customers, driven by less-than-expected attrition from the lower-margin Northeast Dominion customers that we acquired last year.
When excluding those contracts, the recurring customer count grew in Texas and this by a total of 19,000 customers, demonstrating the continued strong momentum we achieved in attracting and retaining customers with innovative products and services. One of the reasons for our strong retail performance has been the subdued wholesale prices in ERCOT, our largest retail market.
Very little has changed since the last update, as you can see on Slide 10. Demand in ERCOT remained strong, with close to 2.5% growth for the quarter despite lower oil prices, as you can see on the upper-left chart. While we have tempered our expectations for the balance of the year, we have yet to see the impact of on-power demand. On the supply side, there are not many new projects beyond the ones announced on the back of potential capacity market and cost advantage brownfield developments.
As you can see on the lower left-hand chart, both historical and forward spark spreads, now expanding over 7 years, do not support the economics of even brownfield projects. These will not only make future projects less likely, but also puts existing plants at risk of mothball or shutdown. This supply rationalization prompted by economics and potential stricter environmental rules could tighten the fundamentals even more so and increase the probability of scarcity prices sooner rather than later. 
While our large, low-cost and environmentally controlled portfolio remains competitive and well hedged for the next 2 years, we will not hesitate in making the right economic decision on behalf of our shareholders if the market continues to behave in such an erratic way. For now, all eyes are on next week, with temperatures rising in Texas over 100 degrees for several consecutive days. 
Now moving to our hedging disclosures on Slide 11. We continue our focus towards the next 2 years and have significantly increased our hedge levels to 84% in 2016 and 40% in 2017, effectively reducing our commodity risk and cash flow variation for the next 2 years.
On the fuel side, we continue to see decreases in commodity costs, fuel surcharges and transportation cost. We continue to work closely with our coal supply chain partners to layer in additional hedges to balance our power sales.
Our commercial team has done a great job in insulating us from the recent drop in gas and power prices, and has contributed significantly to our retail outperformance by effectively managing supply costs. They are now focused on the remainder of the summer and getting ready for the upcoming PJM capacity performance auction.
So a few words on the PJM auction on Slide 12. As you all know, FERC approved the PJM capacity performance proposal in June. While we were disappointed by the delays in the transitional auction, the fine line is now set for the base residual auction, with the transitional auctions likely to happen in early September. We have listed some of the main variables that participants will take into consideration during these auctions, which could provide some direction on price expectations. 
We have not been shy on our support for stricter capacity market that ensures reliability. As with any competitive market, there will be winners and losers. The characteristic of our portfolio, in terms of fuel certainty, reliability and scale, which allows us to better manage the penalty risk of underperformance, puts us in a great position to significantly benefit from this necessary change in the market and recognizes the value that our portfolio brings to the system.
So to close, the prospects of improved capacity markets, a diverse and environmentally controlled portfolio, complemented by retail and opportunistic risk management activities are the foundations for strong results during this low-commodity cycle and sets us up for even stronger results in the medium to long run.
With that, I will turn it over to Kirk."
413857,307376874,848714,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2015",2015-08-04,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone.Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 14, NRG delivered a total of $729 million in adjusted EBITDA of the second quarter, and over $1.5 billion through the first half of the year. Our second quar",1000,"Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone.
Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 14, NRG delivered a total of $729 million in adjusted EBITDA of the second quarter, and over $1.5 billion through the first half of the year. 
Our second quarter results were highlighted by a record $204 million in adjusted EBITDA from Home Retail, a 30% year-over-year increase, yet again highlighting the success of the integrated business model as results improved due to favorable supply costs. Business & Renew for $338 million in EBITDA for the quarter, while NRG Yield, which was impacted by historically low wind speeds, which continued through quarter end, contributed $187 million. 
Despite the subdued summer power prices and a reduction in expected wind production over the balance of the year, thanks to strong Home Retail performance, combined with effective wholesale hedging, we are again reaffirming our guidance ranges of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion in free cash flow before growth for 2015.
As the next step towards achieving our objective of $600 million in drop-down offers to NRG Yield during 2015, on July 24, we offered Yield the opportunity to acquire a 75% stake in a portfolio of 12 wind projects, consisting primarily of assets suppliers as part of the EME transaction. Subject to approval by NRG Yield independent directors, we anticipate the 75% stake will close by the end of this quarter, with the remaining 25% to be offered in 2016. We expect this transaction, combined with completed and ongoing drop-downs of business-to-business distributed solar and residential solar, to result in approximately $300 million in incremental proceeds from NRG Yield through September 30. 
Finally, during the quarter, NRG completed $107 million in additional share repurchases, which, when combined with our quarterly dividend, amounts to $156 million in capital returned to shareholders during the quarter. We have $51 million in the remaining share repurchase authorization, which we expect to be augmented by an additional $200 million in repurchase capacity, or 1/3 of our targeted $600 million in drop-downs based on our previously announced capital allocation program for NRG Yield proceeds.
Turning to an update on 2015 NRG capital sources and uses on Slide 15. And moving from left to right, NRG expects approximately $3.8 billion in cash available to fund capital expenditures, debt repayment, and return to shareholders during all of 2015. That cash basically consists of 3 components: first, excess cash at year-end 2014, which is net of minimum cash reserve for liquidity; second, 2015 operating cash flow, which is basically the midpoint of our free cash flow guidance prior to deducting maintenance environmental CapEx; and third, expected cash proceeds from NRG Yield, which we continue to expect to be approximately $600 million.
2015 capital expenditures, as shown in the second column, totaled approximately $1.7 billion, and include both maintenance and environmental CapEx as well as growth investments as a part of capital allocation. As we reviewed last quarter, about 70% of these capital expenditures represents reinvestment in our core generation fleet. This includes approximately $800 million in maintenance and environmental CapEx to ensure reliability and environmental compliance across the fleet, while the remainder is allocated toward growth investments, primarily fuel conversion at GenOn to help ensure both ongoing eligibility for capacity payments and environmental compliance.
About 20% of 2015 CapEx is being invested in long-term contracted projects, which we expect will ultimately be dropped down into yield. And finally, slightly less than 10% is allocated toward high-growth investments like eVgo and our Carbon 360 project in Texas. The remaining $2.3 billion in 2015 capital funds the balance of capital allocation. Over $1.2 billion, or slightly more than half of this amount, is allocated equally towards debt reduction and return of capital to shareholders in 2015. This includes the expected impact from our capital allocation program relative to anticipated proceeds from yield.
Over $600 million is expected to be returned to shareholders during 2015, and represents more than half of NRG's 2015 free cash flow before growth guidance. This consists of NRG's $200 million annual dividend, nearly $190 million of shares already repurchased, with $51 million in remaining authorizations and up to $200 million in expected additional capacity related to the anticipated proceeds received from NRG Yield.
We expect approximately $900 million of remaining excess capital. $500 million of this excess is at the GenOn level, which we expect will help fund the completion of our fuel conversion projects across that part of the fleet beyond 2015. The remaining capital at NRG will be available either for additional allocation in 2015 or to help support capital commitments in 2016, towards the NRG portion of the 70-20-10 capital mix.
Turning to Slide 16. I provided an illustration to help underscore a point we first raised during our Investor Day, and which has been an ongoing focus of discussions with many of you over the course of the year. In short, we expect a decline in NRG's maintenance and environmental CapEx over the next few years, as we complete the Midwest Generation environmental projects, provides a powerful cushion to help sustain the robust free cash flow, which has long been a cornerstone of the NRG story.
In order to highlight this point, we have assumed consensus-adjusted EBITDA estimates beyond 2015 for illustrative purposes only, which, when combined with interest payments remaining relatively constant and the expected substantial decline of over $400 million in annual maintenance and environmental CapEx by 2017, demonstrates NRG's ability to sustain robust free cash flow despite the near-term decline in EBITDA implied by these consensus estimates.
Importantly, our free cash flow is prior to the expected ongoing receipt of drop-down proceeds from NRG Yield, which, based on over $165 million in remaining right of first offer CAFD and an illustrative 8% yield, implies over $2 billion in proceeds from future drop-downs, serving to significantly augment this compelling cash flow story.
With that, I'll turn it back to David for Q&A."

Just look at the second quarter as an example. I think you would agree with me that prices were significantly low, with gas tinkering around $2.50 per MMBtu. I mean, our generation was higher in Texas quarter-over-quarter from last year to this year. And if you dig deeper, our cogeneration was just slightly lower. I would say less than 5%. So we really didn't see a lot of coal-to-gas switching in our coal fleet. On the other hand, our gas and oil units increased by 60% -- over 60% in Texas. So that tells you the strength of our portfolio and the competitive -- the cost-competitive advantage that we have. So and I guess my point is, look no further to Q2 to just give you a glimpse on how competitive our portfolio is vis-à-vis other portfolios. And yes, while the hedges gives us a runway for 2 years and protects the financial outlook of our portfolio, keep in mind that we dispatch our units against market prices, not necessarily against whatever hedges we put in place."

I mean, you sort of hit the question on the head. The first thing I would say is I agree with you that there's -- well, it may not be immediately apparent, there's actually industrial logic to keeping a conventional side of our business to get the renewables side -- together with the renewables side. And I tried to allude to that in my comments, that the world of NRG is trending green at a very decisive pace. But the one thing that trumps being green for everybody is making sure that the lights stay on, making sure that you have electricity. And the best companies that can do that, given the fundamentally intermittency of renewable power, are companies that are doing both conventional and doing green. So the industrial logic, to me, favors the path that NRG's on. But we are a public company and we suffer -- whether you call it the conglomerate discount or the constant refrain that we hear that we're more complex than some of the people that Wall Street can invest in. So we have to -- value maximization for shareholders is what being a public company is about. So I can't put a precise date on it, Greg. What I would tell you is it's a combination of when does it become clear that -- Wall Street has difficulty digesting the idea of a conventional company going green. But the second half of the equation is having a green company within NRG that not only can survive on its own feet as a public company, but can win the battlefield, can be as competitive as possible. So what we're about right now in 2015, and I think we're making great progress, is building -- everything within our portfolio is strengthening every day. And when we get to that point -- and I don't think we'll get to that point in 2015, and I would say, probably in 2016. If we have, as you say, the sum of the parts or each of the parts or some combination of the parts is strong enough, and if that's the only -- if that's the path that is going to result in shareholder value maximization, then we'll take it at that time. So we're looking at it every day. Everything is on the table. But right now, the instruction within the company that everyone here at this table will say is the primary focus for everyone is building the strongest business that they possibly can in the area that they compete in."

And then number two, that we at NRG don't necessarily have final disposal of wet ash in the company. So I mean, it's hard to tell what would the impact of the ash rule right now. From what I can see now, probably, will be in the tens of millions, not in the hundreds of millions. But that's going to depend on the testing and the monitoring systems that we're going to put in place, or that we're going to go through in the next 2 to 3 years, before we need to put a compliance plan or remediation plan by 2018.

Because obviously, there are pure play solar companies out there which sometimes seem to be in great favor and other times would be seen in less favor.

But the single biggest delay within that period is beyond the control of the solar installer. It's the time that the utility takes to interconnect. And there's been some recent study of that in the press that indicates at least one East Coast utility that's the worst at getting systems energized. And so the more that a light is shined on the fact that, that has a potential to hurt customer satisfaction, then I think that's important. I draw the analogy, it's like when you ask for the check at the restaurant, you're anxious to get home, and they take half an hour to give you the opportunity to pay for your meal.

So with just over 6 weeks passed since we hosted the NRG Reset call, we are going to do our best to be brief so that we could provide you with ample time to ask the questions that you have. However, with the unabated selloff in our stock and across the entire sector during the quarter, I want to begin by acknowledging how difficult the time it has been for you, our shareholders. And truth, in this market environment, I don't know that I could predict what exactly what will cause the stock to turnaround and recover to some level that approximates fair value. But I can tell you that NRG's operational and financial performance has been strong and solid within expectations, that our current liquidity is as strong as it has ever been at over $4 billion. And that our reset program has passed through the planning stage since its implementation with every aspect of it well on track, albeit still in the early going. There certainly are hope and expectation that the gradual accomplishments of various aspects of the reset, the cost cutting, the freeing up of committed capital through various measures, the allocation of capital, particularly to the reduction of debt, all provide a continuous [indiscernible] to the recovery of our share price. And after that preliminary comment, let's move on to discuss how our business has performed through the third quarter of 2015.
Turning to Slide 3 in the Business Update. I'm pleased to report today that we are narrowing our 2015 full year adjusted EBITDA guidance to $3.25  billion to $3.35 billion, solidly in the middle of the original guidance range. Our financial performance in the ever important third quarter was just tremendous, and demonstrated once again the resilience of having a matched Retail Wholesale platform. In a period of subdued Wholesale power prices, our Retail business, alongside our outstanding commercial operations team excel. And indeed, our Retail business delivered its best quarterly result since 2010 with $225 million in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. 
Regarding our conventional Wholesale business, which, by the way, turned in another strong operational quarter, probably the most noteworthy event during the quarter has been the extensive commentary in the financial community, questioning the medium to long term prospects for a power plant fleet like ours. My reaction at this point, based on the many commodity price cycles I have lived through in this industry, is that you can't ignore the underlying reliability value of location advanced assets in competitive markets. Our 48,000 megawatts fleet has a key competitive advantage in each of our 3 regional markets. 
First, in Texas, our generation portfolio's footprint closely matches and compliments our thriving Texas repo. Second, the East, our portfolio has been shaped to focus on providing and being compensated for reliable capacity as demonstrated by the enhanced value in earnings energy as a result for the recent capacity performance option and the importance of which has been underlined by the recently announcement of Entergy with respect to the closure of the Fitzpatrick line. 
And third, and in the West, our portfolio features a heavily contracted, fast-start gas capability, tailored to the market moving towards 50% renewables. In all 3 of our Retail markets, the stead and stable operations of our generation remains critical, not only to the enterprise, but to the grid in general. 
Moving on to other signs of a successful execution of our business plan, I'm pleased to announce today that just yesterday, we closed our most recent drop down NRG Yield, which delivered $210 million in cash back to Entergy, which, as you know, we will be utilizing as part of our efforts to shrink the balance sheet as we discussed in our last call.
I'm also pleased to report that as we announced on September 22, we successfully executed on the $251 million share repurchase program, which in combination with all shares to be purchased year-to-date brings the total shares acquired this year to 7% of our outstanding shares. As we will discuss in more detail in a bit, we are now shifting our immediate capital allocation focus to debt reduction as we indicate would be the case in our NRG reset call as way not only to further strengthen our balance sheet, but also to unlock shareholder value. 
Lastly, our Home Solar business remains well on track as we outlined 6 weeks ago, driven by top line growth with over 6,300 net bookings in the quarter, and we believe one of the highest, if not the highest, growth rates of the major players in this sector. This volume places us in the [indiscernible] with Sunrun and not far off from dividend in the #2 position. 
With respect to our installations for the quarter, we numbered 1,900, are now at total of approximately 80 megawatts. We are making progress in our concerted efforts to reduce the backlog going into and through the early months of 2016. For those tracking Home Solar's negative EBITDA contribution projected for full year 2015, continues to track within the negative $175 million disclosed on the second quarter call.
So let's move on and discuss progress on the NRG reset and drivers behind our 2016 financial guidance, turning to Slide 4.
Let me start with components of the reset, which are full within our control. We are well into the implementation stage of our companywide cost reduction program of $150 million across G&A, marketing and development expense. In addition, and Mauricio will provide more details on this, I'm also pleased to announce today that we have identified and are implementing an additional $100 million in O&M spending reductions across all of our businesses, all of which can be done in matter that does not sacrifice of the reliability of our portfolio. 
So when combined with the initial NRG reset cost reduction plans, our cost reduction efforts now bring on an annual basis of total cost savings target of $250 million to be achieved in 2016 and recurring thereafter. 
On the asset rebalancing component of the program, we remain focused on and highly confident in our ability to unlock, in combination with the cost reduction program, over $1 billion in capital for allocation to reduce the balance sheet. The modifications of our plants in Portland, [indiscernible] and [indiscernible] are complete, reducing or eliminating additional capital spend at those plants, and we are actively marketing select assets for dispositions. Given the high level of interest in these assets expressed during our preliminary marketing phase for the past few weeks, we are moving forward at a pace and in a manner that we believe will lead to an optimization of value for NRG shareholders. You should expect, in all likelihood, a series of such transaction announcements over the weeks and months to come. 
Regarding the GreenCo business, the $125 million GreenCo run way around NRG Home Solar, the C&I business that NRG Renew and eVgo is established and ready to commence on January 1, 2016. As it relates to the process around the securing of the strategic or financial partner in GreenCo, through the initial phase of our efforts, we are quite pleased with the interest we are seeing. We continue to be in a market discovery process and remain focused on selling a majority of interests in Gulf Coast with the goal of financial consolidation and simplification at the parent company level. 
However, and not unlike our approach to asset dispositions on the conventional side, our approach, with respect to GreenCo, is value first and speed of execution second. The choice of partner in the GreenCo is an important  one, and we are focused on both optimizing current value and positioning the business which NRG will continue to own a significant stake in for future success. We will provide you with more material updates as the process allows. 
So as we look at all the actions we are taking and currently [indiscernible] with the ongoing benefit of our integrated platform, we are introducing 2016 financial guidance of $3 billion to $3.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA, and $1 billion to $1.2 billion in free cash flow before growth on a consolidated basis. 
As an additional item and something Kirk will provide more detail around, in response to many of the questions we are receiving from investors pertaining to the complexity of our capital structure, for the first time, we are now providing our expectation for free cash flow before growth at the NRG level. What this represents is the free cash flow generation, excluding nonrecourse subsidiaries such as GenOn, NRG Yield and the primary NRG [indiscernible]  Assets. Our hope is that providing this view, we will eliminate at least part of the concern about the geography of our cash flows.
Now turning to Slide 5, I would like to touch upon capital allocation. We have repeatedly stated over the past few months that our focus over the coming year is on shrinking the balance sheet. So for the avoidance of doubt, let me put our thinking in this regard into some historical context. For many years now, indeed for almost my entire time as CEO of NRG, our focus has been to establish a diversified business platform that reduces our company's exposure to near-term fluctuations in natural gas and power prices amongst other potentially concentrated risks. Specifically, our goal always has been to minimize commodity price impact on free cash flow, while maintain the upside that occurs when the commodity markets move in a positive direction. Our key tool in this regard, in addition to hedging, has been assets and business diversification. Our diversification commenced in earnest when we entered the Retail business 6 years ago through the acquisition of Reliant. Followed with our strong move in the contractor generation targeted around renewables, our redevelopment efforts at our location [indiscernible] brownfield sites, and most recently, our asset management program aimed at maximizing our economic advancing capacity markets like PJM. This quarter's performance, specially with our outstanding Retail performance and next year's guidance coming in as they do at the time of historically low natural gas prices, speaks to the effectiveness of our business diversification as a financial buffer. But, of course, this diversification becomes a mood point if market concerns around the balance sheet persists. this is our strongly held belief that NRG's equity investors will benefit from an absolute reduction in our debt, most notably at the NRG level, but also across our entire capital structure. As Kirk will outline, that is the focus of our capital allocation program now.
As this Slide 5 describes is a result of our recent efforts, we aim to free up roughly $1.6 billion in total over the next 14 months to apply to balance sheet shrinking, and particularly, to debt reduction. Further, as we look out beyond the next 14 months, our efforts around reducing maintenance CapEx and the material completion of our capital expenditure program will provide further capital allocation flexibility. Our overriding goal that [indiscernible] this  entire efforts has put to rest the question of whether NRG is carrying an excessive level of debt so that all of us can be on the same plane where can focus on the cash generative power of the NRG businesses and how that cash can be put to its best use for the benefits of NRG shareholders. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Mauricio."

Our integrated platform continue to perform extremely well during the quarter. Our Wholesale business mitigated the impact of lower power prices through active hedging and good commercial execution, while our Retail business benefited from lower supply cost, highlighting once again the strength of our Wholesale Retail platform. 
During the quarter, we continue to take steps on repositioning our portfolio to optimize and improve economic and returns. First, our asset optimization efforts in the Northeast, which focuses on capacity revenues, was validated by the recent PJM capacity performance [indiscernible]. Second, we continue to reduce spend at [indiscernible] which I will discuss in more detail in our later slide. And finally, we have taken the necessary steps to hedge our portfolio in the short term to protect further downside. All of these efforts are in addition to the business diversification strategy that David already mentioned in his remarks.
So let's start with a review of our operational performance on Slide 7. We had another quarter of top quartile safety performance with 147 out of 168 facilities that finished the quarter without a single recordable injury. We are mindful that our portfolio is going through some changes, and we need to stay vigilant and redouble our efforts to ensure of safety [indiscernible] and remains always first.
Our total generation was up 5% for the quarter, driven primarily by high generation in the Gulf and the West. The East was relatively unchanged with the slightly lower cogeneration, offset by higher [indiscernible]. Our Poland nuclear plant improved their availability and reliability metrics. I want to congratulate [indiscernible] of almost perfect [indiscernible] summer. Our gas units continue to be hold on more frequently in the market as you can see in the bottom right chart. We continue to maintain a remarkable 99% starting reliability in our gas. Turning to Slide 8, our Retail business continue its trend of exceptional performance, delivering $225 million of adjusted EBITDA, the highest third quarter since 2010 and $68 million more than last year. During the quarter, we capture value from lower cost of service, effective margin management and expansion of our product offering. We have also sustained our strong momentum in customer acquisition and retention that led to 5,000 customer account growth, despite a continued expiration of our acquired Dominion customers contracts in the East where we continue to see better-than-expected retention levels.
Excluding the Dominion acquisition, our customer growth was 26,000.
As we have stated in the past 6 years, the ongoing success of our Retail business continues to demonstrate the value of our integrated Wholesale Retail platform, and most importantly, provides NRG diversification in earnings through all stages of the commodity cycle.
Turning to Slide 9, let me share a few comments on the gas market. We have experienced pretty mild weather this past year. A warm winter followed by a mild summer. This weather combination most likely will lead to a new record storage number in the coming weeks at or near 40 CF. Combined with the expectation of an El Niño weather forecast, and you've got a market we don't need various news and falling prices. It's worth noting that El Niño is typically associated with a warmer upper Midwest winter and a colder Gulf Coast one. The diversified energy company with asset involved areas, we could do well in such a scenario. 
I want to remind everyone that we're very well hedged for 2016 and about 50% in 2017. Giving us a nice run way to what we see as a more bullish future. Make no mistake, where we think plenty of upside in gas prices were to rise, but have [indiscernible] significantly the downside through hedging and business diversification. 
Regardless of current sentiment, in our view, long term natural gas fundamentals looks strong. The first half of this decade was dominated by supply growth of stripping demand. We expect the second half to revert that trend with demand growth of stripping supply. Natural gas production has been stagnant since late last year in part because of lower rig counts and low prices. In the meantime, we see growing LNG exports, increasing exports to Mexico, higher industrial production and greater demand from the power sector. As an example, our fuel conversions at [indiscernible] has been [indiscernible] along will increase our summer peak gas consumption by [indiscernible] bcf per day. The gas demand from new builds and conversions is real and is coming. Simply put, we're well-positioned to weather the short term low prices and remain open to benefit from bullish long-term fundamentals.
Turning to Slide 10 on our power market updates, and starting with our [indiscernible]. Have we had this [indiscernible] for several years now, market changes are needed to better reflect [indiscernible] conditions like the ones we experienced this summer. During August, we saw our first real test of the operating reserve demand for mechanism, and sadly, we watched it fail. Specialty conditions arrived for a few days, during which a new record peak was set. But aside from one $350 [indiscernible]  Clear, the week was mostly disappointing. A combination of specific conditions and low prices both the market participants and the [indiscernible] attention. While all this is suspected to be a major topic of conversation at the open meeting tomorrow. Discussions are now underway for some potential changes that can be made for the RDC parameters to make it more effective and reflecting truth [indiscernible] beyond the system. 
We're supportive of that effort, and we'll actively participate in the discussion. Otherwise, fundamentals remain strong, with low growth by 2.7% on a weather normalized basis so far this year despite lower oil prices. Combined with the risk of additional retirements, going forward prices look too low and present an upside to our low-cost and environmentally controlled portfolio.
As for the Northeast, we have been repositioning our portfolio from providing baseload energy, to providing reliability of the capacity resource. The recent result in PJM and New England, which we just covered in our recent call to validate our commercial strategy. 
In the past couple of weeks, we've heard news of additional nuclear retirements. It would seemed up smaller, nuclear plants are starting to cover costs and may lead the way for further tightening in the market.
Turning to our hedging disclosure on Slide 11. And as I mentioned earlier today, we're pretty well hedged for the next 2 years. As the cart in the upper left of the slide shows, we're very well hedged against our expected production for 2016 and almost 50% hedged for 2017. We are evaluating further entry points to increase our coal hedges, and are comfortable with current inventory levels as we head into the winter months. We like the remaining open position for the back half of 2017 and beyond given our more constructed yield in gas and power. 
Finally, on Slide 12, I want to provide more details on our expanded cost reduction program across the company, and more specifically, the $100 million reduction in O&M savings that David mentioned. As you likely have assumed, most of these will be executed on the Wholesale business, where we continue our work on evaluating and prioritizing every actionable spend decision on an asset-by-asset basis. Key drivers of the overall reduction relates to the asset organization efforts that we announced around Portland and [indiscernible] respectively. Changes in the way we're managing operational risk and further cost reductions on the units that have lower capacity factors. 
Of course, we will not make any O&M reductions that jeopardize the safe and efficient operations of our fleet. 
In addition to the $100 million reduction just announced, we're introducing the [indiscernible] of NRG's continues business improvement program called for NRG. This program is driven by employee ideas and innovation to enhance each department's bottom line. The 4 stance were our focus for return, and this is rooting and ensuring that all employees are empowered to find better, more cost-effective ways on doing our jobs. Our goal is to achieve a $150 million of cumulative EBITDA over the next 3 years.
Just as we have done in the past, we remain committed to our continues improvement program that has yielded so many benefits for NRG and its shareholders. With that, I will turn it over to Kirk."

We'll begin with the financial summary on Slide 14. NRG delivered a total of $1.145 billion in adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter, and over $2.7 billion for the 9 months ended September 30. Our third quarter's results were highli",1859,"Thank you, Mauricio. We'll begin with the financial summary on Slide 14. NRG delivered a total of $1.145 billion in adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter, and over $2.7 billion for the 9 months ended September 30. 
Our third quarter's results were highlighted by $225 million in adjusted EBITDA from Home Retail, a 35% year-over-year increase, again highlighting the success of NRG's integrated business model as results improved largely due to its favorable supply costs. Business and renew combined were $722 million in EBITDA for the quarter, while NRG Yield contributed $198 million.
Despite the subdued summer power prices, our strong Home Retail performance, combined with effective Wholesale hedging, allows us to narrow our adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $3.25 billion to $3.35 billion, still in line with the midpoint of our original 2015 guidance. 
Looking to the business segment components of adjusted EBITDA guidance, the increase in guidance for NRG Yield reflects the full year impact of the closing of the wind portfolio drop-down, as required under GAAP, with an equal reduction in business and renew guidance, which previously included the EBITDA associated with equity stake now held by yield. 
Based on our strong Retail performance for the quarter, we are also increasing the Retail components of 2015 EBITDA guidance, which offsets the modest reduction in expected 2015 wholesale results. 
Finally, we are also narrowing guidance for 2015 free cash flow to $1.125 billion to $1.225 billion. 
Turning to other highlights, and focusing first on our progress on NRG Yield drop-downs, we're pleased to announce we've now closed the previously announced sale of a 75% interest on the portfolio of 12 wind projects in NRG Yield for $210 million in cash. The remaining 25% interest continues to be part of the drop-down pipeline remaining under the expanded right of first offer agreement. 
NRG intends to complete the balance of the $100 million in commercial distributed solar projects and $150 million in residential solar leases under our existing partnerships with NRG Yield over the balance of 2015 and into early '16. 
As we've indicated in previous quarters, NRG also intends to offer its remaining stake in CVSR to NRG Yield in late 2015, which makes up the balance of the $600 million and expected drop-down offers to yield during 2015 as originally announced on our first quarter earnings call.
Turning to share repurchases, NRG completed the purchase of $251 million of its common stock during September and October of 2015, which, when combined with our previously completed share repurchases and annualized dividend, lead to a total of approximately $630 million in capital returns at NRG's common stockholders in 2015 and a 7% reduction in common shares outstanding. 
Turning to 2016 guidance on Slide 15, we're initiating 2016 guidance ranges with adjusted EBITDA of $3 billion to $3.2 billion, consisting of business and utility scale renewable adjusted EBITDA of $1.545  billion to $1.67 billion, Retail adjusted EBITDA of $650 million to $725 million, which is a $50 million increase over our initial 2015 Retail guidance. 
And finally, NRG Yield adjusted EBITDA of $805 million, which includes the recently closed [indiscernible] drop-downs. Our free cash flow before growth guidance, which is net of maintenance and environmental capital, is expected to be a robust $1 billion to $1.2 billion. 
Our 2016 guidance excludes the impact of the GreenCo businesses as identified during our reset call on September 18, for which NRG's total cash committed is limited to $125 million, which will be managed through an intercompany revolving credit facility as parts of NRG 2016 capital allocation, which I'll review in greater detail shortly. 
As David mentioned earlier, to further clarify the cash flow and capital available at the NRG level, we are also initiating guidance for the portion of our total free cash flow before growth guidance, which is available at the NRG level, which for 2016, we expect to be $750 million to $950 million. This range is based on deducting the portion of our total free cash flow guidance, expected to be generated at NRG's nonguarantor subsidiaries, which consist primarily of GenOn, NRG Yield and the remaining ROFO assets.
And then finally, adding back to the expected cash distributions and dividends from these subsidiaries, it makes up the adjustment to arrive at NRG level free cash flow before growth. 
Turning to Slide 16, and continuing to see clarifying enhancing our exposures. In light of increasing questions and focus from investors leverage levels at NRG, I have provided here a deconstructed view of the consolidated balance sheet as well as the interpretation of the NRG corporate debt, corporate EBITDA ratio, which is a cornerstone of our targeted prudent balance sheet metric. As you recall, we target this ratio at 4.25x, which is consistent with our targeted BB credit metrics, recently reaffirmed by S&P. 
Based on the midpoint of our 2016 guidance and previously committed debt reduction from 2015, we are in line with the target. As shown on the left of this slide, although NRG's consolidated debt balance as of the quarter end is approximately $20 billion, overall $11 million of that debt resides at our excluded project subsidiary, which consist primarily of NRG Yield and the remaining ROFO assets, most of the debt of which is fully amortized and consistent with the contract durations, with the remaining non-recourse debt residing at GenOn. This debt is another recourse to NRG and is not counted in our corporate credit metrics, including the debt-to-EBITDA ratio prescribed by our credit facilities, which contains thresholds governing our ability to purchase shares and pay dividend. 
Only the remaining $8.8 billion of debt consisting with our senior unsecured notes and term loan facility is recourse to NRG and accounts to this ratio. On the right of the slide, after adjusting for the $500 million in 2015 capital already allocated to NRG level debt reduction which we expect to augment using 2016 capital, we anticipate corporate debt for the numerator of the ratio to be less than $8.3 billion in 2016. 
Turning to corporate EBITDA or the denominator of the targeted ratio, we began with the midpoint of our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance. As only cash distribution from our project subsidiaries count as EBITDA for ratio for purposes, we matched the midpoint 2016 EBITDA from these subsidiaries, and then add back these cash distributions, which include our share of dividends from NRG Yield and distributions in payments from the remaining nonrecourse subsidiaries, primarily remaining ROFO asset. 
The final adjustment this an add back of noncash components of corporate level of expenses, which we're deducting and arriving at our EBITDA guidance. 
What results is $1.95 billion of corporate level EBITDA, which basically represents EBITDA from assets and businesses from our recourse subsidiaries, plus the cash distributions and payments from nonrecourse stubs. Based on the midpoint of our 2016 guidance, our expected corporate debt-to-EBITDA is no greater than 4.26x, in line with our long term targets of this ratio, and significantly below both our restricted payment and default ratio. 
As I mentioned earlier, we expect to augment our 2015 allocation of capital to debt reduction, with additional debt reduction using 2016 to capital driving this ratio even lower and providing additional balance sheet strengthening as we move into 2017. We remain committed to shrinking the NRG balance sheet as part of the NSG reset, and leaving now doubt as to the strength and integrity of NRG credit ratios as we move into the 2016 and beyond.
Turning to Slide 17. Having initiated 2016 guidance, I'd like to next review NRG level capital available for allocation for 2016. We are focused here on capital allocation at the NRG level, which excludes NRG Yield excess cash, [indiscernible] excess cash reserve for liquidity and the completion of our asset optimization projects at GenOn. 
Moving from left to right, we have now allocated all remaining 2015 capital for its debt reduction, which we expect to execute over the balance of 2015 and into 2016, totaling $500 million in discretionary debt reduction at NRG. This balance consist of $200 million, which is 1/3 of the targeted 2015 NRG Yield drop-down [indiscernible] plus $300 million of remaining capital also announced as part of the NRG reset in September, which we are now committing to debt reduction as well.
Turning to 2016, incremental NRG level capital for allocation begins with the midpoint of our NRG level free cash flow guidance of $850 million. Total 2016 committed capital NRG is approximately $600 million as shown int he red bar, and is comprised of the $125 million GenOn run way revolver, those investments of $250 million, primarily our [indiscernible] Robinson [indiscernible] project, Carbon 360, and the eVgo California settlement, with the balance allocated to NRG level corporate debt amortization and our common stock dividend. 
The remaining free cash flow balance of $250 million, combined with $500 million of 2015 capital, remain to be deployed for its debt reduction, leads to $750 million in capital available at the NRG level through 2016, which we expect to further supplement through the execution of the remainder of the energy NRG reset initiatives. These initiatives include nonrecourse project financing for which we expect to fund approximately $250 million of environmental CapEx at Midwest Generation, thereby increasing capital available to NRG. Having now completed the rating process and documentation of this financing, we are prepared to launch when the market conditions become more favorable.
Targeted asset sale proceeds from the NRG reset totaling at least $500 million, are expected to further augment excess capital for consolidated balance sheet reduction. 
Finally, and potentially supplemental to the $1.1 billion in reset capital, any proceeds from the GreenCo sell-down and future NRG Yield drop-downs located currently by equity market recovery, which served to further expand NRG level capital for allocation. 
By way of reference, in the upper right corner of the page, I've provided a walk, beginning with the remaining 2016 excess NRG level free cash flow through the other components of the NRG reset, which combined now total $1.1 billion in consolidated 2016 capital to be deployed toward shrinking the balance sheet. 
Finally, turning to Slide 18, I'd like to briefly review and update our expectations for significant reductions in maintenance, environmental and growth capital from 2016 to 2017. Our revised 2016 capital expenditures reflect reductions in growth CapEx, spending primarily from the $100 million and reduced spend on fuel conversions at GenOn as well as GreenCo-related growth CapEx, which is now capped at $125 million based on the run way amount. 
Turning to 2017, due to incremental reductions and expected 2017 growth capital expenditures, including the elimination of distributed generation solar and residential solar, we now expect a year-over-year reduction of over $550 million in consolidated CapEx in 2017 versus 2016, and approximately $350 million of this reduction occurring under the NRG level. These substantial year-over-year reductions in expected capital expenditures provide a significant [indiscernible]  Against continued softness in commodity prices and a potential uplift in available capital in 2017, which may be allocated to further balance sheet reductions, including debt reductions and return of shareholder capital. 
With that, I'll turn it back to David."

And as we turn to our closing slide, which is Slide 20, we end by quantifying a point previously made, which is that NRG's financial results in 2016 are not be nearly as exposed to fluctuating gas prices as the market change seems to be suggesting. We have successfully mitigated the downward exposure of a falling natural gas prices through our hedging program and through our asset diversification. In the ultra low commodity price environment that currently grips our market, this strategy is what has enabled us today to guide to a healthy adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow level for 2016, in which, together with a substantially increased capital flexibility rising out of the steps listed on the right side of this page, should enable us to implement a substantial capital allocation program over the months ahead. 
Our goal in all of this is to make NRG a simpler,  less leveraged company over the duration of the reset program. NRG is not just an IPP. As we have demonstrated on this call, NRG's unique advantage is that our balanced Wholesale Retail business, mitigate the financial impact of low energy commodity prices, which enables us to possibly serve our Retail customers with a growing mix of products and services. This is essential during the current low commodity price cycle when the volume pendulum in the sector clearly has swung to serving the end-use energy customer. As I said, this Wholesale Retail balance is NRG's unique advantage, and all of us at NRG are excited about the opportunities we have in front of us to maximize the value of this advantage for the benefit of NRG shareholders. And with that, Liz, we are happy to take people's questions."

As to the targeted metric, we continue to target 4.25x corporate debt to corporate EBITDA. Also focused on FFO to debt, keeping that number below -- at or below the high-teens level. And I'd say the tertiary component of that is will look to stay around 50% debt to capital, though that is a book ratio, certainly, something that we focus on, the  ratings agency [indiscernible] but I think, it's probably certainly tertiary than the first 2. And so and part of the reason why we focus on that 4.25 is, as I've said, it [indiscernible] with what  based on our ongoing conversation, the ratings support those double the credit metrics.

The $250 million in the nonrecourse financing, we expect to be at the NRG level, offsetting what would otherwise be an energy capital location our CapEx towards the completion of that environmental spend at Midwest Gen. And then the asset sales, depending on the outcome will be a blend in terms of proceeds between NRG and GenOn. So the way you come up with that, that is accurate, yes."

I would -- I mean, I listed some of the main drivers of that. But I will say the first [indiscernible] impact of the decision, the asset organization, the decisions that we made at Portland -- the suspension of Portland, the retirement of the company. The second one is we've gone through a line-by-line review of every single asset, particularly those that are in a more challenging market conditions. And we have right sized the cost structure to conform with those market dynamics. And then the third one is as we have a portfolio close to 50,000 megawatts allows us to optimize of the management of outage risk and what I call the contingency money that we know we're going to spend. We just don't know where. So if you have a single asset, you to budget for the force outage. But when you have 50,000 megawatts, then you can optimize across the entire portfolio. So that is the step 1. Step 2 is the [indiscernible] for the full year, and this is a target. You are familiar with the [indiscernible] NRG because this is [indiscernible] duration fo this. We are looking at companywide how can we do the things that we're doing today better and a more cost-effective way? So think of this as a whole contract renegotiations, [indiscernible] negotiations, property tax renegotiations. So I mean, it is a host of things that we can do that is very difficult to pinpoint today, but we've been very effective and we've been very successful in achieving in the past these cost-savings, which they will flow directly to the bottom line."

And Kelsey is on the phone, and Kelsey do you have anything to add after I finish go ahead particularly in the southern part of that question.  So on the strategic process, what I would tell you, Julien, preliminary discussion stage up there talking to multiple people who are interested. And I think, specifically, road testing is what are looking to do is sell a majority stake to someone who is strategically aligned with our thinking about the prospects for the business, but maintaining a substantial minority stakes so that we can maintain the business connection with the rest of the company and also have a second bite of the apple in terms of the value utilization. So it's early days. I would tell you it's relatively easy for people to express interest before they have to write-down a number on a piece of paper. But I would say in the early going, there's quite a lot of interest in it, and no problems with the structure we're proposing. So that's what I would tell you about where we are now on the strategic process. With respect to the issues in the Home Solar, what I would tell you is there are operational issues, basic blocking and tackling that sort of come with running a business that has complex logistics and is growing at an annualized triple digit rates. And so you got the sales engine revved up and the installation and of the deployment has to follow and getting that exact balance right, I think, other players in the industry have demonstrated is a constant working progress. I'd say there's an enormous amounts of potential on it, particularly the productivity of our installation crews. Right now, I think, it's double what it was just a couple of months ago. And then there's the paperwork from going from installation to deployments, which is obviously, in terms of getting the right software and just making the process much more efficient. Kelsey, is there anything that you would want to add to that?"

In fact, we ended Q3 almost exactly flat from a headcount perspective. So without adding costs. And Julien, I think, what we've done is really focused, and we're determined to achieve this 90-day from signature to monetization of the Home Solar system. And we've identified with this theme of excess backlog tons of that exceeds the 90-day timeline and then the optimal backlog, which is all the job being executed within the time line.

But I can tell you that NRG's operational and financial performance has been strong and solid within expectations, that our current liquidity is as strong as it has ever been at over $4 billion and that our Reset program has passed through the panning [ph] stage since implementation with every aspect of it well on track, albeit still in the early going.
It is certainly our hope and expectation that the gradual accomplishments of various aspects of the Reset, the cost cutting, the freeing up of committed capital through various measures, the allocation of capital, particularly to the reduction of debt, all provide a continuous impetus to the recovery of our share price. And after that preliminary comment, let's move on to discuss how our business has performed through the third quarter of 2015.
Turning to Slide 3 in the Business Update. I'm pleased to report today that we are narrowing our 2015 full year adjusted EBITDA guidance to $3.25 billion to $3.35 billion, solidly in the middle of the original guidance range. Our financial performance in the ever-important third quarter was just tremendous and demonstrated once again the resilience of having a matched retail/wholesale platform. In a period of subdued wholesale power prices, our retail business, alongside our outstanding commercial operations team, excelled. And indeed, our retail business delivered its best quarterly result since 2010 with $225 million in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter.
Regarding our conventional wholesale business, which, by the way, turned in another strong operational quarter, probably the most noteworthy event during the quarter has been the extensive commentary in the financial community, questioning the medium- to long-term prospects for power plant fleets like ours. My reaction at this point, based on the many commodity price cycles I have lived through in this industry, is that you can't ignore the underlying reliability value of locationally advantaged assets in competitive markets. Our 48,000-megawatt fleet has a key competitive advantage in each of our 3 regional markets.
First, in Texas, our generation portfolio's footprint closely matches and complements our thriving Texas retail business. Second, in the East, our portfolio has been shaped to focus on providing and being compensated for reliable capacity as demonstrated by the enhanced value in earning to NRG as a result for the recent capacity performance auction and the importance of which has been underlined by the recently announcement of Entergy with respect to the closure of the FitzPatrick line.
And third, in the West, our portfolio features a heavily contracted fast-start gas capability tailored to a market moving towards 50% renewables. In all 3 of our retail markets, the steady and stable operations of our generation remains critical not only to the enterprise, but to the grid in general.
Moving on to other signs of a successful execution of our business plan, I'm pleased to announce today that just yesterday, we closed our most recent drop-down to NRG Yield, which delivered $210 million in cash back to NRG, which, as you know, we will be utilizing as part of our efforts to shrink the balance sheet, as we discussed on our last call.
I'm also pleased to report that as we announced on September 22, we successfully executed on the $251 million share repurchase program, which, in combination with all shares we purchased year-to-date, brings the total shares acquired this year to 7% of our outstanding shares. And as we will discuss in more detail in a bit, we are now shifting our immediate capital allocation focus to debt reduction as we indicate would be the case on our NRG Reset call as a way not only to further strengthen our balance sheet, but also to unlock shareholder value.
Lastly, our Home Solar business remains well on track as we outlined 6 weeks ago, driven by top line growth with over 6,300 net bookings in the quarter and we believe one of the highest, if not the highest, growth rate of the major players in this sector. This volume places us in the fight for third with Sunrun and not far off from Vivint in the #2 position.
With respect to our installations for the quarter, which numbered 1,900 or now a total of approximately 80 megawatts, we are making progress in our concerted effort to reduce the backlog going into and through the early months of 2016. For those tracking Home Solar's negative EBITDA contribution projected for full year 2015, it continues to track within the negative $175 million disclosed on the second quarter call.
So let's move on and discuss progress on the NRG Reset and drivers behind our 2016 financial guidance, turning to Slide 4. Let me start with components of the reset, which are fully within our control. We are well into the implementation phase of our company-wide cost reduction program of $150 million across G&A, marketing and development expense.
In addition, and Mauricio will provide more details on this, I'm also pleased to announce today that we have identified and are implementing an additional $100 million in O&M spending reductions across all of our businesses, all of which can be done in a manner that does not sacrifice the reliability of our portfolio.
So when combined with the initial NRG Reset cost reduction plan, our cost reduction efforts now bring, on an annual basis, a total cost savings target of $250 million to be achieved in 2016 and recurring thereafter.
On the asset rebalancing component of the program, we remain focused on and highly confident in our ability to unlock, in combination with the cost reduction program, over $1 billion in capital for allocation to reduce the balance sheet. The modifications of our plants at Portland and Avon Lake Unit 9 are complete, reducing or eliminating additional capital spend at those plants, and we are actively marketing select assets for disposition.
Given the high level of interest in these assets expressed during our preliminary marketing phase for the past few weeks, we are moving forward at a pace and in a manner that we believe will lead to an optimization of value for NRG shareholders. You should expect, in all likelihood, a series of such transaction announcements over the weeks and months to come.
Regarding the GreenCo business, the $125 million GreenCo runway around NRG Home Solar, the C&I business at NRG Renew and eVgo is established and ready to commence on January 1, 2016. As it relates to the process around the securing of a strategic or financial partner in GreenCo, through the initial phase of our efforts, we are quite pleased with the interest we are seeing. We continue to be in a market discovery process and remain focused on selling a majority interest in GreenCo with the goal of financial deconsolidation and simplification at the parent company level.
However, and not unlike our approach to asset dispositions on the conventional side, our approach, with respect to GreenCo, is value first and speed of execution, second. The choice of partner in GreenCo is an important one, and we are focused on both optimizing current value and positioning the business, which NRG will continue to own a significant stake in, for future success. We will provide you with more material updates as the process allows.
So as we look at all the actions we are taking and importantly, bury [ph] this with the ongoing benefit of our integrated platform, we are introducing 2016 financial guidance of $3 billion to $3.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA, and $1 billion to $1.2 billion in free cash flow before growth on a consolidated basis.
As an additional item and something Kirk will provide more detail around, in response to many of the questions we are receiving from investors pertaining to the complexity of our capital structure, for the first time, we are now providing our expectation for free cash flow before growth at the NRG level. What this represents is the free cash flow generation, excluding nonrecourse subsidiaries such as GenOn, NRG Yield and the primary NRG ROFO assets. Our hope is that providing this view, we will eliminate at least part of the concern about the geography of our cash flows.
Now turning to Slide 5. I'd like to touch upon capital allocation. We have repeatedly stated over the past few months that our focus over the coming years on shrinking the balance sheet. So for the avoidance of doubt, let me put our thinking in this regard into some historical context. For many years now, indeed for almost my entire time as CEO of NRG, our focus has been to establish a diversified business platform that reduces our company's exposure to near-term fluctuations in natural gas and power prices, amongst other potentially concentrated risks.
Specifically, our goal always has been to minimize commodity price impact on free cash flow while maintain the upside that occurs when the commodity markets move in a positive direction. Our key tool in this regard, in addition to hedging, has been asset and business diversification. Our diversification commenced in earnest when we entered the retail business 6 years ago through the acquisition of Reliant. Followed with our strong move into contracted generation targeted around renewables, our redevelopment efforts at our locationally advantaged brownfield sites and most recently, our asset management program aimed at maximizing our economic advantaging [ph] capacity markets like PJM.
This quarter's performance, especially with our outstanding retail performance and next year's guidance coming in as they do at a time of historically low natural gas prices, speaks to the effectiveness of our business diversification as a financial buffer. But of course, this diversification becomes a moot point if market concerns around the balance sheet persists. It is our strongly held belief that NRG's equity investors will benefit from an absolute reduction in our debt, most notably at the NRG level, but also across our entire capital structure. As Kirk will outline, that is the focus of our capital allocation program now.
As this Slide 5 describes as a result of our Reset efforts, we aim to free up roughly $1.6 billion in total over the next 14 months to apply to balance sheet shrinking and particularly, to debt reduction. Further, as we look out beyond the next 14 months, our efforts around reducing maintenance CapEx and the material completion of our capital expenditure program will provide further capital allocation flexibility.
Our overriding goal that animates this entire effort has been put to rest the question of whether NRG is carrying an excessive level of debt so that all of us can be on the same plane where we can focus on the cash-generative power of the NRG businesses and how that cash can be put to its best use for the benefits of NRG shareholders.
And with that, I will turn it over to Mauricio."

Our integrated platform continue to perform extremely well during the quarter. Our wholesale business mitigated the impact of lower power prices through active hedging and good commercial execution, while our retail business benefited from lower supply cost, highlighting once again the strength of our wholesale/retail platform.
During the quarter, we continue to take steps on repositioning our portfolio to optimize and improve economics and returns. First, our asset optimization effort in the Northeast, which focuses on capacity revenues, was validated by the recent PJM capacity performance auction [ph] resource. Second, we continue to reduce spend across the fleet, which I will discuss in more detail in a later slide. And finally, we have taken the necessary steps to hedge our portfolio in the short term to protect from further downside. All of these efforts are in addition to the business diversification strategy that David already mentioned in his remarks.
So let's start with a review of our operational performance on Slide 7. We had another quarter of top quartile safety performance with 147 out of 168 facilities that finished the quarter without a single recordable injury. We're mindful that our portfolio is going through some changes, and we need to stay vigilant and redouble our efforts to ensure that safety is and remains always first.
Our total generation was up 5% for the quarter, driven primarily by higher generation in the Gulf and the West. The East was relatively unchanged with the slightly lower coal generation, offset by higher gas lines. [ph] Our coal and nuclear plant improved their availability and reliability metrics. I want to congratulate STP, Parish and Dunford [ph] for almost a perfect growth [ph] this summer. Our gas units continued to be called on more frequently in the market as you can see in the bottom-right chart. We continue to maintain a remarkable 99% starting reliability on our gas [indiscernible].
Turning to Slide 8. Our retail business continue its trend of exceptional performance, delivering $225 million of adjusted EBITDA, the highest third quarter since 2010 and $58 million more than last year. During the quarter, we capture value from lower cost to serve, effective margin management and expansion of our product offering. We have also sustained our strong momentum in customer acquisition and retention that led to 5,000 customer count growth despite the continued expiration of acquired Dominion customers' contracts in the East where we continue to see better-than-expected retention levels. Excluding the Dominion acquisition, our customer growth was 26,000.
As we have stated in the past 6 years, the ongoing success of our retail business continues to demonstrate the value of our integrated wholesale/retail platform and most importantly, provides NRG diversification in earnings through all stages of the commodity cycle.
Turning to Slide 9. Let me share a few comments on the gas market. We have experienced pretty mild weather this past year, a warm winter followed by a mild summer. This weather combination most likely will lead to a new record storage number in the coming weeks at or near 40 CF. Combined with the expectation of an El Niño weather forecast, and you've got a market with only bearish news and falling prices. It's worth noting that El Niño is typically associated with a warmer Upper Midwest winter and a colder Gulf Coast one. As a diversified energy company with asset in both areas, we could do well in such a scenario.
I want to remind everyone that we're very well hedged through 2016 and about 50% in 2017, giving us a nice run way to what we see as a more bullish future. Make no mistake, we're [ph] -- we think plenty of upside in gas prices were to rise, but have protected significantly the downside through hedging and business diversification.
Regardless of current sentiment, in our view, long-term natural gas fundamentals looks strong. The first half of this decade was dominated by supply growth of stripping demand. We expect the second half to revert that trend with demand growth of stripping supply. Natural gas production has been stagnant since late last year in part because of lower rig counts and low prices.
In the meantime, we see growing LNG exports, increasing exports to Mexico, higher industrial production and greater demand from the power sector. As an example, our fuel conversions at New Castle, Joliet and Shawville alone will increase our summer peak day gas consumption by 0.5 bcf [ph] per day. The gas demand from new builds and conversions is real and is coming. Simply put, we're well positioned to weather the short-term low prices and remain open to benefit from bullish long-term fundamentals.
Turning to Slide 10 on our power market update and starting with ERCOT. We have this cost for several years now. Market changes are needed to better reflect scarcity conditions like the ones we experienced this summer. During August, we saw our first real test of the operating reserve demand for mechanism and sadly, we watched it fail.
Scarcity conditions arrived for a few days, during which a new record peak was set. But aside from one $350 day ahead [ph] clear, the week was mostly disappointing. A combination of scarcity conditions and low prices caught both market participants and the PUC's [ph] attention. All this [ph] is suspected to be a major topic of conversation at the open meeting tomorrow. Discussions are now underway to examine potential changes that can be made to the RDC parameters to make it more effective and reflecting truest [ph] case beyond the system.
We're supportive of that effort and we'll actively participate in the discussion. Otherwise, fundamentals remain strong, with load [ph] growing by 2.7% on a weather normalized basis so far this year despite low oil prices. Combined with the risk of additional retirements, current forward prices look too low and present an upside to our low cost and environmentally controlled coal portfolio.
As for the Northeast, we have been repositioning our portfolio from providing baseload energy to providing reliability at the capacity resource. The recent result in PJM and New England, which we just covered in our recent call, validate our commercial strategy.
In the past couple of weeks, we've heard news of additional nuclear retirements. It would seem that smaller nuclear plants are struggling to cover costs and may lead the way to further tightening in the market.
Turning to our hedging disclosure on Slide 11. And as I mentioned earlier today, we're pretty well hedged for the next 2 years. As the cart in the upper left of the slide shows, we're very well hedged against our expected production for 2016 and almost 50% hedged for 2017. We are evaluating further entry points to increase our coal hedges and are comfortable with current inventory levels as we head into the winter months. We like the remaining open position for the back half of 2017 and beyond given our more constructive yield in [ph] gas and power.
Finally, on Slide 12, I want to provide more details on our expanded cost reduction program across the company and more specifically, the $100 million reduction in O&M savings that David mentioned. As you likely have assumed, most of these will be executed on the wholesale business, where we continue our work on evaluating and prioritizing every actionable spend decision on an asset-by-asset basis.
Key drivers of the overall reduction relate to the asset optimization efforts that we announced around Portland and [indiscernible], respectively, changes in the way we're managing operational risk and further cost reductions on the units that have lower capacity factors. Of course, we will not make any O&M reduction that jeopardize the safe and efficient operations of our fleet.
In addition to the $100 million reduction just announced, we're introducing the fourth iteration of NRG's continuous business improvement program called FORNRG. This program is driven by employee ideas and innovation to enhance each department's bottom line. The FOR stands for focus on return, and this is rooted at ensuring that all employees are empowered to find better, more cost-effective ways on doing our jobs. Our goal is to achieve $150 million of cumulative EBITDA over the next 3 years. Just as we have done in the past, we remain committed to our continuous improvement program that has yielded so many benefits for NRG and its shareholders.
With that, I will turn it over to Kirk."
413857,314070684,891989,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2015",2015-11-04,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mauricio. We'll begin with the financial summary on Slide 14. NRG delivered a total of $1.145 billion in adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter and over $2.7 billion for the 9 months ended September 30.Our third quarter's results were highligh",1857,"Thank you, Mauricio. We'll begin with the financial summary on Slide 14. NRG delivered a total of $1.145 billion in adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter and over $2.7 billion for the 9 months ended September 30.
Our third quarter's results were highlighted by $225 million in adjusted EBITDA from Home Retail, a 35% year-over-year increase, again highlighting the success of NRG's integrated business model as results improved largely due to its favorable supply costs. Business and Renew combined were $722 million in EBITDA for the quarter, while NRG Yield contributed $198 million.
Despite the subdued summer power prices, our strong Home Retail performance, combined with effective wholesale hedging, allows us to narrow our adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $3.25 billion to $3.35 billion, still in line with the midpoint of our original 2015 guidance. 
Looking to the business segment components of adjusted EBITDA guidance, the increase in guidance for NRG Yield reflects the full year impact of the closing of the wind portfolio drop-down, as required under GAAP, with an equal reduction in Business and Renew guidance, which previously included the EBITDA associated with the equity stake now held by Yield.
Based on the strong retail performance for the quarter, we are also increasing the retail component of 2015 EBITDA guidance, which offsets the modest reduction in expected 2015 wholesale results. Finally, we are also narrowing guidance for 2015 free cash flow to $1.125 billion to $1.225 billion.
Turning to other highlights and focusing first on our progress on NRG Yield drop-downs. We're pleased to announce we've now closed the previously announced sale of a 75% interest in a portfolio of 12 wind projects to NRG Yield for $210 million in cash. The remaining 25% interest continues to be part of the drop-down pipeline remaining under the expanded right of first offer agreement.
NRG intends to complete the balance of the $100 million in commercial distributed solar projects and $150 million in residential solar leases under our existing partnerships with NRG Yield over the balance of 2015 and into early '16. As we've indicated in previous quarters, NRG also intends to offer its remaining stake in CVSR to NRG Yield in late 2015, which makes up the balance of the $600 million and expected drop-down offers to Yield during 2015, as originally announced on our first quarter earnings call.
Turning to share repurchases, NRG completed the purchase of $251 million of its common stock during September and October of 2015, which, when combined with our previously completed share repurchases and annualized dividend, leads to a total of approximately $630 million in capital returned to NRG common stockholders in 2015 and a 7% reduction in common shares outstanding.
Turning to 2016 guidance on Slide 15. We're initiating 2016 guidance ranges with adjusted EBITDA of $3 billion to $3.2 billion, consisting of business and utility scale renewable adjusted EBITDA of $1.545 billion to $1.67 billion, retail adjusted EBITDA of $650 million to $725 million, which is a $50 million increase over our initial 2015 retail guidance. And finally, NRG Yield adjusted EBITDA of $805 million, which includes the recently closed [ph] drop-downs. Our free cash flow before growth guidance, which is net of maintenance and environmental capital, is expected to be a robust $1 billion to $1.2 billion.
Our 2016 guidance excludes the impact of the GreenCo businesses, as identified during our Reset call on September 18, for which NRG's total cash committed is limited to $125 million, which will be managed through an intercompany revolving credit facility as part of NRG 2016 capital allocation, which I'll review in greater detail shortly.
As David mentioned earlier, to further clarify the cash flow and capital available at the NRG level, we are also initiating guidance for the portion of our total free cash flow before growth guidance, which is available at the NRG level, which, for 2016, we expect to be $750 million to $950 million. This range is based on deducting the portion of our total free cash flow guidance expected to be generated at NRG's nonguarantor subsidiaries, which consist primarily of GenOn, NRG Yield and the remaining ROFO assets. And then finally, adding back the expected cash distributions and dividends from these subsidiaries, it makes up the adjustment to arrive at NRG level free cash flow before growth.
Turning to Slide 16 and continuing the theme of clarifying and enhancing our disclosures. In light of increasing questions and focus from our investors on leverage levels at NRG, I have provided here a deconstructed view of the consolidated balance sheet as well as the derivation of the NRG corporate debt to corporate EBITDA ratio, which is a cornerstone of our targeted prudent balance sheet metrics. As you recall, we target this ratio at 4.25x, which is consistent with our targeted BB credit metrics recently reaffirmed by S&P.
Based on the midpoint of our 2016 guidance and previously committed debt reduction from 2015, we are in line with that target. As shown on the left of this slide, although NRG's consolidated debt balance as of the quarter end is approximately $20 billion. Over $11 billion of that debt resides at our excluded project subsidiaries, which consist primarily of NRG Yield and the remaining ROFO assets, most of the debt at which is fully amortized and consistent with the contract durations, with the remaining nonrecourse debt residing at GenOn. This debt is not a recourse to NRG and is not counted in our corporate credit metrics, including the debt-to-EBITDA ratio prescribed by our credit facilities, which contains thresholds governing our ability to purchase shares and pay dividends.
Only the remaining $8.8 billion of debt, consisting with our senior unsecured notes and term loan facility, is recourse to NRG and counts for this ratio. On the right of the slide, after adjusting for the $500 million in 2015 capital already allocated to NRG level debt reduction, which we expect to augment using 2016 capital, we anticipate corporate debt or the numerator of the ratio to be less than $8.3 billion in 2016.
Turning to corporate EBITDA or the denominator of the targeted ratio, we began with the midpoint of our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance. As only cash distributions from our project subsidiaries count as EBITDA for ratio purposes, we matched [ph] the midpoint 2016 EBITDA from these subsidiaries and then add back these cash distributions, which include our share of dividends from NRG Yield and distributions and payments from the remaining nonrecourse subsidiaries, primarily the remaining ROFO asset. 
The final adjustment this an add-back of noncash components of corporate-level expenses, which we're deducting and arriving at our EBITDA guidance. What results is $1.95 billion of corporate-level EBITDA, which basically represents EBITDA from assets and businesses from our recourse subsidiaries plus the cash distributions and payments from nonrecourse stubs. Based on the midpoint of our 2016 guidance, our expected corporate debt-to-EBITDA is no greater than 4.26x, in line with our long-term target for this ratio and significantly below both our restricted payment and default ratio.
As I mentioned earlier, we expect to augment our 2015 allocation of capital to debt reduction, with additional debt reduction using 2016 capital driving this ratio even lower and providing additional balance sheet strengthening as we move into 2017. We remain committed to shrinking the NRG balance sheet as part of the NSG Reset and leaving no doubt as to the strength and integrity of NRG credit ratios as we move into the 2016 and beyond.
Turning to Slide 17. Having initiated 2016 guidance, I'd like to next review NRG-level capital available for allocation for 2016. We are focused here on capital allocation at the NRG level, which excludes NRG Yield excess cash as well as GenOn excess cash reserve for liquidity and the completion of our asset optimization project at GenOn.
Moving from left to right, we have now allocated all remaining 2015 capital towards debt reduction, which we expect to execute over the balance of 2015 and into 2016, totaling $500 million in discretionary debt reduction at NRG. This balance consists of $200 million, which is 1/3 of the targeted 2015 NRG Yield drop-down proceeds plus $300 million of remaining capital also announced as part of the NRG Reset in September, which we are now committing to debt reduction as well.
Turning to 2016, incremental NRG level capital for allocation begins with the midpoint of our NRG level free cash flow guidance of $850 million. Total 2016 committed capital NRG is approximately $600 million as shown in the red bar and is comprised of the $125 million GreenCo runway revolver, gross investments of $250 million, primarily our PH Robinson Pico [ph] Project, Carbon 360 and the eVgo California settlement, with the balance allocated to NRG-level corporate debt amortization and our common stock dividend.
The remaining free cash flow balance of $250 million, combined with $500 million of 2015 capital, remain to be deployed towards its debt reduction, leads to $750 million in capital available at the NRG level through 2016, which we expect to further supplement through the execution of the remainder of the NRG Reset initiatives.
These initiatives include nonrecourse project financing through which we expect to fund approximately $250 million of environmental CapEx at Midwest Generation, thereby increasing capital available to NRG. Having now completed the rating process and documentation for this financing, we are prepared to launch when market conditions are more favorable.
Targeted asset sale proceeds from the NRG Reset, totaling at least $500 million, are expected to further augment excess capital for consolidated balance sheet reduction.
Finally, and potentially supplemental to the $1.1 billion in Reset capital, any proceeds from the GreenCo sell-down and future NRG Yield drop-downs located currently by equity market recovery, which serve to further expand NRG-level capital for allocation.
By way of reference, in the upper right corner of the page, I've provided a walk, beginning with the remaining 2016 excess NRG-level free cash flow through the other components of the NRG Reset, which combined now total $1.1 billion in consolidated 2016 capital to be deployed toward shrinking the balance sheet. 
Finally, turning to Slide 18, I'd like to briefly review and update our expectations for significant reductions in maintenance, environmental and growth capital from 2016 to 2017. Our revised 2016 capital expenditures reflect reductions in growth CapEx, spending primarily from the $100 million and reduced spend on fuel conversions at GenOn as well as GreenCo-related growth CapEx, which is now capped at $125 million based on the runway amount.
Turning to 2017, due to incremental reductions in expected 2017 growth capital expenditures, including the elimination of distributed generation solar and residential solar, we now expect a year-over-year reduction of over $550 million in consolidated CapEx in 2017 versus 2016 and approximately $350 million of this reduction occurring under at the NRG level.
These substantial year-over-year reductions in expected capital expenditures provide a significant cushion [ph] against continued softness in commodity prices and a potential uplift in available capital in 2017, which may be allocated to further balance sheet reductions, including debt reduction and return of shareholder capital.
With that, I'll turn it back to David."

And if we turn to our closing slide, which is Slide 20, we end by quantifying a point previously made, which is that NRG's financial results in 2016 are not nearly as exposed to fluctuating gas prices as the market seems to be suggesting. We have successfully mitigated the downward exposure of falling natural gas prices through our hedging program and through our asset diversification. 
In the ultra-low commodity price environment that currently grips our market, this strategy is what has enabled us today to guide to a healthy adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow level for 2016, in which, together with a substantially increased capital flexibility arising out of the steps listed on the right side of this page, should enable us to implement a substantial capital allocation program over the months ahead. 
Our goal in all of this is to make NRG a simpler, less leveraged company over the duration of the Reset program. NRG is not just an IPP. As we have demonstrated on this call, NRG's unique advantage is that our balanced wholesale retail business mitigates the financial impact of low energy commodity prices, which enables us to positively serve our retail customers with a growing mix of products and services. This is essential during the current low commodity price cycle when the value pendulum in the sector clearly has swung to serving the end-use energy customer. As I said, this wholesale retail balance is NRG's unique advantage, and all of us at NRG are excited about the opportunities we have in front of us to maximize the value of this advantage for the benefit of NRG shareholders. 
And with that, Liz, we are happy to take people's questions."

As you know, in particular, $500 million of that is what is part of the NRG Reset and asset sales. And depending on the mix of those asset sales, some of which we expect to be at the GenOn low because we're focused on the Northeast, that, more than anything else, would govern the proportion of the allocation of capital towards debt reduction at GenOn versus NRG. As to the targeted metric, we continue to target, as I've said, 4.25x corporate debt to corporate EBITDA. We also focused on FFO to debt, keeping that number below the -- at or below the high-teens level. And I'd say the tertiary component of that is we look to stay around 50% debt to capital, though that is a book ratio, certainly something that we focused on, the  rating agency is focused on. But I think it's probably certainly tertiary than those first 2. And so -- and part of the reason why we focused on that 4.25 is, as I've said, it comports with what, based on our ongoing conversations, the rating agencies support those DD credit metrics. It also gives us a significant cushion against the thresholds in our credit facility, above which we are no longer committed to pay dividends or buy back stock. So we've got a significant cushion there, and obviously, even further cushion below the default ratio. So those are the reasons that go into those target metrics."

As we move into 2016 or -- and what we're seeing in terms of the growth capital on a consolidated basis is primarily the completion of the GenOn repowerings as well as the -- and beyond 2017, the beginning of the capital allocated to our Carlsbad and Mandalay projects. And the balance of that capital in 2016 and a little bit further into 2017 is just, a, the remainder of the Carbon 360 project, which is about $150 million of capital left to go in about equal parts between 2016 and 2017 and the eVgo California settlement, which in both 2016 and 2017 is at or about $20 million in each year. That is really the bulk -- that is all of the remaining growth capital that we have or expect to allocate at this point. As to the allocation of capital towards the balance sheet, your comment about share repurchase, what I would say is we're -- as I'd mentioned, we're continuing to focus on finding opportunities and return capital to shareholders. Certainly, our dividend is something we're committed to do, and certainly, we look to supplement that with share repurchases. But at the present time, we are going to focus and swinging the pendulum towards the debt side of the balance sheet, in particular, leave no doubt and to ensure not only that ratio is improved in '16, but we are confident in our ability to maintain that ratio through '17. I think that, more than anything else, will determine our focus in the near term on debt reduction. And ultimately, arriving at that ratio through that debt reduction will govern the proportion of our capital allocation, which would later go to share repurchases."

And we have rightsized the cost structure to comport with those market dynamics. And then the third one is as we have a portfolio of close to 50,000 megawatts allows us to optimize the management of forced outage risk and what I call the contingency money that we know we're going to have spend, we just don't know where. So if you have a single asset, you have to budget for the forced outage -- probably the forced outage. But when you have 50,000 megawatts, then you can optimize across the entire portfolio. So that is the step 1. Step 2 is the FORNRG portfolio, and this is a target. You're familiar with the FORNRG because this is fourth declaration of this. We are looking at, company-wide, how can we do the things that we're doing today better in a more cost-effective way?

And Kelcy do you have anything to add after I finish, go ahead, particularly obviously on the second part of that question. So on the strategic process, what we'd tell you, Julien, is we've been through this sort of preliminary discussions stage out there, talking to multiple people who are interested. And I think, specifically, road testing the idea that what we're looking to do is sell a majority stake to someone who's sort of strategically aligned with our thinking about the prospects for the business but maintaining a substantial minority stakes, so that we can maintain the business connection with the rest of the company and also have a second bite of the apple in terms of value realization. And it's early days. What I would tell, I mean, it's relatively easy for people to express interest before they have to write down a number on a piece of paper. But I would say in the early going, there's a quite a lot of interest in it and no problems with the structure we're proposing. So that's what I would tell you about where we are now on the strategic process. With respect to the issues in the Home Solar, what I would tell you is there are operational issues, basic blocking and tackling that sort of come with running a business that has complex logistics and is growing at an annualized triple-digit rates. And so you got this sales engine revved up, and then the installation and the deployments have to follow. And getting that exact balance right, as I think other players in the industry have demonstrated, is a constant work in progress. But I'd say there's an enormous amount of detention on it, particularly the productivity of our installation crews. Right now, I think it's double what it was just a couple of months ago. And then there's the paperwork from going from installation to deployment, which is obviously in terms of getting the right software and just making the process much more efficient.

And Julien, I think what we've done is we've really focused, and we're determined to achieve this 90-day from signature to energization of a solar system. And we've identified with this theme of an excess backlog, which is any job that exceeds that 90-day time line, and then the optimal backlog, which is all the jobs being executed within that time line. And we believe we're poised to be executing all of our backlog and all of our bookings to energization in the first half of 2016 within 90 days. And so that's what I would tell you."

So with just over 6 weeks passed since we hosted the NRG Reset call, we are going to do our best to be brief so that we can provide you with ample time to ask the questions that you have. However, with the unabated selloff in our stock and across the entire sector during the quarter, I want to begin by acknowledging how difficult a time it has been for you, our shareholders.
And truth, in this market environment, I don't know that I can predict what exactly what will cause the stock to turn around and recover to some level that approximates fair value. But I can tell you that NRG's operational and financial performance has been strong and solidly within expectations, that our current liquidity is as strong as it has ever been at over $4 billion and that our Reset program has passed through the panning [ph] stage since implementation with every aspect of it well on track, albeit still in the early going.
It is certainly our hope and expectation that the gradual accomplishments of various aspects of the Reset, the cost cutting, the freeing up of committed capital through various measures, the allocation of capital, particularly to the reduction of debt, all provide a continuous impetus to the recovery of our share price. And after that preliminary comment, let's move on to discuss how our business has performed through the third quarter of 2015.
Turning to Slide 3 in the Business Update. I'm pleased to report today that we are narrowing our 2015 full year adjusted EBITDA guidance to $3.25 billion to $3.35 billion, solidly in the middle of the original guidance range. Our financial performance in the ever-important third quarter was just tremendous and demonstrated once again the resilience of having a matched retail/wholesale platform. In a period of subdued wholesale power prices, our retail business, alongside our outstanding commercial operations team, excelled. And indeed, our retail business delivered its best quarterly result since 2010 with $225 million in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter.
Regarding our conventional wholesale business, which, by the way, turned in another strong operational quarter, probably the most noteworthy event during the quarter has been the extensive commentary in the financial community, questioning the medium- to long-term prospects for power plant fleets like ours. My reaction at this point, based on the many commodity price cycles I have lived through in this industry, is that you can't ignore the underlying reliability value of locationally advantaged assets in competitive markets. Our 48,000-megawatt fleet has a key competitive advantage in each of our 3 regional markets.
First, in Texas, our generation portfolio's footprint closely matches and complements our thriving Texas retail business. Second, in the East, our portfolio has been shaped to focus on providing and being compensated for reliable capacity as demonstrated by the enhanced value in earning to NRG as a result of the recent capacity performance auction and the importance of which has been underlined by the recently announcement of Entergy with respect to the closure of the FitzPatrick line.
And third, in the West, our portfolio features a heavily contracted fast-start gas capability tailored to a market moving towards 50% renewables. In all 3 of our regional markets, the steady and stable operations of our generation remains critical not only to the enterprise, but to the grid in general.
Moving on to other signs of a successful execution of our business plan, I'm pleased to announce today that just yesterday, we closed our most recent drop-down to NRG Yield, which delivered $210 million in cash back to NRG, which, as you know, we will be utilizing as part of our efforts to shrink the balance sheet, as we discussed on our last call.
I'm also pleased to report that as we announced on September 22, we successfully executed on the $251 million share repurchase program, which, in combination with all shares we purchased year-to-date, brings the total shares acquired this year to 7% of our outstanding shares. And as we will discuss in more detail in a bit, we are now shifting our immediate capital allocation focus to debt reduction as we indicated would be the case on our NRG Reset call as a way not only to further strengthen our balance sheet, but also to unlock shareholder value.
Lastly, our Home Solar business remains well on track as we outlined 6 weeks ago, driven by tremendous top line growth with over 6,300 net bookings in the quarter and we believe one of the highest, if not the highest, growth rate of the major players in this sector. This volume places us in the fight for third with Sunrun and not that far off from Vivint in the #2 position.
With respect to our installations for the quarter, which numbered 1,900 or now a total of approximately 80 megawatts, we are making progress in our concerted effort to reduce the backlog going into and through the early months of 2016. For those tracking Home Solar's negative EBITDA contribution projected for full year 2015, it continues to track within the negative $175 million disclosed on the second quarter call.
So let's move on to discuss progress on the NRG Reset and drivers behind our 2016 financial guidance, turning to Slide 4. Let me start with components of the reset, which are fully within our control. We are well into the implementation phase of our company-wide cost reduction program of $150 million across G&A, marketing and development expense.
In addition, and Mauricio will provide more details on this, I'm also pleased to announce today that we have identified and are implementing an additional $100 million in O&M spending reductions across all of our businesses, all of which can be done in a manner that does not sacrifice the reliability of our portfolio.
So when combined with the initial NRG Reset cost reduction plan, our cost reduction efforts now bring, on an annual basis, a total cost savings target of $250 million to be achieved in 2016 and recurring thereafter.
On the asset rebalancing component of the program, we remain focused on and highly confident in our ability to unlock, in combination with the cost reduction program, over $1 billion in capital for allocation to reduce the balance sheet. The modifications of our plants at Portland and Avon Lake Unit 9 are complete, reducing or eliminating additional capital spend at those plants, and we are actively marketing select assets for disposition.
Given the high level of interest in these assets expressed during our preliminary marketing phase for the past few weeks, we are moving forward at a pace and in a manner that we believe will lead to an optimization of value for NRG shareholders. You should expect, in all likelihood, a series of such transaction announcements over the weeks and months to come.
Regarding the GreenCo business, the $125 million GreenCo runway around NRG Home Solar, the C&I business at NRG Renew and eVgo is established and ready to commence on January 1, 2016. As it relates to the process around the securing of a strategic or financial partner in GreenCo, through the initial phase of our efforts, we are quite pleased with the interest we are seeing. We continue to be in the market discovery process and remain focused on selling a majority interest in GreenCo with the goal of financial deconsolidation and simplification at the parent company level.
However, and not unlike our approach to asset dispositions on the conventional side, our approach, with respect to GreenCo, is value first and speed of execution, second. The choice of partner in GreenCo is an important one, and we are focused on both optimizing current value and positioning the business, which NRG will continue to own a significant stake in, for future success. We will provide you with more material updates as the process allows.
So as we look at all the actions we are taking and importantly, vary this with the ongoing benefit of our integrated platform, we are introducing 2016 financial guidance of $3 billion to $3.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA, and $1 billion to $1.2 billion in free cash flow before growth on a consolidated basis.
As an additional item and something Kirk will provide more detail around, in response to many of the questions we are receiving from investors pertaining to the complexity of our capital structure, for the first time, we are now providing our expectation for free cash flow before growth at the NRG level. What this represents is the free cash flow generation, excluding nonrecourse subsidiaries such as GenOn, NRG Yield and the primary NRG ROFO assets. Our hope is that providing this view, we will eliminate at least part of the concern about the geography of our cash flows.
Now turning to Slide 5. I'd like to touch upon capital allocation. We have repeatedly stated over the past few months that our focus over the coming year is on shrinking the balance sheet. So for the avoidance of doubt, let me put our thinking in this regard into some historical context. For many years now, indeed for almost my entire time as CEO of NRG, our focus has been to establish a diversified business platform that reduces our company's exposure to near-term fluctuations in natural gas and power prices, amongst other potentially concentrated risks.
Specifically, our goal always has been to minimize commodity price impact on free cash flow while maintain the upside that occurs when the commodity markets move in a positive direction. Our key tool in this regard, in addition to hedging, has been asset and business diversification. Our diversification commenced in earnest when we entered the retail business 6 years ago through the acquisition of Reliant. Followed with our strong move into contracted generation targeted around renewables, our redevelopment efforts at our locationally advantaged brownfield sites and most recently, our asset management program aimed at maximizing our economic advantage in capacity markets like PJM.
This quarter's performance, especially with our outstanding retail performance and next year's guidance coming in as they do at a time of historically low natural gas prices, speaks to the effectiveness of our business diversification as a financial buffer. But of course, this diversification becomes a moot point if market concerns around the balance sheet persists. It is our strongly held belief that NRG's equity investors will benefit from an absolute reduction in our debt, most notably at the NRG level, but also across our entire capital structure. As Kirk will outline, that is the focus of our capital allocation program now.
As this Slide 5 describes as a result of our Reset efforts, we aim to free up roughly $1.6 billion in total over the next 14 months to apply to balance sheet shrinking and particularly, to debt reduction. Further, as we look out beyond the next 14 months, our efforts around reducing maintenance CapEx and the material completion of our capital expenditure program will provide further capital allocation flexibility.
Our overriding goal that animates this entire effort has been put to rest the question of whether NRG is carrying an excessive level of debt so that all of us can be on the same plane where we can focus on the cash-generative power of the NRG businesses and how that cash can be put to its best use for the benefits of NRG shareholders.
And with that, I will turn it over to Mauricio."

Our integrated platform continued to perform extremely well during the quarter. Our wholesale business mitigated the impact of lower power prices through active hedging and good commercial execution, while our retail business benefited from lower supply cost, highlighting once again the strength of our wholesale/retail platform.
During the quarter, we continue to take steps on repositioning our portfolio to optimize and improve economics and returns. First, our asset optimization effort in the Northeast, which focuses on capacity revenues, was validated by the recent PJM capacity performance auction [ph] [indiscernible] . Second, we continue to reduce spend across the fleet, which I will discuss in more detail in a later slide. And finally, we have taken the necessary steps to hedge our portfolio in the short term to protect from further downside. All of these efforts are in addition to the business diversification strategy that David already mentioned in his remarks.
So let's start with a review of our operational performance on Slide 7. We had another quarter of top quartile safety performance with 147 out of 168 facilities that finished the quarter without a single recordable injury. We're mindful that our portfolio is going through some changes, and we need to stay vigilant and redouble our efforts to ensure that safety is and remains always first.
Our total generation was up 5% for the quarter, driven primarily by higher generation in the Gulf and the West. The East was relatively unchanged with a slightly lower coal generation, offset by higher gas lines. [ph] Our coal and nuclear plant improved their availability and reliability metrics. I want to congratulate STP, Parish and Dunford [ph] for almost a perfect runs this summer. Our gas units continued to be called on more frequently in the market as you can see in the bottom-right chart. We continued to maintain a remarkable 99% starting reliability on our gas [indiscernible].
Turning to Slide 8. Our retail business continued its trend of exceptional performance, delivering $225 million of adjusted EBITDA, the highest third quarter since 2010 and $58 million more than last year. During the quarter, we captured value from lower cost to serve, effective margin management and expansion of our product offering. We have also sustained our strong momentum in customer acquisition and retention that led to 5,000 customer count growth despite the continued expiration of acquired Dominion customers' contracts in the East, where we continue to see better-than-expected retention levels. Excluding the Dominion acquisition, our customer growth was 26,000.
As we have stated in the past 6 years, the ongoing success of our retail business continues to demonstrate the value of our integrated wholesale/retail platform and most importantly, provides NRG diversification in earnings through all stages of the commodity cycle.
Turning to Slide 9. Let me share a few comments on the gas market. We have experienced pretty mild weather this past year, a warm winter followed by a mild summer. This weather combination most likely will lead to a new record storage number in the coming weeks at or near 40 CF. Combined with the expectation of an El Niño weather forecast, and you've got a market with only bearish news and falling prices. It's worth noting that El Niño is typically associated with a warmer Upper Midwest winter and a colder Gulf Coast one. As a diversified energy company with assets in both areas, we could do well in such a scenario.
I want to remind everyone that we're very well hedged through 2016 and about 50% in 2017, giving us a nice run way to what we see as a more bullish future. Make no mistake, we will take plenty of upside if gas prices were to rise, but have protected significantly the downside through hedging and business diversification.
Regardless of current sentiment, in our view, long-term natural gas price fundamentals looks strong. The first half of this decade was dominated by supply growth outstripping demand. We expect the second half to revert that trend with demand growth outstripping supply. Natural gas production has been stagnant since late last year in part because of lower rig counts and low prices.
In the meantime, we see growing LNG exports, increasing exports to Mexico, higher industrial production and greater demand from the power sector. As an example, our fuel conversions at New Castle, Joliet and Shawville alone will increase our summer peak day gas consumption by 0.5 bcf [ph] per day. The gas demand from new builds and conversions is real and is coming. Simply put, we're well positioned to weather the short-term low prices and remain open to benefit from bullish long-term fundamentals.
Turning to Slide 10 on our power market update and starting with ERCOT. As we've had this cost for several years now. Market changes are needed to better reflect scarcity conditions like the ones we experienced this summer. During August, we saw our first real test of the operating reserve demand for mechanism and sadly, we watched it fail.
Scarcity conditions arrived for a few days, during which a new record peak was set. But aside from one $350 day ahead [ph] clear, the week was mostly disappointing. A combination of scarcity conditions and low prices caught both market participants and the PUC's [ph] attention. All this [indiscernible]  is expected to be a major topic of conversation at the open meeting tomorrow. Discussions are now underway to examine potential changes that can be made to the RDC parameters to make it more effective and reflecting truest [ph] case beyond the system.
We're supportive of that effort and we'll actively participate in the discussion. Otherwise, fundamentals remain strong, with loads [ph] growing by 2.7% on a weather normalized basis so far this year despite low oil prices. Combined with the risk of additional retirements, current forward prices look too low and present an upside to our low cost and environmentally controlled coal portfolio.
As for the Northeast, we have been repositioning our portfolio from providing baseload energy to providing reliability at the capacity resource. The recent result in PJM and New England, which we just covered in our recent call, validates our commercial strategy.
In the past couple of weeks, we've heard news of additional nuclear retirements. It would seem that smaller nuclear plants are struggling to cover costs and may lead the way to further tightening in the market.
Turning to our hedging disclosure on Slide 11. And as I mentioned earlier today, we're pretty well hedged for the next 2 years. As the chart in the upper left of the slide shows, we're very well hedged against our expected production for 2016 and almost 50% hedged for 2017. We are evaluating further entry points to increase our coal hedges and are comfortable with current inventory levels as we head into the winter months. We like the remaining open position for the back half of 2017 and beyond given our more constructive view of gas and power.
Finally, on Slide 12, I want to provide more details on our expanded cost reduction program across the company and more specifically, the $100 million reduction in O&M savings that David mentioned. As you likely have assumed, most of these will be executed on the wholesale business, where we continue our work on evaluating and prioritizing every actionable spend decision on an asset-by-asset basis.
Key drivers of the overall reduction relate to the asset optimization efforts that we announced around Portland and [indiscernible], respectively, changes in the way we're managing operational risk and further cost reductions on the units that have lower capacity factors. Of course, we will not make any O&M reduction that jeopardize the safe and efficient operations of our fleet.
In addition to the $100 million reduction just announced, we're introducing the fourth iteration of NRG's continuous business improvement program called FORNRG. This program is driven by employee ideas and innovation to enhance each department's bottom line. The FOR stands for focus on return, and is rooted in ensuring all employees are empowered to find better, more cost-effective ways on doing our jobs. Our goal is to achieve $150 million of cumulative EBITDA over the next 3 years. Just as we have done in the past, we remain committed to our continuous improvement program that has yielded so many benefits for NRG and its shareholders.
With that, I will turn it over to Kirk."
413857,314070684,892199,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2015",2015-11-04,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mauricio. We'll begin with the financial summary on Slide 14. NRG delivered a total of $1.145 billion in adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter and over $2.7 billion for the 9 months ended September 30.Our third quarter's results were highligh",1855,"Thank you, Mauricio. We'll begin with the financial summary on Slide 14. NRG delivered a total of $1.145 billion in adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter and over $2.7 billion for the 9 months ended September 30.
Our third quarter's results were highlighted by $225 million in adjusted EBITDA from Home Retail, a 35% year-over-year increase, again highlighting the success of NRG's integrated business model as results improved largely due to favorable supply costs. Business and Renew combined were $722 million in EBITDA for the quarter, while NRG Yield contributed $198 million.
Despite the subdued summer power prices, our strong Home Retail performance, combined with effective wholesale hedging, allows us to narrow our adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $3.25 billion to $3.35 billion, still in line with the midpoint of our original 2015 guidance. 
Looking to the business segment components of adjusted EBITDA guidance, the increase in guidance for NRG Yield reflects the full year impact of the closing of the wind portfolio drop-down, as required under GAAP, with an equal reduction in Business and Renew guidance, which previously included the EBITDA associated with the equity stake now held by Yield.
Based on the strong retail performance for the quarter, we are also increasing the Retail component of 2015 EBITDA guidance, which offsets the modest reduction in expected 2015 wholesale results. Finally, we are also narrowing guidance for 2015 free cash flow to $1.125 billion to $1.225 billion.
Turning to other highlights and focusing first on our progress on NRG Yield drop-downs. We're pleased to announce we've now closed the previously announced sale of a 75% interest in a portfolio of 12 wind projects to NRG Yield for $210 million in cash. The remaining 25% interest continues to be part of the drop-down pipeline remaining under the expanded right of first offer agreement.
NRG intends to complete the balance of the $100 million in commercial distributed solar projects and $150 million in residential solar leases under our existing partnerships with NRG Yield over the balance of 2015 and into early '16. As we've indicated in previous quarters, NRG also intends to offer its remaining stake in CVSR to NRG Yield in late 2015, which makes up the balance of the $600 million in expected drop-down offers to Yield during 2015, as originally announced on our first quarter earnings call.
Turning to share repurchases, NRG completed the purchase of $251 million of its common stock during September and October of 2015, which, when combined with our previously completed share repurchases and annualized dividend, leads to a total over approximately $630 million in capital returned to NRG common stockholders in 2015 and a 7% reduction in common shares outstanding.
Turning to 2016 guidance on Slide 15. We're initiating 2016 guidance ranges with adjusted EBITDA of $3 billion to $3.2 billion, consisting of business and utility scale renewable adjusted EBITDA of $1.545 billion to $1.67 billion, retail adjusted EBITDA of $650 million to $725 million, which is a $50 million increase over our initial 2015 retail guidance. And finally, NRG Yield adjusted EBITDA of $805 million, which includes the recently closed [indiscernible]  drop-downs. Our free cash flow before growth guidance, which is net of maintenance and environmental capital, is expected to be a robust $1 billion to $1.2 billion.
Our 2016 guidance excludes the impact of the GreenCo businesses, as identified during our Reset call on September 18, for which NRG's total cash committed is limited to $125 million, which will be managed through an intercompany revolving credit facility as part of NRG 2016 capital allocation, which I'll review in greater detail shortly.
As David mentioned earlier, to further clarify the cash flow and capital available at the NRG level, we are also initiating guidance for the portion of our total free cash flow before growth guidance, which is available at the NRG level, which, for 2016, we expect to be $750 million to $950 million. This range is based on deducting the portion of our total free cash flow guidance expected to be generated at NRG's nonguarantor subsidiaries, which consists primarily of GenOn, NRG Yield and the remaining ROFO assets. And then finally, adding back the expected cash distributions and dividends from these subsidiaries, makes up the adjustment to arrive at NRG level free cash flow before growth.
Turning to Slide 16 and continuing the theme of clarifying and enhancing our disclosures. In light of increasing questions and focus from our investors on leverage levels at NRG, I have provided here a deconstructed view of the consolidated balance sheet as well as the derivation of the NRG corporate debt to corporate EBITDA ratio, which is a cornerstone of our targeted prudent balance sheet metrics. As you recall, we target this ratio at 4.25x, which is consistent with our targeted BB credit metrics recently reaffirmed by S&P.
Based on the midpoint of our 2016 guidance and previously committed debt reduction from 2015, we are in line with that target. As shown on the left of this slide, although NRG's consolidated debt balance as of the quarter end is approximately $20 billion. Over $11 billion of that debt resides at our excluded project subsidiaries, which consist primarily of NRG Yield and the remaining ROFO asset, most of the debt at which is fully amortized and consistent with the contract durations, with the remaining nonrecourse debt residing at GenOn. This debt is not a recourse to NRG and is not counted in our corporate credit metrics, including the debt-to-EBITDA ratio prescribed by our credit facilities, which contains thresholds governing our ability to purchase shares and pay dividends.
Only the remaining $8.8 billion of debt, consisting of our senior unsecured notes and term loan facility, is recourse to NRG and counts toward this ratio. On the right of the slide, after adjusting for the $500 million in 2015 capital already allocated to NRG level debt reduction, which we expect to augment using 2016 capital, we anticipate corporate debt or the numerator of the ratio to be less than $8.3 billion in 2016.
Turning to corporate EBITDA or the denominator of the targeted ratio, we began with the midpoint of our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance. As only cash distributions from our excluded project subsidiaries count as EBITDA for ratio purposes, we next deduct the midpoint 2016 EBITDA from these subsidiaries and then add back these cash distributions, which include our share of dividends from NRG Yield and distributions and payments from the remaining nonrecourse subsidiaries, primarily the remaining ROFO asset. 
The final adjustment is an add-back of noncash components of corporate-level expenses, which we're deducting and arriving at our EBITDA guidance. What results is $1.95 billion of corporate-level EBITDA, which basically represents EBITDA from assets and businesses from our recourse subsidiaries plus the cash distributions and payments from nonrecourse stubs. Based on the midpoint of our 2016 guidance, and our expected corporate debt-to-EBITDA is no greater than 4.26x, in line with our long-term target for this ratio and significantly below both our restricted payment and default ratio.
As I mentioned earlier, we expect to augment our 2015 allocation of capital to debt reduction, with additional debt reduction using 2016 capital driving this ratio even lower and providing additional balance sheet strengthening as we move into 2017. We remain committed to shrinking the NRG balance sheet as part of the NRG Reset and leaving no doubt as to the strength and integrity of NRG credit ratios as we move into the 2016 and beyond.
Turning to Slide 17. Having initiated 2016 guidance, I'd like to next review NRG-level capital available for allocation for 2016. We are focused here on capital allocation at the NRG level, which excludes NRG Yield excess cash as well as GenOn excess cash reserve for liquidity and the completion of our asset optimization project at GenOn.
Moving from left to right, we have now allocated all remaining 2015 capital towards debt reduction, which we expect to execute over the balance of 2015 and into 2016, totaling $500 million in discretionary debt reduction at NRG. This balance consists of $200 million, which is 1/3 of the targeted 2015 NRG Yield drop-down proceeds plus $300 million of remaining capital also announced as part of the NRG Reset in September, which we are now committing to debt reduction as well.
Turning to 2016, incremental NRG level capital for allocation begins with the midpoint of our NRG level free cash flow guidance of $850 million. Total 2016 committed capital NRG is approximately $600 million as shown in the red bar and is comprised of the $125 million GreenCo runway revolver, gross investments of $250 million, primarily our PH Robinson Pico [ph] Project, Carbon 360 and the eVgo California settlement, with the balance allocated to NRG-level corporate debt amortization and our common stock dividend.
The remaining free cash flow balance of $250 million, combined with $500 million of 2015 capital, remaining to be deployed towards debt reduction, leads to $750 million in capital available at the NRG level through 2016, which we expect to further supplement through the execution of the remainder of the NRG Reset initiatives.
These initiatives include nonrecourse project financing through which we expect to fund approximately $250 million of environmental CapEx at Midwest Generation, thereby increasing capital available to NRG. Having now completed the rating process and documentation for this financing, we were prepared to launch when market conditions are more favorable.
Targeted asset sale proceeds from the NRG Reset, totaling at least $500 million, are expected to further augment excess capital for consolidated balance sheet reduction.
Finally, and potentially supplemental to the $1.1 billion in Reset capital, any proceeds from the GreenCo sell-down and future NRG Yield drop-downs located currently by equity market recovery, which serve to further expand NRG-level capital for allocation.
By way of reference, in the upper right corner of the page, I've provided a walk, beginning with the remaining 2016 excess NRG-level free cash flow, through the other components of the NRG Reset, which combined now total $1.1 billion in consolidated 2016 capital to be deployed toward shrinking the balance sheet. 
Finally, turning to Slide 18, I'd like to briefly review and update our expectations for significant reductions in maintenance, environmental and growth capital from 2016 to 2017. Our revised 2016 capital expenditures reflect reductions in growth CapEx, stemming primarily from the $100 million and reduced spend on fuel conversions at GenOn as well as GreenCo-related growth CapEx, which is now capped at $125 million based on the runway amount.
Turning to 2017, due to incremental reductions in expected 2017 growth capital expenditures, including the elimination of distributed generation solar and residential solar, we now expect a year-over-year reduction of over $550 million in consolidated CapEx in 2017 versus 2016 with approximately $350 million of this reduction occurring at the NRG level.
These substantial year-over-year reductions in expected capital expenditures provide a significant cushion [ph] against continued softness in commodity prices and a potential uplift in available capital in 2017, which may be allocated to further balance sheet reductions, including debt reduction and return of shareholder capital.
With that, I'll turn it back to David."

And if we turn to our closing slide, which is Slide 20, we end by quantifying a point previously made, which is that NRG's financial results in 2016 are not nearly as exposed to fluctuating gas prices as the market seems to be suggesting. We have successfully mitigated the downward exposure of falling natural gas prices through our hedging program and through our asset diversification. 
In the ultra-low commodity price environment that currently grips our market, this strategy is what has enabled us today to guide to a healthy adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow level for 2016, in which, together with a substantially increased capital flexibility arising out of the steps listed on the right side of this page, should enable us to implement a substantial capital allocation program over the months ahead. 
Our goal in all of this is to make NRG a simpler, less leveraged company over the duration of the Reset program. NRG is not just an IPP. As we have demonstrated on this call, NRG's unique advantage is that our balanced wholesale retail business mitigates the financial impact of low energy commodity prices, which enables us to profitably serve our retail customers with a growing mix of products and services. This is essential during the current low commodity price cycle when the value pendulum in the sector clearly has swung to serving the end-use energy customer. As I said, this wholesale retail balance is NRG's unique advantage, and all of us at NRG are excited about the opportunities we have in front of us to maximize the value of this advantage for the benefit of NRG shareholders. 
And with that, Liz, we are happy to take people's questions."

As to the targeted metric, we continue to target, as I've said, 4.25x corporate debt to corporate EBITDA. We also focused on FFO to debt, keeping that number below the -- at or below the high-teens level. And I'd say the tertiary component of that is we look to stay around 50% debt to capital, though that is a book ratio, certainly something that we focused on, the  rating agency is focused on. But I think it's probably certainly tertiary to those first 2. And so -- and part of the reason why we focused on that 4.25 is, as I've said, it comports with what, based on our ongoing conversations, the rating agencies support those DD credit metrics. It also gives us a significant cushion against the thresholds in our credit facility, above which we are no longer permitted to pay dividends or buy back stock. So we've got a significant cushion there, and obviously, even further cushion below the default ratio. So those are the reasons that go into those target metrics."

As to the allocation of capital towards the balance sheet, your comment about share repurchase, what I would say is we're -- as I'd mentioned, we're continuing to focus on finding opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Certainly, our dividend is something we're committed to do, and certainly, we look to supplement that with share repurchases. But at the present time, we are going to focus in swinging the pendulum towards the debt side of the balance sheet, in particular, leave no doubt and to ensure not only that ratio is improved in '16, but we are confident in our ability to maintain that ratio through '17. I think that, more than anything else, will determine our focus in the near term on debt reduction.

But I will say the first gives you the impact of the decisions, the asset optimization decisions that we made at Portland -- the suspension of Portland, the retirement of Huntley. The second one is we've gone through a line-by-line review of every single asset, particularly those that are in more challenging market conditions. And we have rightsized the cost structure to comport with those market dynamics. And then the third one is as we have a portfolio of close to 50,000 megawatts allows us to optimize the management of forced outage risk and what I call the contingency money that we know we're going to have to spend, we just don't know where. So if you have a single asset, you have to budget for the forced outage -- probably the forced outage. But when you have 50,000 megawatts, then you can optimize across the entire portfolio. So that is the step 1. Step 2 is the FORNRG portfolio, and this is a target. You're familiar with the FORNRG because this is fourth iteration of this. We are looking at, company-wide, how can we do the things that we're doing today better in a more cost-effective way? So think of these as whole contract renegotiations, railway negotiations, property tax renegotiations. So I mean, it is a host of things that we can do that is very difficult to pinpoint today, but we've been very effective and we've been very successful in achieving, in the past, these cost savings, which they will flow directly to the bottom line."

We will evaluate any need to retire, just like we did in Huntley. What I can tell you that we're not in such conditions right now in Texas. I have said in the past that our core portfolio is a low-cost, environmentally controlled portfolio.

And then you said, well, how -- what do you need to do to fix this sort of issues within Home Solar. So and Kelcy is on the phone. And Kelcy do you have anything to add after I finish, go ahead, particularly obviously on the second part of that question. So on the strategic process, what we'd tell you, Julien, is we've been through this sort of preliminary discussions stage out there, talking to multiple people who are interested. And I think, specifically, road testing the idea that what we're looking to do is sell a majority stake to someone who's sort of strategically aligned with our thinking about the prospects for the business but maintaining a substantial minority stake, so that we can maintain the business connection with the rest of the company and also have a second bite of the apple in terms of value realization. And it's early days yet. What I would tell you, I mean, it's relatively easy for people to express interest before they have to write down a number on a piece of paper. But I would say in the early going, there's a quite a lot of interest in it and no problems with the structure we're proposing. So that's what I would tell you about where we are now on the strategic process. With respect to the issues in the Home Solar, what I would tell you is there are operational issues, basic blocking and tackling that sort of come with running a business that has complex logistics and is growing at an annualized triple-digit rate. And so you get this sales engine revved up, and then the installation and the deployments have to follow. And getting that exact balance right, as I think other players in the industry have demonstrated, is a constant work in progress. But I'd say there's an enormous amount of attention on it, particularly the productivity of our installation crews. Right now, I think is double what it was just a couple of months ago. And then there's the paperwork from going from installation to deployment, which is obviously in terms of getting the right software and just making the process much more efficient. Kelcy, is there anything that you would want to add to that?"

In fact, we ended Q3 almost exactly flat from a headcount perspective, so without adding costs. And Julien, I think what we've done is we've really focused, and we're determined to achieve this 90-day from signature to energization of a solar system. And we've identified with this theme of an excess backlog, which is any job that exceeds that 90-day time line, and then the optimal backlog, which is all the jobs being executed within that time line.

So with just over 6 weeks passed since we hosted the NRG Reset call, we are going to do our best to be brief so that we can provide you with ample time to ask the questions that you have. However, with the unabated selloff in our stock and across the entire sector during the quarter, I want to begin by acknowledging how difficult a time it has been for you, our shareholders.
And truth, in this market environment, I don't know that I can predict what exactly what will cause the stock to turn around and recover to some level that approximates fair value. But I can tell you that NRG's operational and financial performance has been strong and solidly within expectations, that our current liquidity is as strong as it has ever been at over $4 billion and that our Reset program has passed through the panning [ph] stage since implementation with every aspect of it well on track, albeit still in the early going.
It is certainly our hope and expectation that the gradual accomplishments of various aspects of the Reset, the cost cutting, the freeing up of committed capital through various measures, the allocation of capital, particularly to the reduction of debt, all provide a continuous impetus to the recovery of our share price. And after that preliminary comment, let's move on to discuss how our business has performed through the third quarter of 2015.
Turning to Slide 3 in the Business Update. I'm pleased to report today that we are narrowing our 2015 full year adjusted EBITDA guidance to $3.25 billion to $3.35 billion, solidly in the middle of the original guidance range. Our financial performance in the ever-important third quarter was just tremendous and demonstrated once again the resilience of having a matched retail/wholesale platform. In a period of subdued wholesale power prices, our retail business, alongside our outstanding commercial operations team, excelled. And indeed, our retail business delivered its best quarterly result since 2010 with $225 million in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter.
Regarding our conventional wholesale business, which, by the way, turned in another strong operational quarter, probably the most noteworthy event during the quarter has been the extensive commentary in the financial community, questioning the medium- to long-term prospects for power plant fleets like ours. My reaction at this point, based on the many commodity price cycles I have lived through in this industry, is that you can't ignore the underlying reliability value of locationally advantaged assets in competitive markets. Our 48,000-megawatt fleet has a key competitive advantage in each of our 3 regional markets.
First, in Texas, our generation portfolio's footprint closely matches and complements our thriving Texas retail business. Second, in the East, our portfolio has been shaped to focus on providing and being compensated for reliable capacity as demonstrated by the enhanced value in earning to NRG as a result of the recent capacity performance auction and the importance of which has been underlined by the recently announcement of Entergy with respect to the closure of the FitzPatrick line.
And third, in the West, our portfolio features a heavily contracted fast-start gas capability tailored to a market moving towards 50% renewables. In all 3 of our regional markets, the steady and stable operations of our generation remains critical not only to the enterprise, but to the grid in general.
Moving on to other signs of a successful execution of our business plan, I'm pleased to announce today that just yesterday, we closed our most recent drop-down to NRG Yield, which delivered $210 million in cash back to NRG, which, as you know, we will be utilizing as part of our efforts to shrink the balance sheet, as we discussed on our last call.
I'm also pleased to report that as we announced on September 22, we successfully executed on the $251 million share repurchase program, which, in combination with all shares we purchased year-to-date, brings the total shares acquired this year to 7% of our outstanding shares. And as we will discuss in more detail in a bit, we are now shifting our immediate capital allocation focus to debt reduction as we indicated would be the case on our NRG Reset call as a way not only to further strengthen our balance sheet, but also to unlock shareholder value.
Lastly, our Home Solar business remains well on track as we outlined 6 weeks ago, driven by tremendous top line growth with over 6,300 net bookings in the quarter and we believe one of the highest, if not the highest, growth rate of the major players in this sector. This volume places us in the fight for third with Sunrun and not that far off from Vivint in the #2 position.
With respect to our installations for the quarter, which numbered 1,900 or now a total of approximately 80 megawatts, we are making progress in our concerted effort to reduce the backlog going into and through the early months of 2016. For those tracking Home Solar's negative EBITDA contribution projected for full year 2015, it continues to track within the negative $175 million disclosed on the second quarter call.
So let's move on to discuss progress on the NRG Reset and drivers behind our 2016 financial guidance, turning to Slide 4. Let me start with components of the reset, which are fully within our control. We are well into the implementation phase of our company-wide cost reduction program of $150 million across G&A, marketing and development expense.
In addition, and Mauricio will provide more details on this, I'm also pleased to announce today that we have identified and are implementing an additional $100 million in O&M spending reductions across all of our businesses, all of which can be done in a manner that does not sacrifice the reliability of our portfolio.
So when combined with the initial NRG Reset cost reduction plan, our cost reduction efforts now bring, on an annual basis, a total cost savings target of $250 million to be achieved in 2016 and recurring thereafter.
On the asset rebalancing component of the program, we remain focused on and highly confident in our ability to unlock, in combination with the cost reduction program, over $1 billion in capital for allocation to reduce the balance sheet. The modifications of our plants at Portland and Avon Lake Unit 9 are complete, reducing or eliminating additional capital spend at those plants, and we are actively marketing select assets for disposition.
Given the high level of interest in these assets expressed during our preliminary marketing phase for the past few weeks, we are moving forward at a pace and in a manner that we believe will lead to an optimization of value for NRG shareholders. You should expect, in all likelihood, a series of such transaction announcements over the weeks and months to come.
Regarding the GreenCo business, the $125 million GreenCo runway around NRG Home Solar, the C&I business at NRG Renew and eVgo is established and ready to commence on January 1, 2016. As it relates to the process around the securing of a strategic or financial partner in GreenCo, through the initial phase of our efforts, we are quite pleased with the interest we are seeing. We continue to be in the market discovery process and remain focused on selling a majority interest in GreenCo with the goal of financial deconsolidation and simplification at the parent company level.
However, and not unlike our approach to asset dispositions on the conventional side, our approach, with respect to GreenCo, is value first and speed of execution, second. The choice of partner in GreenCo is an important one, and we are focused on both optimizing current value and positioning the business, which NRG will continue to own a significant stake in, for future success. We will provide you with more material updates as the process allows.
So as we look at all the actions we are taking and importantly, vary this with the ongoing benefit of our integrated platform, we are introducing 2016 financial guidance of $3 billion to $3.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA, and $1 billion to $1.2 billion in free cash flow before growth on a consolidated basis.
As an additional item and something Kirk will provide more detail around, in response to many of the questions we are receiving from investors pertaining to the complexity of our capital structure, for the first time, we are now providing our expectation for free cash flow before growth at the NRG level. What this represents is the free cash flow generation, excluding nonrecourse subsidiaries such as GenOn, NRG Yield and the primary NRG ROFO assets. Our hope is that providing this view, we will eliminate at least part of the concern about the geography of our cash flows.
Now turning to Slide 5. I'd like to touch upon capital allocation. We have repeatedly stated over the past few months that our focus over the coming year is on shrinking the balance sheet. So for the avoidance of doubt, let me put our thinking in this regard into some historical context. For many years now, indeed for almost my entire time as CEO of NRG, our focus has been to establish a diversified business platform that reduces our company's exposure to near-term fluctuations in natural gas and power prices, amongst other potentially concentrated risks.
Specifically, our goal always has been to minimize commodity price impact on free cash flow while maintain the upside that occurs when the commodity markets move in a positive direction. Our key tool in this regard, in addition to hedging, has been asset and business diversification. Our diversification commenced in earnest when we entered the retail business 6 years ago through the acquisition of Reliant. Followed with our strong move into contracted generation targeted around renewables, our redevelopment efforts at our locationally advantaged brownfield sites and most recently, our asset management program aimed at maximizing our economic advantage in capacity markets like PJM.
This quarter's performance, especially with our outstanding retail performance and next year's guidance coming in as they do at a time of historically low natural gas prices, speaks to the effectiveness of our business diversification as a financial buffer. But of course, this diversification becomes a moot point if market concerns around the balance sheet persists. It is our strongly held belief that NRG's equity investors will benefit from an absolute reduction in our debt, most notably at the NRG level, but also across our entire capital structure. As Kirk will outline, that is the focus of our capital allocation program now.
As this Slide 5 describes as a result of our Reset efforts, we aim to free up roughly $1.6 billion in total over the next 14 months to apply to balance sheet shrinking and particularly, to debt reduction. Further, as we look out beyond the next 14 months, our efforts around reducing maintenance CapEx and the material completion of our capital expenditure program will provide further capital allocation flexibility.
Our overriding goal that animates this entire effort has been put to rest the question of whether NRG is carrying an excessive level of debt so that all of us can be on the same plane where we can focus on the cash-generative power of the NRG businesses and how that cash can be put to its best use for the benefits of NRG shareholders.
And with that, I will turn it over to Mauricio."

Our integrated platform continued to perform extremely well during the quarter.

Our integrated platform continued to perform extremely well during the quarter. Our wholesale business mitigated the impact of lower power prices through active hedging and good commercial execution, while our retail business benefited from lower supply cost, highlighting once again the strength of our wholesale/retail platform.
During the quarter, we continue to take steps on repositioning our portfolio to optimize and improve economics and returns. First, our asset optimization effort in the Northeast, which focuses on capacity revenues, was validated by the recent PJM capacity performance auction [ph] [indiscernible] . Second, we continue to reduce spend across the fleet, which I will discuss in more detail in a later slide. And finally, we have taken the necessary steps to hedge our portfolio in the short term to protect from further downside. All of these efforts are in addition to the business diversification strategy that David already mentioned in his remarks.
So let's start with a review of our operational performance on Slide 7. We had another quarter of top quartile safety performance with 147 out of 168 facilities that finished the quarter without a single recordable injury. We're mindful that our portfolio is going through some changes, and we need to stay vigilant and redouble our efforts to ensure that safety is and remains always first.
Our total generation was up 5% for the quarter, driven primarily by higher generation in the Gulf and the West. The East was relatively unchanged with a slightly lower coal generation, offset by higher gas lines [ph]. Our coal and nuclear plant improved their availability and reliability metrics. I want to congratulate STP, Parish and Dunford [ph] for almost a perfect runs this summer. Our gas units continued to be called on more frequently in the market as you can see in the bottom-right chart. We continued to maintain a remarkable 99% starting reliability on our gas [indiscernible].
Turning to Slide 8. Our retail business continued its trend of exceptional performance, delivering $225 million of adjusted EBITDA, the highest third quarter since 2010 and $58 million more than last year. During the quarter, we captured value from lower cost to serve, effective margin management and expansion of our product offering. We have also sustained our strong momentum in customer acquisition and retention that led to 5,000 customer count growth despite the continued expiration of acquired Dominion customers' contracts in the East, where we continue to see better-than-expected retention levels. Excluding the Dominion acquisition, our customer growth was 26,000.
As we have stated in the past 6 years, the ongoing success of our retail business continues to demonstrate the value of our integrated wholesale/retail platform and most importantly, provides NRG diversification in earnings through all stages of the commodity cycle.
Turning to Slide 9. Let me share a few comments on the gas market. We have experienced pretty mild weather this past year, a warm winter followed by a mild summer. This weather combination most likely will lead to a new record storage number in the coming weeks at or near 40 CF. Combined with the expectation of an El Niño weather forecast, and you've got a market with only bearish news and falling prices. It's worth noting that El Niño is typically associated with a warmer Upper Midwest winter and a colder Gulf Coast one. As a diversified energy company with assets in both areas, we could do well in such a scenario.
I want to remind everyone that we're very well hedged through 2016 and about 50% in 2017, giving us a nice run way to what we see as a more bullish future. Make no mistake, we will take plenty of upside if gas prices were to rise, but have protected significantly the downside through hedging and business diversification.
Regardless of current sentiment, in our view, long-term natural gas price fundamentals looks strong. The first half of this decade was dominated by supply growth outstripping demand. We expect the second half to revert that trend with demand growth outstripping supply. Natural gas production has been stagnant since late last year in part because of lower rig counts and low prices.
In the meantime, we see growing LNG exports, increasing exports to Mexico, higher industrial production and greater demand from the power sector. As an example, our fuel conversions at New Castle, Joliet and Shawville alone will increase our summer peak day gas consumption by 0.5 bcf [ph] per day. The gas demand from new builds and conversions is real and is coming. Simply put, we're well positioned to weather the short-term low prices and remain open to benefit from bullish long-term fundamentals.
Turning to Slide 10 on our power market update and starting with ERCOT. As we've had this cost for several years now. Market changes are needed to better reflect scarcity conditions like the ones we experienced this summer. During August, we saw our first real test of the operating reserve demand for mechanism and sadly, we watched it fail.
Scarcity conditions arrived for a few days, during which a new record peak was set. But aside from one $350 day ahead [ph] clear, the week was mostly disappointing. A combination of scarcity conditions and low prices caught both market participants and the PUC's [ph] attention. All this [indiscernible]  is expected to be a major topic of conversation at the open meeting tomorrow. Discussions are now underway to examine potential changes that can be made to the RDC parameters to make it more effective and reflecting truest [ph] case beyond the system.
We're supportive of that effort and we'll actively participate in the discussion. Otherwise, fundamentals remain strong, with loads [ph] growing by 2.7% on a weather normalized basis so far this year despite low oil prices. Combined with the risk of additional retirements, current forward prices look too low and present an upside to our low cost and environmentally controlled coal portfolio.
As for the Northeast, we have been repositioning our portfolio from providing baseload energy to providing reliability at the capacity resource. The recent result in PJM and New England, which we just covered in our recent call, validates our commercial strategy.
In the past couple of weeks, we've heard news of additional nuclear retirements. It would seem that smaller nuclear plants are struggling to cover costs and may lead the way to further tightening in the market.
Turning to our hedging disclosure on Slide 11. And as I mentioned earlier today, we're pretty well hedged for the next 2 years. As the chart in the upper left of the slide shows, we're very well hedged against our expected production for 2016 and almost 50% hedged for 2017. We are evaluating further entry points to increase our coal hedges and are comfortable with current inventory levels as we head into the winter months. We like the remaining open position for the back half of 2017 and beyond given our more constructive view of gas and power.
Finally, on Slide 12, I want to provide more details on our expanded cost reduction program across the company and more specifically, the $100 million reduction in O&M savings that David mentioned. As you likely have assumed, most of these will be executed on the wholesale business, where we continue our work on evaluating and prioritizing every actionable spend decision on an asset-by-asset basis.
Key drivers of the overall reduction relate to the asset optimization efforts that we announced around Portland and [indiscernible], respectively, changes in the way we're managing operational risk and further cost reductions on the units that have lower capacity factors. Of course, we will not make any O&M reduction that jeopardize the safe and efficient operations of our fleet.
In addition to the $100 million reduction just announced, we're introducing the fourth iteration of NRG's continuous business improvement program called FORNRG. This program is driven by employee ideas and innovation to enhance each department's bottom line. The FOR stands for focus on return, and is rooted in ensuring all employees are empowered to find better, more cost-effective ways on doing our jobs. Our goal is to achieve $150 million of cumulative EBITDA over the next 3 years. Just as we have done in the past, we remain committed to our continuous improvement program that has yielded so many benefits for NRG and its shareholders.
With that, I will turn it over to Kirk."
413857,314070684,892910,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2015",2015-11-04,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mauricio.

NRG delivered a total of $1.145 billion in adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter and over $2.7 billion for the 9 months ended September 30.Our third quarter's results were highligh",1855,"Thank you, Mauricio. We'll begin with the financial summary on Slide 14. NRG delivered a total of $1.145 billion in adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter and over $2.7 billion for the 9 months ended September 30.
Our third quarter's results were highlighted by $225 million in adjusted EBITDA from Home Retail, a 35% year-over-year increase, again highlighting the success of NRG's integrated business model as results improved largely due to favorable supply costs. Business and Renew combined were $722 million in EBITDA for the quarter, while NRG Yield contributed $198 million.
Despite the subdued summer power prices, our strong Home Retail performance, combined with effective wholesale hedging, allows us to narrow our adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $3.25 billion to $3.35 billion, still in line with the midpoint of our original 2015 guidance. 
Looking to the business segment components of adjusted EBITDA guidance, the increase in guidance for NRG Yield reflects the full year impact of the closing of the wind portfolio drop-down, as required under GAAP, with an equal reduction in Business and Renew guidance, which previously included the EBITDA associated with the equity stake now held by Yield.
Based on the strong retail performance for the quarter, we are also increasing the Retail component of 2015 EBITDA guidance, which offsets the modest reduction in expected 2015 wholesale results. Finally, we are also narrowing guidance for 2015 free cash flow to $1.125 billion to $1.225 billion.
Turning to other highlights and focusing first on our progress on NRG Yield drop-downs. We're pleased to announce we've now closed the previously announced sale of a 75% interest in a portfolio of 12 wind projects to NRG Yield for $210 million in cash. The remaining 25% interest continues to be part of the drop-down pipeline remaining under the expanded right of first offer agreement.
NRG intends to complete the balance of the $100 million in commercial distributed solar projects and $150 million in residential solar leases under our existing partnerships with NRG Yield over the balance of 2015 and into early '16. As we've indicated in previous quarters, NRG also intends to offer its remaining stake in CVSR to NRG Yield in late 2015, which makes up the balance of the $600 million in expected drop-down offers to Yield during 2015, as originally announced on our first quarter earnings call.
Turning to share repurchases, NRG completed the purchase of $251 million of its common stock during September and October of 2015, which, when combined with our previously completed share repurchases and annualized dividend, leads to a total over approximately $630 million in capital returned to NRG common stockholders in 2015 and a 7% reduction in common shares outstanding.
Turning to 2016 guidance on Slide 15. We're initiating 2016 guidance ranges with adjusted EBITDA of $3 billion to $3.2 billion, consisting of business and utility scale renewable adjusted EBITDA of $1.545 billion to $1.67 billion, retail adjusted EBITDA of $650 million to $725 million, which is a $50 million increase over our initial 2015 retail guidance. And finally, NRG Yield adjusted EBITDA of $805 million, which includes the recently closed [indiscernible]  drop-downs. Our free cash flow before growth guidance, which is net of maintenance and environmental capital, is expected to be a robust $1 billion to $1.2 billion.
Our 2016 guidance excludes the impact of the GreenCo businesses, as identified during our Reset call on September 18, for which NRG's total cash committed is limited to $125 million, which will be managed through an intercompany revolving credit facility as part of NRG 2016 capital allocation, which I'll review in greater detail shortly.
As David mentioned earlier, to further clarify the cash flow and capital available at the NRG level, we are also initiating guidance for the portion of our total free cash flow before growth guidance, which is available at the NRG level, which, for 2016, we expect to be $750 million to $950 million. This range is based on deducting the portion of our total free cash flow guidance expected to be generated at NRG's nonguarantor subsidiaries, which consists primarily of GenOn, NRG Yield and the remaining ROFO assets. And then finally, adding back the expected cash distributions and dividends from these subsidiaries, makes up the adjustment to arrive at NRG level free cash flow before growth.
Turning to Slide 16 and continuing the theme of clarifying and enhancing our disclosures. In light of increasing questions and focus from our investors on leverage levels at NRG, I have provided here a deconstructed view of the consolidated balance sheet as well as the derivation of the NRG corporate debt to corporate EBITDA ratio, which is a cornerstone of our targeted prudent balance sheet metrics. As you recall, we target this ratio at 4.25x, which is consistent with our targeted BB credit metrics recently reaffirmed by S&P.
Based on the midpoint of our 2016 guidance and previously committed debt reduction from 2015, we are in line with that target. As shown on the left of this slide, although NRG's consolidated debt balance as of the quarter end is approximately $20 billion. Over $11 billion of that debt resides at our excluded project subsidiaries, which consist primarily of NRG Yield and the remaining ROFO asset, most of the debt at which is fully amortized and consistent with the contract durations, with the remaining nonrecourse debt residing at GenOn. This debt is not a recourse to NRG and is not counted in our corporate credit metrics, including the debt-to-EBITDA ratio prescribed by our credit facilities, which contains thresholds governing our ability to purchase shares and pay dividends.
Only the remaining $8.8 billion of debt, consisting of our senior unsecured notes and term loan facility, is recourse to NRG and counts toward this ratio. On the right of the slide, after adjusting for the $500 million in 2015 capital already allocated to NRG level debt reduction, which we expect to augment using 2016 capital, we anticipate corporate debt or the numerator of the ratio to be less than $8.3 billion in 2016.
Turning to corporate EBITDA or the denominator of the targeted ratio, we began with the midpoint of our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance. As only cash distributions from our excluded project subsidiaries count as EBITDA for ratio purposes, we next deduct the midpoint 2016 EBITDA from these subsidiaries and then add back these cash distributions, which include our share of dividends from NRG Yield and distributions and payments from the remaining nonrecourse subsidiaries, primarily the remaining ROFO asset. 
The final adjustment is an add-back of noncash components of corporate-level expenses, which we're deducting and arriving at our EBITDA guidance. What results is $1.95 billion of corporate-level EBITDA, which basically represents EBITDA from assets and businesses from our recourse subsidiaries plus the cash distributions and payments from nonrecourse stubs. Based on the midpoint of our 2016 guidance, and our expected corporate debt-to-EBITDA is no greater than 4.26x, in line with our long-term target for this ratio and significantly below both our restricted payment and default ratio.
As I mentioned earlier, we expect to augment our 2015 allocation of capital to debt reduction, with additional debt reduction using 2016 capital driving this ratio even lower and providing additional balance sheet strengthening as we move into 2017. We remain committed to shrinking the NRG balance sheet as part of the NRG Reset and leaving no doubt as to the strength and integrity of NRG credit ratios as we move into the 2016 and beyond.
Turning to Slide 17. Having initiated 2016 guidance, I'd like to next review NRG-level capital available for allocation for 2016. We are focused here on capital allocation at the NRG level, which excludes NRG Yield excess cash as well as GenOn excess cash reserve for liquidity and the completion of our asset optimization project at GenOn.
Moving from left to right, we have now allocated all remaining 2015 capital towards debt reduction, which we expect to execute over the balance of 2015 and into 2016, totaling $500 million in discretionary debt reduction at NRG. This balance consists of $200 million, which is 1/3 of the targeted 2015 NRG Yield drop-down proceeds plus $300 million of remaining capital also announced as part of the NRG Reset in September, which we are now committing to debt reduction as well.
Turning to 2016, incremental NRG level capital for allocation begins with the midpoint of our NRG level free cash flow guidance of $850 million. Total 2016 committed capital NRG is approximately $600 million as shown in the red bar and is comprised of the $125 million GreenCo runway revolver, gross investments of $250 million, primarily our PH Robinson Pico [ph] Project, Carbon 360 and the eVgo California settlement, with the balance allocated to NRG-level corporate debt amortization and our common stock dividend.
The remaining free cash flow balance of $250 million, combined with $500 million of 2015 capital, remaining to be deployed towards debt reduction, leads to $750 million in capital available at the NRG level through 2016, which we expect to further supplement through the execution of the remainder of the NRG Reset initiatives.
These initiatives include nonrecourse project financing through which we expect to fund approximately $250 million of environmental CapEx at Midwest Generation, thereby increasing capital available to NRG. Having now completed the rating process and documentation for this financing, we were prepared to launch when market conditions are more favorable.
Targeted asset sale proceeds from the NRG Reset, totaling at least $500 million, are expected to further augment excess capital for consolidated balance sheet reduction.
Finally, and potentially supplemental to the $1.1 billion in Reset capital, any proceeds from the GreenCo sell-down and future NRG Yield drop-downs located currently by equity market recovery, which serve to further expand NRG-level capital for allocation.
By way of reference, in the upper right corner of the page, I've provided a walk, beginning with the remaining 2016 excess NRG-level free cash flow, through the other components of the NRG Reset, which combined now total $1.1 billion in consolidated 2016 capital to be deployed toward shrinking the balance sheet. 
Finally, turning to Slide 18, I'd like to briefly review and update our expectations for significant reductions in maintenance, environmental and growth capital from 2016 to 2017. Our revised 2016 capital expenditures reflect reductions in growth CapEx, stemming primarily from the $100 million and reduced spend on fuel conversions at GenOn as well as GreenCo-related growth CapEx, which is now capped at $125 million based on the runway amount.
Turning to 2017, due to incremental reductions in expected 2017 growth capital expenditures, including the elimination of distributed generation solar and residential solar, we now expect a year-over-year reduction of over $550 million in consolidated CapEx in 2017 versus 2016 with approximately $350 million of this reduction occurring at the NRG level.
These substantial year-over-year reductions in expected capital expenditures provide a significant cushion [ph] against continued softness in commodity prices and a potential uplift in available capital in 2017, which may be allocated to further balance sheet reductions, including debt reduction and return of shareholder capital.
With that, I'll turn it back to David."

And if we turn to our closing slide, which is Slide 20, we end by quantifying a point previously made, which is that NRG's financial results in 2016 are not nearly as exposed to fluctuating gas prices as the market seems to be suggesting. We have successfully mitigated the downward exposure of falling natural gas prices through our hedging program and through our asset diversification. 
In the ultra-low commodity price environment that currently grips our market, this strategy is what has enabled us today to guide to a healthy adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow level for 2016, in which, together with a substantially increased capital flexibility arising out of the steps listed on the right side of this page, should enable us to implement a substantial capital allocation program over the months ahead. 
Our goal in all of this is to make NRG a simpler, less leveraged company over the duration of the Reset program. NRG is not just an IPP. As we have demonstrated on this call, NRG's unique advantage is that our balanced wholesale retail business mitigates the financial impact of low energy commodity prices, which enables us to profitably serve our retail customers with a growing mix of products and services. This is essential during the current low commodity price cycle when the value pendulum in the sector clearly has swung to serving the end-use energy customer. As I said, this wholesale retail balance is NRG's unique advantage, and all of us at NRG are excited about the opportunities we have in front of us to maximize the value of this advantage for the benefit of NRG shareholders. 
And with that, Liz, we are happy to take people's questions."

And depending on the mix of those asset sales, some of which we expect to be at the GenOn level because we're focused on the Northeast that, more than anything else, would govern the proportion of the allocation of capital towards debt reduction at GenOn versus NRG. As to the targeted metric, we continue to target, as I've said, 4.25x corporate debt to corporate EBITDA. We also focused on FFO to debt, keeping that number below the -- at or below the high-teens level. And I'd say the tertiary component of that is we look to stay around 50% debt to capital, though that is a book ratio, certainly something that we focused on, the  rating agency is focused on. But I think it's probably certainly tertiary to those first 2. And so -- and part of the reason why we focused on that 4.25 is, as I've said, it comports with what, based on our ongoing conversations, the rating agencies support those DD credit metrics. It also gives us a significant cushion against the thresholds in our credit facility, above which we are no longer permitted to pay dividends or buy back stock. So we've got a significant cushion there, and obviously, even further cushion below the default ratio. So those are the reasons that go into those target metrics."

As we move into 2016 or -- and what we're seeing in terms of the growth capital on a consolidated basis is primarily the completion of the GenOn repowerings as well as the -- and beyond 2017, the beginning of the capital allocated to our Carlsbad and Mandalay projects. And the balance of that capital in 2016 and a little bit further into 2017 is just, a, the remainder of the Carbon 360 project, which is about $150 million of capital left to go in about equal parts between 2016 and 2017 and the eVgo California settlement, which in both 2016 and 2017 is at or about $20 million in each year. That is really the bulk -- that is all of the remaining growth capital that we have or expect to allocate at this point. As to the allocation of capital towards the balance sheet, your comment about share repurchase, what I would say is we're -- as I'd mentioned, we're continuing to focus on finding opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Certainly, our dividend is something we're committed to do, and certainly, we look to supplement that with share repurchases. But at the present time, we are going to focus in swinging the pendulum towards the debt side of the balance sheet, in particular, leave no doubt and to ensure not only that ratio is improved in '16, but we are confident in our ability to maintain that ratio through '17. I think that, more than anything else, will determine our focus in the near term on debt reduction. And ultimately, arriving at that ratio through that debt reduction will govern the proportion of our capital allocation, which would later go to share repurchases."

So if you have a single asset, you have to budget for the forced outage -- probably the forced outage. But when you have 50,000 megawatts, then you can optimize across the entire portfolio. So that is the step 1. Step 2 is the FORNRG portfolio, and this is a target. You're familiar with the FORNRG because this is fourth iteration of this.

So I think you're alluding to -- I don't know what particular asset you're saying. But what I can tell you, Julien, is I think we've demonstrated the financial discipline when we have an asset that, number one, you see negative free cash flow; number two, the prospects of the recovering debt market are such that we cannot justify the continuing operation of that plant. And then number three, which I think is significantly important in Texas, is the prospect in terms of additional environmental CapEx to comply with upcoming rules. We will evaluate any need to retire, just like we did in Huntley. What I can tell you that we're not in such conditions right now in Texas. I have said in the past that our core portfolio is a low-cost, environmentally controlled portfolio. And I would expect that coal plants that actually have a much dire forecast in terms of environmental CapEx, we'll have to make the decision before ourself. I'll just leave it at that. But make no mistake, I mean, we will continue with the financial discipline that we have shown over the years."

And Julien, I sort of break your part of the question that I'm going to answer into -- itself in 2 parts. There was sort of how's the strategic process going with GreenCo, I think, particularly as it applies with the focus on Home Solar. And then you said, well, how -- what do you need to do to fix this sort of issues within Home Solar. So and Kelcy is on the phone. And Kelcy do you have anything to add after I finish, go ahead, particularly obviously on the second part of that question. So on the strategic process, what we'd tell you, Julien, is we've been through this sort of preliminary discussions stage out there, talking to multiple people who are interested. And I think, specifically, road testing the idea that what we're looking to do is sell a majority stake to someone who's sort of strategically aligned with our thinking about the prospects for the business but maintaining a substantial minority stake, so that we can maintain the business connection with the rest of the company and also have a second bite of the apple in terms of value realization. And it's early days yet. What I would tell you, I mean, it's relatively easy for people to express interest before they have to write down a number on a piece of paper. But I would say in the early going, there's a quite a lot of interest in it and no problems with the structure we're proposing. So that's what I would tell you about where we are now on the strategic process. With respect to the issues in the Home Solar, what I would tell you is there are operational issues, basic blocking and tackling that sort of come with running a business that has complex logistics and is growing at an annualized triple-digit rate. And so you get this sales engine revved up, and then the installation and the deployments have to follow. And getting that exact balance right, as I think other players in the industry have demonstrated, is a constant work in progress. But I'd say there's an enormous amount of attention on it, particularly the productivity of our installation crews. Right now, I think is double what it was just a couple of months ago. And then there's the paperwork from going from installation to deployment, which is obviously in terms of getting the right software and just making the process much more efficient. Kelcy, is there anything that you would want to add to that?"

We're satisfied with both our sales and installation increase in Q3. Most notably, what was important to us was we were able to sell and install more systems without adding significant headcount. In fact, we ended Q3 almost exactly flat from a headcount perspective, so without adding costs. And Julien, I think what we've done is we've really focused, and we're determined to achieve this 90-day from signature to energization of a solar system. And we've identified with this theme of an excess backlog, which is any job that exceeds that 90-day time line, and then the optimal backlog, which is all the jobs being executed within that time line. And we believe we're poised to be executing all of our backlog and all of our bookings to energization in the first half of 2016 within 90 days. And so that's what I would tell you."
