Very solid performance in the fourth quarter capped off an excellent 2014. We increased our adjusted internal revenue growth by 150 basis points, recorded our 29th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth and delivered record levels of both sales and free cash flow per share. We are pleased with our accomplishments for the year.
We entered 2015 with momentum and focus. We intend to deliver strong results, which we expect will include our fourth straight year of increasing our adjusted internal revenue growth rate. However, before we fully define expectations for 2015, let me recap some highlights for the quarter and the year.
At the outset of 2014, we communicated 3 key priorities to help you gauge our progress of the year: first, to continue building high-quality revenue growth while meeting our earnings commitments; second, extend market momentum to deepen client relationships with a larger share of our strategic solutions; and third, deliver innovation and integration, which enhances results for our clients.
One of our key objectives is to increase our internal revenue growth rate annually, and 2014 was no exception. Our adjusted internal revenue growth rate was up more than 150 basis points to 4.3% for the year. These results also include a negative currency impact in the fourth quarter, which prevented us from being at the top end of our full year internal revenue growth guidance.  Adjusted internal revenue was up 4% in the quarter.
Adjusted earnings per share was up 13% in the quarter, and for the full year also increased 13% to $3.37. Importantly, adjusted operating margin for 2014 was up more than 40 basis points, consistent with our goal of delivering high-quality revenue growth.
Free cash flow performance was stellar at $965 million for the year, which does not include $110 million of dividend distributions from our StoneRiver investment. Combining our well-defined capital allocation strategy with strong cash flow generation resulted in a 15% increase in free cash flow per share to a record $3.82 for the year. To that end, we allocated nearly $1.2 billion to share repurchase in 2014, which reduced our comparative share count by 6% at December 31. 
Our second priority was extending market momentum to deepen client relationships with a larger share of our strategic solutions.  On that front, we closed 7 DNA sales in the quarter 26 for the full year and have now added 57 new clients since the acquisition in 2013. The DNA platform is highly attractive for progressive institutions looking for real-time, straight-through processing, modern architecture and have the desire to -- to deliver new value in a data-centric world.  Only 15 DNA clients went live in 2014, and we expect that number to more than double in 2015. 
In addition, integrated sales for Open Solutions continues to perform beyond our initial revenue synergy estimates, with $40 million in 2014 and $60 million cumulative since the 2013 acquisition. 
We continued to ride the digital wave, adding nearly 400 new Mobiliti clients in 2014. We now have over 14 million mobile users and importantly, grew the Mobiliti ASP community by more than 60% for the year to nearly 3 million subscribers. We also live with our Mobiliti Business solution in the quarter and are seeing strong demand for our mobile-enabled commercial capabilities.
Sales for our market-leading digital payment solutions are strong in the quarter as well. With 109 signings, Q4 was our strongest bill payment sales quarter since 2012, and we added a total of 356 new clients for the year.  We also added over 300 financial institutions to the Popmoney network. 
We have a strong digital payment presence at many of the largest financial institutions in the country. As an example, Citizens Bank, a $131 billion financial institution, renewed its agreement with Fiserv for multiple digital payment securities, signing a 7-year extension for RXP, Popmoney and TransferNow along with small business versions of each of these services. 
Our third priority was to deliver innovation and integration which enhances results for our clients. During the quarter, we launched NOW from Fiserv. Now or the network for our world is designed to enable payments beyond the point of sale to move with intelligence at the speed OF the user's choice. We believe this capability will translate to meaningful value for financial institutions and their customers.
We recently extended our bill payment account to account transfer and P2P relationship with U.S. Bank and are working closely with them as provide customers with a differentiated payment experience based on several factors, including differentiated transaction pricing and payment speed flexibility. We're excited about the expansion of our relationship and the opportunity to help U.S. Bank and the financial industry transform the more than $55 billion payments that occur beyond the point of sale each year.
Real-time money movement is top of mind in the U.S. and around world. Given our suite of solutions, we see multiple opportunities for Fiserv to play a role in this payments transformation. We are proud to have been selected by SWIFT to help build the infrastructure of the new payments platform, or NPP, for Australia. This is an expensive project whereby SWIFT and Fiserv will provide fast, flexible and data-rich payments infrastructure to the country. This project was a key competitive win against a broad set of IT the companies and a testament to the strength of our payments capabilities.
We're also seeing strong interest in Agiliti, our new cloud-based account processing solution in the U.K. Demand stretches across a far broader range of institutions than we originally anticipated. We expect to continue investing in this platform in 2015 as our first clients go live late this year.
With that, let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail on our results."

As you heard upfront, we executed well in the quarter and our results for the year were excellent. Adjusted revenue for the quarter and full year increased 4% to $1.2 billion and $4.7 billion respectively. Adjusted internal revenue growth was also 4% in the fourth quarter, which includes a negative currency impact of 40 basis points.  For the full year, our adjusted internal revenue growth was over 4%, increasing 150 basis points compared to the 3% growth reported last year.
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.89 and for the full year was $3.37, both increasing 13% over the prior periods, coming at the top end of our EPS guidance range for the year.
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was up 10 basis points to 30.6% and for the year was up 52 basis points to 30.5%, driven by high-quality revenue growth along with our continued focus on operational efficiency.  
We are particularly pleased with our Payments segment performance, delivering 6% adjusted internal revenue growth in the quarter and 7% for the full year, accelerating 200 basis points over the prior year.  Performance in this $2.4 billion revenue segment was strong across the majority of the businesses, including card solutions, channels, bill payment and Output Solutions. As you will recall, biller headwinds were a drag on our revenue growth this year, which we'll annualize in the first half of 2015.
Debit transaction growth was 12% in the quarter and 11% for the year. These strong results are a combination of above market transaction growth in our client base, along with the impact of continuing strong sales. We signed 38 new clients in the quarter and 134 for the year.
We remain focused on enabling our clients to be at the forefront dynamic card payments landscape. Accordingly, we expect areas such as EMV and tokenization to spur meaningful new revenue over the next several years.
Payments segment adjusted operating income was excellent, up 10% in the quarter to $202 million and for the year increased 9% to $768 million. We had another quarter of strong adjusted operating margin performance, increasing 120 basis points to 32.1%. And for the full year, segment operating margin was up 70 basis points to 31.7%.  Growth in high-quality Payments revenue is fueling margin expansion, which we expect will continue into the foreseeable future.
Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment increased 2% in both the quarter and the year to $610 million and $2.4 billion respectively. Full year adjusted internal revenue growth in the Financial segment was 2%, up 120 basis points over the prior year. Growth in this segment was led by our account processing and lending businesses, including strong sales to existing clients and the benefit of DNA implementations. As mentioned earlier, revenue was negatively impacted by currency, which reduced growth in the segment by 50 basis points in the quarter.
Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was $192 million in the quarter, down 8% compared to the prior year's very strong results. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was down 300 basis points from the prior year and 130 basis points sequentially. The margin decrease in the quarter was driven primarily by 3 factors: First, our results were compared to record operating margin performance in the prior year. Second, we had 100 basis points of negative impact due to the timing and level of variable compensation. And finally, we experienced 150 basis points of negative impact from our international operations due to several factors, including revenue mix and investments in our new Agiliti solution.  For the full year, adjusted operating income in the segment was up 2% to $773 million, and segment margin was flat at 32.6%.
Corporate segment net operating performance in the quarter improved $6 million sequentially and was $12 million better than the prior year. This improvement was primarily driven by lower consulting and legal costs along with higher prior year expenses due to the implementation of a new HR system.
Our effective adjusted tax rate was 35% in the quarter and 34% for the full year. Both the quarter and year-to-date rates were 80 basis points lower than their respective prior year periods, primarily due to discrete tax benefits recorded in 2014.  We expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be up approximately 100 basis points to 35% in 2015, which will have about a $0.05 to $0.06 negative impact on adjusted EPS for this year. We also expect a substantial majority of that impact to occur in the first quarter due to a 30% comparable adjusted tax rate.
We received $110 million of cash distributions from our StoneRiver joint venture in 2014, which are excluded from both free cash flow and adjusted EPS. The joint venture has made significant progress in effectively and profitably monetizing the businesses through dispositions. As a result, our adjusted equity earnings from this investment, excluding transaction gains, is down about $0.03 per share from the prior year.  We anticipate 2015 adjusted equity earnings to also be down sequentially.
We generated a record $965 million of free cash flow in 2014 and an exceptional 15% increase in free cash flow per share to $3.82. Our results were meaningfully higher than expected due to the timing of several working capital items, which positively impacted free cash flow for the year. These strong result is even more impressive when considering the 20% free cash flow per share growth in 2013.  Our focus on high-quality revenue and disciplined capital allocation continues to produce excellent free cash flow per share results.
Total debt at year-end was $3.8 billion or 2.2x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, which is well within our target leverage ratio.
We repurchased 5.4 million shares of stock in the quarter for $369 million. For the year, we returned nearly $1.2 billion to shareholders, repurchasing 18.7 million shares in 2014 at an average cost of approximately $62 per share.
We announced a new $20 million -- 20 million share repurchase authorization in the fourth quarter and at year-end, had 19.8 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase.
With that, let me turn the call back to Jeff."

Sales were 120% of quota for the quarter, and we attained 106% of the quota for the year. Strong results in card solutions, digital channel, lending and account processing led the way to our record 2014 performance. Actual sales were up 7% in the quarter and 12% for the year. We feel good about our sales performance and expect our momentum to continue. 
We had $89 million of integrated sales in the quarter and finished the year up 7% to $260 million. Clients maintained keen focus on solutions such as card solutions, bill payment, Mobiliti and Source Capture.  As I mentioned upfront, results within the Open Solutions client base are very strong, nearly doubling integrated sales year-over-year.
We achieved Operational Effectiveness savings of $70 million in 2014 or 117% of our $60 million goal. Savings thi syear were driven by strong results and Open Solutions synergies. We continue to see substantial opportunities to drive efficiency, particularly across our data center and real estate footprint. We plan to accelerate our execution this year in a manner that should provide meaningful Operational Effectiveness benefits in 2016 and beyond.
The banking sector firmed during the year. With only 7 regulatory actions in the quarter, it was down meaningfully over the last 2 years. M&A activity picked up during the year, and we expect that trend to continue. We also saw some improvement in spending patterns compared to the last few years, which we believe will moderately extend to 2015.  Financial institutions are focusing their technology spend on solutions that generate revenue, enhance the customer experience, deal with regulatory compliance and drive operational efficiency.
Payments are getting the majority of the industry ink right now, with areas such as Apple Pay, tokenization and systemic real-time money movement capabilities at the forefront of the discussion. We are well suited to partner with our clients in the evolving payments arena.
With that, let's move to 2015. In addition to financial guidance, we have defined 3 key enterprise priorities for the year: first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and expand client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions; and third, deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiation and value for our clients.
Now let's move to 2015 financial outlook. As we accomplished in 2014, our objectives are to sustainably increase our internal revenue growth rate, expand operating margin, and turn that combination into compelling free cash flow per share.
We expect adjusted internal revenue growth of 5% to 6%, a strong step up from 4% in 2014. The wider revenue growth rate this year considers a number of performance scenarios including, among others, the level of EMV card production revenue and currency fluctuation. We also expect our growth rate to bias to the second half of the year due to the tougher comparisons in the first half of 2015 and the expect ramp of new revenue throughout the year. 
We expect adjusted earnings per share growth for the year of 11% to 14%, or a range of $3.73 to $3.83.  
We also expect that our focus on the combination of high quality revenue and Operational Effectiveness will again translate to full year adjusted operating margin expansion of at least 50 basis points.
We estimate our free cash flow per share for 2015 to be at least $4.12, following our very strong 15% per share growth in 2014, incorporating this year's guidance results and expected 3-year compound growth in free cash flow per share of 14%.
Our Operational Effectiveness target for 2015 is $50 million, and our integrated sales target is $250 million.
Lastly, although we don't give quarterly guidance, we expect the first quarter to be our most difficult comparisons of the year, given the lower tax rate of 2014's first quarter and that Q1 was, by far, our strongest revenue growth quarter last year.
In conclusion, our business model is working and we enter this year with momentum and excitement about the opportunities that lie ahead. We are very well positioned to bolster our adjusted internal revenue growth rate again for this year, expand operating margins and deliver value for you, our shareholders, through strong cash flow generation sales and capital allocation. 
Lastly, let me thank the more than 21,000 associates who focus their collective energy on delivering value for clients each and every day. You truly are Fiserv's most important asset. And with that, Tony, let's Open the line for questions."

I think most everyone would say that over -- it's going to be a number of years until that road map is -- actually comes together and however it ultimately gets settled that it allows, in a simple way for that -- for the real-time systemic movement to occur. And so from our standpoint, we're having lots and lots of conversations with institutions who want to take advantage of the idea and turn it into opportunities to drive value for their customers, look at opportunities to high-quality fee revenue and really using Popmoney and bill payment and other app transfer applications as a way to enable that kind of payments capability. So from our perspective, we see it to be positive. Ultimately, we do think that, that real-time changes the nature of how bill payment, and P2P specifically, work today, and that will be important transaction drivers over the next 3 to 5, 7 years."

So from our perspective, it's hard to sit here right now and say that we will have room in one segment or another.

Of course, anything that we do from an acquisition perspective, we're always going to tie it back to our trade-offs against share repurchases. But there's obviously a lot of activity in the market, and we're actively looking at that activity. We're actively looking at what's out there just to make sure we understand what's going on in the market at any point in time."

The split that we see primarily is first and foremost between credit and debit of it.

And that's really because of some technical -- the technical issues which I think you're familiar with around kind of clarifying the Durbin rules as it relates to debit. The indications that we can see are that people are now getting kind of serious about getting reissuance cycles started with debit. We think that, that will push into the second or really kind of take hold now in the second half of 2015.

It will come on over time until we see some benefits in that, and we'll continue to see opportunities within that base. We typically see it in an acquisition that it takes 2 to 3 years to get our stride from a revenue synergy perspective. So we began to see it in the second half of last year, and we think that will continue throughout this year and early into '16. And we're also seeing some very nice opportunities from the Open Solutions products that are moving that back into the Fiserv client base as well, so very good movement on that front.

In Q4 quarter, we had a couple of quarters, particularly in the Financial segment. first and foremost, if you look at the margin fourth quarter last year, that's the highest margin I believe we've had ever in that segment, which was strong comparison to this quarter. The second thing is we had timing associated with some variable comp, both incentives and commissions. We have a strong sales finish in the quarter in that particular segment. So we expensed commissions and we also had , which is variable comp, which we had to expense in the current quarter. And then, the other piece -- that was about 100 basis points. And then, the other piece was international, which I highlighted, which had a revenue mix. It had a very difficult comparison. Also we've had this during the year and have also accentuated into fourth quarter. And then, we had some increased spending in our Agiliti platform that came through in the quarter also. So all of those kind of contributed to the Q4 item. As I also highlighted on the call, our margins in that segment over the past 3 years are up about 200 basis points. Clearly, as we look forward, and you indicated, where's the margin drivers going to happen? We are, clearly, from the Payments segment standpoint at a good place. We're executing very well there, continue to drive incremental revenue on recurring base solutions like card and bill payment and all the rest.  Regarding financial, we talked about international, which was a tough compare in the current year. And clearly, DNA is an area where we've ramped up a lot of expense and we're going to be implementing a lot of clients in 2015. And so that scale is starting to return there as we've had to put more into development and implementation. And so we're confident all along with our Operational Effectiveness initiatives. We are -- have a number of those we're going to be executing in '15 that in '16 and more for forward.

So we're looking to both protect that value chain but more importantly, protect by adding differentiated value. So if I lived in non-constrained resource world, I would think that would be one of the biggest areas that I would focus on. And I think the other big opportunity there is on the lending side of the equation. I think we're going to see, over the next, call it, 2 to 3 years, 3 to 5 years, a lot of movement on the lending side, both in terms of financial institutions looking for ways to make more money in both decisioning as well as in terms of the types of loans that are able to be made, so new basically through new product. So we see that to be a big opportunity. And then, thinking about how can use the data to enhance those kinds of positions, both in terms of origination as well as on the servicing side. So I think these are 2 areas that are at least quite interesting to us as we think about where the world will go over time.

Some of it has to be to do with services, customizations and the ability to allow financial institutions to design experiences that make the most sense for their customers. I mean, one of the things that we talked about is staying focused is really in both time around customer experience. And you know well the traditional killer app in the digital world has been bill payment. So the ability to provide bill payment services and allow institutions to consume that the way they want just generally be opportunities out there. And so we've had an opportunity to create some additional strengths of revenue in that space. You got some add-on transactional opportunities, whether it's around risk management, e-bill are those kinds of things. And then, there's an emerging market category over which really ties into this whole notion of systematic will time, and then, that this premium transaction. So allowing financial institutions to use our capabilities on the front end, so whether they be bill payment, P2P or about the account transfer, linking transfer, linking that to real time and then, charging consumers a reasonable fee that they can -- so that they'll avail that my what makes sense for their own situation. So add those all up and we do see a time where different kinds of transactions get monetized differently. And I think we've talked about the fact that there may be -- there may be some point where slower transactions are priced differently relative to the more call it premium or faster transaction. And so we are look at different pricing models a different place to make sure that we find that balance between what consumers, financially solutions and what we need.  But I will say. The only thing I don't see us moving to license kind of model. IDC this as being a cloud-based and ASP solution because there's a network effect that's very important. And we need to continue to build that network out so that we can have the highest percentage of electronic transactions possible, which is absolutely paramount when you talk about driving a real-time transaction. So it is an evolving space for us. I'm quite excited about this evolution and believe we are extremely well positioned to lead us over the next 3, 5, 7 years."

On a actual basis, it was included in the prior year as well. So it's a apples-to-apples comparison.

We had some nice wins across most of our platforms in 2014 in terms of DNA but also around Premier, Signature, position, Cleartouch. Eventually, we've had good success because the beauty of our data set is that we don't think there's a white size fits all. We know that different institutions want different solutions. So the account processing business did well. Our lending business had a very good year, very happy with over there. Our risk solution, our risk area had a good year as well. And in fact, everyone had a good year. Card solutions did very well. We mentioned that our fourth quarter bill payment results were the highest we've had since 2012, so really, across the board. And I think it's -- it is a matter of having product that are up that are appealing 2 clients under account processing side, where we have a good, strong, integrated value proposition this we're delivering products that are universally taken across the entire landscape from the largest clients through some of the smaller community banks. So that's worked out well. And we expect that to continue into this year. Lastly, we don't -- we wouldn't talk about the numbers quota, but I will say this is our third year in a row that we would say we've have had record sales. And we're continuing to be in a place where we expect under the basis of the investments that we made, to continue to -- to be able to drive increased sales. Part of that comes from being better but our existing clients and part of it comes from delivering some new products into the market. We indicated that we went live with our Mobiliti for business, which is our commercial -- our mobile -- I'm sorry, our commercial mobile solution. And that, we expect to drive across hundreds of financial institution so the next 7 years.

Very solid performance in the fourth quarter capped off an excellent 2014. We increased our adjusted internal revenue growth by 150 basis points, recorded our 29th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth and delivered record levels of both sales and free cash flow per share. We are pleased with our accomplishments for the year.
We entered 2015 with momentum and focus. We intend to deliver strong results, which we expect will include our fourth straight year of increasing our adjusted internal revenue growth rate. However, before we fully define expectations for 2015, let me recap some highlights for the quarter and the year.
At the outset of 2014, we communicated 3 key priorities to help you gauge our progress for the year: first, to continue building high-quality revenue growth while meeting our earnings commitments; second, extend market momentum to deepen client relationships with a larger share of our strategic solutions; and third, to deliver innovation and integration which enhances results for our clients.
One of our key objectives is to increase our internal revenue growth rate annually, and 2014 was no exception. Our adjusted internal revenue growth rate was up more than 150 basis points to 4.3% for the year. These results also include a negative currency impact in the fourth quarter, which prevented us from being at the top end of our full year internal revenue growth guidance.  Adjusted internal revenue was up 4% in the quarter.
Adjusted earnings per share was up 13% in the quarter, and for the full year also increased 13% to $3.37. Importantly, adjusted operating margin for 2014 was up more than 50 basis points, consistent with our goal of delivering high-quality revenue growth.
Free cash flow performance was stellar at $965 million for the year, which does not include $110 million of dividend distributions from our StoneRiver investment. Combining our well-defined capital allocation strategy with strong cash flow generation resulted in a 15% increase in free cash flow per share to a record $3.82 for the year. To that end, we allocated nearly $1.2 billion to share repurchase in 2014, which reduced our comparative share count by 6% at December 31. 
Our second priority was extending market momentum to deepen client relationships with a larger share of our strategic solutions. On that front, we closed 7 DNA sales in the quarter, 26 for the full year, and have now added 57 new clients since the acquisition in 2013. The DNA platform is highly attractive for progressive institutions looking for real-time, straight-through processing, modern architecture and have a desire to look -- to deliver new value in a data-centric world. Only 15 DNA clients went live in 2014, and we expect that number to more than double in 2015. 
In addition, integrated sales for Open Solutions continues to perform beyond our initial revenue synergy estimates, with $40 million in 2014 and $60 million cumulative since the 2013 acquisition. 
We continued to ride the digital wave, adding nearly 400 new Mobiliti clients in 2014. We now have over 14 million mobile users, and importantly, grew the Mobiliti ASP community by more than 60% for the year to nearly 3 million subscribers. We also went live with our Mobiliti Business solution in the quarter and are seeing strong demand for our mobile-enabled commercial capabilities.
Sales for our market-leading digital payment solutions were strong in the quarter as well. With 109 signings, Q4 was our strongest bill payment sales quarter since 2012, and we added a total of 356 new clients for the year.  We also added over 300 financial institutions to the Popmoney network. 
We have a strong digital payment presence at many of the largest financial institutions in the country. As an example, Citizens Bank, a $131 billion financial institution, renewed its agreement with Fiserv for multiple digital payment capabilities, signing a 7-year extension for CheckFree RXP, Popmoney and TransferNow, along with small business versions of each of these services. 
Our third priority was to deliver innovation and integration which enhances results for our clients. During the quarter, we launched NOW from Fiserv. NOW, or the Network for Our World, is designed to enable payments beyond the point of sale to move with intelligence at the speed of the user's choice. We believe this capability will translate to meaningful value for financial institutions and their customers.
We recently extended our bill payment, account-to-account transfer and P2P relationship with U.S. Bank and are working closely with them as they provide their customers with a differentiated payment experience based on several factors, including differentiated transaction pricing and payment speed flexibility. We're excited about the extension of our relationship and the opportunity to help U.S. Bank and the financial industry transform the more than 55 billion payments that occur beyond the point of sale each year.
Real-time money movement is top of mind in the U.S. and around the world. Given our suite of solutions, we see multiple opportunities for Fiserv to play a role in this payments transformation. We are proud to have been selected by SWIFT to help build the infrastructure of the new payments platform, or NPP, for Australia. This is an expansive project whereby SWIFT and Fiserv will provide fast, flexible and data-rich payments infrastructure to the country. This project was a key competitive win against a broad set of IT companies and a testament to the strength of our payments capabilities.
We're also seeing strong interest in Agiliti, our new cloud-based account processing solution in the U.K. Demand is high and stretches across a far broader range of institutions than we originally anticipated. We expect to continue investing in this platform in 2015 as our first clients go live late this year.
With that, let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail on our results."

As you heard upfront, we executed well in the quarter and our results for the year were excellent. Adjusted revenue for the quarter and full year increased 4% to $1.2 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively. Adjusted internal revenue growth was also 4% in the fourth quarter, which includes a negative currency impact of 40 basis points. For the full year, our adjusted internal revenue growth was over 4%, increasing 150 basis points compared to the 3% growth reported last year.
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.89 and for the full year was $3.37, both increasing 13% over the prior periods, coming at the top end of our EPS guidance range for the year.
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was up 10 basis points to 30.6% and for the year was up 52 basis points to 30.5%, driven by high-quality revenue growth, along with our continued focus on operational efficiency.  
We are particularly pleased with our Payments segment performance, delivering 6% adjusted internal revenue growth in the quarter and 7% for the full year, accelerating 200 basis points over the prior year. Performance in this $2.4 billion revenue segment was strong across the majority of the businesses, including card solutions, channels, bill payment and Output Solutions. As you will recall, biller headwinds were a drag in our revenue growth this year, which we'll annualize in the first half of 2015.
Debit transaction growth was 12% in the quarter and 11% for the year. These strong results are a combination of above-market transaction growth in our client base, along with the impact of continuing strong sales. We signed 38 new clients in the quarter and 134 for the year.
We remain focused on enabling our clients to be at the forefront of the dynamic card payments landscape. Accordingly, we expect areas such as EMV and tokenization to spur meaningful new revenue over the next several years.
Payments segment adjusted operating income was excellent, up 10% in the quarter to $202 million and for the year increased 9% to $768 million. We had another quarter of strong adjusted operating margin performance, increasing 120 basis points to 32.1%. And for the full year, segment operating margin was up 70 basis points to 31.7%. Growth in high-quality Payments revenue is fueling margin expansion, which we expect will continue into the foreseeable future.
Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment increased 2% in both the quarter and the year to $610 million and $2.4 billion, respectively. Full year adjusted internal revenue growth in the Financial segment was 2%, up 120 basis points over the prior year. Growth in this segment was led by our account processing and lending businesses, including strong sales to existing clients and the benefit of DNA implementations. As mentioned earlier, revenue was negatively impacted by currency, which reduced growth in the segment by 50 basis points in the quarter.
Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was $192 million in the quarter, down 8% compared to the prior year's very strong results. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was down 300 basis points to the prior year and 130 basis points sequentially. The margin decrease in the quarter was driven primarily by 3 factors. First, our results were compared to record operating margin performance in the prior year. Second, we had 100 basis points of negative impact due to the timing and level of variable compensation. And finally, we experienced 150 basis points of negative impact from our international operations due to several factors including revenue mix and investments in our new Agiliti solution. For the full year, adjusted operating income in the segment was up 2% to $773 million, and segment margin was flat at 32.6%.
Corporate segment net operating performance in the quarter improved $6 million sequentially and was $12 million better than the prior year. This improvement was primarily driven by lower consulting and legal costs along with higher prior year expenses due to the implementation of a new HR system.
Our effective adjusted tax rate was 35% in the quarter and 34% for the full year. Both the quarter and year-to-date rates were 80 basis points lower than their respective prior year periods, primarily due to discrete tax benefits recorded in 2014. We expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be up approximately 100 basis points to 35% in 2015, which will have about a $0.05 to $0.06 negative impact on adjusted EPS for this year. We also expect a substantial majority of that impact to occur in the first quarter due to a 30% comparable adjusted tax rate.
We received $110 million of cash distributions from our StoneRiver joint venture in 2014, which are excluded from both free cash flow and adjusted EPS. The joint venture has made significant progress in effectively and profitably monetizing the businesses through disposition. As a result, our adjusted equity earnings from this investment, excluding transaction gains, is down about $0.03 per share from the prior year. We anticipate 2015 adjusted equity earnings to also be down sequentially.
We generated a record $965 million of free cash flow in 2014 and an exceptional 15% increase in free cash flow per share to $3.82. Our results were meaningfully higher than expected due to the timing of several working capital items, which positively impacted free cash flow for the year. This strong result is even more impressive when considering the 20% free cash flow per share growth in 2013. Our focus on high-quality revenue and disciplined capital allocation continues to produce excellent free cash flow per share results.
Total debt at year-end was $3.8 billion, or 2.2x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, which is well within our target leverage ratio.
We repurchased 5.4 million shares of stock in the quarter for $369 million. For the year, we returned nearly $1.2 billion to shareholders, repurchasing 18.7 million shares in 2014 at an average cost of approximately $62 per share.
We announced a new 20 million share repurchase authorization in the fourth quarter, and at year end, had 19.8 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase.
With that, let me turn the call back to Jeff."

Sales were 120% of quota for the quarter, and we attained 106% of the quota for the year. Strong results in card solutions, digital channel, lending and account processing led the way to our record 2014 performance. Actual sales were up 7% in the quarter and 12% for the year. We feel good about our sales performance and expect our momentum to continue. 
We had $89 million of integrated sales in the quarter and finished the year up 7% to $260 million. Clients have maintained a keen focus on solutions such as card solutions, bill payment, Mobiliti and Source Capture. As I mentioned upfront, results within the Open Solutions client base are very strong, nearly doubling integrated sales year-over-year.
We achieved Operational Effectiveness savings of $70 million in 2014 or 117% of our $60 million goal. Savings this year were driven by strong procurement results and Open Solutions synergies. We continue to see substantial opportunities to drive efficiency, particularly across our data center and real estate footprint. We plan to accelerate our execution this year in a manner that should provide meaningful Operational Effectiveness benefits in 2016 and beyond.
The banking sector firmed during the year. With only 7 regulatory actions in the quarter, it was down meaningfully over the last 2 years. M&A activity picked up during the year and we expect that trend to continue. We also saw some improvement in spending patterns compared to the last few years, which we believe will moderately extend to 2015. Financial institutions are focusing their technology spend on solutions that generate revenue, enhance the customer experience, deal with regulatory compliance and drive operational efficiency.
Payments are getting the majority of the industry ink right now, with areas such as Apple Pay, tokenization and systemic real-time money movement capabilities at the forefront of the discussion. We are well suited to partner with our clients in the evolving payments arena.
With that, let's move to 2015. In addition to financial guidance, we have defined 3 key enterprise priorities for the year: first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions; and third, deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiation and value for our clients.
Now let's move to 2015 financial outlook. As we accomplished in 2014, our objectives are to sustainably increase our internal revenue growth rate, expand operating margin, and turn that combination into compelling free cash flow per share.
We expect adjusted internal revenue growth of 5% to 6%, a strong step up from 4% in 2014. The wider revenue growth rate this year considers a number of performance scenarios including, among others, the level of EMV card production revenue and currency fluctuation. We also expect our growth rate to bias to the second half of the year due to the tougher comparisons in the first half of 2015 and the expected ramp of new revenue throughout the year. 
We expect adjusted earnings per share growth for the year of 11% to 14%, or a range of $3.73 to $3.83.  
We also expect that our focus on the combination of high-quality revenue and Operational Effectiveness will again translate to full year adjusted operating margin expansion of at least 50 basis points.
We estimate our free cash flow per share for 2015 to be at least $4.12, following our very strong 15% per share growth in 2014, incorporating this year's guidance results and an expected 3-year compound growth in free cash flow per share of 14%.
Our Operational Effectiveness target for 2015 is $50 million and our integrated sales target is $250 million.
Lastly, although we don't give quarterly guidance, we expect the first quarter to be our most difficult comparison for the year, given the lower tax rate in 2014's first quarter and that Q1 was, by far, our strongest revenue growth quarter last year.
In conclusion, our business model is working and we enter this year with momentum and excitement about the opportunities that lie ahead. We are very well positioned to bolster our adjusted internal revenue growth rate again for this year, extend operating margin, and deliver value for you, our shareholders, through strong cash flow generation and capital allocation.

I think most everyone would say that over -- it's going to be a number of years until that road map is -- actually comes together and however it ultimately gets settled that it allows, in a single way for that -- for the real-time systemic movement to occur. And so from our standpoint, we're having lots and lots of conversations with institutions who want to take advantage of the idea and turn it into opportunities to drive value for their customers, look at opportunities to drive high-quality fee revenue and really using Popmoney and bill payment and other app transfer applications as a way to enable that kind of payments capability. So from our perspective, we see it to be positive. Ultimately, we do think that, that real-time changes the nature of how bill payment, and P2P specifically, work today, and that will be important transaction drivers over the next 3 to 5, 7 years."

And the reason why we don't do it is we're going to see different -- at different times and in different places, we're going to have opportunities to invest. We're going to see different performance across business lines. You're going to have changes in comparability and lots of different factors that will have an impact. You'll create variability within the segments. And from our standpoint, we're really operating the company to deliver at least 50 basis points of margin at the company level, and that will come from a combination of new growth and existing changes and existing revenue scale, Operational Effectiveness, and the like. So from our perspective, it's hard to sit here right now and say that we will have room in one segment or another. We do have a high degree of confidence that we'll see margins grow for -- and certainly in 2015, by at least 50 basis points is the guidance that we talked about as well as our longer-term outlook."

We really had some difficult international comparisons, but we're also investing, as Jeff highlighted, in our Agiliti platform during the year. We've also ramped up a lot of resources in our DNA business around implementation and development. And we also have a couple of small product line consolidations. So we have expanded margins in that segment about 200 basis points over the last 3 years. And we're confident as we look into the future, we're going to continue to expand margins in that segment.

The split that we see primarily is, first and foremost, between credit and debit. So what you've heard principally from the larger banks are those banks that have a large credit portfolio and they are reissuing early around credit. And that's really because of some technical -- the technical issues which I think you're familiar with around kind of clarifying the Durbin rules as it relates to debit. The indications that we can see are that people are now getting kind of serious about getting reissuance cycles started with debit. We think that, that will push into the second or really kind of take hold now in the second half of 2015. Indications that we can see out of our client base would say that they are kind of behaving or expecting to reissue in much the way that I think the larger banks have indicated they are on debit as well."

It'll come on over time until we see some benefits in that, and we'll continue to see opportunities within that base. We typically see it in an acquisition that it takes 2 to 3 years to get our stride from a revenue synergy perspective. So we began to see it in the second half of last year, and we think that will continue throughout this year and early into '16. And we're also seeing some very nice opportunities from the Open Solutions product set moving that back into the Fiserv client base as well. So very good movement on that front. And then, on the cost synergy side, we indicated again this year that a lot of the value that we drove in the Operational Effectiveness category came from Open Solutions.

But we do see a much larger opportunity to grow, specifically the ASP subscriber base, which we said we're near 3 million this year. That number is still on a very low level of penetration and we expect to see meaningful growth. We actually introduced a new program late in 2014 where we're working with our bank and credit union clients to help them drive better adoption in their client base. I mean, the beauty of mobile is the consumers want it and the financial institutions want consumers to use it. And so they're really looking for ways to drive that together.

So we would see this coming in over the next 3 to 5 years. An important element of this infrastructure is creating more electronification. Obviously, paper payments are only going to move at a certain pace. So one of the things that we are looking at is how do we create a faster and faster electronification. That's one of the aspects as well. We do see this to be an important revenue opportunity, again, over time, as we've seen institutions today be able to create differentiated pricing around this.

And then, going forward, it's good to see once again another year of 50 basis points plus of margin expansion for '15.

And in the Q4 quarter, we had a couple of things. One is particularly in the Financial segment. First and foremost, if you look back at our margin in the fourth quarter last year, that's the highest margin I believe we've had ever in that segment, which was a very strong comparison to this quarter. The second thing is we had timing associated with some variable comp, both incentives and commissions. We have a strong sales finish in the quarter in that particular segment. So we expensed commissions and we also had some ACEP, which is some variable comp, which we had to expense in the current quarter. And then, the other piece -- that was about 100 basis points. And then, the other piece was international, which I highlighted, which had a revenue mix. It had a very difficult comparison. Also, we've had this during the year and have also accentuated in the fourth quarter. And then, we had some increased spending in our Agiliti platform that came through in the quarter also. So all of those kind of contributed to the Q4 item. As I also highlighted on the call, our margins in that segment over the past 3 years are up about 200 basis points. Clearly, as we look forward, and you indicated, where's the margin drivers going to happen? We are, clearly, from the Payments segment standpoint, at a good place. We're executing very well there, continue to drive incremental revenue on our recurring base solutions like card and bill payment and all the rest. Regarding financial, we talked about international, which was a tough compare in the current year. And clearly, DNA is an area where we've ramped up a lot of expense and we're going to be implementing a lot of clients in 2015. And so that scale is starting to return there as we've had to put more into development and implementation. And so we're confident overall, along with our Operational Effectiveness initiatives. We are -- have a number of those we're going to be executing in '15 that will benefit us in '16 and forward. So those things leave us much comfort that we're very confident that we're going to have margin expansion greater than 50 in 2015."

And the opportunity for us to work with financial institutions to ensure that non-FIs don't come in and take over that space. I mean, it's, as you know, it's a highly competitive world out there and there are lots and lots of providers trying to scrape away pieces of that value chain. So we're looking to both protect that value chain but more importantly protect it by adding differentiated value. So if I lived in a non-constrained resource world, I would think that would be one of the biggest areas that I would focus on. And I think the other big opportunity there is on the lending side of the equation. I think we're going to see, over the next, call it, 2 to 3 years, 3 to 5 years, a lot of movement on the lending side, both in terms of financial institutions looking for ways to make more money in both decisioning as well as in terms of the types of loans that are able to be made, so new -- basically through new product. So we see that to be a big opportunity. And then, thinking about how can you use the data to enhance those kinds of decisions, both in terms of origination as well as on the servicing side. So I mean I think those are 2 areas that are at least quite interesting to us as we think about where the world will go over time. And clearly, we are investing in those kinds of areas, but we're not doing it in an unconstrained way. We're doing it in a responsible way so we can continue to drive high-quality revenue to make sure that we can meet our margin commitments at the same time."

So Brett, I would say that we do see a variety of different ways in which we are driving value in the -- on the bill payment -- in the bill payment business. Some of it has to do with services, customization, so the ability to allow financial institutions to design experiences that make the most sense for their customers. I mean, one of the things that we talked about is that spend -- spend focus is really a big time around customer experience. And you know well the traditional killer app in the digital world has been bill payment. So the ability to provide bill payment services and allow institutions to consume that the way they want is certainly one of the opportunities out there. And so we've had an opportunity to create some additional streams of revenue in that space. You've got some add-on transactional opportunities, whether it's around risk management, e-bill, those kinds of things. And then, there's another emerging category which really ties into this whole notion of systematic real-time, and that is premium transaction. So allowing financial institutions to use our capabilities on the front end, so whether they be bill payment, P2P, or account-to-account transfer, linking that to real-time and then charging consumers a reasonable fee that they can -- so that they'll avail themselves of that real-time capability when it makes sense for their own situation. So you add all those up, and we do see a time where different kinds of transactions get monetized differently. And I think we've talked about the fact that there may be some point where slower transactions are priced differently relative to the more, call it, premium or faster transaction. And so we are looking at different pricing models and different ways to make sure that we find that balance between what consumers, financial institutions and what we need. But I will say, the only thing I would say is I don't see us moving to a license kind of a model. I see this continuing to be a cloud-based, an ASP solution, because there's a network effect that's very important. And we need to continue to build that network out so that we can have the highest percentage of electronic transactions possible, which is absolutely paramount when you talk about driving real-time transaction. So it is an evolving space for us. I'm quite excited about this evolution and believe that we are extremely well positioned to lead that over the next 3, 5, 7 years."

And it was included in the -- on an actual basis. It was included in the prior year as well. So it's an apples-to-apples comparison. I mean, the big drivers in the sales results for the year are going to be around our account processing platforms. We had some nice wins across most of our platforms in 2014 in terms of DNA, but also around Premier, Signature, Precision, Cleartouch. Eventually, we've had good success because the beauty of our product set is that we don't think there's a one-size-fits-all. We know that different institutions want different solutions. So the account processing business did well. Our lending business had a very good year, very happy with the work there. Our risk solution, our risk area had a good year as well. And in fact, everyone had a good year. Card solution did very well. We mentioned that our fourth quarter bill payment results were the highest that we've had since 2012. So really across the board. And I think it's -- it is a matter of having products that are appealing to clients on the account processing side where we have a good, strong, integrated value proposition because we're delivering products that are universally taken across the entire landscape from the largest clients through some of the smaller community banks. So that's worked out well and we expect that to continue into this year. Lastly, we don't -- we wouldn't talk about the numbers and quota, but I will say I think this is our third year in a row that we would say we've had record sales. And we're continuing to be in a place where we expect on the basis of the investments that we make, to continue to be able to drive increased sales. Part of that comes from being better with our existing clients and part of it comes from delivering some new products into the market. We indicated that we went live with our Mobiliti for business which is our commercial -- our mobile -- I'm sorry, our commercial mobile solution. And that we expect to drive across hundreds of financial institutions over the next several years. So again, it's a combination of continuing to have the best sales force and also introducing new products."

Very solid performance in the fourth quarter capped off an excellent 2014. We increased our adjusted internal revenue growth by 150 basis points, recorded our 29th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth and delivered record levels of both sales and free cash flow per share. We are pleased with our accomplishments for the year.
We enter 2015 with momentum and focus. We intend to deliver strong results, which we expect will include our fourth straight year of increasing our adjusted internal revenue growth rate. However, before we fully define expectations for 2015, let me recap some highlights for the quarter and the year.
At the outset of 2014, we communicated 3 key priorities to help you gauge our progress for the year: first, to continue building high-quality revenue growth while meeting our earnings commitments; second, extend market momentum to deepen client relationships with a larger share of our strategic solutions; and third, to deliver innovation and integration which enhances results for our clients.
One of our key objectives is to increase our internal revenue growth rate annually, and 2014 was no exception. Our adjusted internal revenue growth rate was up more than 150 basis points to 4.3% for the year. These results also include a negative currency impact in the fourth quarter, which prevented us from being at the top end of our full year internal revenue growth guidance.  Adjusted internal revenue was up 4% in the quarter.
Adjusted earnings per share was up 13% in the quarter, and for the full year also increased 13% to $3.37. Importantly, adjusted operating margin for 2014 was up more than 50 basis points, consistent with our goal of delivering high-quality revenue growth.
Free cash flow performance was stellar at $965 million for the year, which does not include $110 million of dividend distributions from our StoneRiver investment. Combining our well-defined capital allocation strategy with strong cash flow generation resulted in a 15% increase in free cash flow per share to a record $3.82 for the year. To that end, we allocated nearly $1.2 billion to share repurchase in 2014, which reduced our comparative share count by 6% at December 31. 
Our second priority was extending market momentum to deepen client relationships with a larger share of our strategic solutions. On that front, we closed 7 DNA sales in the quarter, 26 for the full year, and have now added 57 new clients since the acquisition in 2013. The DNA platform is highly attractive for progressive institutions looking for real-time, straight-through processing, modern architecture and have a desire to look -- to deliver new value in a data-centric world. Only 15 DNA clients went live in 2014, and we expect that number to more than double in 2015. 
In addition, integrated sales for Open Solutions continues to perform beyond our initial revenue synergy estimates, with $40 million in 2014 and $60 million cumulative since the 2013 acquisition. 
We continued to ride the digital wave, adding nearly 400 new Mobiliti clients in 2014. We now have over 14 million mobile users, and importantly, grew the Mobiliti ASP community by more than 60% for the year to nearly 3 million subscribers. We also went live with our Mobiliti Business solution in the quarter and are seeing strong demand for our mobile-enabled commercial capabilities.
Sales for our market-leading digital payment solutions were strong in the quarter as well. With 109 signings, Q4 was our strongest bill payment sales quarter since 2012, and we added a total of 356 new clients for the year.  We also added over 300 financial institutions to the Popmoney network. 
We have a strong digital payment presence at many of the largest financial institutions in the country. As an example, Citizens Bank, a $131 billion financial institution, renewed its agreement with Fiserv for multiple digital payment capabilities, signing a 7-year extension for CheckFree RXP, Popmoney and TransferNow, along with the small business versions of each of these services. 
Our third priority was to deliver innovation and integration which enhances results for our clients. During the quarter, we launched NOW from Fiserv. NOW, or the Network for Our World, is designed to enable payments beyond the point of sale to move with intelligence at the speed of the user's choice. We believe this capability will translate to meaningful value for financial institutions and their customers.
We recently extended our bill payment, account-to-account transfer and P2P relationship with U.S. Bank and are working closely with them as they provide their customers with a differentiated payment experience based on several factors, including differentiated transaction pricing and payment speed flexibility. We're excited about the extension of our relationship and the opportunity to help U.S. Bank and the financial industry transform the more than 55 billion payments that occur beyond the point of sale each year.
Real-time money movement is top of mind in the U.S. and around the world. Given our suite of solutions, we see multiple opportunities for Fiserv to play a role in this payments transformation. We are proud to have been selected by SWIFT to help build the infrastructure of the new payments platform, or NPP, for Australia. This is an expansive project whereby SWIFT and Fiserv will provide fast, flexible and data-rich payments infrastructure to the country. This project was a key competitive win against a broad set of IT companies and a testament to the strength of our payments capabilities.
We're also seeing strong interest in Agiliti, our new cloud-based account processing solution in the U.K. Demand is high and stretches across a far broader range of institutions than we originally anticipated. We expect to continue investing in this platform in 2015, as our first clients go live late this year.
With that, let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail on our results."

As you heard upfront, we executed well in the quarter and our results for the year were excellent. Adjusted revenue for the quarter and full year increased 4% to $1.2 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively. Adjusted internal revenue growth was also 4% in the fourth quarter, which includes a negative currency impact of 40 basis points. For the full year, our adjusted internal revenue growth was over 4%, increasing 150 basis points compared to the 3% growth reported last year.
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.89 and for the full year was $3.37, both increasing 13% over the prior periods, coming at the top end of our EPS guidance range for the year.
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was up 10 basis points to 30.6% and for the year was up 52 basis points to 30.5%, driven by high-quality revenue growth, along with our continued focus on operational efficiency.  
We are particularly pleased with our Payments segment performance, delivering 6% adjusted internal revenue growth in the quarter and 7% for the full year, accelerating 200 basis points over the prior year. Performance in this $2.4 billion revenue segment was strong across the majority of the businesses, including card solutions, channels, bill payment and Output Solutions. As you will recall, biller headwinds were a drag on our revenue growth this year, which we'll annualize in the first half of 2015.
Debit transaction growth was 12% in the quarter and 11% for the year. These strong results are a combination of above-market transaction growth in our client base, along with the impact of continuing strong sales. We signed 38 new clients in the quarter and 134 for the year.
We remain focused on enabling our clients to be at the forefront of the dynamic card payments landscape. Accordingly, we expect areas such as EMV and tokenization to spur meaningful new revenue over the next several years.
Payments segment adjusted operating income was excellent, up 10% in the quarter to $202 million and for the year increased 9% to $768 million. We had another quarter of strong adjusted operating margin performance, increasing 120 basis points to 32.1%. And for the full year, segment operating margin was up 70 basis points to 31.7%. Growth in high-quality Payments revenue is fueling margin expansion, which we expect will continue into the foreseeable future.
Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment increased 2% in both the quarter and the year to $610 million and $2.4 billion, respectively. Full year adjusted internal revenue growth in the Financial segment was 2%, up 120 basis points over the prior year. Growth in this segment was led by our account processing and lending businesses, including strong sales to existing clients and the benefit of DNA implementations. As mentioned earlier, revenue was negatively impacted by currency, which reduced growth in the segment by 50 basis points in the quarter.
Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was $192 million in the quarter, down 8% compared to the prior year's very strong results. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was down 300 basis points to the prior year and 130 basis points sequentially. The margin decrease in the quarter was driven primarily by 3 factors. First, our results were compared to record operating margin performance in the prior year. Second, we had 100 basis points of negative impact due to the timing and level of variable compensation. And finally, we experienced 150 basis points of negative impact from our international operations due to several factors including revenue mix and investments in our new Agiliti solution. For the full year, adjusted operating income in the segment was up 2% to $773 million, and segment margin was flat at 32.6%.
Corporate segment net operating performance in the quarter improved $6 million sequentially and was $12 million better than the prior year. This improvement was primarily driven by lower consulting and legal costs along with higher prior year expenses due to the implementation of a new HR system.
Our effective adjusted tax rate was 35% in the quarter and 34% for the full year. Both the quarter and year-to-date rates were 80 basis points lower than their respective prior-year periods, primarily due to discrete tax benefits recorded in 2014. We expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be up approximately 100 basis points to 35% in 2015, which will have about a $0.05 to $0.06 negative impact on adjusted EPS for this year. We also expect a substantial majority of that impact to occur in the first quarter due to a 30% comparable adjusted tax rate.
We received $110 million of cash distributions from our StoneRiver joint venture in 2014, which are excluded from both free cash flow and adjusted EPS. The joint venture has made significant progress in effectively and profitably monetizing the businesses through disposition. As a result, our adjusted equity earnings from this investment, excluding transaction gains, is down about $0.03 per share from the prior year. We anticipate 2015 adjusted equity earnings to also be down sequentially.
We generated a record $965 million of free cash flow in 2014 and an exceptional 15% increase in free cash flow per share to $3.82. Our results were meaningfully higher than expected due to the timing of several working capital items, which positively impacted free cash flow for the year. This strong result is even more impressive when considering the 20% free cash flow per share growth in 2013. Our focus on high-quality revenue and disciplined capital allocation continues to produce excellent free cash flow per share results.
Total debt at year-end was $3.8 billion, or 2.2x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, which is well within our target leverage ratio.
We repurchased 5.4 million shares of stock in the quarter for $369 million. For the year, we returned nearly $1.2 billion to shareholders, repurchasing 18.7 million shares in 2014 at an average cost of approximately $62 per share.
We announced a new 20 million share repurchase authorization in the fourth quarter, and at year end, had 19.8 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase.
With that, let me turn the call back to Jeff."

Sales were 120% of quota for the quarter, and we attained 106% of the quota for the year. Strong results in card solutions, digital channel, lending and account processing led the way to our record 2014 performance. Actual sales were up 7% in the quarter and 12% for the year. We feel good about our sales performance and expect our momentum to continue. 
We had $89 million of integrated sales in the quarter and finished the year up 7% to $260 million. Clients have maintained a keen focus on solutions such as card solutions, bill payment, Mobiliti and Source Capture. As I mentioned upfront, results within the Open Solutions client base are very strong, nearly doubling integrated sales year-over-year.
We achieved Operational Effectiveness savings of $70 million in 2014, or 117% of our $60 million goal. Savings this year were driven by strong procurement results and Open Solutions synergies. We continue to see substantial opportunities to drive efficiency, particularly across our data center and real estate footprint. We plan to accelerate our execution this year in a manner that should provide meaningful Operational Effectiveness benefits in 2016 and beyond.
The banking sector firmed during the year. With only 7 regulatory actions in the quarter, it was down meaningfully over the last 2 years. M&A activity picked up during the year and we expect that trend to continue. We also saw some improvement in spending patterns compared to the last few years, which we believe will moderately extend to 2015. Financial institutions are focusing their technology spend on solutions that generate revenue, enhance the customer experience, deal with regulatory compliance and drive operational efficiency.
Payments are getting the majority of the industry ink right now, with areas such as Apple Pay, tokenization and systemic real-time money movement capabilities at the forefront of the discussion. We are well suited to partner with our clients in the evolving payments arena.
With that, let's move to 2015. In addition to financial guidance, we have defined 3 key enterprise priorities for the year: first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions; and third, deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiation and value for our clients.
Now let's move to 2015 financial outlook. As we accomplished in 2014, our objectives are to sustainably increase our internal revenue growth rate, expand operating margin, and turn that combination into compelling free cash flow per share.
We expect adjusted internal revenue growth of 5% to 6%, a strong step up from 4% in 2014. The wider revenue growth rate this year considers a number of performance scenarios including, among others, the level of EMV card production revenue and currency fluctuation. We also expect our growth rate to bias to the second half of the year due to the tougher comparisons in the first half of 2015 and the expected ramp of new revenue throughout the year. 
We expect adjusted earnings per share growth for the year of 11% to 14%, or a range of $3.73 to $3.83.  
We also expect that our focus on the combination of high-quality revenue and Operational Effectiveness will again translate to full year adjusted operating margin expansion of at least 50 basis points.
We estimate our free cash flow per share for 2015 to be at least $4.12, following our very strong 15% per share growth in 2014, incorporating this year's guidance results and an expected 3-year compound growth in free cash flow per share of 14%.
Our Operational Effectiveness target for 2015 is $50 million and our integrated sales target is $250 million.
Lastly, although we don't give quarterly guidance, we expect the first quarter to be our most difficult comparison for the year, given the lower tax rate in 2014's first quarter and that Q1 was, by far, our strongest revenue growth quarter last year.
In conclusion, our business model is working and we enter this year with momentum and excitement about the opportunities that lie ahead. We are very well positioned to bolster our adjusted internal revenue growth rate again for this year, expand operating margin, and deliver value for you, our shareholders, through strong cash flow generation and capital allocation. 
Lastly, let me thank the more than 21,000 associates who focus their collective energy on delivering value for clients each and every day. They truly are Fiserv's most important asset. And with that, Tony, let's open the line for questions."

And so from our standpoint, we're having lots and lots of conversations with institutions who want to take advantage of the idea and turn it into opportunities to drive value for their customers, look at opportunities to drive high-quality fee revenue and really using Popmoney and bill payment and other app transfer applications as a way to enable that kind of payments capability. So from our perspective, we see it to be positive. Ultimately, we do think that -- that real-time changes the nature of how bill payment, and P2P specifically, work today, and that will be important transaction drivers over the next 3 to 5, 7 years."

The indications that we can see are that people are now getting kind of serious about getting reissuance cycles started with debit. We think that, that will push into the second or really kind of take hold now in the second half of 2015.

It is, again, one of the topics that we're going to cover in some level of depth at Investor Day, but I would say that we do see a lot of growth in terms of the opportunity to take mobile up to a large degree against that 70 million. Now in fairness, we don't believe we'll get all 70 million because some of those 70 million are on -- on the larger Corillian platform and some of that have -- some of those institutions have adopted Mobiliti, some of them have not. But we do see a much larger opportunity to grow specifically the ASP subscriber base, which we said we're near 3 million this year. That number is still at a very low level of penetration and we expect to see meaningful growth. We actually introduced a new program late in 2014 where we're working with our bank and credit union clients to help them drive better adoption in their client base. I mean, the beauty of mobile is that consumers want it and the financial institutions want consumers to use it. And so they're really looking for ways to drive that together. So we have very strong alignment. We see that to be a very big opportunity and you will continue to hear us talk about it, and we would expect that, over time, that'll continue to accelerate for us and drive some nice recurring revenue."

This is really to focus on the 55 billion payments that happen through the non-POS side of the system. And so we're looking at how do we use data, how do we use speed, how do we integrate those capabilities into applications such as bill payment and Popmoney to allow, we think, the important convenience aspect of these -- of electronifying in a much faster way these payments. So we would see this coming in over the next 3 to 5 years. An important element of this infrastructure is creating more electronification. Obviously, paper payments are only going to move at a certain pace. So one of the things that we are looking at is how do we create a faster and faster electronification. That's one of the aspects as well. We do see this to be an important revenue opportunity, again, over time, as we've seen institutions today be able to create differentiated pricing around this. And we think that's one of the areas that institutions will use to drive new value. I would say, on the call, that's probably about as much detail as we can go into, but we will talk about this in more depth in June."

And in the Q4 quarter, we had a couple of things. One is particularly in the Financial segment. First and foremost, if you look back at our margin in the fourth quarter last year, that's the highest margin I believe we've had ever in that segment, which was a very strong comparison to this quarter. The second thing is we had timing associated with some variable comp, both incentives and commissions. We had a strong sales finish in the quarter in that particular segment. So we expensed commissions and we also had some ACEP, which is some variable comp, which we had to expense in the current quarter. And then, the other piece -- that was about 100 basis points. And then, the other piece was international, which I highlighted, which had a revenue mix. It had a very difficult comparison. Also, we've had this during the year and it also accentuated in the fourth quarter. And then, we had some increased spending in our Agiliti platform that came through in the quarter also. So all of those kind of contributed to the Q4 item. As I also highlighted on the call, our margins in that segment over the past 3 years are up about 200 basis points. Clearly, as we look forward, and you indicated, where's the margin drivers going to happen? We are, clearly, from the Payments segment standpoint, at a good place. We're executing very well there, continue to drive incremental revenue on our recurring base solutions like card and bill payment and all the rest. Regarding financial, we talked about international, which was a tough compare in the current year. And clearly, DNA is an area where we've ramped up a lot of expense and we're going to be implementing a lot of clients in 2015. And so that scale is starting to return there as we've had to put more into development and implementation. And so we're confident overall, along with our Operational Effectiveness initiatives. We are -- have a number of those we're going to be executing in '15 that will benefit us in '16 and forward.

And the opportunity for us to work with financial institutions to ensure that non-FIs don't come in and take over that space. I mean, it's, as you know, it's a highly competitive world out there and there are lots and lots of providers trying to scrape away pieces of that value chain. So we're looking to both protect that value chain but more importantly protect it by adding differentiated value. So if I lived in a non-constrained resource world, I would think that would be one of the biggest areas that I would focus on. And I think the other big opportunity out there is on the lending side of the equation. I think we're going to see, over the next, call it, 2 to 3 years, 3 to 5 years, a lot of movement on the lending side, both in terms of financial institutions looking for ways to make more money in both decisioning as well as in terms of the types of loans that are able to be made, so new -- basically through new products. So we see that to be a big opportunity. And then, thinking about how can you use the data to enhance those kinds of decisions, both in terms of origination as well as on the servicing side.

So Brett, I would say that we do see a variety of different ways in which we are driving value in the -- on the bill payment -- in the bill payment business. Some of it has to do with services, customization, so the ability to allow financial institutions to design experiences that make the most sense for their customers. I mean, one of the things that we talked about is that spend -- spend focus is really big time around customer experience. And as you know well, the traditional killer app in the digital world has been bill payment. So the ability to provide bill payment services and allow institutions to consume that the way they want is certainly one of the opportunities out there. And so we've had an opportunity to create some additional streams of revenue in that space. You've got some add-on transactional opportunities, whether it's around risk management, e-bill, those kinds of things. And then, there's another emerging category which really ties into this whole notion of systematic real-time, and that is premium transaction. So allowing financial institutions to use our capabilities on the front end, so whether they be bill payment, P2P, or account-to-account transfer, linking that to real-time and then charging consumers a reasonable fee that they can -- so that they'll avail themselves of that real-time capability when it makes sense for their own situation. So you add all those up, and we do see a time where different kinds of transactions get monetized differently. And I think we've talked about the fact that there may be some point where slower transactions are priced differently relative to the more, quote, premium or faster transactions. And so we are looking at different pricing models and different ways to make sure that we find that balance between what consumers, financial institutions and what we need. But I will say -- the only thing I would say is I don't see us moving to a license kind of a model. I see this continuing to be a cloud-based, an ASP solution, because there's a network effect that's very important. And we need to continue to build that network out so that we can have the highest percentage of electronic transactions possible, which is absolutely paramount when you talk about driving real-time transaction. So it is an evolving space for us. I'm quite excited about this evolution and believe that we are extremely well positioned to lead that over the next 3, 5, 7 years."

And it was included in the -- on an actual basis. It was included in the prior year as well. So it's an apples-to-apples comparison. I mean, the big drivers in the sales results for the year are going to be around our account processing platforms. We had some nice wins across most of our platforms in 2014 in terms of DNA, but also around Premier, Signature, Precision, Cleartouch. I mean, so we've had good success because the beauty of our product set is that we don't think there's a one-size-fits-all. We know that different institutions want different solutions. So the account processing business did well. Our lending business had a very good year, very happy with the work there. Our risk solution, our risk area had a good year as well. And in fact, everyone had a good year. Card solution did very well. We mentioned that our fourth quarter bill payment results were the highest that we've had since 2012. So really across the board. And I think it's -- it is a matter of having products that are appealing to clients on the account processing side where we have a good, strong, integrated value proposition because we're delivering products that are universally taken across the entire landscape from the largest clients through some of the smaller community banks. So that's worked out well and we expect that to continue into this year. Lastly, we don't -- we wouldn't talk about the numbers and quota, but I will say I think this is our third year in a row that we would say we've had record sales. And we're continuing to be in a place where we expect on the basis of the investments that we make, to continue to be able to drive increased sales. Part of that comes from being better with our existing clients and part of it comes from delivering some new products into the market. We indicated that we went live with our Mobiliti for business which is our commercial -- our mobile -- I'm sorry, our commercial mobile solution. And that we expect to drive across hundreds of financial institutions over the next several years. So again, it's a combination of continuing to have the best sales force and also introducing new products."

We are pleased with our strong financial results in the quarter and are on track to meet our objectives for the year. We delivered internal revenue growth of 4%, against what was by far our most difficult revenue comparison of the year. These results include a 1 percentage point drag on revenue from a combination of currency and lower termination fees in the quarter. Our continuing focus on high-quality revenue growth and operational efficiency drove an increase in adjusted operating income of 8% and a 150 basis point expansion in adjusted operating margin. Adjusted earnings per share was up 9%, despite an 8 percentage point negative tax rate impact on adjusted EPS in the quarter. Free cash flow per share was up an impressive 22% in the quarter. 
Sales were 83% in the quarter and slightly below last year's record Q1 results. We remain confident about our sales and revenue prospects for the remainder of the year. 
For the second straight year, we were recognized as one of Fortune Magazine's World's Most Admired Companies. In April, we were also named one of America's Best Employers by Forbes Magazine. In both cases, we were the only one of our core competitors to be recognized, which we believe is a reflection of our cultural focus on delivering superior value for our clients, associates and shareholders. 
We identified 3 key enterprise priorities for 2015 in our last call, which we will update you on each quarter. The priorities are: First, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitment. Second, build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on Payment and Channel Solutions; and third, to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiation and value for our clients. 
As I mentioned, internal revenue growth was 4% in the quarter compared to 6% in last year's Q1, led by strong performance in a number of our recurring revenue businesses. Growth was strong across several areas in the quarter, such as card services, digital solutions, including Mobiliti ASP, and account processing. 
We continue to focus on building high-quality recurring revenue, which should lead to an increase in our internal revenue growth rate again this year. This targeted growth profile also helps fuel our objective to sustainably grow operating margin, which for this year is targeted to expand by at least 100 -- by at least 50 basis points. In the quarter, adjusted operating margin increased 150 basis points. 
Free cash flow per share was up a very strong 22% in the quarter, reflecting the results of our attractive business model, combined with the benefit of consistent disciplined capital allocation. Overall, we are on track to deliver on each of our financial commitments for the year. 
Our second priority is to build and extend client relationships and we did just that in the quarter. We recently announced that Vibrant credit union, with assets in excess of $500 million, selected the DNA account processing platform, along with a number of Fiserv integrated solutions to help them deliver a unique experience to each of their 41,000 members. 4 new DNA clients went live in the quarter. We expect to more than double the number of new DNA institutions that go live this year as compared to 2014. 
Our core account processing growth opportunities extend well beyond DNA as our account processing offerings meet the needs of a diverse end market. During the quarter, a top 40 bank selected our Signature account processing platform, along with a full suite of our market-leading products, such as item processing, electronic bill payment, Popmoney, debit processing and the ACCEL network. We are excited about the opportunity to provide this new client a uniquely differentiated experience when they go live next year. 
Digital solutions and mobile in particular, continue to be a high priority for the market. We added to our Mobiliti consumer business 36 new clients in the quarter. Late last year, we began implementing programs to help our clients drive higher levels of mobile adoption, which contributed to even stronger growth in Mobiliti ASP subscribers in Q1. 
Mobile usage also tends to enable a variety of value add opportunities, such as real-time payments and deposits, mobile capture and Snap to Pay. 
As you may recall, our Mobiliti Business solution went live in the fourth quarter of last year. Through the end of Q1, we've already signed 8% of the business banking client base to this important new solution. Although only a handful of clients are currently live, we expect this strategic product to drive value for some of our clients' most profitable customers and an attractive recurring revenue stream for us. 
We just wrapped our Springform client event, where we hosted nearly 4000 people, representing a broad range of financial institutions, billers, lenders and other purveyors of financial products. At forum, we provided update on our market-leading solutions and latest innovations from across the company. Our solutions center was highly trafficked with more than 2000 unique visits to different product areas, including the NOW network, digital solutions, real-time payments, lending, building, EMV and investment services. We are pleased with the early returns from forum and look forward to our next event coming in the fall. 
Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiation in value for our clients. While we expect to cover several of these opportunities in depth at our Investor Day, some highlights for the quarter include a new unique agreement with Morgan Stanley to jointly provide a global turnkey asset management platform for financial institutions outside the U.S. Our market-leading managed account technology solution, which now supports multicurrency, portfolio accounting, model management and trading, will be combined with the breadth and expertise of Morgan Stanley to create differentiated value and an attractive source of brand new growth. We're excited about this opportunity and expect to go live in early 2016. 
We're gaining traction in abetting our real-time payment capabilities into CheckFree RXP and Popmoney. Real-time transactions were up 54% in the quarter, which has a dual benefit of meeting critical customer need while delivering high-quality fee revenue for our clients. We also advanced our new real-time deposit capability in the quarter. This newer use case allows consumer faster, guaranteed access to their funds and drives fee revenue for our clients. These real-time opportunities, which are generally enabled by the NOW network, are a strong link to changing consumer expectations. 
Interest for Agiliti, our U.K. cloud-based account processing solution, expanded once again in the quarter. The far-reaching demand has moved from being core based to include several key add-on solutions, such as card processing, digital capabilities and risk. We continue to build out our integrated platform and expect to go live later this year. 
Last, we continue our focus on EMV. The number in level of client conversations remains elevated and we've increased our capacity to deliver against the anticipated market demand. And while debit EMV card issuance continues to lack credit, we expect to see a ramp in the second half of the year and expect that to continue over the next several years. With that, let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail on our results."
128209,290122654,804337,"Fiserv, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone.

Internal revenue growth was 4% and adjusted revenue was up to $1.2 billion in the quarter, against our toughest compare of the year. This performance was even stronger below the surface, given the negative currency impact along with lower termination fees, which together, push our growth rate down by 1 percentage point. 
Growth in our card processing, digital channels, including Mobiliti, account processing and risk solutions led our performance in the quarter. This high-quality revenue growth and the continued focus on operational efficiency drove an 8% increase in adjusted operating income to $371 million and an impressive 150 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin. 
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.89, increasing 9% over last year. Our adjusted EPS in the quarter was negatively impacted by about $0.07 or 8 percentage points of growth from this year's much higher comparable tax rate due to significant discrete tax benefits in last year's first quarter. 
Moving onto the segment results. Our Payments segment adjusted revenue all internal, was up 4% to $613 million compared to one of our strongest growth quarters in the past several years. Growth was led by our card processing and digital channels businesses and was partially offset by the anniversary impact of some larger bill payment client implementations and biller headwinds. 
We believe the Payments segment revenue growth in the quarter will be the low watermark of the year, as biller headwinds ease at the end of the second quarter, ongoing conversion of the Mobiliti backlog, Output Solutions revenue acceleration and the early revenue benefit of EMV. For reference, we continue to expect that the majority of the EMV-related revenue will buy us later in the year. 
Debit transaction growth was a very strong 12% in the quarter, driven by the dual benefit of growing card usage and strong sales. Mobiliti growth was excellent as backlog grew and ASP subscribers increased 65% year-over-year to more than 3.2 million. 
Bill payment transaction growth remained in the low single digits and P2P transactions grew 30% in the quarter. Our focus on delivering value-added services in these solutions closely aligned -- aligns with the industry's focus on faster payments. Real-time transactions were up more than 50% in the quarter. 
Payments segment adjusted operating income grew 6% to $191 million and operating margin expanded 60 basis points. This solid performance includes the offsetting negative impact of additional investments in several areas, including Biller Solutions and expanding our EMV capabilities. 
Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment was up 3% to $594 million. Performance was solid in our recurring revenue businesses, including account processing and lending, notwithstanding the more than 1% negative revenue growth impact from currency and lower termination fees. 
Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was up 10% to $204 million. This very strong performance translated to a 220 basis point increase in segment adjusted operating margin for the quarter. These results were driven by high-quality revenue growth in our account processing businesses and the positive impact from our operational efficiency programs. 
The corporate segment generated an operating loss of $24 million, which is in line with last year's results. Our effective adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 35%, up sharply compared to the prior year, but in line with our full year expectations. Last year's tax rate of 30% benefited from significant discrete tax benefits. 
Free cash flow per share is one of our most important performance metrics. Free cash flow in the quarter was up significantly to $268 million and up an even stronger 22% on a per share basis to $1.10. Strong operating earnings growth and working capital improvements drove the excellent quarterly results. 
Total debt at quarter end was $3.9 billion or 2.2x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, well within our target leverage ratio. We allocated $290 million to share repurchase in the quarter, buying 3.8 million shares at an average cost of $75 per share. There were 60 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase at quarter's end. With that, let me turn the call back over to Jeff."

We had several high-profile wins in the quarter, which demonstrate the power of both our integrated value proposition and the innovation that we are supplying to the dynamic market. For the full year, we expect actual sales value to be up roughly 10% compared to last year's record level. 
Integrated sales were $44 million or 18% of our full year goal. During the quarter, we also passed through the $900 million mark for accumulative integrated sales in the second phase of our program, which we launched in 2010. We expect to surpass our 5-year program goal of $950 million of total integrated sales in the second quarter. 
We are on track with our Operational Effectiveness goals, achieving $13 million in the quarter and are making good progress against our infrastructure consolidation this year. For example, we expect to complete our  building project and consolidate a number of our Atlanta-based facilities and over 2000 associates in the fourth quarter of this year. Not only do we expect increased associate engagement and enhanced client interaction, we also expect to see meaningful Operational Effectiveness benefits in 2016 and beyond. 
There were only 5 regulatory actions in the quarter, which was consistent with last year's level. While at forum, we had the opportunity to hear directly from our clients about their priorities and technology focus. Tone continues to moderately improve and strategic conversations tend to center on building revenue, delivering digital capabilities, faster payments and a focus on differentiated customer experiences. 
Overall, we are on track to achieve our objectives for the year. We continue to expect internal revenue growth of 5% to 6% and adjusted earnings per share of $3.73 to $3.83, a range of 11% to 14% growth for the year. We also expect internal revenue growth to further accelerate in the second half of the year as more of our sales and related revenue come online. We expect full year adjusted operating margin to expand at least 50 basis points and importantly, that free cash flow per share will be at least $4.12 for the year. 
In conclusion, we are pleased with our strong start to the year. We're on track to meet our financial and strategic commitments, which include recording an increase in the rate of internal revenue growth for the third consecutive year. These results and the third-party recognition I mentioned upfront are a strong testament to the focus and dedication of our more than 21,000 associates, who drive value for our clients each and everyday. With that, Mary, let's open the line for questions."

As Tom mentioned, the pipeline is at its fullest level ever. And we are seeing a lot more interest from larger institutions, frankly, those institutions that would not be having the conversations with us but for the fact that we have this modern technology platform. Again, when we acquired Open Solutions, we anticipated a number of benefits we had not anticipated the fact that the world would change so dramatically since January of 2013, that real-time would become so critical, along with the processing and data capability of that platform. So we're involved in a number of larger transactions. Now the negative is larger transactions tend to have long sales cycle. But we're excited to be in there. And frankly, another of the benefits is, as you know, we have a lot of very strong relationships with large financial institutions that tend to be based in our payments, technologies or -- and/or our channels technologies, our risk technologies.

So we've got a number of over 5000 account processing clients.

Within that category, we're always looking for how can we be more efficient part to be able to margin but frankly part of that is to ensure that we are able to continue investing in our products in a meaningful way. The other big piece of margin expansion, frankly, is on the Operational Effectiveness that we have been executing really fairly well since 2007. Most of that work has not touched our infrastructure today. We've done -- we've had a small numbers of data centers to be consolidated. We've done allocation here and there. We're now focused on making sure that we are able to leverage the company that we built over -- for the last 3 to 5, 7 years. And Tom and I both talked about the fact that we're doing these infrastructure consolidations. So we're doing more on the data center for. We're doing more in looking for ways to bring people together to create better communities of effort around our clients. And then lastly, we are also continuing to focus on what are the right ways for us to get the best leverage across our labor bases. We're pretty spread out. We still have lots of opportunities to create value there. So those are the 3 areas that we're really focused on right now from an Operational Effectiveness. Combined with the scale, that really gives us a high degree of confidence that we're going to be able to continue to expand margin consistent with our long-term guidance in the foreseeable future. Lastly, I would say that you'll see us spend a fair amount of energy on this at Investor Day to be able to provide confidence for the next several years if that will continue, not just for us, but for also for you, our owners."

So we will definitely spend more time on it. But the point that we were trying to make earlier, just as it relates to margin number is as you know, we were -- we've been investing in this for a number of years. We're now at the point where were -- we've hit the tipping point and we would expect it to be fairly, fairly positive for us from now over the next several years."

We're now starting to bring in some of our next tier higher value -- higher integration value products and so we are -- we remain very confident that we're going to hit or frankly exceed the revenue synergy numbers that we talked about when we acquired -- when we acquired Open. The beginning question is an interesting question because from a sales innings perspective, we're probably somewhere in the middle innings in terms of aggregate values sold. In terms of the revenue recognized on that, I would say we are in the very early stages of the ballgame. I have a lot of runway left to had. Some of that is because of implementation cues. Some of that is because we've signed contracts that don't expire for, whether agreements and expire for a number of time. But again, that's one of the things that gives us confidence, not just into the second half of this year, but frankly, on our exit run rate. So it's pretty early on that opportunity."

So I think about real-time on several levels, but you've got  solutions, such as DNA, which, I think of a little bit more file drawer. And we're creating this real-time capability that allows for a lot of optionality to put the files in that drawer, which are the real-time applications. So it could be deposits, it could be data management, it could be payments, any of those different opportunities. And we're going to see that both in real-time core. But the mandate is coming much more of how consumers are accessing those technologies or how business owners are accessing those technologies through Mobiliti and online and the like. And we're in the enviable position of having both the income processing or the core platform as well as the channels platforms, which we have a very long legacy on the online side that we're now complementing on the mobile side. That, however, is only part of the opportunity. Frankly, I am at least, if not more, excited about the second part of the opportunity, and that is, that today, because of the solutions that we have in the market, be it the CheckFree RXP solution or the Popmoney, ACH solutions, we have rails today, which are slower rails but are moving many, many, many millions and millions and billions of transactions. And what we're seeing is financial institutions get quite excited about the opportunity to provide real-time capabilities, payments and deposits. We mentioned that in our prepared remarks. Real-time deposit credit is another intriguing opportunity, where institutions can create small fees that make sense to the consumer and make sense to them. So they can create a little bit of fee revenue, consumers can get what they want from a time to move or speed to move perspective. And because we're the enabling party, we're getting that as well. And my belief is that we're going to see some meaningful percentage take bill pay, where we got roughly 1.5 billion transactions a year. Some meaningful percentage of those have the propensity to go on a real-time basis. And that will create real value, not just in terms of growing the transactions, but on RevPAR trend basis, that can be very, very impactful to our model over time. So it's a little bit of a long winded answer. You can be sure were going to talk about this in Investor Day. But it's a very, very important opportunity. And it's a place where the interest of consumers or users, whether they be retail or business, financial institution, whether that be a bank, credit union, on that and there, a bitter, whatever it is, and our interest all intersect at this point of real-time."

We are pleased with our strong financial results in the quarter and are on track to meet our objectives for the year.

We are pleased with our strong financial results in the quarter and are on track to meet our objectives for the year. We delivered internal revenue growth of 4%, against what was, by far, our most difficult revenue comparison of the year. These results include a 1 percentage point drag on revenue from a combination of currency and lower termination fees in the quarter. Our continuing focus on high-quality revenue growth and operational efficiency drove an increase in adjusted operating income of 8% and a 150-basis-point expansion in adjusted operating margin. Adjusted earnings per share was up 9% despite an 8 percentage point negative tax rate impact on adjusted EPS in the quarter. Free cash flow per share was up an impressive 22% in the quarter. 
Sales were 83% of quota in the quarter and slightly below last year's record Q1 results. We remain confident about our sales and revenue prospects for the remainder of the year. 
For the second straight year, we were recognized as one of Fortune Magazine's World's Most Admired Companies. In April, we were also named one of America's Best Employers by Forbes Magazine. In both cases, we were the only one of our core competitors to be recognized, which we believe is a reflection of our cultural focus on delivering superior value for our clients, associates and shareholders. 
We identified 3 key enterprise priorities for 2015 in our last call, which we will update you on each quarter. That priorities are: first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on Payment and Channel Solutions; and third, to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiation and value for our clients. 
As I mentioned, internal revenue growth was 4% in the quarter compared to 6% in last year's Q1, led by very strong performance in a number of our recurring revenue businesses. Growth was strong across several areas in the quarter, such as card services, digital solutions, including Mobiliti ASP, and account processing. 
We continue to focus on building high-quality recurring revenue, which should lead to an increase in our internal revenue growth rate again this year. This targeted growth profile also helps fuel our objective to sustainably grow operating margin which, for this year, is targeted to expand by at least 100 -- by at least 50 basis points. In the quarter, adjusted operating margin increased 150 basis points. 
Free cash flow per share was up a very strong 22% in the quarter, reflecting the results of our attractive business model combined with the benefit of consistent disciplined capital allocation. Overall, we are on track to deliver on each of our financial commitments for the year. 
Our second priority is to build and extend client relationships, and we did just that in the quarter. We recently announced that Vibrant credit union, with assets in excess of $500 million, selected the DNA account processing platform, along with a number of Fiserv integrated solutions to help them deliver a unique experience to each of their 41,000 members. 4 new DNA clients went live in the quarter. We expect to more than double the number of new DNA institutions that go live this year as compared to 2014. 
Our core account processing growth opportunities extend well beyond DNA as our account processing offerings meet the needs of a diverse end market. During the quarter, a top 40 bank selected our Signature account processing platform, along with a full suite of our market-leading products, such as item processing, electronic bill payment, Popmoney, debit processing and the ACCEL network. We are excited about the opportunity to provide this new client a uniquely differentiated experience when they go live next year. 
Digital solutions and mobile in particular continue to be a high priority for the market. We added to our Mobiliti consumer business signing 36 new clients in the quarter. Late last year, we began implementing programs to help our clients drive higher levels of mobile adoption, which contributed to even stronger growth in Mobiliti ASP subscribers in Q1. 
Mobile usage also tends to enable a variety of value-add opportunities, such as real-time payments and deposits, mobile capture and Snap to Pay. 
As you may recall, our Mobiliti Business solution went live in the fourth quarter of last year. Through the end of Q1, we've already signed 8% of the business banking client base to this important new solution. Although only a handful of clients are currently live, we expect this strategic product to drive value for some of our clients' most profitable customers and an attractive recurring revenue stream for us. 
We just wrapped our Spring forum client event, where we hosted nearly 4,000 people, representing a broad range of financial institutions, billers, lenders and other purveyors of financial products. At forum, we provided updates on our market-leading solutions and latest innovations from across the company. Our solutions center was highly trafficked with more than 2,000 unique visits to different product areas, including the NOW network, digital solutions, real-time payments, lending, billing, EMV and investment services. We are pleased with the early returns from forum and look forward to our next event coming in the fall. 
Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiation in value for our clients. While we expect to cover several of these opportunities in depth at our Investor Day, some highlights for the quarter include a new unique agreement with Morgan Stanley to jointly provide a global turnkey asset management platform for financial institutions outside the U.S. Our market-leading managed account technology solution, which now supports multicurrency, portfolio accounting, model management and trading, will be combined with the breadth and expertise of Morgan Stanley to create differentiated value and an attractive source of brand new growth. We're excited about this opportunity and expect to go live in early 2016. 
We're gaining traction in embedding our real-time payment capabilities into CheckFree RXP and Popmoney. Real-time transactions were up 54% in the quarter, which has a dual benefit of meeting a critical customer need while delivering high-quality fee revenue for our clients. We also advanced our new real-time deposit capability in the quarter. This newer use case allows consumers faster, guaranteed access to their funds and drives fee revenue for our clients. These real-time opportunities, which are generally enabled by the NOW network, are a strong link to changing consumer expectations. 
Interest for Agiliti, our U.K. cloud-based account processing solution, expanded once again in the quarter. The far-reaching demand has moved from being core-based to include several key add-on solutions, such as card processing, digital capabilities and risk. We continue to build out our integrated platform and expect to go live later this year. 
Last, we continued our focus on EMV. The number in level of client conversations remains elevated and we've increased our capacity to deliver against the anticipated market demand. And while debit EMV card issuance continues to lack credit, we expect to see a ramp in the second half of the year and expect that to continue over the next several years. With that, let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail on our results."
128209,290122654,804562,"Fiserv, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Internal revenue growth was 4% and adjusted revenue was up to $1.2 billion in the quarter, against our toughest compare of the year. This performance was even stronger below the surface, given the negative curre",679,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Internal revenue growth was 4% and adjusted revenue was up to $1.2 billion in the quarter, against our toughest compare of the year. This performance was even stronger below the surface, given the negative currency impact along with lower termination fees which, together, push our growth rate down by 1 percentage point. 
Growth in our card processing, digital channels, including Mobiliti, account processing and risk solutions led our performance in the quarter. This high-quality revenue growth and a continued focus on operational efficiency drove an 8% increase in adjusted operating income to $371 million and an impressive 150 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin. 
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.89, increasing 9% over last year. Our adjusted EPS in the quarter was negatively impacted by about $0.07 or 8 percentage points of growth from this year's much higher comparable tax rate due to significant discrete tax benefits in last year's first quarter. 
Moving onto the segment results. Our Payments segment adjusted revenue, all internal, was up 4% to $613 million compared to one of our strongest growth quarters in the past several years. Growth was led by our card processing and digital channels businesses and was partially offset by the anniversary impact of some larger bill payment client implementations and biller headwinds. 
We believe the Payments segment revenue growth in the quarter will be the low watermark of the year as biller headwinds ease at the end of the second quarter, ongoing conversion of the Mobiliti backlog, Output Solutions revenue acceleration and the early revenue benefit of EMV. For reference, we continue to expect that the majority of the EMV-related revenue will bias to later in the year. 
Debit transaction growth was a very strong 12% in the quarter, driven by the dual benefit of growing card usage and strong sales. Mobiliti growth was excellent as backlog grew and ASP subscribers increased 65% year-over-year to more than 3.2 million. 
Bill payment transaction growth remained in the low single digits and P2P transactions grew 30% in the quarter. Our focus on delivering value-added services in these solutions closely aligned -- aligns with the industry's focus on faster payments. Real-time transactions were up more than 50% in the quarter. 
Payments segment adjusted operating income grew 6% to $191 million and operating margin expanded 60 basis points. This solid performance includes the offsetting negative impact of additional investments in several areas, including Biller Solutions and expanding our EMV capabilities. 
Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment was up 3% to $594 million. Performance was solid in our recurring revenue businesses, including account processing and lending, notwithstanding the more than 1% negative revenue growth impact from currency and lower termination fees. 
Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was up 10% to $204 million. This very strong performance translated to a 220-basis-point increase in segment adjusted operating margin for the quarter. These results were driven by high-quality revenue growth in our account processing businesses and the positive impact from our operational efficiency programs. 
The corporate segment generated an operating loss of $24 million, which is in line with last year's results. Our effective adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 35%, up sharply compared to the prior year, but in line with our full year expectations. Last year's tax rate of 30% benefited from significant discrete tax benefits. 
Free cash flow per share is one of our most important performance metrics. Free cash flow in the quarter was up significantly to $268 million and up an even stronger 22% on a per share basis to $1.10. Strong operating earnings growth and working capital improvements drove the excellent quarterly results. 
Total debt at quarter end was $3.9 billion or 2.2x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, well within our target leverage ratio. We allocated $290 million to share repurchase in the quarter, buying 3.8 million shares at an average cost of $75 per share. There were 16 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase at quarter's end. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Jeff."

These results were slightly off last year's exceptional Q1 results, but generally consistent with expectations coming off our very strong Q4 finish. We had several high-profile wins in the quarter, which demonstrate the power of both our integrated value proposition and the innovation that we are supplying to the dynamic market. For the full year, we expect actual sales value to be up roughly 10% compared to last year's record level. 
Integrated sales were $44 million or 18% of our full year goal. During the quarter, we also passed through the $900 million mark for cumulative integrated sales in the second phase of our program, which we launched in 2010. We expect to surpass our 5-year program goal of $950 million of total integrated sales in the second quarter. 
We're on track with our Operational Effectiveness goals, achieving $13 million in the quarter and are making good progress against our infrastructure consolidation this year. For example, we expect to complete our Alpharetta building project and consolidate a number of our Atlanta-based facilities and over 2,000 associates in the fourth quarter of this year. Not only do we expect increased associate engagement and enhanced client interaction, we also expect to see meaningful Operational Effectiveness benefits in 2016 and beyond. 
There were only 5 regulatory actions in the quarter, which was consistent with last year's level. While at forum, we had the opportunity to hear directly from our clients about their priorities and technology focus. Tone continues to moderately improve and strategic conversations tend to center on building revenue, delivering digital capabilities, faster payments and a focus on differentiated customer experiences. 
Overall, we are on track to achieve our objectives for the year. We continue to expect internal revenue growth of 5% to 6% and adjusted earnings per share of $3.73 to $3.83, a range of 11% to 14% growth for the year. We also expect internal revenue growth to further accelerate in the second half of the year as more of our sales and related revenue come online. We expect full year adjusted operating margin to expand at least 50 basis points and, importantly, that free cash flow per share will be at least $4.12 for the year. 
In conclusion, we are pleased with our strong start to the year. We're on track to meet our financial and strategic commitments, which include recording an increase in the rate of internal revenue growth for the third consecutive year. These results and the third-party recognition I mentioned upfront are a strong testament to the focus and dedication of our more than 21,000 associates who drive value for our clients each and everyday. With that, Mary, let's open the line for questions."

As Tom mentioned, the pipeline is at its fullest level ever. And we are seeing a lot more interest from larger institutions, frankly, those institutions that would not be having the conversations with us, but for the fact that we have this modern technology platform. Again, when we acquired Open Solutions, we anticipated a number of benefits. Frankly, we had not anticipated the fact that the world would change so dramatically since January of 2013 that real-time would become so critical, along with the processing and data capability of that platform. So we're involved in a number of larger transactions. Now the negative, to the extent there is one, is those larger transactions tend to have long sales cycles. But we're excited to be in there. And frankly, another of the benefits is, as you know, we have a lot of very strong relationships with large financial institutions that tend to be based in our payments, technologies or -- and/or our channels technologies, our risk technologies.

It comes from scaling, either scaling new product investments or being additive to existing solutions that are already scaled. So that's 1 category. Within that category, we're always looking for how can we be more efficient part to be able to expand margin, but frankly part of that is to ensure that we're able to continue to invest in our products in a meaningful way. The other big piece of margin expansion, frankly, is on the Operational Effectiveness that we have been executing really fairly well since 2007. Most of that work has not touched our infrastructure today. We've done -- we've had small numbers of data centers to be consolidated. We've done a location here or there. We're now focused on making sure that we are able to leverage the company that we built over  the last -- for the last 3 to 5, 7 years. And Tom and I both talked about the fact that we're doing these infrastructure consolidations. So we're doing more on the data center front. We're doing more in looking for ways to bring people together to create better communities of effort around our clients. And then lastly, we're also continuing to focus on what are the right ways for us to get the best leverage across our labor bases. We're pretty spread out. We still have lots of opportunities to create value there. So those are the 3 areas that we're really focused on right now from an Operational Effectiveness. Combined with the scale, that really gives us a high degree of confidence that we're going to be able to continue to expand margin consistent with our long-term guidance in the foreseeable future. Lastly, I would say that you'll see us spend a fair amount of energy on this at Investor Day to be able to provide confidence for the next several years that, that will continue, not just for us, but for also for you, our owners."

We're now starting to bring in some of our next tier higher value -- higher integration value products. And so we are -- we remain very confident that we're going to hit or frankly exceed the revenue synergy numbers that we talked about when we acquired -- when we acquired Open. The beginning question is an interesting question because from a sales inning perspective, we're probably somewhere in the middle innings in terms of aggregate values sold. In terms of the revenue recognized on that, I would say we're in the very early stages of the ballgame and have a lot of runway left ahead. Some of that is because of implementation cues. Some of it is we've signed contracts that don't expire for -- where they have competitive agreements that don't expire for a period of time. But again, that's one of the things that gives us confidence, not just into the second half of this year, but frankly, on our exit run rate. So it's pretty early on that opportunity."

So I think about real-time on several levels, but you've got solutions, such as DNA, which I think of a little bit more as a file drawer. And we're creating this real-time capability that allows for a lot of optionality to put files in that drawer, which are the real-time applications. So it could be deposits, it could be data management, it could be payments, any of those different opportunities. And we're going to see that both in real-time core. But the mandate is coming much more off of how consumers are accessing those technologies or frankly how business owners are accessing those technologies through Mobiliti and online and the like. And we're in the enviable position of having both the account processing or the core platform as well as the channels platforms, which we have a very long legacy on the online side that we're now complementing on the mobile side. That, however, is only part of the opportunity. Frankly, I am at least, if not more, excited about the second part of the opportunity, and that is, that today, because of the solutions that we have in the market, be it the CheckFree RXP solution or Popmoney, ACH solutions, we have rails today, which are slower rails but are moving many, many, many millions and millions and billions of transactions. And what we're seeing is financial institutions get quite excited about the opportunity to provide real-time capabilities, payments and deposits. We mentioned that in our prepared remarks. Real-time deposit credit is another intriguing opportunity, where institutions can create small fees that make sense to the consumer and make sense to them. So they can create a little bit of fee revenue, consumers can get what they want from a time to move or speed to move perspective. And because we're the enabling party, we're getting that as well. And my belief is that we're going to see some meaningful percentage, take bill pay, where we've got roughly 1.5 billion transactions a year. Some meaningful percentage of those have the propensity to go on a real-time basis. And that will create real value, not just in terms of growing the transactions, but on a RevPAR trend basis, that could be very, very impactful to our model over time. So it's a little bit of a long-winded answer. You can be sure we're going to talk about this at Investor Day. But it's a very, very important opportunity. And uniquely it's a place where the interest of consumers or users, whether they be retail or business, the financial institution, whether that be a bank, a credit union, a lender, a biller, whoever it is, and our interests all intersect at this point in real-time."

We are pleased with our strong financial results in the quarter and are on track to meet our objectives for the year. We delivered internal revenue growth of 4% against what was, by far, our most difficult revenue comparison of the year. These results include a 1 percentage point drag on revenue from a combination of currency and lower termination fees in the quarter. Our continuing focus on high-quality revenue growth and operational efficiency drove an increase in adjusted operating income of 8% and a 150-basis-point expansion in adjusted operating margin. Adjusted earnings per share was up 9% despite an 8 percentage point negative tax rate impact on adjusted EPS in the quarter. Free cash flow per share was up an impressive 22% in the quarter. 
Sales were 83% of quota in the quarter and slightly below last year's record Q1 results. We remain confident about our sales and revenue prospects for the remainder of the year. 
For the second straight year, we were recognized as one of Fortune Magazine's World's Most Admired Companies. In April, we were also named one of America's Best Employers by Forbes Magazine. In both cases, we were the only one of our core competitors to be recognized, which we believe is a reflection of our cultural focus on delivering superior value for our clients, associates and shareholders. 
We identified 3 key enterprise priorities for 2015 in our last call, which we will update you on each quarter. The priorities are: first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on Payment and Channel Solutions; and third, to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiation and value for our clients. 
As I mentioned, internal revenue growth was 4% in the quarter compared to 6% in last year's Q1, led by very strong performance in a number of our recurring revenue businesses. Growth was strong across several areas in the quarter, such as card services, digital solutions, including Mobiliti ASP, and account processing. 
We continue to focus on building high-quality recurring revenue, which should lead to an increase in our internal revenue growth rate again this year. This targeted growth profile also helps fuel our objective to sustainably grow operating margin which, for this year, is targeted to expand by at least 100 -- by at least 50 basis points. In the quarter, adjusted operating margin increased 150 basis points. 
Free cash flow per share was up a very strong 22% in the quarter, reflecting the results of our attractive business model combined with the benefit of consistent disciplined capital allocation. Overall, we are on track to deliver on each of our financial commitments for the year. 
Our second priority is to build and extend client relationships, and we did just that in the quarter. We recently announced that Vibrant Credit Union, with assets in excess of $500 million, selected the DNA account processing platform, along with a number of Fiserv integrated solutions to help them deliver a unique experience to each of their 41,000 members. 4 new DNA clients went live in the quarter. We expect to more than double the number of new DNA institutions that go live this year as compared to 2014. 
Our core account processing growth opportunities extend well beyond DNA as our account processing offerings meet the needs of a diverse end market. During the quarter, a top 40 bank selected our Signature account processing platform, along with a full suite of our market-leading products, such as item processing, electronic bill payment, Popmoney, debit processing and the ACCEL network. We are excited about the opportunity to provide this new client a uniquely differentiated experience when they go live next year. 
Digital solutions and mobile in particular continue to be a high priority for the market. We added to our Mobiliti consumer business signing 36 new clients in the quarter. Late last year, we began implementing programs to help our clients drive higher levels of mobile adoption, which contributed to even stronger growth in Mobiliti ASP subscribers in Q1. 
Mobile usage also tends to enable a variety of value-add opportunities, such as real-time payments and deposits, mobile capture and Snap to Pay. 
As you may recall, our Mobiliti Business solution went live in the fourth quarter of last year. Through the end of Q1, we've already signed 8% of the business banking client base to this important new solution. Although only a handful of clients are currently live, we expect this strategic product to drive value for some of our clients' most profitable customers and an attractive recurring revenue stream for us. 
We just wrapped our Spring forum client event, where we hosted nearly 4,000 people, representing a broad range of financial institutions, billers, lenders and other purveyors of financial products. At forum, we provided updates on our market-leading solutions and latest innovations from across the company. Our solutions center was highly trafficked with more than 2,000 unique visits to different product areas, including the NOW network, digital solutions, real-time payments, lending, billing, EMV and investment services. We are pleased with the early returns from forum and look forward to our next event coming in the fall. 
Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiation in value for our clients. While we expect to cover several of these opportunities in depth at our Investor Day, some highlights for the quarter include a new unique agreement with Morgan Stanley to jointly provide a global turnkey asset management platform for financial institutions outside the U.S. Our market-leading managed account technology solution, which now supports multicurrency, portfolio accounting, model management and trading, will be combined with the breadth and expertise of Morgan Stanley to create differentiated value and an attractive source of brand new growth. We're excited about this opportunity and expect to go live in early 2016. 
We're gaining traction in embedding our real-time payment capabilities into CheckFree RXP and Popmoney. Real-time transactions were up 54% in the quarter, which has a dual benefit of meeting a critical customer need while delivering high-quality fee revenue for our clients. We also advanced our new real-time deposit capability in the quarter. This newer use case allows consumers faster, guaranteed access to their funds and drives fee revenue for our clients. These real-time opportunities, which are generally enabled by the NOW network, are a strong link to changing consumer expectations. 
Interest for Agiliti, our U.K. cloud-based account processing solution, expanded once again in the quarter. The far-reaching demand has moved from being core-based to include several key add-on solutions, such as card processing, digital capabilities and risk. We continue to build out our integrated platform and expect to go live later this year. 
Last, we continued our focus on EMV. The number and level of client conversations remains elevated and we've increased our capacity to deliver against the anticipated market demand. And while debit EMV card issuance continues to lack credit, we expect to see a ramp in the second half of the year and expect that to continue over the next several years. With that, let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail on our results."
128209,290122654,804628,"Fiserv, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone.

Internal revenue growth was 4% and adjusted revenue was up to $1.2 billion in the quarter, against our toughest compare of the year. This performance was even stronger below the surface, given the negative currency impact along with lower termination fees which, together, push our growth rate down by 1 percentage point. 
Growth in our card processing, digital channels, including Mobiliti, account processing and risk solutions led our performance in the quarter. This high-quality revenue growth and a continued focus on operational efficiency drove an 8% increase in adjusted operating income to $371 million and an impressive 150 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin. 
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.89, increasing 9% over last year. Our adjusted EPS in the quarter was negatively impacted by about $0.07 or 8 percentage points of growth from this year's much higher comparable tax rate due to significant discrete tax benefits in last year's first quarter. 
Moving onto the segment results. Our Payments segment adjusted revenue, all internal, was up 4% to $613 million compared to one of our strongest growth quarters in the past several years. Growth was led by our card processing and digital channels businesses and was partially offset by the anniversary impact of some larger bill payment client implementations and biller headwinds. 
We believe the Payments segment revenue growth in the quarter will be the low watermark of the year as biller headwinds ease at the end of the second quarter, ongoing conversion of the Mobiliti backlog, Output Solutions revenue acceleration and the early revenue benefit of EMV. For reference, we continue to expect that the majority of the EMV-related revenue will bias to later in the year. 
Debit transaction growth was a very strong 12% in the quarter, driven by the dual benefit of growing card usage and strong sales. Mobiliti growth was excellent as backlog grew and ASP subscribers increased 65% year-over-year to more than 3.2 million. 
Bill payment transaction growth remained in the low single digits and P2P transactions grew 30% in the quarter. Our focus on delivering value-added services in these solutions closely aligned -- aligns with the industry's focus on faster payments. Real-time transactions were up more than 50% in the quarter. 
Payments segment adjusted operating income grew 6% to $191 million and operating margin expanded 60 basis points. This solid performance includes the offsetting negative impact of additional investments in several areas, including Biller Solutions and expanding our EMV capabilities. 
Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment was up 3% to $594 million. Performance was solid in our recurring revenue businesses, including account processing and lending, notwithstanding the more than 1% negative revenue growth impact from currency and lower termination fees. 
Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was up 10% to $204 million. This very strong performance translated to a 220-basis-point increase in segment adjusted operating margin for the quarter. These results were driven by high-quality revenue growth in our account processing businesses and the positive impact from our operational efficiency programs. 
The corporate segment generated an operating loss of $24 million, which is in line with last year's results. Our effective adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 35%, up sharply compared to the prior year, but in line with our full year expectations. Last year's tax rate of 30% benefited from significant discrete tax benefits. 
Free cash flow per share is one of our most important performance metrics. Free cash flow in the quarter was up significantly to $268 million and up an even stronger 22% on a per share basis to $1.10. Strong operating earnings growth and working capital improvements drove the excellent quarterly results. 
Total debt at quarter end was $3.9 billion or 2.2x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, well within our target leverage ratio. We allocated $290 million to share repurchase in the quarter, buying 3.8 million shares at an average cost of $75 per share. There were 16 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase at quarter's end. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Jeff."

These results were slightly off last year's exceptional Q1 results, but generally consistent with expectations coming off our very strong Q4 finish. We had several high-profile wins in the quarter, which demonstrate the power of both our integrated value proposition and the innovation that we are supplying to the dynamic market. For the full year, we expect actual sales value to be up roughly 10% compared to last year's record level. 
Integrated sales were $44 million or 18% of our full year goal. During the quarter, we also passed through the $900 million mark for cumulative integrated sales in the second phase of our program, which we launched in 2010. We expect to surpass our 5-year program goal of $950 million of total integrated sales in the second quarter. 
We're on track with our Operational Effectiveness goals, achieving $13 million in the quarter and are making good progress against our infrastructure consolidation this year. For example, we expect to complete our Alpharetta building project and consolidate a number of our Atlanta-based facilities and over 2,000 associates in the fourth quarter of this year. Not only do we expect increased associate engagement and enhanced client interaction, we also expect to see meaningful Operational Effectiveness benefits in 2016 and beyond. 
There were only 5 regulatory actions in the quarter, which was consistent with last year's level. While at forum, we had the opportunity to hear directly from our clients about their priorities and technology focus. Tone continues to moderately improve and strategic conversations tend to center on building revenue, delivering digital capabilities, faster payments and a focus on differentiated customer experiences. 
Overall, we are on track to achieve our objectives for the year. We continue to expect internal revenue growth of 5% to 6% and adjusted earnings per share of $3.73 to $3.83, a range of 11% to 14% growth for the year. We also expect internal revenue growth to further accelerate in the second half of the year as more of our sales and related revenue come online. We expect full year adjusted operating margin to expand at least 50 basis points and, importantly, that free cash flow per share will be at least $4.12 for the year. 
In conclusion, we are pleased with our strong start to the year. We're on track to meet our financial and strategic commitments, which include recording an increase in the rate of internal revenue growth for the third consecutive year. These results and the third-party recognition I mentioned upfront are a strong testament to the focus and dedication of our more than 21,000 associates who drive value for our clients each and every day. With that, Mary, let's open the line for questions."

And now we're getting to a point where we have scale. And as that scale -- as we continue to add users, we continue to get nice drop through benefits in that.

We're on track where we would expect it to be on those implementations. I'm going to separate that from sales for a minute. The sales momentum is quite strong. As Tom mentioned, the pipeline is at its fullest level ever. And we are seeing a lot more interest from larger institutions, frankly, those institutions that would not be having the conversations with us, but for the fact that we have this modern technology platform. Again, when we acquired Open Solutions, we anticipated a number of benefits. Frankly, we had not anticipated the fact that the world would change so dramatically since January 2013 that real-time would become so critical, along with the processing and data capability of that platform. So we're involved in a number of larger transactions. Now the negative, to the extent there is one, is those larger transactions tend to have long sales cycles. But we're excited to be in there. And frankly, another of the benefits is, as you know, we have a lot of very strong relationships with large financial institutions that tend to be based in our payments, technologies or -- and/or our channels technologies, our risk technologies. And this is now giving us an opportunity to be able to go in and have more wholesome conversations centered on the core processing solution of DNA."

So we've got a number of over 5,000 account processing clients. We've developed differentiation that's centered in integration, whether it's into the core or into our mobile services, risk services, et cetera. So that's a very different value proposition. Now we're also competing against some of the larger players that are not connected to our core. But the reality is, is that the majority of our success has historically come from the integration value that we can create in core.

Within that category, we're always looking for how can we be more efficient part to be able to expand margin, but frankly part of that is to ensure that we're able to continue to invest in our products in a meaningful way. The other big piece of margin expansion, frankly, is on the Operational Effectiveness that we have been executing really fairly well since 2007. Most of that work has not touched our infrastructure today. We've done -- we've had small numbers of data centers to be consolidated. We've done a location here or there. We're now focused on making sure that we are able to leverage the company that we built over the last -- for the last 3 to 5, 7 years. And Tom and I both talked about the fact that we're doing these infrastructure consolidations. So we're doing more on the data center front. We're doing more in looking for ways to bring people together to create better communities of effort around our clients. And then lastly, we're also continuing to focus on what are the right ways for us to get the best leverage across our labor bases. We're pretty spread out. We still have lots of opportunities to create value there. So those are the 3 areas that we're really focused on right now from an Operational Effectiveness. Combined with the scale, that really gives us a high degree of confidence that we're going to be able to continue to expand margin consistent with our long-term guidance in the foreseeable future. Lastly, I would say that you'll see us spend a fair amount of energy on this at Investor Day to be able to provide confidence for the next several years that, that will continue, not just for us, but for also for you, our owners."

The beginning question is an interesting question because from a sales inning perspective, we're probably somewhere in the middle innings in terms of aggregate values sold. In terms of the revenue recognized on that, I would say we're in the very early stages of the ballgame and have a lot of runway left ahead. Some of that is because of implementation cues. Some of it is we've signed contracts that don't expire for -- where they have competitive agreements that don't expire for a period of time. But again, that's one of the things that gives us confidence, not just into the second half of this year, but frankly, on our exit run rate. So it's pretty early on that opportunity."

So I think about real-time on several levels, but you've got solutions, such as DNA, which I think of a little bit more as a file drawer. And we're creating this real-time capability that allows for a lot of optionality to put files in that drawer, which are the real-time applications. So it could be deposits, it could be data management, it could be payments, any of those different opportunities. And we're going to see that both in real-time core. But the mandate is coming much more off of how consumers are accessing those technologies or frankly how business owners are accessing those technologies through Mobiliti and online and the like. And we're in the enviable position of having both the account processing or the core platform as well as the channels platforms, which we have a very long legacy on the online side that we're now complementing on the mobile side. That, however, is only part of the opportunity. Frankly, I am at least, if not more, excited about the second part of the opportunity, and that is, that today, because of the solutions that we have in the market, be it the CheckFree RXP solution or Popmoney, or ACH solutions, we have rails today, which are slower rails but are moving many, many, many millions and millions and billions of transactions. And what we're seeing is financial institutions get quite excited about the opportunity to provide real-time capabilities, payments and deposits. We mentioned that in our prepared remarks. Real-time deposit credit is another intriguing opportunity, where institutions can create small fees that make sense to the consumer and make sense to them. So they can create a little bit of fee revenue, consumers can get what they want from a time to move or speed to move perspective. And because we're the enabling party, we're getting that as well. And my belief is that we're going to see some meaningful percentage, take bill pay, where we've got roughly 1.5 billion transactions a year. Some meaningful percentage of those have the propensity to go on a real-time basis. And that will create real value, not just in terms of growing the transactions, but on a RevPAR trend basis, that could be very, very impactful to our model over time. So it's a little bit of a long-winded answer. You can be sure we're going to talk about this at Investor Day. But it's a very, very important opportunity. And uniquely it's a place where the interest of consumers or users, whether they be retail or business, the financial institution, whether that be a bank, a credit union, a lender, a biller, whoever it is, and our interests all intersect at this point of real-time."

On last month's Investor Day, we stared strategy, our focus on annually increasing our rate of internal revenue growth, further expanding both operating margin and cash flow and most important, our plans to",878,"Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon, everyone. On last month's Investor Day, we stared strategy, our focus on annually increasing our rate of internal revenue growth, further expanding both operating margin and cash flow and most important, our plans to deliver compelling and differentiating value to clients. We are increasingly optimistic about the opportunities ahead.
We delivered another quarter of solid results, including 4% internal revenue growth, strong margin expansion and excellent free cash flow. Importantly, our results were in line with our plans and we remain on track to achieve our full year financial performance outlook.
Adjusted operating income growth was 8%, both the quarter and year-to-date. Adjusted operating performance was exceptional, increasing 120 basis points in the quarter to 31.8%. Adjusted EPS was up 17% in the quarter and is up 12% year-to-date. Free cash flow totaled $439 million for the first 6 months of the year and importantly, free cash flow per share through June is up a very strong 18% for the period. 
We also gained sales momentum, recording a sequential increase in sales value of 11% in the quarter and a 10% increase over the same period last year. We are poised for revenue acceleration in the second half of the year and expect to exit the year positioned to increase our internal revenue growth rate again in 2016.
Each quarter, we update you on progress against our 3 strategic focus areas, which given our recent Investor Day, will be a bit more abridged than normal. The 3 areas are: first, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment human and channel solution; and third, deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiation and value for our clients.
We've executed both in the quarter and year-to-date, delivering 4% internal revenue growth despite more than 50 basis points of foreign currency headwinds in both periods. Our high-quality revenue strategy supported strong adjusted operating margin expansion of 140 basis points in the first half of the year. Our focus on market differentiation breaths high-quality revenue, and that helped us sign Synchrony Bank with over $35 billion of assets to our Signature account processing platform in the quarter, along with a broad suite of payments solutions. 
Our second priority is to build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on our payments and channels business. During the quarter, we added more than 100 new retail and business clients to our Mobiliti ASP solution, and exited the quarter with more than 3.5 million retail subscribers. Our focus on digital services has us positioned to deliver unique client value for years to come.
At our Investor Day, we shared our strategy for expanding biller services as part of our commitment to further adoption of realtime payment. We moved the needle in the quarter by significantly expanding our on demand payment relationship with Direct Energy, one of the largest utility companies in the nation. We also signed a Top 40 financial institution for our e-bill and bill matrix solutions in quarter. And lastly, U.S. Bank, the fifth largest bank in the country, selected Biller Advantage to provide electronic billing, -- and payments to a broad range of its customers. We were also excited to announce that United Way, the largest privately supported nonprofit organization in the world would now allow any of the roughly 6 million U.S. donors to use Popmoney to make contributions directly from a digitally enabled bank account.
Interesting DNA remain strong across all sized institutions and charter types, which was again evident in our sales results. For example, Georgia's Own Credit Union, a $1.9 billion institution with over 180,000 members selected our DNA platform for its advanced technology, strong commercial capabilities and then open architecture that will enable enhanced service to its members. We have 11 new DNA clients go live in the first half of the year versus 15 in all of last year. Remain on pace to double the growth DNA implementations this year. As many of these clients have selected a full suite of Fiserv's solutions, we expect as he revenue benefits across both report segments.
Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiation our clients. Our new Agiliti solution was recently included on the integrators list for Transaction Services by Global Finance Magazine. This recognition is for banks and FinTech providers that use cutting-edge technology to disrupt the Transaction Services market. We also had a 5 clients recognize at the Retail Banker International Awards for initiatives executed in conjunction with Fiserv. This highly regarded awards focus on organizations that deliver excellence for the customers. We are pleased partner with each of these organizations to provide technology and innovation that enables best-in-class results.
Realtime money movement is at the forefront of many financial industry conversations which is right in our wheelhouse. We provide realtime processing capabilities for a number of clients. And accordingly, realtime transactions grew over 40% in the quarter and are up nearly 50% year-to-date. We also announced a strategic our partnership with a Early Warning services to further extend our realtime reach and capabilities. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail on our financial results."
128209,305665581,841837,"Fiserv, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2015",2015-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone.

Internal revenue growth was 4% in both the quarter and for the year-to-date. Growth on a constant currency basis was 5% in the quarter, when excluding the 60 basis point negative impact from foreign currency.
The net change in license and termination fee revenue was not material to our results in either the quarter or year-to-date period. Our focus on high-quality revenue growth and optimizing efficiency in our business model continues to pay off. Adjusted operating income increased 8% in both the quarter and year-to-date to $390 million and $761 million, respectively.
Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was up 120 basis points over the prior year to 31.8%. First app adjusted operating margin is up 140 basis points, driven by high-quality revenue and scale benefit across both segments, along with continued operational efficiency savings.
While we continue to expect strong margin performance, we have a more difficult margin comparison the balance of the year, as the second half adjusted operating margin in 2014 was nearly 100 basis points higher than the first half of 2014. 
Adjusted earnings per share increased 17% to $0.95 in the quarter and for the first half of the year, adjusted earnings per share is up 12% to $1.83, even with a $0.05 headwind from a higher year-to-date tax rate. 
Now I will move onto the segment detail. Internal revenue growth in the Payments segment accelerated sequentially to 6% in the second quarter from 4% in the first quarter. Adjusted revenue was $627 million in the quarter led by strength in our card services, biller, bill payment and digital channels divisions. Results in our Output Solutions business were relatively flat compared to the prior year due to benefits from larger than normal breach re-issuances last year and lower than anticipated EMV-related revenue year-to-date.
As we indicated at Investor Day, we continue to invest in preparation for EMV and entered the second half of the year with a good-sized production order book. However, we continue to see variability around the timing of EMV revenue especially in debit and prepaid, which is the majority of our secure card client base.
During the quarter, we further extended existing relationships with our market-leading Payment Solutions, signing 40 debit and 70 bill payment clients in the quarter. Transaction growth rate held steady with debit in the low-double digits and bill payment in the low-single digits. As Jeff mentioned earlier, we continue to have success across our recurring revenue, Mobiliti ASP retail and business solutions.
Payments segment operating income was up 12% in the quarter to $208 million and year-to-date was up 9% to $399 million. Adjusted operating margin in the segment expanded 190 basis points to 33.2% for the quarter. Through June 30, segment adjusted operating margin is up a very strong 130 basis points to 32.2%, driven by high-quality revenue growth and strong operating leverage.
Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment grew 2% in the quarter to $609 million and 3% in the first 6 months of the year to $1.2 billion. Segment revenue growth, led by our account processing and lending solutions divisions, was partially impacted by a 70 basis point negative currency impact in the second quarter.
Operating income in the Financial segment was up 3% in the quarter to $209 million. And for the first half of the year was up 6% to $413 million. Despite a very difficult prior year comparison, adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points in the quarter to 34.5%.
Through June 30, the segment adjusted operating margin is up 130 basis points to 34.4%. Our strong results have been driven by scale center growth in our account assessing and lending businesses, along with benefits realized from our operational efficiency programs, partially offset by solution investments, including our Agiliti platform.
Corporate segment operating performance by the second quarter adjustments and year-to-date are in line with prior year. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 34.6% in the quarter, which was slightly lower than the prior year. The adjusted tax rate of 34.9% through June was 180 basis points higher than the prior year's rate of 33.1% due to larger discrete tax benefits recognized in last year's first quarter. We continue to expect a 35% adjusted effective tax rate for the full year.
We are pleased with our strong free cash flow performance in the first half of the year. Free cash flow increased 11% to $439 million, and on a per share basis, grew 18% over the prior year to $1.82. We anticipate much higher tax payments in the second half of the year, which will likely compress free cash flow growth in that period.
We took important steps to improve our long-term debt structure and flexibility the quarter. First, we extended the maturity on our $2 billion revolving debt facility to April 2020. We also raised $1.75 billion of proceeds in a public offering of 5- and 10-year senior notes primarily to refinance near-term obligations. These transactions significantly extended our debt maturities while lowering our weighted average pretax cost of debt to 3.3%.
We continue to focus capital allocation on share repurchase. Our total payout ratio was 121% of adjusted income. We repurchased 3.1 million shares of stock in the quarter for $245 million. Through June 30, we have repurchased $6.9 million shares at an average cost of $77 per share, totaling $535 million.
At quarter's end, there were 235.2 million shares outstanding and 12.9 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff."

As I said upfront, sales in the quarter were up 10% over the prior year, 11% sequentially and were 85% of quota. We saw strong pipeline growth in the quarter across the company, including several of the areas we discussed in detail at Investor Day. We expect strong sales performance in the second half of the year. 
Integrated sales were $67 million in the quarter, which puts us over our $950 million 5-year program goal, about 6 months earlier than we originally anticipated. Our continuing strong performance speaks to the value of our integrated solutions combined with compelling market opportunity.
We have recorded $111 million of integrated sales through June or 44% of our full year target. We've also realized $27 million of Operational Effectiveness savings to date, in line with our goals for the year. Going forward, we remain bullish on the opportunity to enhance our infrastructure through projects such as the data center and real estate consolidation in Atlanta, which is our largest domestic market area. We are pleased with our progress and anticipate completion in Q4.
As we shared at Investor Day, the FI [ph] market remains stable. We continue to work with clients to leverage opportunities arising from the eventuality of interest rate gains, new sources of noninterest income and enhanced operational efficiency. Both financial institution and merchants tenants are marching cautiously towards compliance for the October ENB liability shift date and there continues to be a heightened level of discussion on faster payments.
As I mentioned upfront, we remain on track to achieve our full year financial outlook, which includes another step up in internal revenue growth. Internal revenue growth for the full year is still expected to be 5% to 6%. And as I shared at Investor Day, we'll likely move towards 5% primarily due to slower than anticipated EMV adoption and negative foreign currency impacts. We still expect adjusted earnings per share growth to be 11% to 14% or $3.73 to $3.83, with the bias above the midpoint of the range for the full year.
We also anticipate that adjusted operating margin will expand more than 50 basis points and that free cash flow per share will be at least $4.12 for the year.
For modeling purposes, we expect much stronger revenue growth in the fourth quarter due primarily to the timing of EMV and license revenue, prior year comparisons and revenue impact from new client implementations.
We're pleased with our results through June and fully expect to deliver on our full year financial expectations. We are executing well in our existing businesses and making strong progress with innovation-based growth. When taken together, we believe this will contribute to further acceleration of our internal revenue growth in 2016 and beyond. This only happens as a result of the incredible contributions of our 21,000 associates around the world who work tirelessly each day to deliver quality, service and innovation to our clients.

But we'll also get revenue from each of the remaining implementations that go live in the second half of the year. And that's both in the DNA, as well as all of the surround solutions that go with it. We've been fortunate that a large majority of clients who have selected DNA have also selected a broad suite of our solution to go along with that. In addition to that, the DNA, we also have, as you remember from our last couple of investor days, talked about the large that's the progress that we made in the large -- primarily in the large bank space, and so a number of those clients we also anticipate going live in this year so we're starting to have a benefit from again the account processing platform revenue as well as the surround revenue that goes with them as well."

So we expect a very strong second half in our Biller business. Clearly, I highlight on the call also that our Output Solutions business, which includes EMV, was fairly flat compared to the prior year in first 6 months of the year. And again, we expect good revenue acceleration, both the base business in that Output Solutions business and also been EMV. And then in the fourth quarter specifically, some stronger license sales in regards to that, which is usual, but it's going to be a little bit heavy this year.

I mean in your 4% year-to-date sort of implies at least 6% under the the back half and your commentary on the fourth quarter suggests it might've been higher than that in the fourth quarter so maybe 7%. So do you have the visibility just based on the DNA conversion, some of the large bank account conversions and some of the headwinds, whether it's the Biller headwinds or just the output headwinds just sort of a beating? I guess what I'm getting at is how much incremental new books of business do you to sign or is it just a function of review the conversions that's happening as you plan?"

From our perspective, we have a pretty darn good visibility to the big chunks of revenue that we need to deliver in a second half of the year and as we commented on, I think it will bias even further into the fourth quarter. The big blocks of revenue, as Tom talked about, just to reiterate, are the revenue that's coming from the conversions, DNA is the one that we talked about a lot but we have DNA and our Signature platform. Frankly, we've got outsized clients coming in there that will spread across both of the segments. The second area is in our Biller business as Tom referenced again, it's growing quite well. And we also have the benefit of some headwinds that have now abated as we cross the threshold of the middle this year. And so we get the combined benefit of better compare and some nice growth. The third area is really around our Output Solutions business which is responsible for EMV. We talked about the size of our production book which is quite strong. It's really a matter of when are the banks going to take delivery of the product, when are they going to be ready for it? We have indicated that it's slipped based on what our internal expectations were at the beginning of the year. It's not a demand item at all. In fact, I think demand is probably better shape than we would have anticipated it to be holistically but the timing of revenues has been slipping. That's why we believe we're going to have a pretty nice boost and likely going to be biased into the fourth quarter. And then the last thing is around license revenue. We do expect to see more license revenue based on what we can see in the pipe coming in the fourth quarter this year. And we also had -- we had a little bit of a tougher comparing the third quarter that's why this growth will look to be a little bit stronger in Q4. So overall, we have pretty good business visibility to those numbers. We have actually good, strong -- good, solid, I'll say, visibility into how that will translate best exit rate will translate into growth into next year like we talked about at Investor Day, we have a pretty high level of confidence that we'll be able to grow at that 50 to 100 basis points of growth in 2016."

But those headwinds in our Biller business are so in there in the second quarter, so those completely go away in the second half, so we're going to continue to see some good ramp. So really good growth across all 4 of those businesses. And I would also say that as I highlighted, the one that that not performed at a level we anticipated at plan was our Output Solutions business. And  you kind of see that in our P&L in the profit product revenue line item. But given EMV and some prior year comparison to base business, that business was flattish. So again, we continue to have good momentum in those other businesses as we head into the second half and we should see much improved performance in our output business in the second half."

It doesn't take a very high percentage of those transactions to really move the needle on realtime. I see realtime deposit, realtime mobile deposit being a very really interesting use case where today there are many, many banks in the U.S. who are charging relatively nominal amounts anywhere from $0.25 to $1 per deposit or per item depending on the institution to use those remote mobile deposit capabilities, so that I think there's an opportunity there. And then of course I do see P2P and then I see B2B as another area in treating use case. So yes, I am bullish on that. I'll tell you what, if you ask me where my nervousness is, it's not on the transactions, it's on the price per transaction. And the nervousness is only not -- if there's a billion transactions at a relatively small amount or 100 million transactions at a relatively large amount, it's still going to create a very interesting, scalable opportunity for us and more importantly, for the financial institutions that offer that service.

The first one is that EMV, while we've had a very large demand and future orders log, we have not seen the level of production that we had anticipated earlier in the year. That's a matter of timing. The other thing that is -- intricately connected to that is there were -- because of the large number of breaches last year, we had a lot of reissue. And we're finding institutions trying to balance out how do I think about last year's big reissues with the EMV this year? And we're not seeing the number of programs, through that we typically would have -- and we believe that's solely related currency these blips and breach timing from last year.

On last month's Investor Day, we shared strategy, our focus on annually increasing our rate of internal revenue growth, further expanding both operating margin and cash flow, and most important, our plans t",880,"Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon, everyone. On last month's Investor Day, we shared strategy, our focus on annually increasing our rate of internal revenue growth, further expanding both operating margin and cash flow, and most important, our plans to deliver compelling and differentiating value to clients. We are increasingly optimistic about the opportunities ahead.
We delivered another quarter of solid results, including 4% internal revenue growth, strong margin expansion and excellent free cash flow. Importantly, our results were in line with our plans and we remain on track to achieve our full year financial performance outlook.
Adjusted operating income growth was 8% in both the quarter and year-to-date. Adjusted operating performance was exceptional, increasing 120 basis points in the quarter to 31.8%. Adjusted EPS was up 17% in the quarter and is up 12% year-to-date. Free cash flow totaled $439 million for the first 6 months of the year, and importantly, free cash flow per share through June is up a very strong 18% for the period. 
We also gained sales momentum, recording a sequential increase in sales value of 11% in the quarter and a 10% increase over the same period last year. We are poised for revenue acceleration in the second half of the year and expect to exit the year positioned to increase our internal revenue growth rate again in 2016.
Each quarter, we update you on progress against our 3 strategic focus areas, which given our recent Investor Day, will be a bit more abridged than normal. The 3 areas are: First, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solution; and third, deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiation and value for our clients.
We've executed well in the quarter and year-to-date, delivering 4% internal revenue growth despite more than 50 basis points of foreign currency headwinds in both periods. Our high-quality revenue strategy supported strong adjusted operating margin expansion of 140 basis points in the first half of the year. Our focus on market differentiation breeds high-quality revenue, and that helped us sign Synchrony Bank with over $35 billion of assets to our Signature account processing platform in the quarter, along with a broad suite of payments solutions. 
Our second priority is to build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on our payments and channels business. During the quarter, we added more than 100 new retail and business clients to our Mobiliti ASP solution, and exited the quarter with more than 3.5 million retail subscribers. Our focus on digital services has us positioned to deliver unique client value for years to come.
At our Investor Day, we shared our strategy for expanding biller services as part of our commitment to further adoption of realtime payments. We moved the needle in the quarter by significantly expanding our on-demand payment relationship with Direct Energy, one of the largest utility companies in the nation. We also signed a top 40 financial institution for our e-bill and bill matrix solutions in the quarter. And lastly, U.S. Bank, the fifth largest bank in the country, selected Biller Advantage to provide electronic billing, presentment and payments to a broad range of its business customers. We were also excited to announce that United Way, the largest privately supported nonprofit organization in the world, will now allow any of the roughly 6 million U.S. donors to use Popmoney to make contributions directly from a digitally enabled bank account.
Interest in DNA remain strong across all size institutions and charter types, which was again evident in our sales results. For example, Georgia's Own Credit Union, a $1.9 billion institution with over 180,000 members, selected our DNA platform for its advanced technology, strong commercial capabilities and an open architecture that will enable enhanced service to its members. We have 11 new DNA clients go live in the first half of the year versus 15 in all of last year. We remain on pace to double the number of DNA implementations this year. As many of these clients have selected a full suite of Fiserv's solutions, we expect to see revenue benefits across both reporting segments.
Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiation for our clients. Our new Agiliti solution was recently included on the innovators list for Transaction Services by Global Finance Magazine. This recognition is for banks and FinTech providers that use cutting-edge technology to disrupt the Transaction Services market. We also had 5 clients recognize at the Retail Banker International Awards for initiatives executed in conjunction with Fiserv. These highly regarded awards focus on organizations that deliver excellence for their customers. We are pleased partner with each of these organizations to provide technology and innovation that enables best-in-class results.
Realtime money movement is at the forefront of many financial industry conversations which is right in our wheelhouse. We provide realtime processing capabilities for a number of clients. And accordingly, realtime transactions grew over 40% in the quarter and are up nearly 50% year-to-date. We also announced a strategic partnership with Early Warning services to further extend our realtime reach and capabilities. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail on our financial results."
128209,305665581,842088,"Fiserv, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2015",2015-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone.

Internal revenue growth was 4% in both the quarter and for the year-to-date. Growth on a constant currency basis was 5% in the quarter when excluding the 60 basis point negative impact from foreign currency.
The net change in license and termination fee revenue was not material to our results in either the quarter or year-to-date period. Our focus on high-quality revenue growth and optimizing efficiency in our business model continues to pay off. Adjusted operating income increased 8% in both the quarter and year-to-date to $390 million and $761 million, respectively.
Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was up 120 basis points over the prior year to 31.8%. First app adjusted operating margin is up 140 basis points, driven by high-quality revenue and scale benefit across both segments, along with continued operational efficiency savings.
While we continue to expect strong margin performance, we have a more difficult margin comparison for the balance of the year, as the second half adjusted operating margin in 2014 was nearly 100 basis points higher than the first half of 2014. 
Adjusted earnings per share increased 17% to $0.95 in the quarter, and for the first half of the year, adjusted earnings per share is up 12% to $1.83, even with a $0.05 headwind from a higher year-to-date tax rate. 
Now I will move onto the segment detail. Internal revenue growth in the Payments segment accelerated sequentially to 6% in the second quarter from 4% in the first quarter. Adjusted revenue was $627 million in the quarter, led by strength in our card services, biller, bill payment and digital channels divisions. Results in our Output Solutions business were relatively flat compared to the prior year due to benefits from larger-than-normal breach reissuances last year and lower-than-anticipated EMV-related revenue year-to-date.
As we indicated at Investor Day, we continue to invest in preparation for EMV and enter the second half of the year with a good-sized production order book. However, we continue to see variability around the timing of EMV revenue, especially in debit and prepaid, which is the majority of our secure card client base.
During the quarter, we further extended existing relationships with our market-leading payment solutions, signing 40 debit and 70 bill payment clients in the quarter. Transaction growth rates held steady, with debit in the low-double digits and bill payment in the low-single digits. As Jeff mentioned earlier, we continue to have success across our recurring revenue, Mobiliti ASP retail and business solutions.
Payments segment operating income was up 12% in the quarter to $208 million and year-to-date was up 9% to $399 million. Adjusted operating margin in the segment expanded 190 basis points to 33.2% for the quarter. Through June 30, segment adjusted operating margin is up a very strong 130 basis points to 32.2%, driven by high-quality revenue growth and strong operating leverage.
Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment grew 2% in the quarter to $609 million and 3% in the first 6 months of the year to $1.2 billion. Segment revenue growth, led by our account processing and lending solutions divisions, was partially impacted by a 70 basis point negative currency impact in the second quarter.
Operating income in the Financial segment was up 3% in the quarter to $209 million. And for the first half of the year, was up 6% to $413 million. Despite a very difficult prior year comparison, adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points in the quarter to 34.5%.
Through June 30, the segment adjusted operating margin is up 130 basis points to 34.4%. Our strong results have been driven by scaled center growth in our account assessing and lending businesses, along with benefits realized from our operational efficiency programs, partially offset by solution investments, including our Agiliti platform.
Corporate segment net operating performance for the second quarter and year-to-date are in line with the prior year. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 34.6% in the quarter, which was slightly lower than the prior year. The adjusted tax rate of 34.9% through June was 180 basis points higher than the prior year's rate of 33.1% due to larger discrete tax benefits recognized in last year's first quarter. We continue to expect a 35% adjusted effective tax rate for the full year.
We are pleased with our strong free cash flow performance in the first half of the year. Free cash flow increased 11% to $439 million, and on a per share basis, grew 18% over the prior year to $1.82. We anticipate much higher tax payments in the second half of the year, which will likely compress free cash flow growth in that period.
We took important steps to improve our long-term debt structure and flexibility in the quarter. First, we extended the maturity on our $2 billion revolving debt facility to April 2020. We also raised $1.75 billion of proceeds in a public offering of 5 and 10-year senior notes primarily to refinance near-term obligations. These transactions significantly extended our debt maturities while lowering our weighted average pretax cost of debt to 3.3%.
We continue to focus capital allocation on share repurchase. Our total payout ratio was 121% of adjusted income. We repurchased 3.1 million shares of stock in the quarter for $245 million. Through June 30, we have repurchased $6.9 million shares at an average cost of $77 per share, totaling $535 million.
At quarter's end, there were 235.2 million shares outstanding and 12.9 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff."

As I said upfront, sales in the quarter were up 10% over the prior year, 11% sequentially and were 85% of quota. We saw strong pipeline growth in the quarter across the company, including several of the areas we discussed in detail at Investor Day. We expect strong sales performance in the second half of the year. 
Integrated sales were $67 million in the quarter, which puts us over our $950 million 5-year program goal about 6 months earlier than we originally anticipated. Our continuing strong performance speaks to the value of our integrated solutions combined with compelling market opportunity.
We've recorded $111 million of integrated sales through June or 44% of our full year target. We've also realized $27 million of Operational Effectiveness savings to date, in line with our goals for the year. Going forward, we remain bullish on the opportunity to enhance our infrastructure through projects such as the data center and real estate consolidation in Atlanta, which is our largest domestic market area. We are pleased with our progress and anticipate completion in Q4.
As we shared at Investor Day, the FI market remains stable. We continue to work with clients to leverage opportunities arising from the eventuality of interest rate gains, new sources of noninterest income and enhanced operational efficiency. Both financial institutions and merchants are marching cautiously towards compliance for the October EMV liability shift date and there continues to be a heightened level of discussion on faster payments.
As I mentioned upfront, we remain on track to achieve our full year financial outlook, which includes another step up in internal revenue growth. Internal revenue growth for the full year is still expected to be 5% to 6%, and as I shared at Investor Day, will likely move towards 5%, primarily due to slower than anticipated EMV adoption and negative foreign currency impacts. We still expect adjusted earnings per share growth to be 11% to 14% or $3.73 to $3.83, with a bias above the midpoint of the range for the full year.
We also anticipate that adjusted operating margin will expand more than 50 basis points and that free cash flow per share will be at least $4.12 for the year.
For modeling purposes, we expect much stronger revenue growth in the fourth quarter due primarily to the timing of EMV and license revenue, prior year comparisons and revenue impact from new client implementations.
We're pleased with our results through June and fully expect to deliver on our full year financial expectations. We are executing well in our existing businesses and making strong progress with innovation-based growth. When taken together, we believe this will contribute to further acceleration of our internal revenue growth in 2016 and beyond. This only happens as a result of the incredible contributions of our 21,000 associates around the world who work tirelessly each day to deliver quality, service and innovation to our clients.
With that, Tory, let's open the line for questions."

We've been fortunate that a large majority of the clients who have selected DNA have also selected a broad suite of our solution to go along with that.

Clearly, I highlight on the call also that our Output Solutions business, which includes EMV, was fairly flat compared to the prior year in first 6 months of the year. And again, we expect good revenue acceleration in both the base business in that Output Solutions business and also with EMV. And then, in the fourth quarter specifically, some stronger license sales in regards to that, which is usual, but it's going to be a little bit more heavy this year.

And as you know, revenue -- a few million dollars of revenue can impact your growth rate in any quarter. From our perspective, we have a pretty darn good visibility to the big chunks of revenue that we need to deliver in the second half of the year. And as we commented on, we think it will bias even further to the fourth quarter. The big blocks of revenue, as Tom talked about, just to reiterate, are the revenue that's coming from the conversions, DNA is the one that we talked about a lot but we have DNA and our Signature platform. Frankly, we've got good size clients coming in there that will spread across both of the segments. The second area is in our Biller business, as Tom referenced again, it's growing quite well. And we also have the benefit of some headwinds that have now abated as we cross the threshold of the middle of this year. And so we get the combined benefit of better compare and some nice growth. The third area is really around our Output Solutions business which is responsible for EMV. We talked about the size of our production book which is quite strong. It's really a matter of when are the banks going to take delivery of the product, when are they going to be ready for it? We've indicated that it's slipped based on what our internal expectations were at the beginning of the year. It's not a demand item at all. In fact, I think, demand is probably in better shape than we would have anticipated it to be holistically but the timing of the revenues has been slipping, that's why we believe we're going to have a pretty nice boost and likely going to be biased into the fourth quarter. And then, the last thing is around license revenue. We do expect to see more license revenue based on what we can see in the pipe coming in the fourth quarter this year. And we also had -- we had a little bit of a tougher compare in the third quarter, that's why that growth will look a little bit stronger in Q4. So overall, we have pretty good visibility to those numbers. We have actually good, strong -- good, solid, I'll say, visibility into how that will translate -- that exit rate will translate into growth into next year, like we talked about at Investor Day, we have a pretty high level of confidence that we'll be able to grow 50 -- add that 50 to 100 basis points of growth in 2016."

So -- but there's nothing else unusual going on there.

The question of does the utilization of a public cloud make -- allow -- change the barriers to entry in the business, I suspect the people who were trying to get in would say, yes. We would say that at least our belief is that the public cloud as we know it today doesn't have the robustness that would be necessary to support the regulatory environment. And there are some private cloud utilizations that I think could come in, and we're certainly looking at that as a way to provide the most modern technology solutions possible. But I would say that, yes, it will allow people to talk about being in the market. The reality is in order to make a solution like that work, you have to win enough clients to get to scale so that the investment makes sense. And it's just -- it's a long, long road to get there.

One of the comments in our prepared remarks was actually signing a top 40 financial institution to some of our Biller -- a lending client that was referred to our Biller area. So we're really now, over the last 18 months, really been building some muscle in building out that ability to identify good, exciting solutions for us to deliver to our non-account processing solution. And then, also beginning to bring our account processing area into -- or being able to cross over into some of the account processing solutions. A couple of these new DNA solutions that we're out pitching right now to these larger institutions, both of them originated out of relationships that we have in other payments and channel solutions where we have credibility with those clients and therefore, they're looking at us to bring in -- potentially bring in DNA.

But Dave, we incurred about $50 million of leasehold improvements in that CapEx number to the first 6 months. And so that's what's driving that. We're going to continue to be at 5% to 6% of revenues on an ongoing basis. This is one of those things that's going to occur largely very infrequently just because of the fact it's our largest domestic location. And again, they're leasehold improvements. So when you take that out, we're going to be up to 5% to 6% range. And most of our investment, as you know, really goes through our P&L from a standpoint of development dollars, et cetera."

So maybe the key parts of your Payments business that have such a high level of operating leverage versus the other parts that may not, I think, that'd be a great understanding."

I would say, outside of that, our output business clearly doesn't have that same type of margin dynamic from a long-term standpoint. And that's probably the business in there that can move around with EMV. As we kind of talked about, as Mark kind of highlighted on Investor Day, we don't see it have a big impact, but that can kind of move around as that revenue kind of goes around. But we feel good about our margin performance. Clearly, it was above our expectations in the first half of the year but we're going to continue to focus on driving high-quality revenue and we'll continue our strategy as we've laid out."

I don't believe that we'll be able to grow it at 190 basis points on a continuing basis.

We would see -- I would see bill payment the kind of the RXP-based bill payment service where we have 1.4 billion, 1.5 billion transactions a year. It doesn't take a very high percentage of those transactions to really move the needle on realtime. I see realtime deposit, realtime mobile deposit being a very interesting use case where today, there are many, many banks in the U.S. who are charging relatively nominal amounts, anywhere from $0.25 to $1 per deposit or per item depending on the institution to use those remote mobile deposit capabilities, and I think there's an opportunity there. And then, of course, I do see P2P and then I see B2B as another area of intriguing use case. So yes, I am bullish on that. I'll tell you what, if you ask me where my nervousness is, it's not on the transactions, it's on the price per transaction. And the nervousness is only not -- if there's 1 billion transactions at a relatively small amount, or 100 million transactions at a relatively large amount, it's still going to create a very interesting, scalable opportunity for us, but more importantly, for the financial institutions that offer that service. So I do think -- I think there are a number of ways that use case will come together and we're really excited about it over the next several years."

And because we don't issue our numbers on a constant currency basis, we haven't had that benefit. And then, really, in our Output Solutions, and there's a twofold impact there. The first one is that EMV, while we've had a very large demand and future orders logged, we have not seen the level of production that we had anticipated earlier in the year. That's a matter of timing. The other thing that is intricately connected to that is there were -- because of the large number of breaches last year, we had a lot of reissue. And we're finding institutions trying to balance out how do I think about last year's big reissues with the EMV this year? And we're not seeing the number of programs come through that we typically would have, and we believe that's solely related to the -- these blips and breach timing from last year. So those are the things that we hadn't anticipated. But on balance, we feel like we're making good progress in that.

At last month's Investor Day, we shared strategy, our focus on annually increasing our rate of internal revenue growth, further expanding both operating margin and cash flow, and most important, our plans to deliver compelling and differentiating value to clients. We are increasingly optimistic about the opportunities ahead.
We delivered another quarter of solid results, including 4% internal revenue growth, strong margin expansion and excellent free cash flow. Importantly, our results were in line with our plans and we remain on track to achieve our full year financial performance outlook.
Adjusted operating income growth was 8% in both the quarter and year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin performance was exceptional, increasing 120 basis points in the quarter to 31.8%. Adjusted EPS was up 17% in the quarter and is up 12% year-to-date. Free cash flow totaled $439 million for the first 6 months of the year, and importantly, free cash flow per share through June is up a very strong 18% for the period. 
          We also gained sales momentum, recording a sequential increase in sales value of 11% in the quarter and a 10% increase over the same period last year. We are poised for revenue acceleration in the second half of the year and expect to exit the year positioned to increase our internal revenue growth rate again in 2016.
Each quarter, we update you on progress against our 3 strategic focus areas, which given our recent Investor Day, will be a bit more abridged than normal. The 3 areas are: First, continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; second, build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solution; and third, deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiation and value for our clients.
We've executed well in the quarter and year-to-date, delivering 4% internal revenue growth despite more than 50 basis points of foreign currency headwinds in both periods. Our high-quality revenue strategy supported strong adjusted operating margin expansion of 140 basis points in the first half of the year. Our focus on market differentiation breeds high-quality revenue, and that helped us sign Synchrony Bank with over $35 billion of assets to our Signature account processing platform in the quarter, along with a broad suite of payments solutions. 
          Our second priority is to build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on our payments and channels business. During the quarter, we added more than 100 new retail and business clients to our Mobiliti ASP solution, and exited the quarter with more than 3.5 million retail subscribers. Our focus on digital services has us positioned to deliver unique client value for years to come.
At our Investor Day, we shared our strategy for expanding biller services as part of our commitment to further adoption of realtime payments. We moved the needle in the quarter by significantly expanding our on-demand payment relationship with Direct Energy, one of the largest utility companies in the nation. We also signed a top 40 financial institution for our e-bill and bill matrix solutions in the quarter. And lastly, U.S. Bank, the fifth largest bank in the country, selected Biller Advantage to provide electronic billing, presentment and payments to a broad range of its business customers. We were also excited to announce that United Way, the largest privately supported nonprofit organization in the world, will now allow any of the roughly 6 million U.S. donors to use Popmoney to make contributions directly from a digitally enabled bank account.
Interest in DNA remain strong across all size institutions and charter types, which was again evident in our sales results. For example, Georgia's Own Credit Union, a $1.9 billion institution with over 180,000 members, selected our DNA platform for its advanced technology, strong commercial capabilities and an open architecture that will enable enhanced service to its members. We had 11 new DNA clients go live in the first half of the year versus 15 in all of last year. We remain on pace to double the number of DNA implementations this year. As many of these clients have selected a full suite of Fiserv's solutions, we expect to see revenue benefits across both reporting segments.
Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiation for our clients. Our new Agiliti solution was recently included on the innovators list for Transaction Services by Global Finance Magazine. This recognition is for banks and FinTech providers that use cutting-edge technology to disrupt the Transaction Services market. We also had 5 clients recognize at the Retail Banker International Awards for initiatives executed in conjunction with Fiserv. These highly regarded awards focus on organizations that deliver excellence for their customers. We are pleased to partner with each of these organizations to provide technology and innovation that enables best-in-class results.
Realtime money movement is at the forefront of many financial industry conversations which is right in our wheelhouse. We provide realtime processing capabilities for a number of clients. And accordingly, realtime transactions grew over 40% in the quarter and are up nearly 50% year-to-date. We also announced a strategic partnership with Early Warning services to further extend our realtime reach and capabilities. 
          With that, let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail on our financial results."
128209,305665581,842186,"Fiserv, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2015",2015-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter and $2.4 billion year-to-date. Internal revenue growth was 4% in both the quarter and for the year-to-date. Growth on a constant currency basis was 5% in the quar",941,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Adjusted revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter and $2.4 billion year-to-date. Internal revenue growth was 4% in both the quarter and for the year-to-date. Growth on a constant currency basis was 5% in the quarter when excluding the 60 basis point negative impact from foreign currency.
The net change in license and termination fee revenue was not material to our results in either the quarter or year-to-date period. Our focus on high-quality revenue growth and optimizing efficiency in our business model continues to pay off. Adjusted operating income increased 8% in both the quarter and year-to-date to $390 million and $761 million, respectively.
Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was up 120 basis points over the prior year to 31.8%. First half adjusted operating margin is up 140 basis points, driven by high-quality revenue and scale benefit across both segments, along with continued operational efficiency savings.
While we continue to expect strong margin performance, we have a more difficult margin comparison for the balance of the year, as the second half adjusted operating margin in 2014 was nearly 100 basis points higher than the first half of 2014. 
          Adjusted earnings per share increased 17% to $0.95 in the quarter, and for the first half of the year, adjusted earnings per share is up 12% to $1.83, even with a $0.05 headwind from a higher year-to-date tax rate. 
          Now I will move on to the segment detail. Internal revenue growth in the Payments segment accelerated sequentially to 6% in the second quarter from 4% in the first quarter. Adjusted revenue was $627 million in the quarter, led by strength in our card services, biller, bill payment and digital channels divisions. Results in our Output Solutions business were relatively flat compared to the prior year due to benefits from larger-than-normal breach reissuances last year and lower-than-anticipated EMV-related revenue year-to-date.
As we indicated at Investor Day, we continue to invest in preparation for EMV and enter the second half of the year with a good-sized production order book. However, we continue to see variability around the timing of EMV revenue, especially in debit and prepaid, which is the majority of our secure card client base.
During the quarter, we further extended existing relationships with our market-leading payment solutions, signing 40 debit and 70 bill payment clients in the quarter. Transaction growth rates held steady, with debit in the low-double digits and bill payment in the low-single digits. As Jeff mentioned earlier, we continued to have success across our recurring revenue, Mobiliti ASP retail and business solutions.
Payments segment operating income was up 12% in the quarter to $208 million and year-to-date was up 9% to $399 million. Adjusted operating margin in the segment expanded 190 basis points to 33.2% for the quarter. Through June 30, segment adjusted operating margin is up a very strong 130 basis points to 32.2%, driven by high-quality revenue growth and strong operating leverage.
Adjusted revenue in the Financial segment grew 2% in the quarter to $609 million and 3% in the first 6 months of the year to $1.2 billion. Segment revenue growth, led by our account processing and lending solutions divisions, was partially impacted by a 70 basis point negative currency impact in the second quarter.
Operating income in the Financial segment was up 3% in the quarter to $209 million. And for the first half of the year, was up 6% to $413 million. Despite a very difficult prior year comparison, adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points in the quarter to 34.5%.
Through June 30, the segment adjusted operating margin is up 130 basis points to 34.4%. Our strong results have been driven by scale centered growth in our account assessing and lending businesses, along with benefits realized from our operational efficiency programs, partially offset by solution investments, including our Agiliti platform.
Corporate segment net operating performance for the second quarter and year-to-date are in line with the prior year. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 34.6% in the quarter, which was slightly lower than the prior year. The adjusted tax rate of 34.9% through June was 180 basis points higher than the prior year's rate of 33.1% due to larger discrete tax benefits recognized in last year's first quarter. We continue to expect a 35% adjusted effective tax rate for the full year.
We are pleased with our strong free cash flow performance in the first half of the year. Free cash flow increased 11% to $439 million, and on a per share basis, grew 18% over the prior year to $1.82. We anticipate much higher tax payments in the second half of the year, which will likely compress free cash flow growth in that period.
We took important steps to improve our long-term debt structure and flexibility in the quarter. First, we extended the maturity on our $2 billion revolving debt facility to April 2020. We also raised $1.75 billion of proceeds in a public offering of 5 and 10-year senior notes primarily to refinance nearer-term obligations. These transactions significantly extended our debt maturities while lowering our weighted average pretax cost of debt to 3.3%.
We continue to focus capital allocation on share repurchase. Our total payout ratio was 121% of adjusted income. We repurchased 3.1 million shares of stock in the quarter for $245 million. Through June 30, we have repurchased $6.9 million shares at an average cost of $77 per share, totaling $535 million.
At quarter's end, there were 235.2 million shares outstanding and 12.9 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. 
          With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff."

As I said upfront, sales in the quarter were up 10% over the prior year, 11% sequentially and were 85% of quota. We saw strong pipeline growth in the quarter across the company, including several of the areas we discussed in detail at Investor Day. We expect strong sales performance in the second half of the year. 
          Integrated sales were $67 million in the quarter, which puts us over our $950 million 5-year program goal about 6 months earlier than we originally anticipated. Our continuing strong performance speaks to the value of our integrated solutions combined with compelling market opportunity.
We've recorded $111 million of integrated sales through June or 44% of our full year target. We've also realized $27 million of Operational Effectiveness savings to date, in line with our goals for the year. Going forward, we remain bullish on the opportunity to enhance our infrastructure through projects such as the data center and real estate consolidation in Atlanta, which is our largest domestic market area. We are pleased with our progress and anticipate completion in Q4.
As we shared at Investor Day, the FI market remains stable. We continue to work with clients to leverage opportunities arising from the eventuality of interest rate gains, new sources of noninterest income and enhanced operational efficiency. Both financial institutions and merchants are marching cautiously towards compliance for the October EMV liability shift date and there continues to be a heightened level of discussion on faster payments.
As I mentioned upfront, we remain on track to achieve our full year financial outlook, which includes another step up in internal revenue growth. Internal revenue growth for the full year is still expected to be 5% to 6%, and as I shared at Investor Day, will likely move towards 5%, primarily due to slower than anticipated EMV adoption and negative foreign currency impacts. We still expect adjusted earnings per share growth to be 11% to 14% or $3.73 to $3.83, with a bias above the midpoint of the range for the full year.
We also anticipate that adjusted operating margin will expand more than 50 basis points and that free cash flow per share will be at least $4.12 for the year.
For modeling purposes, we expect much stronger revenue growth in the fourth quarter due primarily to the timing of EMV and license revenue, prior year comparisons and revenue impact from new client implementations.
We're pleased with our results through June and fully expect to deliver on our full year financial expectations. We are executing well in our existing businesses and making strong progress with innovation-based growth. When taken together, we believe this will contribute to further acceleration of our internal revenue growth in 2016 and beyond. This only happens as a result of the incredible contributions of our 21,000 associates around the world who work tirelessly each day to deliver quality, service and innovation to our clients.
With that, Tory, let's open the line for questions."

But we'll also get revenue from each of the remaining implementations that go live in the second half of the year. And that's both in DNA, as well as all of the surround solutions that go with it. We've been fortunate that a large majority of the clients who have selected DNA have also selected a broad suite of our solution to go along with that. In addition to that, to DNA, we also have, as you will remember from our last couple of investor days, talked about the large -- the progress that we made in the large -- primarily in the large bank space, and so a number of those clients we also anticipate going live in this year.

Clearly, I highlight on the call also that our Output Solutions business, which includes EMV, was fairly flat compared to the prior year in first 6 months of the year. And again, we expect good revenue acceleration in both the base business in that Output Solutions business and also with EMV. And then, in the fourth quarter specifically, some stronger license sales in regards to that, which is usual, but it's going to be a little bit more heavy this year. So those are some of the things that give us good visibility and confidence as we look into the second half of the year."

But is it -- do you have the visibility just based on the DNA conversion, some of the large bank account conversions and some of the headwinds, whether it's the Biller headwinds or the output headwinds just sort of abating? I guess, what I'm getting at is how much incremental new books of business do you need to sign? Or is it just a function of really the conversions just happening as you planned?"

And as you know, revenue -- a few million dollars of revenue can impact your growth rate in any quarter. From our perspective, we have a pretty darn good visibility to the big chunks of revenue that we need to deliver in the second half of the year. And as we commented on, we think it will bias even further to the fourth quarter. The big blocks of revenue, as Tom talked about, just to reiterate, are the revenue that's coming from the conversions, DNA is the one that we talked about a lot but we have DNA and our Signature platform. Frankly, we've got good size clients coming in there that will spread across both of the segments. The second area is in our Biller business, as Tom referenced again, it's growing quite well. And we also have the benefit of some headwinds that have now abated as we've crossed the threshold of the middle of this year. And so we get the combined benefit of better compare and some nice growth. The third area is really around our Output Solutions business which is responsible for EMV. We talked about the size of our production book which is quite strong. It's really a matter of when are the banks going to take delivery of the product, when are they going to be ready for it? We've indicated that it's slipped based on what our internal expectations were at the beginning of the year. It's not a demand item at all. In fact, I think, demand is probably in better shape than we would have anticipated it to be holistically but the timing of the revenues has been slipping, that's why we believe we're going to have a pretty nice boost and likely going to be biased into the fourth quarter. And then, the last thing is around license revenue. We do expect to see more license revenue based on what we can see in the pipe coming in, in the fourth quarter this year. And we also had -- we had a little bit of a tougher compare in the third quarter, that's why that growth will look a little bit stronger in Q4. So overall, we have pretty good visibility to those numbers. We have actually good, strong -- good, solid, I'll say, visibility into how that will translate -- that exit rate will translate into growth into next year, like we talked about at Investor Day, we have a pretty high level of confidence that we'll be able to grow 50 -- add that 50 to 100 basis points of growth in 2016."

Now clearly, the sales cycle on some those transactions is a bit longer because of the size of the institution, but yes -- no, we clearly see that in our pipelines."

That was an area that we had not anticipated, specifically in the large in-house realtime market. And that there are several opportunities that we're working on and involved in. And the beauty of that is we are competing against platforms that, frankly, not just some of the domestic platforms but some of the platforms outside the U.S. And it will -- the more swings we get at the plate, the more likely it is that we're going to begin penetrating that space. And frankly, as we begin penetrating that space, we have a pretty high degree of confidence that the combination of that technology with our surround solutions, with our expertise and knowledge of the U.S. banking market, is going to make us quite formidable and turn into some very attractive revenue over the next, call it, the next 2 to 4 years."

I think, Temenos is building something, Fidelity is working on something, I think [indiscernible] has something out there. In the U.S. specifically, do you see any change in the appetite of banks to sort of put their -- smaller banks that you service, to put their core accounting processing kind of in the public cloud? And I guess, the question is sort of if they become more comfortable doing that, does that open up the door to new entrants or competition in a way that you kind of have not seen in the past? And I know it's a relatively long-term question, but just curious on your thoughts there."

The question of does the utilization of a public cloud make -- allow -- change the barriers to entry in the business, I suspect the people who are trying to get in would say, yes. We would say that at least our belief is that the public cloud as we know it today doesn't have the robustness that would be necessary to support the regulatory environment. Then there are some private cloud utilizations that I think could come in, and we're certainly looking at that as a way to provide the most modern technology solutions possible. But I would say that, yes, it will allow people to talk about being in the market. But the reality is in order to make a solution like that work, you have to win enough clients to get to scale so that the investment makes sense. And it's just -- it's a long, long road to get there. Ultimately, I would not be so bold as to say no one will crack that code. Someone may crack that code and I can tell you that we're looking for what are the best ways to use these emerging technologies to make sure that we have the winning solutions in the market."

We know that the only way that we can really grow since there are not a lot of new financial institutions in the market is by selling more deeply in. And in fact, one of the things that we're quite focused on is the -- we've traditionally set this up as a way to extend the privileged relationship that exists on the account processing side. One of the comments in our prepared remarks was actually signing a top 40 financial institution to some of our Biller -- a lending client that was referred to our Biller area. So we're really now, over the last 18 months, really been building some muscle in building out that ability to identify good, exciting solutions for us to deliver to our non-account processing solution. And then, also beginning to bring our account processing area into -- or being able to cross over into some of the account processing solutions. A couple of these new DNA solutions that we're out pitching right now to these larger institutions, both of them originated out of relationships that we have in other payments and channel solutions where we have credibility with those clients and therefore, they're looking at us to bring in -- potentially bring in DNA. So we're building a lot of muscle in there regardless of the fact that we haven't set a new program goal."

And I would also say that as I highlighted, the one that has not performed at the level we anticipated at plan was our Output Solutions business.

I mean, whether it's the term fees or it's certain contracts that moved away or whatever? But obviously, that abates into next year and that helps acceleration also."

That's something that was out there. We talked a little bit about the Biller business and some headwinds there in the first half of the year, which are dissipating clearly as we get into the second half of the year. And we did also talk a little bit about output in the first half of the year given the fact that we had a tough compare. And those are probably the 3 that I kind of see from kind of things that are out there from just a headwind that as we look out into future, we continue to believe that some of those will clearly go away."

And I think the clients will become attached to that kind of a service delivery, whether it is realtime credit of a deposit or to being able to send money to a family member immediately or even paying a bill as if they were at a Biller website.

We would see -- I would see bill payment -- kind of the RXP-based bill payment service where we have 1.4 billion or 1.5 billion transactions a year. It doesn't take a very high percentage of those transactions to really move the needle on realtime. I see realtime deposit, realtime mobile deposit being a very interesting use case where today, there are many, many banks in the U.S. who are charging relatively nominal amounts, anywhere from $0.25 to $1 per deposit or per item depending on the institution to use those remote mobile deposit capabilities, and I think there's an opportunity there. And then, of course, I do see P2P and then I see B2B as another very intriguing use case. So yes, I am bullish on that. I'll tell you what, if you asked me where my nervousness is, it's not on the transactions, it's on the price per transaction. And the nervousness is only not -- if there's 1 billion transactions at a relatively small amount, or 100 million transactions at a relatively large amount, it's still going to create a very interesting, scalable opportunity for us, but more importantly, for the financial institutions that offer that service. So I do think -- I think there are a number of ways that use case will come together and we're really excited about it over the next several years."

The area -- really, the big area that we talked about of underperformance would be impact from foreign currency, which is greater than we anticipated it to be. And because we don't issue our numbers on a constant currency basis, we haven't had that benefit. And then, really, in our Output Solutions, and there's a twofold impact there. The first one is that EMV, while we've had a very large demand and future orders logged, we have not seen the level of production that we had anticipated earlier in the year. That's a matter of timing. The other thing that is intricately connected to that is there were -- because of the large number of breaches last year, we had a lot of reissue. And we're finding institutions trying to balance out how do I think about last year's big reissues with the EMV this year? And we're not seeing the number of programs come through that we typically would have, and we believe that's solely related to the -- these blips and breach timing from last year. So those are the things that we hadn't anticipated. But on balance, we feel like we're making good progress. In that we're well-positioned for the second half acceleration that we had planned originally."

We delivered strong third quarter results, highlighted by the sequential acceleration of our internal revenue growth rate to 5%, excellent adjusted margin expansion and a 20% increase in adjusted earnings per share. These results are consistent with the ramp we expected this year and are indicative of the financial performance and continuing internal revenue growth acceleration we previewed at our June Investor Day. 
Adjusted earnings per share is up 15% for the first 9 months of the year due to strong adjusted operating income growth and disciplined capital allocation. As a result, we have raised our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to $3.84 to $3.87, an increase of 14% to 15% over last year.
Consistent with our capital allocation strategy and in the face of equity market volatility in the quarter, we repurchased 6 million shares. We remain very committed to that strategy, and through September 30, had already returned over $1 billion to shareholders.
Sales in the quarter was up sequentially over Q2 and came in at 86% of quota. This is a solid result in light of a tough prior year comparison and heightened expectations for increased performance. We're set up for a very strong finish to the year.
Now let me provide an update on our 2015 enterprise priorities, which are: first, to continue to build high-quality revenue mile while meeting our earnings commitments; next, build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions; and third, deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiation and value for our clients.
Our first priority centers on building high-quality revenue in areas that support client value, margin expansion and earnings growth. Third quarter internal revenue growth accelerated 5%, with strong performance across both segments. Businesses with high recurring revenue such as account processing payments, including card services, lending and Biller Solutions all performed well. For reference, our reported results included negative currency impact of 70 basis points in the quarter and was 60 basis points year-to-date.
Growing revenue in areas where we have operating leverage, along with flexing our operational efficiency muscle, led to a 190 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin in the quarter and was up 150 basis points for the year. We believe our business model will produce continued operating margin expansion into the foreseeable future. We're pleased with our financial performance and are on track to meet our shareholder commitments.
Our second priority is to build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions. One of our key strategies is to partner with financial institutions to drive higher levels of digital engagement for our clients. We continue to gain momentum with our industry-leading mobile solutions in the quarter, with over 2,000 financial institution clients now live on Mobiliti ASP, we have seen a more than 50% increase in subscribers to nearly 4 million users as of September 30. We expanded our overall mobile footprint in the quarter, adding 100 new clients to the family. We were pleased that the First Hawaiian Bank, with $18.7 billion in assets, selected a full suite of digital banking, payments and personal financial management capabilities from Fiserv, including Corillian Online, Mobiliti ASP, CheckFree RXP and Popmoney. These solutions will provide best-of-breed digital engagement to their customers and a lower total cost of ownership.
At our Investor Day, we also discussed opportunities to utilize payment speed and efficiency to create solutions that deliver unique value for consumers, financial institutions and billers. During the quarter, P&C, the eighth largest bank in the U.S., selected Popmoney for disbursements to do just that. This solution utilizes our Popmoney capabilities to simplify and expedite the business to consumer payment experience. In a test of payment receipt options, nearly 50% of consumers opted to receive funds via Popmoney. This use case is an important part of our integrated payment strategy and is one of the distinctive growth opportunities embedded in our DDA-based payment approach.
7 DNA clients went live in the quarter and we remain on track for 30 installs this year. Importantly, we anticipate that 6 institutions with assets greater than $1 billion will go live in the fourth quarter, including Columbia Bank, with $4.6 billion of assets; and the $14.4 billion asset institution, Washington Federal, all contributing to increased growth in Q4 and well beyond. We continue to be very pleased with DNA's momentum.
Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiation and value for our clients. One of our primary areas of innovation are solutions that create revenue for our clients. We recently highlighted our new CardValet product at our fall client forum. This solution enables debit card holders to take control over their spending patterns through the comfort of their mobile device. The early indications are extremely positive, with CardValet users adding an average of 5 incremental debit transactions per month. On top of deeper customer engagement, financial institutions should also benefit from additional interchange revenue. Although early, over 200 clients have already signed up for CardValet. When live, this group of FIs will further empower their more than 4.5 million underlying debit cardholders, which should translate to revenue over the short and midterm. 
We're also excited about our immediate fund solution, which provides financially solutions tools to allow consumers realtime access to deposited funds across brands, ATM and mobile channel. This is another example of a Fiserv solution which creates value for consumers and new revenue for our clients.
EMV continued to progress in the quarter with an additional boost from the October 1 liability shift date. As you know, Fiserv both manufacturers and personalizes EMV cards, giving us a competitive advantage along with multiple sources of revenue. Although demand has ticked up, will be recognized about 10%, or $1 million of the incremental EMV revenue generated during the quarter. The remaining $9 billion will be deferred until the manufactured cards are personalized. We expect this incremental revenue growth from EMV in the fourth quarter and well into 2016.
Lastly, we were very pleased to sign our first Agiliti client, Think Money Limited, in October. Think Money, which has been in existence for 20 years, provides a broad range of innovative financial products for personal financial management, mortgage and insurance services across more than 100,000 personal accounts today. The Agiliti pipeline remains strong, and we expect additional signings before the end of the year.
Now let me now let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail on our financial results."

We are pleased with our performance in the quarter. Internal revenue growth accelerated sequentially to 5%. These results included a 140 basis point negative impact due to a combination of unfavorable currency impacts and the EMV revenue deferral that Jeff mentioned earlier. Adjusted earnings per share was up a very strong 20% over the prior year to $1.03.
Adjusted revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter and $3.7 billion in the first 9 months of the year. Internal revenue growth was 4% year-to-date. Our continued focus on recurring revenue acceleration was highlighted by a 6% increase in processing and services revenue in this quarter, offset by a decline in product revenue, due primarily to the lower cared reissuance revenue in Output Solutions. Combined license and termination fee revenue benefited revenue growth by 60 basis points in the quarter and 20 basis points year-to-date.
Adjusted operating income growth was excellent, increasing 11% in the quarter and 9% year-to-date to $411 million and $1.2 billion, respectively. Adjusted operating margin was up 190 basis points in the quarter to 33.1%, and year-to-date was up 150 basis points to 32%. Margin performance across both segments was primarily driven by revenue growth in our scale processing businesses and cost efficiencies, including savings from our Operational Effectiveness programs.
Now on to the the segment results. Internal revenue growth in the Payments segment was 6% in the quarter versus our strongest prior year quarter and up 5% year-to-date. Growth in our card services and biller businesses led the segment performance. While EMV production in our Output Solutions business increased, much of that revenue, $9 million, was deferred to future periods due to cards which have been fully manufactured as of quarter end but not yet personalized.
We have added nearly 100 new debit clients through September and have a solid pipeline of future activity. Our double-digit transaction growth so far this year remains ahead of the market. 
Our integrated debit value proposition, along with continued solution innovation, such as CardValet and Card Free Cash is resonating well with the market. 
Bill payments transaction growth remained in the low single-digits and we saw good traction in value added services such as same-day bill payment, which has transaction growth of 36% over last year. 
Mobile users continue to grow as we approached 4 million Mobiliti ASP subscribers at the end of the quarter. We continue to believe digital transformation is still early in the cycle and expect to see more growth in the future as demand for digital services continues.
Payments segment adjusted operating income grew 8% in the quarter to $217 million, and year-to-date is up 9% to $616 million. Segment adjusted operating margin expanded 80 basis points in the quarter to 33.7%. And through September, is up 110 basis points to 32.7%, driven primarily by growth in our scale recurring revenue businesses and our cost efficiencies.
Internal revenue growth in the Financial segment was 4% in the quarter and 3% year-to-date. Growth in the quarter was driven primarily by strength in our account processing and lending businesses, along with the positive impact of higher combined termination and license revenue, partially offset by currency.
Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was up 13% in the quarter to $218 million and up 9% to $631 million in the first 9 months of the year. Adjusted operating margin was 35.5% in the quarter and has increased 180 basis points to 34.8% year-to-date. Strong margin performance in the quarter was driven by scale business growth in areas such as account processing and lending, higher onetime fees and benefits from our continued focus on operational efficiency.
Corporate segment adjusted net operating performance for the quarter and year-to-date are both in line with our expectations and consistent with the comparable prior year results. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 34.3% in the quarter and year-to-date is up 100 basis points to 34.7%, resulting in a $0.04 per share negative impact year-over-year. We expect our fourth quarter rate to approximate 36%.
Free cash flow was $666 million through September 30. Results were negatively impacted in the quarter by the timing of working capital, including a $60 million increase in tax payments compared to 2014. Our free cash flow does not include a $32 million cash distribution from our StoneRiver venture in the quarter. We anticipate stronger fourth quarter results due to working capital favorability, including lower tax payments. Free cash flow per share is up 5% year-to-date to $2.77.
Total debt at September 30 was $4.2 billion or 2.3x our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We are deeply committed to creating value for our shareholders through disciplined capital allocation. We repurchased $514 million of our stock in the quarter, nearly equaling the amount in the first half of the year. For the first 3 quarters of the year, we have allocated over $1 billion to share repurchase, acquiring 12.9 million shares at an average price of $81 per share. As of quarter's end, there were 229.5 million shares outstanding and 6.9 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff."

As I mentioned upfront, sales in the quarter were 86% of quota. Actual sales performance was down a bit compared to the prior year's results, primarily from deals pushing to future quarters.

Actual sales performance was down a bit compared to the prior year's results, primarily from deals pushing to future quarters. Pipelines are solid across the board, including good traction with our newer solutions. We expect to finish our sales here strong, leading to excellent momentum going into '16. 
Integrated sales in the quarter were $57 million, led by solutions such as debit and credit services, Mobiliti, bill payment, Source Capture and statement processing. With integrated sales of $168 million through September, we expect to meet our $250 million target for the year.
Operational Effectiveness savings were up sequentially in the quarter and now at $44 million year-to-date. In addition to solid in-year performance, we are building a foundation to achieve a new $250 million target we shared at Investor Day. We were pleased to complete the construction of our Alpharetta Campus in the quarter. 80% of our nearly 2,000 Atlanta-based associates from a number of locations are now housed in our new state-of-the-art facility. In conjunction with this project, we also consolidated 2 of our largest data centers, which we also expect will generate meaningful savings. 
Although the financial institution environment remains generally stable, the conjecture and implications around interest rates were front and center in the quarter. M&A activity is progressing at elevated levels which we expect will continue. While regulatory and efficiency remain in focus, we were starting to see the movement by financial institutions towards revenue-focused solutions that deliver end-user value at the intersection of realtime, digital and evolving consumer expectations.
As I mentioned upfront, we are well-positioned to achieve our 2015 financial objectives, which include our third consecutive year of increased internal revenue growth. We are tightening our internal revenue growth guidance to 5% for the full year, which would translate to approximately 6% revenue growth in the fourth quarter. That performance would cap off a strong second half of the year and serve as an attractive exit run rate for 2016.
We have raised our full year adjusted earnings per share target to a range of $3.84 to $3.87, which at 14% to 15% growth is above the top end of our previous guidance of $3.73 to $3.83. We also expect that adjusted operating margin will increase well over 50 basis points for the full year, and that free cash flow per share will be at least $4.12 for the year. 
Although we are in sight of delivering our 30th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, we are far more excited about the future. We are providing a unique set of solutions that enable our clients to best serve their customers, which should drive high-quality revenue for Fiserv into the future. 
We know our success is dependent on the more than 21,000 talented associates who partner with our thousands of clients around the world. We are grateful for the difference they make each and every day. Speaking of talented associates, earlier today, we filed an 8-K announcing that after more than 20 years of Fiserv, the last 10 of them as CFO, Tom Hirsch intends to retire on March 31, 2016. Tom is leaving for personal reasons and does not have plans to pursue comparable employment outside of Fiserv. He will also be available as needed after March for special projects and to ensure a smooth transition, Tom is a stellar executive with deep business acumen and tremendous passion for the company and its clients. He has been instrumental in the transformation of Fiserv, working with the team to deliver strong results and set an even more attractive course for the future.
On a personal note, Tom has been a great partner, confidant and friend. In typical form, he will be more than fully engaged until he walks out the door, and when he closes the ledger for the last time he will be missed. 
With that said, transition and change breed opportunity. Tom and his family will embark on a new chapter of their life, and so will the company. We intend to consider a full slate of internal and external candidates for this highly desirable role. We have a strong finance leadership team, which we believe will ensure a smooth transition, and we expect to make a decision on a new CFO no later than January 31. 
With that, Cindy, let's open the line for questions."

I'd like nothing better than to be building that implementation team out even further because we're winning lots of deals there. The majority of this next phase of $250 million of Operational Effectiveness saves is going to come from looking to become more efficient in our real estate footprint, looking to bring together some of our dispersed data centers and also looking for ways to get better leverage out of our dispersed workforce. So those are the big 3 ways that we see that we're going to knock down that $250 million. Remember also in our Operational Effectiveness savings, they're going to be a little lumpy by quarter, right? And so we had a very good quarter this year, I think we're just about $5 million to $6 million away for our target for the year. Hopefully will stay on that as we can but will continue to build that muscle and we feel good about our ability for the next 2 years to use that to create supplemental margin moving forward."

I guess the only point I would make is because of how we shaped the model, whether that revenue comes in through a Mobiliti user or it comes in from a one -- kind of a onetime our additional revenue, the drop throughs are going to get better and better because of how we're managing the cost base overall. And that -- we like that because obviously, it gives us the margin and some business model expense leverage, but it also gives us the ability to invest at times where there are opportunities for us to invest. And so we, as you know, we're committed to raising margins 50 to 100 basis points a year. And when things are going a little bit better, we'll look for ways to invest to take advantage of those where the perfect storm comes in our favor."

Could you just step back as you talk about high-quality revenue and the margin improvement you've been enjoying and certainly disbursement is an interesting new offering and new functionality. Generally speaking, faster settlement, realtime settlement, is this all part of everything that's going to Fiserv's sort of innovation when I think about Mobiliti suite and so forth? Or is there a separate call out that we're going to be talking about a year from now or 18 months from now around a realtime payment suite of products?"

And we've used a label of now to try to capture this notion of realtime beyond point-of-sale, right? There's a big war that's going on at point-of-sale, whether it's MCX or whatever's going on out there, there's a lot of that. And we're really focused on the DDA-based payments beyond point-of-sale, and that's both payments and deposits. And so the product that we talked about that was immediate funds, that's around deposits. The disbursement product, that's not necessarily leveraging realtime, although certainly the businesses will have the opportunity to decide if they want to use a realtime rail to make that payment. And I only set that up as context because the answer is I'm optimistic that over the next several years, we'll have lots of conversations to talk about leveraging all of the construction that's going on in the realtime space and linking that construction into our front-end applications and weaving back construction into the backend of our realtime payment system. And that will, whether it's Mobiliti or Popmoney or RXP or immediate funds or something that we haven't thought of yet, all of the different functionality that exists in the DDA, I think I think the example used at Investor Day was being able to make a payment through bill pay and get immediate credit at a bank where you have -- where a consumer has a credit card accounts. We see that all as options and ways to help consumers use the realtime networks that are being built right now. I think one of the confusions, as you well know, is which rails are going to be built. And so while we are, to some extent, in the business of constructing those rails, we also don't think that there is a single ubiquitous rail that we can build. We think we can enable people to use some of our technologies and we will connect to other people's technologies. But we -- our ambition is to bring that realtime capability to our applications to enhance the consumer experience to hopefully drive revenue for the financial institution and value for the different users. So I know that's a longer -- maybe a longer answer but that's how we're thinking about it right now."

What we have said is we see a couple of discrete opportunities, Agiliti is one of them, where we can create a boost to our internal revenue growth rate.

It's going to be hard even if you're adding 1% as internal revenue growth, it's going to be hard just to call that essential to the company. To date, we have not seen large international acquisitions. I assume that you're asking question around large, that would make sense for our model. Frankly, we have seen so much opportunity in the U.S. right now and that's where our focus is. We certainly look at some of the assets that become available. But for right now, the majority of the opportunity that we see international beyond the 6% or 7% of revenue that we're focused on today is really trying to make the world smaller, right? So allowing money to move more simply between the U.S. and Australia or the U.S. and India or the U.S. and wherever and back, right?

I think Tom was also talking about some of the timing of expenses that we believe that will hit us in Q4. But that said, one of the things that we've talked about over time is the combination of the revenue model that we're building and the benefit of the Operational Effectiveness program really gives us more capacity to invest and grow the business or frankly not invest and let it flow through to the bottom line. So we're looking at that all the time quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year, month-on-month, depending on what's going on. Now you know well that we don't make large -- it's hard for us to decide in a heartbeat to make a big capital investment. Most of our investment is through our P&L.

128209,312625988,883091,"Fiserv, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2015",2015-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon everyone. We delivered strong third quarter results highlighted by the sequential acceleration of our internal revenue growth rate to 5%, excellent adjusted margin expansion and a 20% increase in adjusted earnings per",1091,"Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon everyone. We delivered strong third quarter results highlighted by the sequential acceleration of our internal revenue growth rate to 5%, excellent adjusted margin expansion and a 20% increase in adjusted earnings per share. These results are consistent with the ramp we expected this year and are indicative of the financial performance and continuing internal revenue growth acceleration we previewed at our June Investor Day.
Adjusted earnings per share is up 15% for the first 9 months of the year due to strong adjusted operating income growth and disciplined capital allocation. As a result, we have raised our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to $3.84 to $3.87, an increase of 14% to 15% over last year.
Consistent with our capital allocation strategy and in the face of equity market volatility in the quarter, we repurchased 6 million shares. We remain very committed to that strategy and through September 30, had already returned over $1 billion to shareholders.
Sales in the quarter was up sequentially over Q2 and came in at 86% of quota. This is a solid result in light of a tough prior year comparison and heightened expectations for increased performance. We're set up for a very strong finish to the year.
Now let me provide an update on our 2015 enterprise priorities, which are: first, to continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; next, build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions; and third, deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiation and value for our clients.
Our first priority centers on building high-quality revenue in areas that support client value, margin expansion and earnings growth. Third quarter internal revenue growth accelerated 5% with strong performance across both segments. Businesses with high recurring revenue, such as account processing, payments, including card services, lending and biller solutions, all performed well. For reference, our reported results included negative currency impact of 70 basis points in the quarter and was 60 basis points year-to-date.
Growing revenue in areas where we have operating leverage, along with flexing our operational efficiency muscle, led to a 190 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin in the quarter and was up 150 basis points for the year. We believe our business model will produce continued operating margin expansion into the foreseeable future. We're pleased with our financial performance and are on track to meet our shareholder commitments.
Our second priority is to build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions. One of our key strategies is to partner with financial institutions to drive higher levels of digital engagement for our clients. We continue to gain momentum with our industry-leading mobile solutions in the quarter. With over 2,000 financial institution clients now live on Mobiliti ASP, we have seen more than 50% increase in subscribers to nearly 4 million users as of September 30. We expanded our overall mobile footprint in the quarter, adding 100 new clients to the family. We were pleased that First Hawaiian Bank with $18.7 billion in assets selected a full suite of digital banking, payments and personal financial management capabilities from Fiserv, including Corillian Online, Mobiliti ASP, CheckFree RXP and Popmoney. These solutions will provide best-of-breed digital engagement to their customers and a lower total cost of ownership.
At our Investor Day, we also discussed opportunities to utilize payment speed and efficiency to create solutions that deliver unique value for consumers, financial institutions and billers. During the quarter, PNC, the eighth largest bank in the U.S., selected Popmoney for disbursements to do just that. This solution utilizes our Popmoney capabilities to simplify and expedite the business-to-consumer payment experience. In a test of payment receipt options, nearly 50% of consumers opted to receive funds via Popmoney. This use case is an important part of our integrated payment strategy and is one of the distinctive growth opportunities embedded in our DDA-based payment approach.
7 DNA clients went live in the quarter, and we remain on track for 30 installs this year. Importantly, we anticipate that 6 institutions with assets greater than $1 billion will go live in the fourth quarter, including Columbia Bank with $4.6 billion of assets; and the $14.4 billion asset institution, Washington Federal, all contributing to increased growth in Q4 and well beyond. We continue to be very pleased with DNA's momentum.
Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiation and value for our clients. One of our primary areas of innovation are solutions that create revenue for our clients. We recently highlighted our new CardValet product at our fall client forum. This solution enables debit card holders to take control over their spending patterns through the comfort of their mobile device. The early indications are extremely positive with CardValet users adding an average of 5 incremental debit transactions per month. On top of deeper customer engagement, financial institutions should also benefit from additional interchange revenue. Although early, over 200 clients have already signed up for CardValet. When live, this group of FIs will further empower their more than 4.5 million underlying debit cardholders, which should translate to new revenue over the short and mid-term. 
We're also excited about our Immediate Funds solution, which provides financial solutions tool to allow consumers real time access to deposited funds across branch, ATM and mobile channel. This is another example of a Fiserv solution, which creates value for consumers and new revenue for our clients.
EMV continued to progress in the quarter with an additional boost from the October 1 liability shift date. As you know, Fiserv both manufacturers and personalizes EMV cards, giving us a competitive advantage along with multiple sources of revenue. Although demand has picked up, we only recognized about 10% or $1 million of the incremental EMV revenue generated in the quarter. The remaining $9 billion will be deferred until the manufactured cards are personalized. We expect to see  incremental revenue growth from EMV in the fourth quarter and well into 2016.
Lastly, we were very pleased to sign our first Agiliti client, Think Money Limited, in October. Think Money, which has been in existence for more than 20 years, provides a broad range of innovative financial products for personal financial management, mortgage and insurance services across more than 100,000 personal accounts today. The Agiliti pipeline remains strong, and we expect additional signings before the end of the year.
Now let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail on our financial results."
128209,312625988,883091,"Fiserv, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2015",2015-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone.

We are pleased with our performance in the quarter. Internal revenue growth accelerated sequentially to 5%. These results included a 140 basis point negative impact due to a combination of unfavorable currency impacts and the EMV revenue deferral that Jeff mentioned earlier. Adjusted earnings per share was up a very strong 20% over the prior year to $1.03.
Adjusted revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter and $3.7 billion in the first 9 months of the year. Internal revenue growth was 4% year-to-date. Our continued focus on recurring revenue acceleration was highlighted by a 6% increase in processing and services revenue this quarter, offset by a decline in product revenue, due primarily to lower card reissuance revenue in Output Solutions. Combined license and termination fee revenue benefited revenue growth by 60 basis points in the quarter and 20 basis points year-to-date.
Adjusted operating income growth was excellent, increasing 11% in the quarter and 9% year-to-date to $411 million and $1.2 billion, respectively. Adjusted operating margin was up 190 basis points in the quarter to 33.1% and year-to-date was up 150 basis points to 32%. Margin performance across both segments was primarily driven by revenue growth in our scale processing businesses and cost efficiencies, including savings from our Operational Effectiveness programs.
Now on to the segment results. Internal revenue growth in the Payments segment was 6% in the quarter versus our strongest prior year quarter and up 5% year-to-date. Growth in our card services and biller businesses led the segment performance. While EMV production in our Output Solutions business increased, much of that revenue, $9 million, was deferred to future periods to the cards which have been fully manufactured as of quarter end but not yet personalized.
We have added nearly 100 new debit clients through September and have a solid pipeline of future activity. Our double-digit transaction growth so far this year remains ahead of the market.
Our integrated debit value proposition, along with continued solution innovation, such as CardValet and CardFree Cash is resonating well with the market. 
Bill payment transaction growth remained in the low single digits and we saw good traction in value-added services, such as same-day bill payment, which has transaction growth of 36% over last year. 
Mobile users continue to grow as we approached 4 million Mobiliti ASP subscribers at the end of the quarter. We continue to believe digital transformation is still early in the cycle and expect to see more growth in the future as demand for digital services continues.
Payments segment adjusted operating income grew 8% in the quarter to $217 million and year-to-date is up 9% to $616 million. Segment adjusted operating margin expanded 80 basis points in the quarter to 33.7% and through September, is up 110 basis points to 32.7%, driven primarily by growth in our scale, recurring revenue businesses and cost efficiencies.
Internal revenue growth in the Financial segment was 4% in the quarter and 3% year-to-date. Growth in the quarter was driven primarily by strength in our account processing and lending businesses along with the positive impact of higher combined termination and license revenue, partially offset by currency.
Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was up 13% in the quarter to $218 million and up 9% to $631 million in the first 9 months of the year. Adjusted operating margin was 35.5% in the quarter and has increased 180 basis points to 34.8% year-to-date. Strong margin performance in the quarter was driven by scale business growth in areas, such as account processing and lending, higher one-time fees and benefits from our continued focus on operational efficiency.
Corporate segment adjusted net operating performance for the quarter and year-to-date are both in line with our expectations and consistent with the comparable prior year results. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 34.3% in the quarter and year-to-date is up 100 basis points to 34.7%, resulting in a $0.04 per share negative impact year-over-year. We expect our fourth quarter rate to approximate 36%.
Free cash flow was $666 million through September 30. Results were negatively impacted in the quarter by the timing of working capital, including a $60 million increase in tax payments compared to 2014. Our free cash flow does not include a $32 million cash distribution from our StoneRiver venture in the quarter. We anticipate stronger fourth quarter results due to working capital favorability, including lower tax payments. Free cash flow per share is up 5% year-to-date to $2.77.
Total debt at September 30 was $4.2 billion or 2.3x, our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We are deeply committed to creating value for our shareholders through disciplined capital allocation. We repurchased $514 million of our stock in the quarter, nearly equaling the amount in the first half of the year. For the first 3 quarters of the year, we have allocated over $1 billion to share repurchase, acquiring 12.9 million shares at an average price of $81 per share. As of quarter's end, there were 229.5 million shares outstanding and 6.9 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.
With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff."

Actual sales performance was down a bit compared to the prior year's results, primarily from deals pushing to future quarters. Pipelines are solid across the board, including good traction with our newer solutions. We expect to finish our sales year strong, leading to excellent momentum going into '16.
Integrated sales in the quarter were $57 million, led by solutions, such as debit and credit services, Mobiliti, bill payment, Source Capture and statement processing. With integrated sales of $168 million through September, we expect to meet our $250 million target for the year.
Operational Effectiveness savings were up sequentially in the quarter and now at $44 million year-to-date. In addition to solid in-year performance, we are building the foundation to achieve the new $250 million target we shared at Investor Day. We were pleased to complete the construction of our Alpharetta Campus in the quarter. 80% of our nearly 2,000 Atlanta-based associates from a number of locations are now housed in our new state-of-the-art facility. In conjunction with this project, we also consolidated 2 of our largest data centers, which we also expect will generate meaningful savings.
Although the financial institution environment remains generally stable, the conjecture and implications around interest rates were front and center in the quarter. M&A activity is progressing at elevated levels, which we expect will continue. While regulatory and efficiency remain in focus, we are starting to see the movement by financial institutions towards revenue-focused solutions that deliver end-user value at the intersection of real time, digital and evolving consumer expectations.
As I mentioned upfront, we are well positioned to achieve our 2015 financial objectives, which include our third consecutive year of increased internal revenue growth. We are tightening our internal revenue growth guidance to 5% for the full year, which would translate to approximately 6% revenue growth in the fourth quarter. That performance would cap off a strong second half of the year and serve as an attractive exit run rate for 2016.
We have raised our full year adjusted earnings per share target to a range of $3.84 to $3.87, which at 14% to 15% growth is above the top end of our previous guidance of $3.73 to $3.83. We also expect that adjusted operating margin will increase well over 50 basis points for the full year, and that free cash flow per share will be at least $4.12 for the year.
Although we are in sight of delivering our 30th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, we are far more excited about the future. We are providing a unique set of solutions that enable our clients to best serve their customers, which should drive high-quality revenue growth for Fiserv into the future. 
We know our success is dependent on more than 21,000 talented associates who partner with our thousands of clients around the world. We are grateful for the difference they make each and every day. Speaking of talented associates, earlier today, we filed an 8-K announcing that after more than 20 years of Fiserv, the last 10 of them as CFO, Tom Hirsch intends to retire on March 31, 2016. Tom is leaving for personal reasons and does not have plans to pursue comparable employment outside of Fiserv. He will also be available as needed after March for special projects and to ensure a smooth transition. Tom is a stellar executive with deep business acumen and tremendous passion for the company and its clients. He has been instrumental in the transformation of Fiserv, working with the team to deliver strong results and set an even more attractive course for the future.
On a personal note, Tom has been a great partner, confidant and friend. In typical form, he will be more than fully engaged until he walks out the door and when he closes the ledger for the last time, he will be missed. 
With that said, transition and change breed opportunity. Tom and his family will embark on a new chapter of their life and so will the company. We intend to consider a full slate of internal and external candidates for this highly desirable role. We have a strong finance leadership team, which we believe will ensure a smooth transition, and we expect to make a decision on a new CFO no later than January 31.
With that, Cindy, let's open the line for questions."

So while the first few quarters have been a little bit light, we expect quite a strong fourth quarter. We typically have had larger deals in the middle of the year.

So we have ramped it up nicely. And we are finding to the extent that there are any issues and there have been very few, but if there are any issues, they are not coming from us. They're coming on the client side. And these have also tended to be larger, multiple product implementations. Again, so they've got a level of complexity, and the team has dealt with them beautifully. Most of the clients are referenceable, if not on day 1, on day 3 or 4. So we're feeling very good about the implementations today, and that's one of the reasons why we have great momentum in the market."

And at the same time, at some point, we will likely be able to reduce the size of our implementation team within DNA. But frankly, that's the last thing we want to do. I'd like nothing better than to be building that implementation team out even further because we're winning lots of deals there. The majority of this next phase of $250 million of Operational Effectiveness saves is going to come from looking to become more efficient in our real estate footprint, looking to bring together some of our dispersed data centers, and also looking for ways to get better leverage out of our dispersed workforce. So those are the big 3 ways that we see that we're going to knock down that $250 million. Remember also in our Operational Effectiveness savings, they're going to be a little lumpy by quarter, right? And so we had a very good quarter this year, I think we're just about $5 million to $6 million away from our target for the year.

Regarding the termination fees, I know, David, as you well know, right, it's kind of the normal part of our business and they vary period to period. The combined license and termination fees were up about $6 million to $7 million in the third quarter and year-to-date compared to the prior year. To your question specifically, termination fees overall were up by approximately $10 million year-to-date and for the quarter. This was offset, however, by a decrease of about $5 million in license fees year-to-date and for the quarter. And just as a reminder, we had negative currency impact in the quarter of about $8 million and $20 million on a year-to-date basis, which more than offset those increases. And as Jeff highlighted, we have to defer about $9 million of EMV revenue in the quarter due to the fact that we've completed the manufacturing element. But have not personalized the cards, which is a smaller part of that, which will happen. And so with that, that's the numbers on the termination fee side."

We're able to offset some smaller term fees -- I'm sorry, smaller license revenue. You have all kinds of things going on. I guess the only point I would make is because of how we've shaped the model, whether that revenue comes in through a Mobiliti user or it comes in from a one -- kind of a onetime or occasional revenue, the drop throughs are going to get better and better because of how we're managing the cost base overall. And that -- we like that because obviously, it gives us the margin and some business model expense leverage, but it also gives us the ability to invest at times where there are opportunities for us to invest.

And we've used a label of now to try to capture this notion of realtime beyond point-of-sale, right? There's a big war that's going on at point-of-sale, whether it's MCX or whatever's going on out there, there's a lot of that. And we're really focused on the DDA-based payments beyond point-of-sale, and that's both payments and deposits. And so the product that we talked about that was immediate funds, that's around deposits. The disbursement product, that's not necessarily leveraging realtime, although certainly, the businesses will have the opportunity to decide if they want to use a real-time rail to make that payment. And I only set that up as context because the answer is I'm optimistic that over the next several years, we'll have lots of conversations to talk about leveraging all of the construction that's going on in the real-time space and linking that construction into our front-end applications and weaving that construction into the backend of our real-time payment system. And that will, whether it's Mobiliti or Popmoney or RXP or immediate funds or something that we haven't thought of yet, all of the different functionality that exists in the DDA, I think the example we used at Investor Day was being able to make a payment through bill pay and get immediate credit at a bank where you have -- a consumer has a credit card account. We see that all those options and ways to help consumers use the real-time networks that are being built right now. I think one of the confusions, as you well know, is which rails are going to be built. And so while we are, to some extent, in the business of constructing those rails, we also don't think that there is a single ubiquitous rail that we can build. We think we can enable people to use some of our technologies and we will connect to other people's technologies. But we -- our ambition is to bring that real-time capability to our applications to enhance the consumer experience to hopefully drive revenue for the financial institution and value for the different users. So I know it's a longer -- maybe a longer answer, but that's how we're thinking about it right now."

Frankly, we have seen so much opportunity in the U.S. right now and that's where our focus is. We certainly look at some of the assets that become available.

We're seeing a lot of competition in that -- in the smaller kind of in the $1 billion and below -- in the below space, and so there's a lot of activity there. But we are seeing processes, RFP [ph] processes, evaluation processes going on. We've been pleased that we've been involved in that. We've actually been down selected once or twice in pretty big evaluations, which is something that we would not have been able to do frankly had we not acquired DNA. So we are seeing some activity there. I think that'll manifest over time. One of the beauties to that is the institutions that are doing the evaluation tend to know us because there -- maybe they're a Corillian client, they're very likely a bill pay client. In that space, we've got a number of really important solutions, PEP+. PEP+ client, so they're using our technologies and so we have a relationship with them. Whether that will ultimately get us over the finish line, we'll see. But we do think it has them give us more consideration than if we were one of the new kids on the block."

If you go back and look at what we've laid out for Investor Day, I mean, that would have been the start of a very attractive run for us. So the answer is yes. We saw a lot more production. We ended up needing to defer the $9 million of the $10 million, and we believe that, that deferral will stay constant for a while, right? And so if you look through that, we would expect to be able to recognize a more normal amount of revenue moving forward."

We delivered strong third quarter results highlighted by the sequential acceleration of our internal revenue growth rate to 5%, excellent adjusted margin expansion and a 20% increase in adjusted earnings per",1092,"Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon everyone. We delivered strong third quarter results highlighted by the sequential acceleration of our internal revenue growth rate to 5%, excellent adjusted margin expansion and a 20% increase in adjusted earnings per share. These results are consistent with the ramp we expected this year and are indicative of the financial performance and continuing internal revenue growth acceleration we previewed at our June Investor Day.
Adjusted earnings per share is up 15% for the first 9 months of the year due to strong adjusted operating income growth and disciplined capital allocation. As a result, we have raised our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to $3.84 to $3.87, an increase of 14% to 15% over last year.
Consistent with our capital allocation strategy and in the face of equity market volatility in the quarter, we repurchased 6 million shares. We remain very committed to that strategy and through September 30, had already returned over $1 billion to shareholders.
Sales in the quarter was up sequentially over Q2 and came in at 86% of quota. This is a solid result in light of a tough prior year comparison and heightened expectations for increased performance. We're set up for a very strong finish to the year.
Now let me provide an update on our 2015 enterprise priorities, which are: first, to continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; next, build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions; and third, deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiation and value for our clients.
Our first priority centers on building high-quality revenue in areas that support client value, margin expansion and earnings growth. Third quarter internal revenue growth accelerated 5% with strong performance across both segments. Businesses with high recurring revenue, such as account processing, payments, including card services, lending and biller solutions, all performed well. For reference, our reported results included negative currency impact of 70 basis points in the quarter and was 60 basis points year-to-date.
Growing revenue in areas where we have operating leverage, along with flexing our operational efficiency muscle, led to a 190 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin in the quarter and was up 150 basis points for the year. We believe our business model will produce continued operating margin expansion into the foreseeable future. We're pleased with our financial performance and are on track to meet our shareholder commitments.
Our second priority is to build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions. One of our key strategies is to partner with financial institutions to drive higher levels of digital engagement for our clients. We continue to gain momentum with our industry-leading mobile solutions in the quarter. With over 2,000 financial institution clients now live on Mobiliti ASP, we have seen a more than 50% increase in subscribers to nearly 4 million users as of September 30. We expanded our overall mobile footprint in the quarter, adding 100 new clients to the family. We were pleased that First Hawaiian Bank with $18.7 billion in assets selected a full suite of digital banking, payments and personal financial management capabilities from Fiserv, including Corillian Online, Mobiliti ASP, CheckFree RXP and Popmoney. These solutions will provide best-of-breed digital engagement to their customers and a lower total cost of ownership.
At our Investor Day, we also discussed opportunities to utilize payment speed and efficiency to create solutions that deliver unique value for consumers, financial institutions and billers. During the quarter, PNC, the eighth largest bank in the U.S., selected Popmoney for disbursements to do just that. This solution utilizes our Popmoney capabilities to simplify and expedite the business-to-consumer payment experience. In a test of payment receipt options, nearly 50% of consumers opted to receive funds via Popmoney. This use case is an important part of our integrated payment strategy and is one of the distinctive growth opportunities embedded in our DDA-based payment approach.
7 DNA clients went live in the quarter, and we remain on track for 30 installs this year. Importantly, we anticipate that 6 institutions with assets greater than $1 billion will go live in the fourth quarter, including Columbia Bank with $4.6 billion of assets; and the $14.4 billion asset institution, Washington Federal, all contributing to increased growth in Q4 and well beyond. We continue to be very pleased with DNA's momentum.
Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiation and value for our clients. One of our primary areas of innovation are solutions that create revenue for our clients. We recently highlighted our new CardValet product at our fall client forum. This solution enables debit card holders to take control over their spending patterns through the comfort of their mobile device. The early indications are extremely positive with CardValet users adding an average of 5 incremental debit transactions per month. On top of deeper customer engagement, financial institutions should also benefit from additional interchange revenue. Although early, over 200 clients have already signed up for CardValet. When live, this group of FIs will further empower their more than 4.5 million underlying debit cardholders, which should translate to new revenue over the short and mid-term. 
We're also excited about our Immediate Funds solution, which provides financial institutions tools to allow consumers real time access to deposited funds across branch, ATM and mobile channels. This is another example of a Fiserv solution, which creates value for consumers and new revenue for our clients.
EMV continued to progress in the quarter with an additional boost from the October 1 liability shift date. As you know, Fiserv both manufactures and personalizes EMV cards, giving us a competitive advantage along with multiple sources of revenue. Although demand has picked up, we only recognized about 10% or $1 million of the incremental EMV revenue generated in the quarter. The remaining $9 million will be deferred until the manufactured cards are personalized. We expect to see incremental revenue growth from EMV in the fourth quarter and well into 2016.
Lastly, we were very pleased to sign our first Agiliti client, Think Money Limited, in October. Think Money, which has been in existence for more than 20 years, provides a broad range of innovative financial products for personal financial management, mortgage and insurance services across more than 100,000 personal accounts today. The Agiliti pipeline remains strong, and we expect additional signings before the end of the year.
Now let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail on our financial results."

We are pleased with our performance in the quarter. Internal revenue growth accelerated sequentially to 5%. These results included a 140 basis point negative impact due to a combination of unfavorable currency impacts and the EMV revenue deferral that Jeff mentioned earlier. Adjusted earnings per share was up a very strong 20% over the prior year to $1.03.
Adjusted revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter and $3.7 billion in the first 9 months of the year. Internal revenue growth was 4% year-to-date. Our continued focus on recurring revenue acceleration was highlighted by a 6% increase in processing and services revenue this quarter, offset by a decline in product revenue, due primarily to lower card reissuance revenue in Output Solutions. Combined license and termination fee revenue benefited revenue growth by 60 basis points in the quarter and 20 basis points year-to-date.
Adjusted operating income growth was excellent, increasing 11% in the quarter and 9% year-to-date to $411 million and $1.2 billion, respectively. Adjusted operating margin was up 190 basis points in the quarter to 33.1% and year-to-date was up 150 basis points to 32%. Margin performance across both segments was primarily driven by revenue growth in our scale processing businesses and cost efficiencies, including savings from our Operational Effectiveness programs.
Now on to the segment results. Internal revenue growth in the Payments segment was 6% in the quarter versus our strongest prior year quarter and up 5% year-to-date. Growth in our card services and biller businesses led the segment performance. While EMV production in our Output Solutions business increased, much of that revenue, $9 million, was deferred to future periods to the cards which have been fully manufactured as of quarter end but not yet personalized.
We have added nearly 100 new debit clients through September and have a solid pipeline of future activity. Our double-digit transaction growth so far this year remains ahead of the market.
Our integrated debit value proposition, along with continued solution innovation, such as CardValet and CardFree Cash is resonating well with the market. 
Bill payment transaction growth remained in the low single digits and we saw good traction in value-added services, such as same-day bill payment, which has transaction growth of 36% over last year. 
Mobile users continue to grow as we approach 4 million Mobiliti ASP subscribers at the end of the quarter. We continue to believe digital transformation is still early in the cycle and expect to see even more growth in the future as demand for digital services continues.
Payments segment adjusted operating income grew 8% in the quarter to $217 million and year-to-date is up 9% to $616 million. Segment adjusted operating margin expanded 80 basis points in the quarter to 33.7% and through September, is up 110 basis points to 32.7%, driven primarily by growth in our scale, recurring revenue businesses and cost efficiencies.
Internal revenue growth in the Financial segment was 4% in the quarter and 3% year-to-date. Growth in the quarter was driven primarily by strength in our account processing and lending businesses along with the positive impact of higher combined termination and license revenue, partially offset by currency.
Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was up 13% in the quarter to $218 million and up 9% to $631 million in the first 9 months of the year. Adjusted operating margin was 35.5% in the quarter and has increased 180 basis points to 34.8% year-to-date. Strong margin performance in the quarter was driven by scale business growth in areas, such as account processing and lending, higher one-time fees and benefits from our continued focus on operational efficiency.
Corporate segment adjusted net operating performance for the quarter and year-to-date are both in line with our expectations and consistent with the comparable prior year results. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 34.3% in the quarter and year-to-date is up 100 basis points to 34.7%, resulting in a $0.04 per share negative impact year-over-year. We expect our fourth quarter rate to approximate 36%.
Free cash flow was $666 million through September 30. Results were negatively impacted in the quarter by the timing of working capital, including a $60 million increase in tax payments compared to 2014. Our free cash flow does not include a $32 million cash distribution from our StoneRiver venture in the quarter. We anticipate stronger fourth quarter results due to working capital favorability, including lower tax payments. Free cash flow per share is up 5% year-to-date to $2.77.
Total debt at September 30 was $4.2 billion or 2.3x, our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We are deeply committed to creating value for our shareholders through disciplined capital allocation. We repurchased $514 million of our stock in the quarter, nearly equaling the amount in the first half of the year. For the first 3 quarters of the year, we have allocated over $1 billion to share repurchase, acquiring 12.9 million shares at an average price of $81 per share. As of quarter's end, there were 229.5 million shares outstanding and 6.9 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.
With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff."

Integrated sales in the quarter were $57 million, led by solutions, such as debit and credit services, Mobiliti, bill payment, Source Capture and statement processing. With integrated sales of $168 million through September, we expect to meet our $250 million target for the year.
Operational Effectiveness savings were up sequentially in the quarter and now at $44 million year-to-date. In addition to solid end year performance, we are building the foundation to achieve the new $250 million target we shared at Investor Day. We were pleased to complete the construction of our Alpharetta Campus in the quarter. 80% of our nearly 2,000 Atlanta-based associates from a number of locations are now housed in our new state-of-the-art facility. In conjunction with this project, we also consolidated 2 of our largest data centers, which we also expect will generate meaningful savings.
Although the financial institution environment remains generally stable, the conjecture and implications around interest rates were front and center in the quarter. M&A activity is progressing at elevated levels, which we expect will continue. While regulatory and efficiency remain in focus, we are starting to see early movement by financial institutions towards revenue-focused solutions that deliver end-user value at the intersection of real time, digital and evolving consumer expectations.
As I mentioned upfront, we are well positioned to achieve our 2015 financial objectives, which include our third consecutive year of increased internal revenue growth. We are tightening our internal revenue growth guidance to 5% for the full year, which would translate to approximately 6% revenue growth in the fourth quarter. That performance would cap off a strong second half of the year and serve as an attractive exit run rate for 2016.
We have raised our full year adjusted earnings per share target to a range of $3.84 to $3.87, which at 14% to 15% growth is above the top end of our previous guidance of $3.73 to $3.83. We also expect that adjusted operating margin will increase well over 50 basis points for the full year, and that free cash flow per share will be at least $4.12 for the year.
Although we are in sight of delivering our 30th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, we are far more excited about the future. We are providing a unique set of solutions that enable our clients to best serve their customers, which should drive high-quality revenue growth for Fiserv into the future. 
We know our success is dependent on more than 21,000 talented associates who partner with our thousands of clients around the world. We are grateful for the difference they make each and every day. Speaking of talented associates, earlier today, we filed an 8-K announcing that after more than 20 years at Fiserv, the last 10 of them as CFO, Tom Hirsch intends to retire on March 31, 2016. Tom is leaving for personal reasons and does not have plans to pursue comparable employment outside of Fiserv. He will also be available, as needed, after March for special projects and to ensure a smooth transition. Tom is a stellar executive with deep business acumen and tremendous passion for the company and its clients. He has been instrumental in the transformation of Fiserv, working with the team to deliver strong results and set an even more attractive course for the future.
On a personal note, Tom has been a great partner, confidant and friend. In typical form, he will be more than fully engaged until he walks out the door and when he closes the ledger for the last time, he will be missed. 
With that said, transition and change breed opportunity. Tom and his family will embark on a new chapter of their life and so will the company. We intend to consider a full slate of internal and external candidates for this highly desirable role. We have a strong finance leadership team, which we believe will ensure a smooth transition, and we expect to make a decision on a new CFO no later than January 31.
With that, Cindy, let's open the line for questions."

They're coming on the client side. And these have also tended to be larger, multiple product implementations.

And at the same time, at some point, we will likely be able to reduce the size of our implementation team within DNA. But frankly, that's the last thing we want to do. I'd like nothing better than to be building that implementation team out even further because we're winning lots of deals there. The majority of this next phase of $250 million of Operational Effectiveness saves is going to come from looking to become more efficient in our real estate footprint, looking to bring together some of our dispersed data centers, and also looking for ways to get better leverage out of our dispersed workforce. So those are the big 3 ways that we see that we're going to knock down that $250 million. Remember also in our Operational Effectiveness savings, they're going to be a little lumpy by quarter, right? And so we had a very good quarter this year, I think we're just about $5 million to $6 million away from our target for the year.

Regarding the termination fees, I know, David, as you well know, right, it's kind of the normal part of our business and they vary period to period. The combined license and termination fees were up about $6 million to $7 million in the third quarter and year-to-date compared to the prior year. To your question specifically, termination fees overall were up by approximately $10 million year-to-date and for the quarter. This was offset, however, by a decrease of about $5 million in license fees year-to-date and for the quarter. And just as a reminder, we had negative currency impact in the quarter of about $8 million and $20 million on a year-to-date basis, which more than offset those increases. And as Jeff highlighted, we had to defer about $9 million of EMV revenue in the quarter due to the fact that we've completed the manufacturing element. But have not personalized the cards, which is a smaller part of that, which will happen. And so with that, that's the numbers on the termination fee side."

We're going to have a pretty significant ramp in the fourth quarter this year compared to the other quarters. There's normal seasonality there, but it's going to be much bigger. And so those are all kind of 4 or 5 different events that are kind of impacting our Q4 a little bit higher expense level than we normally would have.

Could you just step back as you talk about high-quality revenue and the margin improvement you've been enjoying, and certainly, disbursement is an interesting new offering and new functionality. Generally speaking, faster settlement, real-time settlement, is this all part of everything that's going into Fiserv's sort of innovation when I think about Mobiliti Suite and so forth? Or is there a separate call out that we're going to be talking about a year from now or 18 months from now around a real-time payment suite of products?"

And we've used a label of now to try to capture this notion of realtime beyond point-of-sale, right? There's a big war that's going on at point-of-sale, whether it's MCX or whatever's going on out there, there's a lot of that. And we're really focused on the DDA-based payments beyond point-of-sale, and that's both payments and deposits. And so the product that we talked about that was Immediate Funds, that's around deposits. The disbursement product, that's not necessarily leveraging realtime, although certainly, the businesses will have the opportunity to decide if they want to use a real-time rail to make that payment. And I only set that up as context because the answer is, I'm optimistic that over the next several years, we'll have lots of conversations to talk about leveraging all of the construction that's going on in the real-time space and linking that construction into our front-end applications and weaving that construction into the backend of our real-time payment system. And that will, whether it's Mobiliti or Popmoney or RXP or Immediate Funds or something that we haven't thought of yet, all of the different functionality that exists in the DDA, I think the example we used at Investor Day was being able to make a payment through bill pay and get immediate credit at a bank where you have -- a consumer has a credit card account. We see that all as options and ways to help consumers use the real-time networks that are being built right now. I think one of the confusions, as you well know, is which rails are going to be built? And so while we are, to some extent, in the business of constructing those rails, we also don't think that there is a single ubiquitous rail that we can build. We think we can enable people to use some of our technologies and we will connect to other people's technologies. But we -- our ambition is to bring that real-time capability to our applications to enhance the consumer experience to hopefully drive revenue for the financial institution and value for the different users. So I know it's a longer -- maybe a longer answer, but that's how we're thinking about it right now."

What we have said is we see a couple of discrete opportunities, Agiliti is one of them where we can create a boost to our internal revenue growth rate. But at the end of the day, I think we have 6%, 7% of our revenue is international. It's going to be hard even if you're adding 1% of internal revenue growth, it's going to be hard just to call that essential to the company. To date, we have not seen large international acquisitions. I assume that you're asking question around large, that would make sense for our model. Frankly, we have seen so much opportunity in the U.S. right now that, that's where our focus is. We certainly look at some of the assets that become available. But for right now, the majority of the opportunity that we see international beyond the 6% or 7% of revenue that we're focused on today is really trying to make the world smaller, right? So allowing money to move more simply between the U.S. and Australia or the U.S. and India or the U.S. and wherever and back, right?

I think Tom was also talking about some of the timing of expenses that we believe that will hit us in Q4. But that said, one of the things that we've talked about over time is the combination of the revenue model that we're building, and the benefit of the Operational Effectiveness program really gives us more capacity to invest and grow the business or frankly not invest and let it flow through to the bottom line. So we're looking at that all the time quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year, month-on-month, depending on what's going on. Now you know well that we don't make large, it's hard for us to decide in a heartbeat to make a big capital investment. Most of our investment is through our P&L. It's linked to labor, so you have to hire people. So you can't make big decisions to change -- I can't make a big decision to change my expense trajectory next week.

128209,312625988,884153,"Fiserv, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2015",2015-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon everyone. We delivered strong third quarter results highlighted by the sequential acceleration of our internal revenue growth rate to 5%, excellent adjusted margin expansion and a 20% increase in adjusted earnings per",1092,"Thanks, Stephanie, and good afternoon everyone. We delivered strong third quarter results highlighted by the sequential acceleration of our internal revenue growth rate to 5%, excellent adjusted margin expansion and a 20% increase in adjusted earnings per share. These results are consistent with the ramp we expected this year and are indicative of the financial performance and continuing internal revenue growth acceleration we previewed at our June Investor Day.
Adjusted earnings per share is up 15% for the first 9 months of the year due to strong adjusted operating income growth and disciplined capital allocation. As a result, we have raised our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to $3.84 to $3.87, an increase of 14% to 15% over last year.
Consistent with our capital allocation strategy and in the face of equity market volatility in the quarter, we repurchased 6 million shares. We remain very committed to that strategy and through September 30, had already returned over $1 billion to shareholders.
Sales in the quarter was up sequentially over Q2 and came in at 86% of quota. This is a solid result in light of a tough prior year comparison and heightened expectations for increased performance. We're set up for a very strong finish to the year.
Now let me provide an update on our 2015 enterprise priorities, which are: first, to continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments; next, build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions; and third, deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiation and value for our clients.
Our first priority centers on building high-quality revenue in areas that support client value, margin expansion and earnings growth. Third quarter internal revenue growth accelerated 5% with strong performance across both segments. Businesses with high recurring revenue, such as account processing, payments, including card services, lending and biller solutions, all performed well. For reference, our reported results included negative currency impact of 70 basis points in the quarter and was 60 basis points year-to-date.
Growing revenue in areas where we have operating leverage, along with flexing our operational efficiency muscle, led to a 190 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin in the quarter and was up 150 basis points for the year. We believe our business model will produce continued operating margin expansion into the foreseeable future. We're pleased with our financial performance and are on track to meet our shareholder commitments.
Our second priority is to build and extend client relationships with an increased emphasis on payment and channel solutions. One of our key strategies is to partner with financial institutions to drive higher levels of digital engagement for our clients. We continue to gain momentum with our industry-leading mobile solutions in the quarter. With over 2,000 financial institution clients now live on Mobiliti ASP, we have seen a more than 50% increase in subscribers to nearly 4 million users as of September 30. We expanded our overall mobile footprint in the quarter, adding 100 new clients to the family. We were pleased that First Hawaiian Bank with $18.7 billion in assets selected a full suite of digital banking, payments and personal financial management capabilities from Fiserv, including Corillian Online, Mobiliti ASP, CheckFree RXP and Popmoney. These solutions will provide best-of-breed digital engagement to their customers and a lower total cost of ownership.
At our Investor Day, we also discussed opportunities to utilize payment speed and efficiency to create solutions that deliver unique value for consumers, financial institutions and billers. During the quarter, PNC, the eighth largest bank in the U.S., selected Popmoney for disbursements to do just that. This solution utilizes our Popmoney capabilities to simplify and expedite the business-to-consumer payment experience. In a test of payment receipt options, nearly 50% of consumers opted to receive funds via Popmoney. This use case is an important part of our integrated payment strategy and is one of the distinctive growth opportunities embedded in our DDA-based payment approach.
7 DNA clients went live in the quarter, and we remain on track for 30 installs this year. Importantly, we anticipate that 6 institutions with assets greater than $1 billion will go live in the fourth quarter, including Columbia Bank with $4.6 billion of assets; and the $14.4 billion asset institution, Washington Federal, all contributing to increased growth in Q4 and well beyond. We continue to be very pleased with DNA's momentum.
Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiation and value for our clients. One of our primary areas of innovation are solutions that create revenue for our clients. We recently highlighted our new CardValet product at our fall client forum. This solution enables debit card holders to take control over their spending patterns through the comfort of their mobile device. The early indications are extremely positive with CardValet users adding an average of 5 incremental debit transactions per month. On top of deeper customer engagement, financial institutions should also benefit from additional interchange revenue. Although early, over 200 clients have already signed up for CardValet. When live, this group of FIs will further empower their more than 4.5 million underlying debit cardholders, which should translate to new revenue over the short and mid-term. 
We're also excited about our Immediate Funds solution, which provides financial institutions tools to allow consumers real time access to deposited funds across branch, ATM and mobile channels. This is another example of a Fiserv solution, which creates value for consumers and new revenue for our clients.
EMV continued to progress in the quarter with an additional boost from the October 1 liability shift date. As you know, Fiserv both manufactures and personalizes EMV cards, giving us a competitive advantage along with multiple sources of revenue. Although demand has picked up, we only recognized about 10% or $1 million of the incremental EMV revenue generated in the quarter. The remaining $9 million will be deferred until the manufactured cards are personalized. We expect to see incremental revenue growth from EMV in the fourth quarter and well into 2016.
Lastly, we were very pleased to sign our first Agiliti client, Think Money Limited, in October. Think Money, which has been in existence for more than 20 years, provides a broad range of innovative financial products for personal financial management, mortgage and insurance services across more than 100,000 personal accounts today. The Agiliti pipeline remains strong, and we expect additional signings before the end of the year.
Now let me turn the call over to Tom to provide additional detail on our financial results."
128209,312625988,884153,"Fiserv, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2015",2015-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone.

We are pleased with our performance in the quarter. Internal revenue growth accelerated sequentially to 5%. These results included a 140 basis point negative impact due to a combination of unfavorable currency impacts and the EMV revenue deferral that Jeff mentioned earlier. Adjusted earnings per share was up a very strong 20% over the prior year to $1.03.
Adjusted revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter and $3.7 billion in the first 9 months of the year. Internal revenue growth was 4% year-to-date. Our continued focus on recurring revenue acceleration was highlighted by a 6% increase in processing and services revenue this quarter, offset by a decline in product revenue, due primarily to lower card reissuance revenue in Output Solutions. Combined license and termination fee revenue benefited revenue growth by 60 basis points in the quarter and 20 basis points year-to-date.
Adjusted operating income growth was excellent, increasing 11% in the quarter and 9% year-to-date to $411 million and $1.2 billion, respectively. Adjusted operating margin was up 190 basis points in the quarter to 33.1% and year-to-date was up 150 basis points to 32%. Margin performance across both segments was primarily driven by revenue growth in our scale processing businesses and cost efficiencies, including savings from our Operational Effectiveness programs.
Now on to the segment results. Internal revenue growth in the Payments segment was 6% in the quarter versus our strongest prior year quarter and up 5% year-to-date. Growth in our card services and biller businesses led the segment performance. While EMV production in our Output Solutions business increased, much of that revenue, $9 million, was deferred to future periods to the cards which have been fully manufactured as of quarter end but not yet personalized.
We have added nearly 100 new debit clients through September and have a solid pipeline of future activity. Our double-digit transaction growth so far this year remains ahead of the market.
Our integrated debit value proposition, along with continued solution innovation, such as CardValet and CardFree Cash is resonating well with the market. 
Bill payment transaction growth remained in the low single digits and we saw good traction in value-added services, such as same-day bill payment, which has transaction growth of 36% over last year. 
Mobile users continue to grow as we approach 4 million Mobiliti ASP subscribers at the end of the quarter. We continue to believe digital transformation is still early in the cycle and expect to see even more growth in the future as demand for digital services continues.
Payments segment adjusted operating income grew 8% in the quarter to $217 million and year-to-date is up 9% to $616 million. Segment adjusted operating margin expanded 80 basis points in the quarter to 33.7% and through September, is up 110 basis points to 32.7%, driven primarily by growth in our scale, recurring revenue businesses and cost efficiencies.
Internal revenue growth in the Financial segment was 4% in the quarter and 3% year-to-date. Growth in the quarter was driven primarily by strength in our account processing and lending businesses along with the positive impact of higher combined termination and license revenue, partially offset by currency.
Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was up 13% in the quarter to $218 million and up 9% to $631 million in the first 9 months of the year. Adjusted operating margin was 35.5% in the quarter and has increased 180 basis points to 34.8% year-to-date. Strong margin performance in the quarter was driven by scale business growth in areas, such as account processing and lending, higher one-time fees and benefits from our continued focus on operational efficiency.
Corporate segment adjusted net operating performance for the quarter and year-to-date are both in line with our expectations and consistent with the comparable prior year results. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 34.3% in the quarter and year-to-date is up 100 basis points to 34.7%, resulting in a $0.04 per share negative impact year-over-year. We expect our fourth quarter rate to approximate 36%.
Free cash flow was $666 million through September 30. Results were negatively impacted in the quarter by the timing of working capital, including a $60 million increase in tax payments compared to 2014. Our free cash flow does not include a $32 million cash distribution from our StoneRiver venture in the quarter. We anticipate stronger fourth quarter results due to working capital favorability, including lower tax payments. Free cash flow per share is up 5% year-to-date to $2.77.
Total debt at September 30 was $4.2 billion or 2.3x, our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We are deeply committed to creating value for our shareholders through disciplined capital allocation. We repurchased $514 million of our stock in the quarter, nearly equaling the amount in the first half of the year. For the first 3 quarters of the year, we have allocated over $1 billion to share repurchase, acquiring 12.9 million shares at an average price of $81 per share. As of quarter's end, there were 229.5 million shares outstanding and 6.9 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.
With that, I will turn the call back over to Jeff."

Actual sales performance was down a bit compared to the prior year's results, primarily from deals pushing to future quarters. Pipelines are solid across the board, including good traction with our newer solutions. We expect to finish our sales year strong, leading to excellent momentum going into '16.
Integrated sales in the quarter were $57 million, led by solutions, such as debit and credit services, Mobiliti, bill payment, Source Capture and statement processing. With integrated sales of $168 million through September, we expect to meet our $250 million target for the year.
Operational Effectiveness savings were up sequentially in the quarter and now at $44 million year-to-date. In addition to solid end year performance, we are building the foundation to achieve the new $250 million target we shared at Investor Day. We were pleased to complete the construction of our Alpharetta Campus in the quarter. 80% of our nearly 2,000 Atlanta-based associates from a number of locations are now housed in our new state-of-the-art facility. In conjunction with this project, we also consolidated 2 of our largest data centers, which we also expect will generate meaningful savings.
Although the financial institution environment remains generally stable, the conjecture and implications around interest rates were front and center in the quarter. M&A activity is progressing at elevated levels, which we expect will continue. While regulatory and efficiency remain in focus, we are starting to see early movement by financial institutions towards revenue-focused solutions that deliver end-user value at the intersection of real time, digital and evolving consumer expectations.
As I mentioned upfront, we are well positioned to achieve our 2015 financial objectives, which include our third consecutive year of increased internal revenue growth. We are tightening our internal revenue growth guidance to 5% for the full year, which would translate to approximately 6% revenue growth in the fourth quarter. That performance would cap off a strong second half of the year and serve as an attractive exit run rate for 2016.
We have raised our full year adjusted earnings per share target to a range of $3.84 to $3.87, which at 14% to 15% growth is above the top end of our previous guidance of $3.73 to $3.83. We also expect that adjusted operating margin will increase well over 50 basis points for the full year, and that free cash flow per share will be at least $4.12 for the year.
Although we are in sight of delivering our 30th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, we are far more excited about the future. We are providing a unique set of solutions that enable our clients to best serve their customers, which should drive high-quality revenue growth for Fiserv into the future. 
We know our success is dependent on more than 21,000 talented associates who partner with our thousands of clients around the world. We are grateful for the difference they make each and every day. Speaking of talented associates, earlier today, we filed an 8-K announcing that after more than 20 years at Fiserv, the last 10 of them as CFO, Tom Hirsch intends to retire on March 31, 2016. Tom is leaving for personal reasons and does not have plans to pursue comparable employment outside of Fiserv. He will also be available, as needed, after March for special projects and to ensure a smooth transition. Tom is a stellar executive with deep business acumen and tremendous passion for the company and its clients. He has been instrumental in the transformation of Fiserv, working with the team to deliver strong results and set an even more attractive course for the future.
On a personal note, Tom has been a great partner, confidant and friend. In typical form, he will be more than fully engaged until he walks out the door and when he closes the ledger for the last time, he will be missed. 
With that said, transition and change breed opportunity. Tom and his family will embark on a new chapter of their life and so will the company. We intend to consider a full slate of internal and external candidates for this highly desirable role. We have a strong finance leadership team, which we believe will ensure a smooth transition, and we expect to make a decision on a new CFO no later than January 31.
With that, Cindy, let's open the line for questions."

So while the first few quarters have been a little bit light, we expect quite a strong fourth quarter. We typically have had larger deals in the middle of the year.

And we have meaningfully ramped up their implementations. I would guess that we'll do more implementations in the fourth quarter than that business did in the prior 12 to 18 months. So we have ramped it up nicely. And we are finding to the extent that there are any issues and there have been very few, but if there are any issues, they are not coming from us. They're coming on the client side. And these have also tended to be larger, multiple product implementations. Again, so they've got a level of complexity, and the team has dealt with them beautifully. Most of the clients are referenceable, if not on day 1, on day 3 or 4. So we're feeling very good about the implementations to date, and that's one of the reasons why we have great momentum in the market."

And at the same time, at some point, we will likely be able to reduce the size of our implementation team within DNA. But frankly, that's the last thing we want to do. I'd like nothing better than to be building that implementation team out even further because we're winning lots of deals there. The majority of this next phase of $250 million of Operational Effectiveness saves is going to come from looking to become more efficient in our real estate footprint, looking to bring together some of our dispersed data centers, and also looking for ways to get better leverage out of our dispersed workforce. So those are the big 3 ways that we see that we're going to knock down that $250 million. Remember also in our Operational Effectiveness savings, they're going to be a little lumpy by quarter, right? And so we had a very good quarter this year, I think we're just about $5 million to $6 million away from our target for the year. Hopefully, we'll stay ahead of that as we can, but we continue to build that muscle and we feel good about our ability for the next few years to use that to create supplemental margin moving forward."

Regarding the termination fees, I know, David, as you well know, right, it's kind of the normal part of our business and they vary period to period. The combined license and termination fees were up about $6 million to $7 million in the third quarter and year-to-date compared to the prior year. To your question specifically, termination fees overall were up by approximately $10 million year-to-date and for the quarter. This was offset, however, by a decrease of about $5 million in license fees year-to-date and for the quarter. And just as a reminder, we had negative currency impact in the quarter of about $8 million and $20 million on a year-to-date basis, which more than offset those increases. And as Jeff highlighted, we had to defer about $9 million of EMV revenue in the quarter due to the fact that we've completed the manufacturing element. But have not personalized the cards, which is a smaller part of that, which will happen. And so with that, that's the numbers on the termination fee side."

We're able to offset some smaller term fees -- I'm sorry, smaller license revenue. You have all kinds of things going on. I guess the only point I would make is because of how we've shaped the model, whether that revenue comes in through a Mobiliti user or it comes in from a one -- kind of a onetime or occasional revenue, the drop throughs are going to get better and better because of how we're managing the cost base overall. And that -- we like that because obviously, it gives us the margin and some business model expense leverage, but it also gives us the ability to invest at times where there are opportunities for us to invest. And so we -- as you know, we're committed to raising margins 50 to 100 basis points a year.

There's a big war that's going on at point-of-sale, whether it's MCX or whatever's going on out there, there's a lot of that. And we're really focused on the DDA-based payments beyond point-of-sale, and that's both payments and deposits. And so the product that we talked about that was Immediate Funds, that's around deposits. The disbursement product, that's not necessarily leveraging realtime, although certainly, the businesses will have the opportunity to decide if they want to use a real-time rail to make that payment. And I only set that up as context because the answer is, I'm optimistic that over the next several years, we'll have lots of conversations to talk about leveraging all of the construction that's going on in the real-time space and linking that construction into our front-end applications and weaving that construction into the backend of our real-time payment system. And that will, whether it's Mobiliti or Popmoney or RXP or Immediate Funds or something that we haven't thought of yet, all of the different functionality that exists in the DDA, I think the example we used at Investor Day was being able to make a payment through bill pay and get immediate credit at a bank where you have -- a consumer has a credit card account. We see that all as options and ways to help consumers use the real-time networks that are being built right now. I think one of the confusions, as you well know, is which rails are going to be built? And so while we are, to some extent, in the business of constructing those rails, we also don't think that there is a single ubiquitous rail that we can build. We think we can enable people to use some of our technologies and we will connect to other people's technologies. But we -- our ambition is to bring that real-time capability to our applications to enhance the consumer experience to hopefully drive revenue for the financial institution and value for the different users. So I know it's a longer -- maybe a longer answer, but that's how we're thinking about it right now."

I know there's been a lot of DNA wins, you've had some good wins also like First Hawaiian and, et cetera, including some Corillian stuff. I'm just curious, the year's almost done, have you seen in hindsight here a bigger appetite for conversions, and how does that feel going into next year on the conversion side?"

We have -- there's more discussion and movement on the real-time core processing side of the house. We are not seeing a lot more activity below that level. We're seeing a lot of competition in that -- in the smaller -- kind of in the $1 billion and below -- in the below space, and so there's a lot of activity there. But we are seeing processes, RFP processes, evaluation processes going on. We've been pleased that we've been involved in that. We've actually been down selected once or twice in pretty big evaluations, which is something that we would not have been able to do frankly had we not acquired DNA. So we are seeing some activity there. I think that'll manifest over time. One of the beauties to that is the institutions that are doing the evaluation tend to know us because they're -- maybe they're a Corillian client, they're very likely a bill pay client. In that space, we've got a number of really important solutions, the PEP+. PEP+ client, so they're using our technologies and so we have a relationship with them. Whether that will ultimately get us over the finish line, we'll see. But we do think it has them give us more consideration than if we were one of the new kids on the block."

So we did $10 million of EMV -- incremental EMV manufacturing in the third quarter, which is much more significant than the second. We had to defer $9 million of that to future periods. But as we laid out on kind of Investor Day as Mark laid out, right, this 2015 is going to be the low water point. And it's building nicely as we look out into '16 and '17. And so that's the way I would phrase that. But, Jeff, I don't know if you wanted to add something else to that."

If you go back and look at what we've laid out for Investor Day, I mean, that would have been the start of a very attractive run for us. So the answer is yes. We saw a lot more production. We ended up needing to defer the $9 million of the $10 million, and we believe that, that deferral will stay constant for a while, right? And so if you look through that, we would expect to be able to recognize a more normal amount of revenue moving forward."

We announced a partnership with them at our Investor Day. We're doing some very interesting work on the realtime side. Now they have not traditionally been in the real-time payment world. They're in the real-time data exchange world, and they're going to build out some capabilities. We're building a nice partnership with them, and we expect this to be quite positive for the industry. Remember, clearXchange is the -- really the backend of the process, where they're enabling some of the engines for those institutions. Those institutions still need front-end applications. A number of those institutions that are in clearXchange, as well as another 2,000, more than 2,000, around the system use our front-end. So I'm hopeful and optimistic that this will move the industry closer to more ubiquity in allowing consumers to move money at the speed of their choice, so we're quite excited about it."
