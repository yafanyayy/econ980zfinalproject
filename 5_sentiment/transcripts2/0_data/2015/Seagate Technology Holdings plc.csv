Seagate demonstrated strong financial performance in the December quarter, achieving revenues of $3.7 billion; and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margin of 28.2%; net income of $452 million; and diluted earnings per share of $1.35. Our results this quarter reflect revenue in line with our expectations and sequential margin improvement. We had record storage shipments of 61.3 exabytes, up 17% year-over-year, with average gigabytes per drive for the quarter increasing sequentially and continuing to average over 1 terabyte per drive. 
Cash flow generation was again strong in the December quarter and we achieved $670 million in operating cash flow and $455 million in free cash flow, excluding the partial payment for the arbitration award from Western Digital of $773 million. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $546 million, slightly lower than our expectations due primarily to expense control around the core business and commensurate with our revenue growth. Capital expenditures were in line with our expectations, and inventory, both internally and externally, are within manageable levels. 
Our balance sheet remains healthy and we ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We raised approximately $500 million in debt and retired approximately $375 million in principal of higher cost debt this quarter, effectively staggering and extending our debt maturities. We believe we are the first high-tech BBB- company to issue a 20-year coupon which is a testament to the market's confidence and our management team, the strength of our technology portfolio and our financial and business policies. 
Turning to our outlook, while we are generally optimistic about calendar year 2015 in terms of the demand for storage and overall economic activity especially that of the United States, we are tempered somewhat by the instability of the European business environment, as well as the commodity and currency volatility throughout the world. For example, Europe represents approximately 20% of our revenues and in retail, we would have historically experienced an increase of about 5% revenue in the December quarter, and in fact, it declined by about 5%. While we expect Europe to be challenged economically for most of 2015, it's difficult to assess the degree of impact this will have on revenue and demand. While Central Bank activity can alleviate some of the issues that are impacting specific country growth issues globally, these instruments are, by design, temporary and given the low level of interest rates we are now experiencing, are by definition less effective at least in the measure of providing cheaper credit. 
While our forecasting continues to contain a sense of caution due to these macroeconomic conditions, the trends we are seeing in the marketplace continue to align with our long-term expectations for exabyte demand and the growing need for economic growth and efficient storage. Industry estimates for the HDD market demand are forecasting a seasonal decrease -- sorry, and we believe TAM will be approximately 135 million units in the March quarter. This was primarily driven by a seasonal decline in the client and retail market, which is also expected to be the low quarter for the calendar year. Traditional enterprise market is estimated to follow seasonal patterns as well, although this market has been more resilient than we have forecasted over the last several quarters. 
The cloud enterprise market is estimated to be relatively flat, reflecting continued demand strength for high-capacity storage. We anticipate the cloud market will exhibit relative strength throughout the calendar year as the acceleration which began last quarter continues. We are experiencing supply constraints in some key products for this market, and we expect to be supply-challenged for the next few quarters based on current demand signals. 
Pricing in the client and cloud enterprise market was slightly more aggressive than the December quarter than the 5 prior quarters. In some accounts, we participated, and in others, we did not. As we look ahead, we believe this is a temporal issue related to specific industry conditions. Given the increasing demand trend from a broad base of customers towards the higher capacity products, we also believe this level of price erosion is unsustainable to fund the required capital and R&D investments needed in our industry. We anticipate we will need to drive margin expansion at least towards the higher end or long-term range of 27% to 32%, to fund the long term capital and R&D budgets related to the increased demand for cloud-based storage products. 
Seagate's product portfolio is well-positioned competitively in this demand environment and we expect to achieve revenue of at least $3.45 billion in the March quarter. We are planning our non-GAAP gross margin to be up sequentially and at least 28.5% due primarily to seasonal product mix shifts while also taking into account continued dilution impact from our recent acquisitions. We are planning for operating expenses of approximately $570 million in both the March and the June quarters. These expenses include some increases in core R&D as we refresh nearly our entire HDD and SSD product portfolio this calendar year, as well as investments in our new market adjacencies. 
Based on customer engagements to date, we are encouraged that our value proposition for cloud computing is gaining traction and our revenue potential is slightly greater than our original expectations. I thank our employees for their hard work, and our customers, vendors and suppliers and shareholders for their ongoing support. I'll open up for questions."

I think it's really the relationship between the cloud space and the client space. And the client pricing, even though it's quite low, continues to be kind of strangely aggressive, and the reason I say strangely is that most of those components are low capacity for most part. You have a lot of single disc, 2-headed products there. So you don't have a lot of cost opportunities, and yet in a demand environment that's been volatile, relatively fell flat both in notebook and desktop, if you take a 1-year perspective, there's not a lot of movement for absorption or cost reductions from especially the single part component companies. So continued price aggression there kind of doesn't make a lot of sense but there were certain market segments, for example, in retail where a couple of our competitors seem to be battling it to the end of who can have the last half a point of market share. It's just been kind of silly. It relates to the cloud market in that people can manage their overall gross margin obviously because the cloud products, by virtue of their increased difficulty of manufacturing and tests do carry higher margins, the reality is given the shift that we've had towards high-capacity, we won't be able to match supply long-term at these margin structures because the shift to high end, it requires a lot more tests, it requires a lot more heads and disks, the harder the machines to make and, therefore, we have to have margin structures, I think in the 30% to 32% range to fund the mix change that we've seen already. The mix change that we're at is probably a year ahead than where we thought we would be. So I think we view it more holistically of what's happening across the portfolio and it just doesn't seem sustainable for the industry to continue like this. I think the -- as it relates to your specific topic, Seagate does have some product leadership in particular categories. We're very constraint that obviously relates to pricing that remains more firm. As I indicated, there's a couple of classes of product that were effectively sold out through the rest of the year subject to what we can do on the manufacturing side to increase supply. As I do think that in the last few weeks, we've seen some firming around the pricing on cloud, but I think the reality is to really get to the investment rates that we need long-term, we're going to have to see an end in the erosion as we can basically rebuild the margin profile."

I think the whole balance between notebook and desktop has been interesting and dynamic over the last calendar year to say the least. We had a start of the year that had a lot of relative strength in desktop, especially relative to what people were projecting. And then the second half of the year kind of really flipped to the other way where the relative performance was on the notebook side. I think as we left the December quarter, we were, I suppose discouraged a bit by the lack of momentum in the client space, which I think again lends to some of the consciousness that we're seeing, as well as some of Intel's forecast was about 7% down on their revenue estimate. That's probably not nearly the pricing pressures we have. So I think the client space is a bit influx. It feels for us right now that actually I lean off that maybe desktop demand is doing well already these few weeks in the quarter, whereas notebooks seems to be having troubles getting started. But I think it's a going constant dance between the 2. And again what you're probably looking at is relatively small growth, single, low single digit percentages on a TAM basis on the calendar year. That just doesn't support the price aggression that we've seen in the marketplace. So I think it's something the industry is going to figure out and I think our supply chain is being pretty firm with this, that they just don't have additional cost to give us especially again after a single part provider to each platform."

That business began to pick up a couple of quarters ago after, as we know, a few quarters of less than expected growth. And we all talked about was that a function of deployment, was that a function of utilization rates, or was that a function of time to deployment. And our thesis was that it was probably time to deployment and utilization rates and that there would be an acceleration and that's going to what I think you're seeing backdrop of end user demand hasn't slowed. And again, anything that's high content video is just going to drive more and more demand for that class of storage. So I think for Seagate, the portfolio is quite strong. Our position in 6-terabyte is really good, and we see a big demand profile. I think for a lot of the CSPs especially the top 15, they almost take any amount of capacity for spend that you can give them. If we had an 8 or 10 terabyte drive, they take it, they have software that knows how to manage that much data on the spindle now. So as our portfolio shift to that, I think we've had some relative advantage and that's helped the margin. But again, the client -- the client space is aggressive and it all mixes up. I think the other thing to remember though is our new businesses, and I'm not sure this has been modeled well, but I'm not sure we've been probably able to give you as much detail to model it well. So I'm not being thoughtful. But our cloud business is dilutive to gross margin. That's a business I think that we've described. We're going to grow into the margin. We were adding revenue, we have really excellent confidence in the revenue profile going forward, if anything like I said, I think, we're probably either in the June quarter call or we'll do it at the analyst meeting, we'll reset our revenue expectations. But again, that business comes in at a lower than corporate gross margin and we will grow into it, we will exceed the corporate gross margin when the thing is all flushed out. But I think that was probably a little bit heavier in the quarter than we would have expected and the client pricing was a little bit expected in the quarter so those were the 2 main driver offset as you point out by better margin from the higher demand for our cloud products."

But let me say this way, that, that product has long lead times on wafer and it has a lot of tests. So between wafer and test, we're looking at 20 plus weeks of supply chain that has to be managed. And so if the customer set isn't fully -- doesn't have that fully baked in the ordering system or if they're seeing demand increases that are inside those lead times, it creates a lot of stress on the system. So what we're seeing now is a lot of stress on the system for the demand that we see this quarter and next, let's say. We can't really do much about this quarter, unless we have yield improvements right because we have either a wafer issue or a test issue that's more than the quarter in duration. For next quarter, we can start to line some things up, but it's really all the work we have to do for the September quarter and the December quarter and, of course, for that, we have to go back to our customers and kind of say these are pretty firm orders because we're going to do a lot of things to our supply chain to accommodate our demand which will impact our total portfolio. So it's pretty dynamic right now, and it's a good problem to have. But the lead times on this class of product, it's not like calling up and saying I need another million notebook drives.

So I think net, net we will see a little growth. I think the real issue is what's the nature of the growth and what's the class of machine that people are offering in. I think the biggest opportunity in the industry is going to see, I don't think it's a calendar '15 event, by the way. I think it's probably a calendar '16 event. But there will be smarter client. If we believe half of what we say of the value of the cloud, while it does talk to into some applications, a lighter client, it also talks to a richer client. And so whether or not that's greater compute or greater storage or greater bandwidth capabilities, especially for the knowledge worker and the value creator, these machines have to get more sophisticated not less. I don't think that's really been kind of thought through completely. Things like Chromebook are gaining a lot of attention, but when you think about the use case of a Chromebook, let's just hope that's not where the world is going, to check my e-mail and weather and that's all I do. I have a lot more faith in humanity than that. I actually think we're going to see a big rotation on the client in '16.

With the backdrop of that, we see where that revenue coming from and how we model that, and we feel pretty confident in this range. But as Steve said, that range needs to expand. And that's the backdrop of the erosion comments because the cost to deploy these are getting greater and greater. You see that in the gross margin and just as importantly as the OpEx as we fundamentally refresh. So I think we feel fairly confident on this gross margin in staying in this range, but that is on the backdrop that the erosion needs to slow down. The cost takedowns have continued to happen, but remember, these products are long in the tooth, that's why you see the OpEx with refresh almost the entire portfolio this year. So that's part of that as well. So the gross margin, I think, it's modeled pretty straight and it's this classic how much price you can afford to make these investments.

So maybe could you talk about all the investments we've seen in the business? When can we see pickup in top line and the impact, basically inflection in revenue?"

We, basically we're engaged with a few significant opportunities that I think will put us in a position of changing that revenue forecast. And to date, the growth has been strong. We're happy with the engagement that we have, even just based on what we've done. We will probably be ahead of what we anticipated, we're going to be for fiscal '15 or fiscal '16, but there are few opportunities that could change that in a more material way which certainly justify the tiny incremental investment that we're making in the OpEx side, increasing the OpEx by $10 million to $15 million to get the type of revenue opportunity that we think in front of us we're quite confident is the right thing to do, and hopefully we'll have more details on that, again, either after June call and certainly after the September update."

So a lot of people forget, I mean and I get it, because of the 2 entities owned by a few parent corps but the reality is given the wholesale agreement, that's been dictated by the Chinese government, there are 5 competitors in the notebook space and in the desktop space, although Toshiba is maybe not quite as strong there in the notebook space. So I think and so that and it gets resolved. We're going to have this imbalance and again it's just an economic dislocation of that. It will adjust one way or the other. Secondly, I think in the retail space, there's been a battle between 2 of our competitors that just are refusing at this point to either give up share or not stop trying to gain share at kind of at no matter what cost. And we don't quite understand if that's okay. We'll just walk away from business it doesn't make sense to redeploy our assets and our products where we can make more money. Again, that will end up creating a shortage which then will be self-adjusting somewhere down the stream. In terms of vertical integration in the industry, it's an interesting point. I don't know that it's necessary from like -- what's happening with pricing. I think the real issue is around continuity of supply under critical key components, especially again those components that aren't gaining the value that we gain at the drive level at the shift to the high end, it's more heads and disks. That's our 2 most expensive areas for capital and R&D if you take them together. So we get the absorption we need with that shift, but if you're just selling one part per device, it's a tough world when TAM's growing so that creates stresses on the supply chain. That may need to either have tighter relationships in terms of the up and downstream suppliers or, I guess, theoretically could result in some types of consolidation in spaces that are critical components that either us or our competitors will worry about in terms of continuity of supply. So more to come I suppose in terms of how does that really play out. In terms of buyback, we're still in the position that we were that when we have the last call, the stock was momentarily sub 60. We said at these levels, we would be aggressive, that's still our position. We would buy for anti-dilution and would be opportunistic about buying below there. So, again, we're thinking our buyback's over this fiscal year and next fiscal year, and we want to continue to commit to return capital at the levels that we've indicated. So I don't think we're in the [indiscernible] of that front in terms of buybacks of the dividends or total amount of capital that returned to shareholders and will be advantageous where we can. But I think, like we said before, below 60, we believe is pretty attractive and then it's just a function of timing."

I look at it more as where is the exabyte growth overall relative to areal density growth. And then also thinking about it in terms of absorption of heads and disk channel capabilities and tests. And all of those measures are still moving in a way that says we're constrained, that whether or not you think of whether it's heads or disks or test time or lead times or complexity channel or exabyte growth relative to areal density growth, they're all ahead of areal density growth that the industry can provide right now.

I think part of it is just again the momentum. December is always a tricky quarter because sometimes the momentum accelerates and sometimes it decreases and sometimes that impacts what happens in the March quarter, and sometimes it doesn't. So it definitely slowed down on the client side in December. That has this cautious. And frankly the issues around currency and what's going on in Europe, I just think it's wiser to aim for the lower TAM and we can obviously leverage up a couple of million units pretty easily as an industry versus overproducing. And again, I have to look at the Intel midpoint, and that's a company that doesn't have a lot of price pressure, and they kind of guided down 7% in the midpoint of the range. So we have to take that as an input as well.

Seagate demonstrated strong financial performance in the December quarter, achieving revenues of $3.7 billion; and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margin of 28.2%; net income of $452 million; and dilu",907,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Seagate demonstrated strong financial performance in the December quarter, achieving revenues of $3.7 billion; and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margin of 28.2%; net income of $452 million; and diluted earnings per share of $1.35. Our results this quarter reflect revenue in line with our expectations and sequential margin improvement. We had record storage shipments of 61.3 exabytes, up 17% year-over-year, with average gigabytes per drive for the quarter increasing sequentially and continuing to average over 1 terabyte per drive. 
Cash flow generation was again strong in the December quarter and we achieved $670 million in operating cash flow and $455 million in free cash flow, excluding the partial payment for the arbitration award from Western Digital of $773 million. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $546 million, slightly lower than our expectations due primarily to expense control around the core business and commensurate with our revenue growth. Capital expenditures were in line with our expectations, and inventory both internally and externally are within manageable levels. 
Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We raised approximately $500 million in debt and retired approximately $375 million in principal of higher cost debt this quarter, effectively staggering and extending our debt maturities. We believe we are the first high-tech BBB- company to issue a 20-year coupon which is a testament to the market's confidence and our management team, the strength of our technology portfolio and our financial and business policies. 
Turning to our outlook. While we are generally optimistic about calendar year 2015 in terms of the demand for storage and overall economic activity, especially that of the United States, we are tempered somewhat by the instability of the European business environment, as well as the commodity and currency volatility throughout the world. For example, Europe represents approximately 20% of our revenues, and in retail, we would have historically experienced an increase of about 5% revenue in the December quarter, and in fact, it declined by about 5%. While we expect Europe to be challenged economically for most of 2015, it's difficult to assess the degree of impact this will have on revenue and demand. While Central Bank activity can alleviate some of the issues that are impacting specific country growth issues globally, these instruments are, by design, temporary, and given the low level of interest rates we are now experiencing, are by definition less effective at least on the measure of providing cheaper credit. 
While our forecasting continues to maintain a sense of caution due to these macroeconomic conditions, the trends we are seeing in the marketplace continue to align with our long-term expectations for exabyte demand and the growing need for economical and efficient storage. Industry estimates for the HDD market demand are forecasting a seasonal decrease -- sorry, and we believe TAM will be approximately 135 million units in the March quarter. This was primarily driven by a seasonal decline in the client and retail market, which is also expected to be the low quarter for the calendar year. The traditional enterprise market is estimated to follow seasonal patterns as well, although this market has been more resilient than we have forecasted over the last several quarters. 
The cloud enterprise market is estimated to be relatively flat, reflecting continued demand strength for high capacity storage. We anticipate the cloud market will exhibit relative strength throughout the calendar year, as the acceleration which began last quarter continues. We are experiencing supply constraints in some key products in this market, and we expect to be supply-challenged for the next few quarters based on current demand signals. 
Pricing in the client and cloud enterprise market was slightly more aggressive than the December quarter than the 5 prior quarters. In some accounts, we participated, and in others, we did not. As we look ahead, we believe this is a temporal issue related to specific industry conditions. Given the increasing demand trend from a broad base of customers towards the higher capacity products, we also believe this level of price erosion is unsustainable to fund the required capital and R&D investments needed in our industry. We anticipate we will need to drive margin expansion at least towards the higher end or long-term range of 27% to 32% to fund the long term capital and R&D budgets related to the increased demand for cloud-based storage products. 
Seagate's product portfolio is well-positioned competitively in this demand environment, and we expect to achieve revenue of at least $3.45 billion in the March quarter. We are planning our non-GAAP gross margin to be up sequentially and at least 28.5% due primarily to seasonal product mix shifts, while also taking into account continued dilution impact from our recent acquisitions. We are planning for operating expenses of approximately $570 million in both the March and the June quarters. These expenses include some increases in core R&D, as we refresh nearly our entire HDD and SSD product portfolio this calendar year, as well as investments in our new market adjacencies. 
Based on customer engagements to date, we are encouraged that our value proposition for cloud computing is gaining traction and our revenue potential is slightly greater than our original expectations. I thank our employees for their hard work and our customers, vendors and suppliers and shareholders for their ongoing support. Let me now open it up for questions."

I think it's really relationship between the cloud space and the client space. And the client pricing, even though it's quite low, continues to be kind of strangely aggressive, and the reason I say strangely is that most of those components are low capacity for the most part. You have a lot of single-disc, 2-headed products there. So you don't have a lot of cost opportunities, and yet, in a demand environment that's been volatile, relatively fell flat both in notebook and desktop if you take a 1-year perspective. There's not a lot of movement for absorption or cost reductions from especially the single part component companies. So continued price aggression there kind of doesn't make a lot of sense, but there are certain market segments, for example, in retail where a couple of our competitors seem to be battling it to the end of who can have the last 0.5 point of market share. It's just been kind of silly. It relates to the cloud market in that people can manage their overall gross margin, obviously, because the cloud products, by virtue of the increased difficulty of manufacturing and tests, do carry higher margins. The reality is given the shift that we've had towards high-capacity, we won't be able to match supply long-term at these margin structures because the shift to high end, it requires a lot more tests. It requires a lot more heads and disks, harder machines to make, and therefore, we have to have margin structures, I think in the 30% to 32% range to fund the mix change that we've seen already. The mix change that we're at is probably a year ahead of where we thought we would be. So I think we view it more holistically of what's happening across the portfolio, and it just doesn't seem sustainable for the industry to continue like this. I think the -- as it relates to your specific topic, Seagate does have some product leadership in particular categories. We're very constrained. That obviously relates to pricing that remains more firm. As I indicated, there's a couple of classes of product that were effectively sold out through the rest of the year subject to what we can do on the manufacturing side to increase supply. So I do think that in the last few weeks, we've seen some firming around the pricing on cloud, but I think the reality is to really get the investment rates that we need long-term. We're going to have to see an end of the erosion, so we can basically rebuild the margin profile."

I think that the whole balance between notebook and desktop has been interesting and dynamic over the last calendar year to say the least. We had a start of the year that had a lot of relative strength in desktop, especially relative to what people were projecting. And then the second half of the year kind of really flipped the other way, where the relative performance was on the notebook side. I think as we left the December quarter, we were, I suppose, discouraged a bit by the lack of momentum in the client space, which I think again lends to some of the cautiousness that we're seeing, as well as Intel's forecast was about 7% down on their revenue estimate, and that's what the -- probably not nearly the pricing pressures we have. So I think the client space is a bit influx. It feels for us right now that, actually, I'd lean off that maybe desktop demand is doing well already these few weeks in the quarter, whereas notebooks seems to be having troubles getting started, but I think it's just going to be this constant dance between the 2. And again what you're probably looking at is relatively small growth, single, low-single-digit percentages on a TAM basis through the calendar year, and that just doesn't support the price aggression that we've seen in the marketplace. So I think it's something the industry is going to figure out, and I think our supply chain is being pretty firm with this that they just don't have additional cost to give us especially, again, at their single part providers to each platform."

That business began to pick up a couple of quarters ago after, as we know, a few quarters of less than expected growth. And we all talked about was that a function of deployment, was that a function of utilization rates or was that a function of time to deployment. And our thesis was it was probably time to deployment and utilization rates, and that there'd be an acceleration, and that's kind of what I think we're seeing. I think the backdrop of end user demand hasn't slowed, and again, anything that's high content video is just going to drive more and more demand for that class of storage. So I think for Seagate, the portfolio is quite strong. Our position in 6-terabyte is really good, and we see a big demand profile. I mean, I think for a lot of the CSPs, especially the top 15, they'd almost take any amount of capacity per spindle that you could give them. If we had an 8 or 10 terabyte drive, they'd take it. They have software that knows how to manage that much data on their spindle now. So as our portfolio shift to that, I think we've had some relative advantage, and that's helped the margin. But again, the client -- the client space is aggressive, and it all mixes up. I think the other thing to remember, though, is on our new businesses, and I'm not sure this has been modeled well, but I'm not sure that we've been probably able to give you as much detail to model it well. So I'm not being thoughtful, but our client -- our cloud business is dilutive to gross margin. That's a business, I think, that we've described. We're going to grow into the margin. We're adding revenue. We have really excellent confidence in the revenue profile going forward. If anything, like I said, I think, we're probably either in the June quarter call or we'll do it at the Analyst Meeting. We'll reset our revenue expectations, but again, that business comes in at a lower than corporate gross margin, and we will grow into it. We will exceed the corporate gross margin when the thing is all flushed out, but I think that was probably a little bit heavier in the quarter than we would have expected, and then the client pricing was a little bit heavier than we would have expected in the quarter. So those were the 2 main drivers, offset, as you pointed out, by better margin from the higher demand for our cloud products."

So between wafer and the test, you're looking at 20-plus weeks of supply chain that has to be managed, and so if the customer set isn't fully -- doesn't have that fully baked into their ordering system or if they're seeing demand increases that are inside those lead times, it creates a lot of stress on the system. So what we're seeing now is a lot of stress on the system for the demand that we see this quarter and next, let's say. We can't really do much about this quarter unless we have yield improvements, right, because you've got either a wafer issue or a test issue that's more than the quarter in duration. For next quarter, we can start to line some things up, but it's really all the work we have to do for the September quarter and the December quarter, and of course, for that, we have to go back to our customers and kind of say, ""These are pretty firm orders because we're going to do a lot of things to our supply chain to accommodate that demand, which will impact our total portfolio."" So it's pretty dynamic right now, and it's a good problem to have. But the lead times on this class of product, it's not like calling up and saying, ""I need another million notebook drives."" I mean, these are complicated machines."

We're looking at -- from the customer demand side, it looks like June quarter will be up versus March on the client side, and I think, and obviously September, and December are typically up as well. So I think net, net we will see a little growth. I think the real issue is what's the nature of the growth and what's the class of machine that people are offering in. I think the biggest opportunity the industry is going to see, I don't think it's a calendar '15 event, by the way. I think it's probably a calendar '16 event, but there will be a smarter client. If we believe half of what we say about the value of the cloud, while it does talk to in some applications, a lighter client, it also talks to a richer client. And so whether or not that's greater compute or greater storage or greater bandwidth capabilities, especially for the knowledge worker and the value creator, these machines have to get more sophisticated, not less. And I don't think that's really been kind of thought through completely. Things like Chromebook are gaining a lot of attention, but when you think about the use case of a Chromebook, let's just hope that's not the world -- where the world is going, to check my e-mail and weather, and that's all I do, and I have a lot more faith in humanity than that, and I actually think we're going to see a big rotation in the client in '16.

We still feel confident that's growing. With the backdrop of that, we see where that revenue's coming from and how we model that, and we feel pretty confident in this range. But as Steve said, that range needs to expand, and that's the backdrop of the erosion comments because the cost to deploy these are getting greater and greater. You see that in the gross margin, and just as importantly as the OpEx as we fundamentally refresh. So I think we feel fairly confident on this gross margin in staying in this range, but that is on the backdrop that the erosion needs to slow down. The cost takedowns have continued to happen, but remember, these products are long in the tooth, and that's why you see the OpEx with the refresh of almost the entire portfolio this year. So that's part of that as well. So the gross margin, I think, it's modeled pretty straight, and it's this classic, how much price you can afford to make these investments, and that's where it's lining up, and so we feel pretty confident we can hit these numbers."

So I think for the next couple of quarters, we have underpinned cost takedowns that we're confident we can deliver relative to the shift in the portfolio, and then after that, we get a whole new product line that's going to help us on both the HDD and the SSD side. And then, I think, going forward, while that margin profile feels secure, my point was a little different. It's got to be higher than that though to maintain the level of investments that we need if the shift to cloud versus client continues at the rate it is, and I think that's the challenge for the industry."

So a lot of people forget, I mean, and I get it, because of 2 of the entities owned by, if you will, parent corps. But the reality is, given the hold separate agreement, that's been dictated by the Chinese government, there are 5 competitors in the notebook space and in the desktop space, although Toshiba is maybe not quite as strong there as they are in the notebook space. So I think -- and so that kind of gets resolved. We're going to have this imbalance, and again, it's an economic dislocation of that. It will adjust one way or the other. Secondly, I think in the retail space, there's been a battle between 2 of our competitors that just are refusing at this point to either give up share or not stop trying to gain share at kind of -- at no matter what cost, and we don't quite understand it, but that's okay. We'll just walk away from business where it doesn't make sense and redeploy our assets in our products where we can make more money. Again, that will end up creating a shortage, which then will be self-adjusting somewhere down the stream. In terms of vertical integration in the industry, it's an interesting point. I don't know that it's necessary from like -- what's happening with pricing. I think the real issue is around continuity of supply under critical key components, and especially, again, those components that aren't gaining the value that we gain at the drive level of the shift to the high end. It's more heads and disks. That's our 2 most expensive areas for capital and R&D if you take them together. So we get the absorption we need with that shift, but if you're just selling one part per device, it's a tough world when TAM's not growing, and so that creates stresses on the supply chain. That may need to either have tighter relationships in terms of the up and downstream suppliers or I guess, theoretically, could result in some types of consolidation in spaces that are critical components that either us or our competitors will worry about in terms of continuity of supply. So more to come, I suppose, in terms of how does that really play out. In terms of buyback, I think, we're still in the position that we were that when we have the last call and the stock was momentarily sub-60, we said at these levels, we would be aggressive, and that's still our position. We will buy for anti-dilution and then we'll be opportunistic about buying below there. So again, we're thinking our buyback's over this fiscal year, next fiscal year, and we want to continue to commit to return capital at the levels that we've indicated. So I don't think we're going to disappoint anybody on that front either in terms of the buybacks or the dividends or the total amount of capital that gets returned to the shareholders, and we'll be advantageous where we can. But I think, like we said below -- before below 60, we believe, is pretty attractive, and then it's just a function of timing."

And then we have the adjacencies whether or not that's the PCI business or the cloud business that carry a different load of expenses, but are also in trying to get different revenue profile. And I think we all have to work together here over the next few quarters as we manage the expense side and continue to try and provide you updates on the revenue and then we get more confidence. At the end of the day, this model could be very different, but it would only be very different if we're generating revenue growth, and ultimately, the margin growth that would sustain that type of OpEx increase. Right now, we're feeling pretty confident about that. So we want to make sure we continue the investments that Jamie needs for his business, particularly, building and the go-to-market capabilities, as well as some of the technical capabilities that are being put in front of us by a wide variety of customers, whether they'd be OEM or end user or startups."

So I don't want to not talk about desktop because it does drive a lot of high-capacity devices, and in fact, a lot of high-capacity devices. In the cloud, there seems to be -- 4s will be the predominant capacity, I would think, for the leading edge companies. There's still a lot of 1, 2s and 3s that are sold in the kind of generation of cloud companies behind them, whether or not those are private clouds or public, and then the leading edge ones are transitioning pretty quick to 6, and like I said, if we could make 8s and 10s, I'm sure they would take them. I look at it more as where is the exabyte growth overall relative to areal density growth, and then also thinking about it in terms of absorption of heads and disk channel capabilities and tests. And all of those measures are still moving in a way that says we're constrained, that whether or not you think of whether it's heads or disks or test time or lead times or complexity channel or exabyte growth relative to areal density growth, they're all ahead of areal density growth that the industry can provide right now. So I think that's the dynamic we think about long-term."

It kind of talks to 5% to 7%, I'm not going to debate that, and it's kind of where we think. I think part of it is just, again, the momentum. December is always a tricky quarter because, sometimes, the momentum accelerates, and sometimes, it decreases and then, sometimes, that impacts what happens in the March quarter, and sometimes, it doesn't. So it definitely slowed down on the client side in December. That has us cautious, and frankly, the issues around currency and what's going on in Europe. I just think it's wiser to aim for the lower TAM, and we can obviously leverage up a couple of million units pretty easily as an industry versus overproducing. And again, I have to look at the Intel midpoint, and that's a company that doesn't have a lot of price pressure, and they kind of guided down 7% in the mid-point of the range. So we have to take that as an input as well.

Seagate demonstrated strong financial performance in the December quarter, achieving revenues of $3.7 billion; and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margin of 28.2%; net income of $452 million; and diluted earnings per share of $1.35. Our results this quarter reflect revenue in line with our expectations and sequential margin improvement. We had record storage shipments of 61.3 exabytes, up 17% year-over-year, with average gigabytes per drive for the quarter increasing sequentially and continuing to average over 1 terabyte per drive. 
Cash flow generation was again strong in the December quarter and we achieved $670 million in operating cash flow and $455 million in free cash flow, excluding the partial payment for the arbitration award from Western Digital of $773 million. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $546 million, slightly lower than our expectations due primarily to expense control around the core business and commensurate with our revenue growth. Capital expenditures were in line with our expectations, and inventory both internally and externally are within manageable levels. 
Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We raised approximately $500 million in debt and retired approximately $375 million in principal of higher cost debt this quarter, effectively staggering and extending our debt maturities. We believe we are the first high-tech BBB- company to issue a 20-year coupon which is a testament to the market's confidence in our management team, the strength of our technology portfolio and our financial and business policies. 
Turning to our outlook. While we are generally optimistic about calendar year 2015 in terms of the demand for storage and overall economic activity, especially that of the United States, we are tempered somewhat by the instability of the European business environment, as well as the commodity and currency volatility throughout the world. For example, Europe represents approximately 20% of our revenues, and in retail, we would have historically experienced an increase of about 5% revenue in the December quarter, and in fact, it declined by about 5%. While we expect Europe to be challenged economically for most of 2015, it's difficult to assess the degree of impact this will have on revenue and demand. While Central Bank activity can alleviate some of the issues that are impacting specific country growth issues globally, these instruments are, by design, temporary, and given the low level of interest rates we are now experiencing, are by definition less effective, at least on the measure of providing cheaper credit. 
While our forecasting continues to maintain a sense of caution due to these macroeconomic conditions, the trends we are seeing in the marketplace continue to align with our long-term expectations for exabyte demand and the growing need for economical and efficient storage. Industry estimates for the HDD market demand are forecasting a seasonal decrease -- sorry, and we believe TAM will be approximately 135 million units in the March quarter. This was primarily driven by a seasonal decline in the client and retail market, which is also expected to be the low quarter for the calendar year. The traditional enterprise market is estimated to follow seasonal patterns as well, although this market has been more resilient than we have forecasted over the last several quarters. 
The cloud enterprise market is estimated to be relatively flat, reflecting continued demand strength for high capacity storage. We anticipate the cloud market will exhibit relative strength throughout the calendar year, as the acceleration, which began last quarter, continues. We are experiencing supply constraints in some key products in this market, and we expect to be supply-challenged for the next few quarters based on current demand signals. 
Pricing in the client and cloud enterprise market was slightly more aggressive than the December quarter than the 5 prior quarters. In some accounts, we participated, and in others, we did not. As we look ahead, we believe this is a temporal issue related to specific industry conditions. Given the increasing demand trend from a broad base of customers towards the higher capacity products, we also believe this level of price erosion is unsustainable to fund the required capital and R&D investments needed in our industry. We anticipate we will need to drive margin expansion at least towards the higher end or long-term range of 27% to 32% to fund the long term capital and R&D budgets related to the increased demand for cloud-based storage products. 
Seagate's product portfolio is well-positioned competitively in this demand environment, and we expect to achieve revenue of at least $3.45 billion in the March quarter. We are planning our non-GAAP gross margin to be up sequentially and at least 28.5% due primarily to seasonal product mix shifts, while also taking into account continued dilution impact from our recent acquisitions. We are planning for operating expenses of approximately $570 million in both the March and the June quarters. These expenses include some increases in core R&D, as we refresh nearly our entire HDD and SSD product portfolio this calendar year, as well as investments in our new market adjacencies. 
Based on customer engagements to date, we are encouraged that our value proposition for cloud computing is gaining traction and our revenue potential is likely greater than our original expectations. I thank our employees for their hard work and our customers, vendors and suppliers and shareholders for their ongoing support. Let me now open it up for questions."

I think it's really relationship between the cloud space and the client space. And the client pricing, even though it's quite low, continues to be kind of strangely aggressive, and the reason I say strangely is that most of those components are low capacity for the most part. You have a lot of single-disc, 2-headed products there. So you don't have a lot of cost opportunities, and yet, in a demand environment that's been volatile, relatively fell flat both in notebook and desktop if you take a 1-year perspective. There's not a lot of movement for absorption or cost reductions from especially the single part component companies. So continued price aggression there kind of doesn't make a lot of sense, but there are certain market segments, for example, in retail where a couple of our competitors seem to be battling it to the end of who can have the last 0.5 point of market share. It's just been kind of silly. It relates to the cloud market in that people can manage their overall gross margin, obviously, because the cloud products, by virtue of their increased difficulty to manufacture and test, do carry higher margins. The reality is, given the shift that we've had towards high-capacity, we won't be able to match supply long-term at these margin structures because the shift to high end, it requires a lot more tests. It requires a lot more heads and disks, they're harder machines to make, and therefore, we have to have margin structures, I think in the 30% to 32% range to fund the mix change that we've seen already. The mix change that we're at is probably a year ahead of where we thought we would be. So I think we view it more holistically of what's happening across the portfolio, and it just doesn't seem sustainable for the industry to continue like this. I think the -- as it relates to your specific topic, Seagate does have some product leadership in particular categories. We're very constrained. That obviously relates to pricing that remains more firm. As I indicated, there's a couple of classes of product that were effectively sold out through the rest of the year subject to what we can do on the manufacturing side to increase supply. So I do think that in the last few weeks, we've seen some firming around the pricing on cloud, but I think the reality is to really get the investment rates that we need long-term. We're going to have to see an end of the erosion, so we can basically rebuild the margin profile."

I think that the whole balance between notebook and desktop has been interesting and dynamic over the last calendar year to say the least. We had a start of the year that had a lot of relative strength in desktop, especially relative to what people were projecting. And then the second half of the year kind of really flipped the other way, where the relative performance was on the notebook side. I think as we left the December quarter, we were, I suppose, discouraged a bit by the lack of momentum in the client space, which I think again lends to some of the cautiousness that we're seeing, as well as Intel's forecast was about 7% down on their revenue estimate, and that's what the -- probably not nearly the pricing pressures we have. So I think the client space is a bit in flux. It feels for us right now that, actually, I'd lean off that maybe desktop demand is doing well already these few weeks in the quarter, whereas notebooks seems to be having troubles getting started, but I think it's just going to be this constant dance between the 2. And again, what you're probably looking at is relatively small growth, single, low-single-digit percentages on a TAM basis through the calendar year, and that just doesn't support the price aggression that we've seen in the marketplace. So I think it's something the industry is going to figure out, and I think our supply chain is being pretty firm with this, that they just don't have additional cost to give us especially, again, if they're single part providers to each platform."

That business began to pick up a couple of quarters ago after, as we know, a few quarters of less than expected growth. And we all talked about was that a function of deployment, was that a function of utilization rates or was that a function of time to deployment. And our thesis was it was probably time to deployment and utilization rates, and that there'd be an acceleration, and that's kind of what I think we're seeing. I think the backdrop of end user demand hasn't slowed, and again, anything that's high content video is just going to drive more and more demand for that class of storage. So I think for Seagate, the portfolio is quite strong. Our position in 6-terabyte is really good, and we see a big demand profile. I mean, I think for a lot of the CSPs, especially the top 15, they'd almost take any amount of capacity per spindle that you could give them. If we had an 8 or 10 terabyte drive, they'd take it. They have software that knows how to manage that much data on their spindle now. So as our portfolio shift to that, I think we've had some relative advantage, and that's helped the margin. But again, the client -- the client space is aggressive, and it all mixes up. I think the other thing to remember, though, is on our new businesses, and I'm not sure this has been modeled well, but I'm not sure that we've been probably able to give you as much detail to model it well. So I'm not being faultful, but our client -- our cloud business is dilutive to gross margin. That's a business, I think, that we've described. We're going to grow into the margin. We're adding revenue. We have really excellent confidence in the revenue profile going forward. If anything, like I said, I think, we're probably either in the June quarter call or we'll do it at the Analyst Meeting. We'll reset our revenue expectations, but again, that business comes in at a lower than corporate gross margin, and we will grow into it. We will exceed the corporate gross margin when the thing is all flushed out, but I think that was probably a little bit heavier in the quarter than we would have expected, and then the client pricing was a little bit heavier than we would have expected in the quarter. So those were the 2 main drivers, offset, as you pointed out, by better margin from the higher demand for our cloud products."

So between wafer and the test, you're looking at 20-plus weeks of supply chain that has to be managed, and so if the customer set isn't fully -- doesn't have that fully baked into their ordering system or if they're seeing demand increases that are inside those lead times, it creates a lot of stress on the system. So what we're seeing now is a lot of stress on the system for the demand that we see this quarter and next, let's say. We can't really do much about this quarter unless we have yield improvements, right, because you've got either a wafer issue or a test issue that's more than the quarter in duration. For next quarter, we can start to line some things up, but it's really all the work we have to do for the September quarter and the December quarter, and of course, for that, we have to go back to our customers and kind of say, ""These are pretty firm orders because we're going to do a lot of things to our supply chain to accommodate that demand, which will impact our total portfolio.""

Again, we believe March is probably the low quarter, actually, for the first time in kind of as long as I can remember. We're looking at -- from the customer demand side, it looks like June quarter will be up versus March on the client side, and I think, and obviously September, and December are typically up as well. So I think net, net we will see a little growth. I think the real issue is what's the nature of the growth and what's the class of machine that people are offering in. I think the biggest opportunity the industry is going to see, I don't think it's a calendar '15 event, by the way. I think it's probably a calendar '16 event, but there will be a smarter client. If we believe half of what we say about the value of the cloud, while it does talk to in some applications, a lighter client, it also talks to a richer client. And so whether or not that's greater compute or greater storage or greater bandwidth capabilities, especially for the knowledge worker and the value creator, these machines have to get more sophisticated, not less. And I don't think that's really been kind of thought through completely. Things like Chromebook are gaining a lot of attention, but when you think about the use case of a Chromebook, let's just hope that's not the world -- where the world is going, to check my e-mail and weather, and that's all I do, and I have a lot more faith in humanity than that, and I actually think we're going to see a big rotation in the client in '16. But I think in '15, it's probably going to be low single digits, and March is the low quarter."

We still feel confident that's growing. With the backdrop of that, we see where that revenue's coming from and how we model that, and we feel pretty confident in this range. But as Steve said, that range needs to expand, and that's the backdrop of the erosion comments because the cost to deploy these are getting greater and greater. You see that in the gross margin, and just as importantly as the OpEx as we fundamentally refresh. So I think we feel fairly confident on this gross margin in saying this range, but that is on the backdrop that the erosion needs to slow down. The cost takedowns have continued to happen, but remember, these products are long in the tooth, and that's why you see the OpEx with the refresh of almost the entire portfolio this year. So that's part of that as well. So the gross margin, I think, it's modeled pretty straight, and it's this classic, how much price you can afford to make these investments, and that's where it's lining up, and so we feel pretty confident we can hit these numbers."

So I think for the next couple of quarters, we have underpinned cost takedowns that we're confident we can deliver relative to the shift in the portfolio, and then after that, we get a whole new product line that's going to help us on both the HDD and the SSD side. And then, I think, going forward, while that margin profile feels secure, my point was a little different. It's got to be higher than that though to maintain the level of investments that we need if the shift to cloud versus client continues at the rate it is, and I think that's the challenge for the industry."

We -- basically we're engaged with a few significant opportunities that I think will put us in a position of changing that revenue forecast. And to date, the growth has been strong. We're happy with the engagement that we have.  Even just based on what we've done, we would probably be ahead of what we anticipated we were going to be either for fiscal '15 or fiscal '16, but there are few opportunities that could change that in a more material way, which certainly justify the tiny incremental investment that we're making in the OpEx side, increasing the OpEx by $10 million to $15 million to get the type of revenue opportunity that we think is in front of us. We're quite confident it's the right thing to do, and hopefully, we'll have more details on that, again, either off the June call or certainly at the September update."

So a lot of people forget, I mean, and I get it, because of 2 of the entities owned by, if you will, parent corps. But the reality is, given the hold separate agreement, that's been dictated by the Chinese government.  There are 5 competitors in the notebook space and in the desktop space, although Toshiba is maybe not quite as strong there as they are in the notebook space. So I think until that kind of gets resolved, we're going to have this imbalance, and again, it's an economic dislocation of that. It will adjust one way or the other. Secondly, I think in the retail space, there's been a battle between 2 of our competitors that just are refusing at this point to either give up share or not stop trying to gain share at kind of -- at no matter what cost, and we don't quite understand it, but that's okay. We'll just walk away from business where it doesn't make sense and redeploy our assets in our products where we can make more money. Again, that will end up creating a shortage, which then will be self-adjusting somewhere down the stream. In terms of vertical integration in the industry, it's an interesting point. I don't know that it's necessary from like -- what's happening with pricing. I think the real issue is around continuity of supply under critical key components, and especially, again, those components that aren't gaining the value that we gain at the drive level of the shift to the high end. It's more heads and disks. That's our 2 most expensive areas for capital and R&D if you take them together. So we get the absorption we need with that shift, but if you're just selling one part per device, it's a tough world when TAM's not growing, and so that creates stresses on the supply chain. That may need to either have tighter relationships in terms of the up and downstream suppliers or, I guess, theoretically, could result in some types of consolidation in spaces that are critical components that either us or our competitors will worry about in terms of continuity of supply. So more to come, I suppose, in terms of how does that really play out. In terms of buyback, I think, we're still in the position that we were that when we have the last call and the stock was momentarily sub-60, we said at these levels, we would be aggressive, and that's still our position. We will buy for anti-dilution and then we'll be opportunistic about buying below there. So again, we're thinking our buyback's over this fiscal year, next fiscal year, and we want to continue to commit to return capital at the levels that we've indicated. So I don't think we're going to disappoint anybody on that front either in terms of the buybacks or the dividends or the total amount of capital that gets returned to the shareholders, and we'll be advantageous where we can. But I think, like we said below -- before below 60, we believe, is pretty attractive, and then it's just a function of timing."

I think we should certainly be trending that direction as soon as possible, but I don't think that means we get to the endpoint this year. And by the way, it also drives revenue growth.

So then we would expect that part of the portfolio to roll back to flat. And then, obviously, we go for leverage where we can there, and that gets back to this dynamic around are we getting paid what we need to invest in the core products. And then we have the adjacencies whether or not that's the PCI business or the cloud business that carry a different load of expenses, but are also driving a different revenue profile. And I think we all have to work together here over the next few quarters as we manage the expense side and continue to try and provide you updates on the revenue and then we get more confidence. At the end of the day, this model could be very different, but it would only be very different if we're generating revenue growth, and ultimately, the margin growth that would sustain that type of OpEx increase. Right now, we're feeling pretty confident about that.

So depending on even the client products, if you're looking at a certain segment in the consumer area, that's a lot of 2-terabyte drives get eaten up there, and it's 3s and 4s for some of the consumer-at-home applications. So I don't want to not talk about desktop because it does drive a lot of high-capacity devices, and in fact, a lot of high-capacity devices. In the cloud, there seems to be -- 4s will be the predominant capacity, I would think, for the leading edge companies. There's still a lot of 1, 2s and 3s that are sold in the kind of generation of cloud companies behind them, whether or not those are private clouds or public, and then the leading edge ones are transitioning pretty quick to 6, and like I said, if we could make 8s and 10s, I'm sure they would take them. I look at it more as where is the exabyte growth overall relative to areal density growth, and then also thinking about it in terms of absorption of heads and disk channel capabilities and tests. And all of those measures are still moving in a way that says we're constrained, that whether or not you think of whether it's heads or disks or test time or lead times or complexity channel or exabyte growth relative to areal density growth, they're all ahead of areal density growth that the industry can provide right now.

It kind of talks to 5% to 7%, I'm not going to debate that, and it's kind of where we think. I think part of it is just, again, the momentum. December is always a tricky quarter because, sometimes, the momentum accelerates, and sometimes, it decreases and then, sometimes, that impacts what happens in the March quarter, and sometimes, it doesn't. So it definitely slowed down on the client side in December. That has us cautious, and frankly, the issues around currency and what's going on in Europe. I just think it's wiser to aim for the lower TAM, and we can obviously leverage up a couple of million units pretty easily as an industry versus overproducing. And again, I have to look at the Intel midpoint, and that's a company that doesn't have a lot of price pressure, and they kind of guided down 7% in the mid-point of the range.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. For the fiscal third quarter 2015, Seagate achieved revenues of $3.3 billion on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 28.9%; net income of $357 million; and diluted earnings per share of $1.08. As we indicated in our business outlook in January, challenges from macroeconomic pressures in Europe and PC demand were factors we needed to manage through the quarter. The magnitude of these factors actually increased intra quarter, resulting in an impact to our top line revenue beyond our initial expectations, particularly in our EMEA business, which was down approximately $100 million sequentially. In light of these dynamic market conditions, we are satisfied with the company's overall execution this quarter and we are particularly pleased with our sequential gross margin improvements and demonstration of operational expense control. 
Overall, storage shipments for the March quarter were 55 exabytes, up 9% year-over-year, with average gigabytes per drive for the quarter increasing sequentially and continuing to average over 1 terabyte per drive. Cash flow generation was again strong in the March quarter, and we achieved $374 million in operating cash flow and $215 million in free cash flow, including our previously announced $225 million payment for our tax audit assessment with the State Tax Bureau in China. 
Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $555 million, reflecting expense control around the core business and some optimization in our Cloud Systems and Solutions business. Capital expenditure in the March quarter were in line with our expectations and inventory both internally and externally are within manageable levels. Our balance sheet remains strong and we ended the quarter with $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. 
During the quarter, we returned $882 million to shareholders in dividends and stock redemptions. We redeemed approximately 12 million shares ending the quarter with 318 million ordinary shares outstanding. Year-to-date, we have returned $1.4 billion to shareholders and have redeemed approximately 5% of our ordinary shares outstanding. We continue to believe our capital allocation policy is aligned with the long-term shareholder value creation and reflects our confidence and our ability to generate strong cash flow from our business. 
Before I cover our business outlook, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave Mosley, to provide an update on the technology portfolio refresh that is underway across our business."

Regarding our comments last quarter that we are in the process of refreshing significant portions of our HDD and SSD product portfolio, I'm pleased to say that we are executing very well on our plans. Development progress and customer qualification activity is on schedule with our traditional enterprise mission-critical HDDs as well as with our newest high-capacity cloud offerings. Our 4-terabyte, 6-terabyte and 8-terabyte platforms are performing extremely well in the field and customer adoption was strong in Q3. In the retail space, our 2-terabyte 2.5-inch drive still leads the industry in areal density and will be refreshed in the next 2 quarters to a higher capacity maintaining our leadership. We look forward to pushing these area of density improvements into the majority of our products in FY '16. As the cost of NAND flash have come down over the last several quarters, customers have begun to recognize the combination and the value of combining nonvolatile caches with HDDs. With the advantage of selling over 15 million hybrid drives under our belt, we believe we are uniquely positioned to drive continued innovation and lead the industry in delivering this value -- the value that this combination of technology enables. 
Revenue growth and customer qualification traction for our SSD controllers, solid-state drives and PCIe accelerator cards are on track to our milestones. Our recently announced partnership with Micron for our next-generation enterprise SaaS SSD is proceeding well and customer feedback has been favorable. In addition, we are very happy with the close collaboration that we have with customers on application-specific tuning for SSDs and data center environments, underscoring the quality of our decision in the M&A space over the last few years. 
In the high-performance computing space, this past quarter saw major new wins with leading academic, public sector and private labs that combined represent more than 120 petabytes of storage capacity, equivalent to the amount of storage needed for 1,600 years of HD video. We also made first delivery of a massive scale out storage system that when complete will achieve 1.7 terabit -- terabytes per second while adjusting data, making that the fastest storage system in the world and it's built end-to-end on Seagate's storage technology. 
I'm really pleased with the breadth of technical innovation that the Seagate engineering teams are delivering while continuing to judiciously manage operating expenses during a period of dynamic market conditions. I'd like to take a moment to thank the entire global team for their continued efforts. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

Seagate is expanding and in",475,"Great, thanks, Dave. Turning to our business outlook, the long-term trends in data growth, Big Data analytics, machine-to-machine computing and public and private cloud deployments continue to progress in an encouraging manner. Seagate is expanding and investing in its Storage Technology product and solutions portfolio to align competitively with these market dynamics and capitalize on Exabyte demand growth. We remain optimistic that calendar year 2015 will provide significant opportunities to deepen our customer relationships, leverage our business model and return value to our shareholders. In the near-term, macroeconomic pressures in Europe and global currency fluctuations are continuing to have an effect on customer's demand visibility. While we expect Europe to be challenged economically for most of 2015, it continues to be difficult to assess the degree of this impact will have on our client market customers in addition to the timing of the release of Windows 10. Overall, demand in the enterprise market is relatively stable, and as we have expressed previously, the nearline high-capacity drive market can exhibit variations quarter-to-quarter as cloud service providers drive higher utilization storage capacity additions and others prepare for buildouts in the second half of the year. When you take a multiquarter view of this market, the exponential demand per storage is evident, as exabyte capacity shipments in 2014 were up 35% over the prior year. 
From our broad-based discussions with customers, we currently believe that the addressable market in the June quarter will be relatively flat with the March quarter. We are targeting revenues for the June quarter of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion and managing to a very lean production schedule. Should macro conditions improve, our PC builds accelerate with improved confidence and back-to-school demand, we could see upside to this forecast and we have the ability to flex up production as necessary. We will continue to shape our top line revenue opportunities that preserve our business profitably and enable us to continue to invest in advancing our storage technology portfolio offerings. For the June quarter, we anticipate margins of approximately 28.5%, taking into account continued dilution impact from our recent acquisitions. We're targeting operating expenses of $555 million as our core product portfolio refresh continues to be on track as well as timing of investments in our new market adjacencies. 
Looking further ahead, we continue to believe that the second half of the calendar year will be stronger than the first half with demand coming from the PC market, seasonal gaming demand and continued stability in the enterprise market with potential upside from hyperscale deployments. We're confident in the long-term dynamics of data growth and the opportunities ahead for Seagate in the Storage Technology marketplace in 2015 and beyond. I thank our employees for their hard work and our customers, vendors, suppliers and shareholders for their ongoing support. 
I'll know open up the call for questions."

Relative to the PCIe space, what we're finding is that the customers who tend to buy these drives really want their applications accelerated in a very specific way. So there's a lot of deep understanding of the application that's required in order to get the design win and a lot of work with the customers specifically to make sure that it has traction across their entire installed base when you install it. There is a very healthy market out there right now for SATA and SaaS going into existing plugs without the requirements of that tuning, and I wouldn't pit one against the other, although I would say that maybe some of the growth of the PCIe space was a little overblown in the past. It's very customer and application-specific, and there's a lot of work required in order to get that traction. I think going forward, the idea that everything becomes the model where you just unplug what you have against one of the SaaS or SATA plugs and plug-in something new is probably not the right answer though, because I think there's architectural disruption in the software and hardware side that require further optimization and on a lot of the PCIe space, obviously, that time is money, the application acceleration that you can get means a lot to those customers and we'll continue to do that work."

And on the margin side, we inherited a business that had a lot of good technology, but operationally probably hadn't had some of the investments that it needed to really be optimized and drive some of the efficiencies that we typically do on the drive side. So we're actively using that operations capability that we have to push more efficiency and flexibility which is kind of a combination of trying to get the efficiency with the flexibility because these orders come in fairly dynamically with not a lot of time, sometimes to address the opportunity especially as we get near the end of the quarter. We're still kind of the systems mentality, where stuff is very back-end-loaded which we're trying to address operationally as well as how we manage our inventory.

I think where there's opportunity for the upside is probably in the PC side depending again on the OEMs confidence about back-to-school pull which I think we'll start deciding probably in the month of June. I think my guess is they probably got their build plans pretty set for April and May and June with one level of expectation for back-to-school which they're obviously going to prepare for and I think if there some shift in terms of what the macro conditions are whether or not that's global or just more confident about what's happening in the U.S., then you could see it, you could see an acceleration in June. So I think on the client side, and maybe that's mostly a notebook comment, I think that's where there's opportunity for something beyond flat. There's also a lot of inventory and supply chain adjustments in the March quarter that we don't have perfect visibility on, but it's pretty clear that the OEMs drew down inventories and limited their production. So this quarter, they probably have to catch up on the production side to meet even a flat demand, or I guess maybe until even imply a slight growth. So we're watching that closely. As indicated on the nearline side, it's really just a function of where the big cloud service providers are in their capital deployment plans. Most as we would see it though, the acceleration is probably more in the September and the December quarter and whether or not they pull anything into the June quarter, just to smooth out that pull in September and December is I think where the opportunity might be there. And I think the other markets are relatively flat."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 
For the fiscal third quarter 2015, Seagate achieved revenues of $3.3 billion on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 28.9%, net income of $357 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.08. As we indicated in our business outlook in January, challenges from macroeconomic pressures in Europe and PC demand were factors we needed to manage through the quarter. The magnitude of these factors actually increased intra-quarter, resulting in an impact to our top line revenue beyond our initial expectations, particularly in our EMEA business, which was down approximately $100 million sequentially. In light of these dynamic market conditions, we are satisfied with the company's overall execution this quarter, and we are particularly pleased with our sequential gross margin improvements and demonstration of operational expense control. 
Overall storage shipments for the March quarter were 55 exabytes, up 9% year-over-year, with average gigabytes per drive for the quarter increasing sequentially and continuing to average over 1 terabyte per drive. 
Cash flow generation was again strong in the March quarter, and we achieved $374 million in operating cash flow and $215 million in free cash flow, including our previously announced $225 million payment for our tax audit assessment with the State Tax Bureau in China. 
Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $555 million, reflecting expense control around the core business and some optimization in our Cloud Systems and Solutions business. 
Capital expenditure in the March quarter were in line with our expectations, and inventory, both internally and externally, are within manageable levels. 
Our balance sheet remained strong and we ended the quarter with $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. 
During the quarter, we returned $882 million to shareholders in dividends and stock redemptions. We redeemed approximately 12 million shares, ending the quarter with 318 million ordinary shares outstanding. Year-to-date, we have returned $1.4 billion to shareholders and have redeemed approximately 5% of our ordinary shares outstanding. We continue to believe our capital allocation policy is aligned with the long-term shareholder value creation and reflects our confidence in our ability to generate strong cash flow from our business. 
Before I cover our business outlook, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave Mosley to provide an update on the technology portfolio refresh that is under way across our business."

Regarding our comments last quarter that we are in the process of refreshing significant portions of our HDD and SSD product portfolio, I'm pleased to say that we are executing very well on our plans. Development progress and customer qualification activity is on schedule with our traditional enterprise mission-critical HDDs as well as with our newest high-capacity cloud offerings. Our 4-terabyte, 6-terabyte and 8-terabyte platforms are performing extremely well in the field and customer adoption was strong in Q3. In the retail space, our 2-terabyte 2.5-inch drive still leads the industry in areal density and will be refreshed in the next 2 quarters to a higher capacity, maintaining our leadership. We look forward to pushing these areal density improvements into the majority of our products in FY '16. 
As the cost of NAND flash have come down over the last several quarters, customers have begun to recognize the combination and the value of combining non-volatile caches with HDDs. With the advantage of selling over 15 million hybrid drives under our belt, we believe we are uniquely positioned to drive continued innovation and lead the industry in delivering this value -- the value that this combination of technology enables. 
Revenue growth and customer qualification traction for our SSD controllers, solid-state drives and PCIe accelerator cards are on track to our milestones. Our recently announced partnership with Micron for our next-generation enterprise SAS SSD is proceeding well and customer feedback has been favorable. In addition, we are very happy with the close collaboration that we have with customers on application-specific tuning for SSDs in data center environments, underscoring the quality of our decisions in the M&A space over the last few years. 
In the high-performance computing space, this past quarter saw major new wins with leading academic, public sector and private labs that combined represent more than 120 petabytes of storage capacity, equivalent to the amount of storage needed for 1,600 years of HD video. We also made first delivery of a massive scale-out storage system that, when complete, will achieve 1.7 terabit -- terabytes per second while adjusting data, making that the fastest storage system in the world, and it's built end-to-end on Seagate's storage technology. 
I'm really pleased with the breadth of technical innovation that the Seagate engineering teams are delivering while continuing to judiciously manage operating expenses during a period of dynamic market conditions. I'd like to take a moment to thank the entire global team for their continued efforts. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

Turning to our business outlook. The long-term trends in data growth, Big Data Analytics, machine-to-machine computing and public and private cloud deployments continue to progress in an encouraging manner. Seagate is expanding and investing in its storage technology product and solutions portfolio to align competitively with these market dynamics and capitalize on exabyte demand growth. We remain optimistic that calendar year 2015 will provide significant opportunities to deepen our customer relationships, leverage our business model and return value to our shareholders. 
In the near term, macroeconomic pressures in Europe and global currency fluctuations are continuing to have an effect on customers' demand visibility. While we expect Europe to be challenged economically for most of 2015, it continues to be difficult to assess the degree of this impact will have on our client market customers in addition to the timing of the release of Windows 10. 
Overall, demand in the enterprise market is relatively stable. And as we have expressed previously, the nearline high-capacity drive market can exhibit variations quarter-to-quarter as cloud service providers drive higher-utilization storage capacity additions and others prepare for build-outs in the second half of the year. When you take a multi-quarter view of this market, the exponential demand per storage is evident as exabyte capacity shipments in 2014 were up 35% over the prior year. 
From our broad-based discussions with customers, we currently believe that the addressable market in the June quarter will be relatively flat with the March quarter. We are targeting revenues for the June quarter of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion and managing to a very lean production schedule. Should macro conditions improve or PC builds accelerate with improved confidence and back-to-school demand, we could see upside to this forecast and we have the ability to flex up production as necessary. We will continue to shape our top line revenue opportunities that preserve our business profitably and enable us to continue to invest in advancing our storage technology portfolio offerings. 
For the June quarter, we anticipate margins of approximately 28.5%, taking into account continued dilution impact from our recent acquisitions. We're targeting operating expenses at $555 million as our core product portfolio refresh continues to be on track as well as timing of investments in our new market adjacencies. 
Looking further ahead, we continue to believe that the second half of the calendar year will be stronger than the first half with demand coming from the PC market, seasonal gaming demand and continued stability in the enterprise market with potential upside from hyperscale deployments. We're confident in the long-term dynamics of data growth and the opportunities ahead for Seagate in the storage technology marketplace in 2015 and beyond. I thank our employees for their hard work and our customers, vendors, suppliers and shareholders for their ongoing support. 
I'll now open up the call for questions."

Relative to the PCIe space, what we're finding is that the customers who tend to buy these drives really want their applications accelerated in a very specific way. So there's a lot of deep understanding of the application that's required in order to get the design wins and a lot of work with the customers specifically to make sure that it has traction across their entire installed base when you install it. There is a very healthy market out there right now for SATA and SaaS going into existing plugs without that -- the requirements of that tuning. And I wouldn't pit one against the other, although I would say that maybe some of the growth of the PCIe space was a little overblown in the past. It's very customer and application specific and there's a lot of work required in order to get that traction. I think going forward, the idea that everything becomes the model where you just unplug what you have against one of the SaaS or SATA plugs and plug in something new is probably not the right answer, though, because I think there'll be architectural disruption on the software and hardware side that require further optimization. And on a lot of the PCIe space, obviously that time is money. The application acceleration that you can get means a lot to those customers and we'll continue to do that work."

And on the margin side, we inherited a business that had a lot of good technology but operationally probably hadn't had some of the investments that it needed to really be optimized and drive some of the efficiencies that we typically do on the drive side. So we're actively using that operations capability that we have to push more efficiency and flexibility, which is kind of a combination of trying to get the efficiency with the flexibility because these orders come in fairly dynamically with not a lot of time sometimes to address the opportunity. Especially as we get near the end of the quarter, there's still kind of the systems mentality where stuff is very back-end loaded, which we're trying to address operationally as well as how we manage our inventory.

I think where there's opportunity for the upside is probably in the PC side depending again on the OEMs' confidence about back-to-school pull, which I think they'll start deciding probably in the month of June. And I think my guess is they probably got their build plans pretty set for April and May and June with one level of expectation about back-to-school, which they're obviously going to prepare for. And then I think if there's some shift in terms of what the macro conditions are, on whether or not that's global or just more confidence about what's happening in the U.S., then you could see it, you could see an acceleration in June. So I think in the -- on the client side, and maybe that's mostly a notebook comment, I think that's where there's some opportunity for something beyond flat. There was also a lot of inventory and supply chain adjustments in the March quarter that we don't have perfect visibility on, but it's pretty clear that the OEMs drew down inventories and limited their production. So this quarter, they probably have to catch up on the production side to meet even a flat demand, or I guess maybe Intel even implied a slight growth. So we're watching that closely. As indicated on the nearline side, it's really just a function of where the big cloud service providers are in their capital deployment plans. Most -- as we would see it, though, the acceleration is probably more in the September and the December quarter. And whether or not they pull anything into the June quarter just to smooth out that pull in September and December is, I think, where the opportunity might be there. And I think the other markets are relatively flat."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 
For the fiscal third quarter 2015, Seagate achieved revenues of $3.3 billion, on a non-GAAP basis gross margins of 28.9%, net income of $357 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.08. As we indicated in our business outlook in January, challenges from macroeconomic pressures in Europe and PC demand were factors we needed to manage through the quarter. The magnitude of these factors actually increased intra-quarter, resulting in an impact to our top line revenue beyond our initial expectations, particularly in our EMEA business, which was down approximately $100 million sequentially. In light of these dynamic market conditions, we are satisfied with the company's overall execution this quarter, and we are particularly pleased with our sequential gross margin improvements and demonstration of operational expense control. 
Overall storage shipments for the March quarter were 55 exabytes, up 9% year-over-year, with average gigabytes per drive for the quarter increasing sequentially and continuing to average over 1 terabyte per drive. 
Cash flow generation was again strong in the March quarter, and we achieved $374 million in operating cash flow and $215 million in free cash flow, including our previously announced $225 million payment for our tax audit assessment with the State Tax Bureau in China. 
Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $555 million, reflecting expense control around the core business and some optimization in our Cloud Systems and Solutions business. 
Capital expenditure in the March quarter were in line with our expectations, and inventory, both internally and externally, are within manageable levels. 
Our balance sheet remained strong and we ended the quarter with $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. 
During the quarter, we returned $882 million to shareholders in dividends and stock redemptions. We redeemed approximately 12 million shares, ending the quarter with 318 million ordinary shares outstanding. Year-to-date, we have returned $1.4 billion to shareholders and have redeemed approximately 5% of our ordinary shares outstanding. We continue to believe our capital allocation policy is aligned with the long-term shareholder value creation and reflects our confidence in our ability to generate strong cash flow from our business. 
Before I cover our business outlook, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave Mosley to provide an update on the technology portfolio refresh that is under way across our business."

Development progress and customer qualification activity is on schedule with our traditional enterprise mission-critical HDDs as well as with our newest high-capacity cloud offerings. Our 4-terabyte, 6-terabyte and 8-terabyte platforms are performing extremely well in the field and customer adoption was strong in Q3. In the retail space, our 2-terabyte 2.5-inch drive still leads the industry in areal density and will be refreshed in the next 2 quarters to a higher capacity, maintaining our leadership. We look forward to pushing these areal density improvements into the majority of our products in FY '16. 
As the costs of NAND flash have come down over the last several quarters, customers have begun to recognize the combination and the value of combining non-volatile caches with HDDs. With the advantage of selling over 15 million hybrid drives under our belt, we believe we are uniquely positioned to drive continued innovation and lead the industry in delivering this value -- the value that this combination of technology enables. 
Revenue growth and customer qualification traction for our SSD controllers, solid-state drives and PCIe accelerator cards are on track to our milestones. Our recently announced partnership with Micron for our next-generation enterprise SAS SSD is proceeding well, and customer feedback has been favorable. In addition, we are very happy with the close collaboration that we have with customers on application-specific tuning for SSDs in data center environments, underscoring the quality of our decisions in the M&A space over the last few years. 
In the high-performance computing space, this past quarter saw major new wins with leading academic, public sector and private labs that, combined, represent more than 120 petabytes of storage capacity, equivalent to the amount of storage needed for 1,600 years of HD video. We also made first delivery of a massive scale-out storage system that, when complete, will achieve 1.7 terabit -- terabytes per second while adjusting data, making that the fastest storage system in the world, and it's built end-to-end on Seagate's storage technology. 
I'm really pleased with the breadth of technical innovation that the Seagate engineering teams are delivering while continuing to judiciously manage operating expenses during a period of dynamic market conditions. I'd like to take a moment to thank the entire global team for their continued efforts. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

Turning to our business outlook. The long-term trends in data growth, Big Data Analytics, machine-to-machine computing and public and private cloud deployments continue to progress in an encouraging manner. Seagate is expanding and investing in its storage technology product and solutions portfolio to align competitively with these market dynamics and capitalize on exabyte demand growth. We remain optimistic that calendar year 2015 will provide significant opportunities to deepen our customer relationships, leverage our business model and return value to our shareholders. 
In the near term, macroeconomic pressures in Europe and global currency fluctuations are continuing to have an effect on customers' demand visibility. While we expect Europe to be challenged economically for most of 2015, it continues to be difficult to assess the degree that this impact will have on our client market customers in addition to the timing of the release of Windows 10. 
Overall, demand in the enterprise market is relatively stable. And as we have expressed previously, the nearline high-capacity drive market can exhibit variations quarter-to-quarter as cloud service providers drive higher-utilization storage capacity additions and others prepare for build-outs in the second half of the year. When you take a multi-quarter view of this market, the exponential demand per storage is evident as exabyte capacity shipments in 2014 were up 35% over the prior year. 
From a broad base of discussions with customers, we currently believe that the addressable market in the June quarter will be relatively flat with the March quarter. We are targeting revenues for the June quarter of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion and managing to a very lean production schedule. Should macro conditions improve or PC builds accelerate with improved confidence and back-to-school demand, we could see upside to this forecast and we have the ability to flex up production as necessary. We will continue to shape our top line revenue opportunities that preserve our business profitably and enable us to continue to invest in advancing our storage technology portfolio offerings. 
For the June quarter, we anticipate margins of approximately 28.5%, taking into account continued dilution impact from our recent acquisitions. We're targeting operating expenses at $555 million as our core product portfolio refresh continues to be on track as well as timing of investments in our new market adjacencies. 
Looking further ahead, we continue to believe that the second half of the calendar year will be stronger than the first half with demand coming from the PC market, seasonal gaming demand and continued stability in the enterprise market with potential upside from hyperscale deployments. We're confident in the long-term dynamics of data growth and the opportunities ahead for Seagate in the storage technology marketplace in 2015 and beyond. I thank our employees for their hard work and our customers, vendors, suppliers and shareholders for their ongoing support. 
I'll now open up the call for questions."

Relative to the PCIe space, what we're finding is that the customers who tend to buy these drives really want their applications accelerated in a very specific way. So there's a lot of deep understanding of the application that's required in order to get the design wins and a lot of work with the customers specifically to make sure that it has traction across their entire installed base when you install it. There is a very healthy market out there right now for SATA and SaaS going into existing plugs without that -- the requirements of that tuning. And I wouldn't pit one against the other, although I would say that maybe some of the growth of the PCIe space was a little overblown in the past. It's very customer and application specific, and there's a lot of work required in order to get that traction. I think going forward, the idea that everything becomes the model where you just unplug what you have against one of the SaaS or SATA plugs and plug in something new is probably not the right answer, though, because I think there'll be architectural disruption on the software and hardware side that require further optimization. And on a lot of the PCIe space, obviously that time is money. The application acceleration that you can get means a lot to those customers and we'll continue to do that work."

And on the margin side, we inherited a business that had a lot of good technology but operationally probably hadn't had some of the investments that it needed to really be optimized and drive some of the efficiencies that we typically do on the drive side. So we're actively using that operations capability that we have to push more efficiency and flexibility, which is kind of a combination of trying to get the efficiency with the flexibility because these orders come in fairly dynamically with not a lot of time sometimes to address the opportunity. Especially as we get near the end of the quarter, there's still kind of the systems mentality where stuff is very back-end loaded, which we're trying to address operationally as well as how we manage our inventory.

I think where there's opportunity for the upside is probably on the PC side, depending again on the OEMs' confidence about back-to-school pull, which I think they'll start deciding probably in the month of June. And I think my guess is they probably got their build plans pretty set for April and May and June with one level of expectation about back-to-school, which they're obviously going to prepare for. And then I think if there's some shift in terms of what the macro conditions are, whether or not that's global or just more confidence about what's happening in the U.S., then you could see it, you could see an acceleration in June. So I think in the -- on the client side, and maybe that's mostly a notebook comment, I think that's where there's some opportunity for something beyond flat. There was also a lot of inventory and supply chain adjustments in the March quarter that we don't have perfect visibility on, but it's pretty clear that the OEMs drew down inventories and limited their production. So this quarter, they probably have to catch up on the production side to meet even a flat demand, or I guess maybe Intel even implied a slight growth. So we're watching that closely. As indicated on the nearline side, it's really just a function of where the big cloud service providers are in their capital deployment plans. Most -- as we would see it, though, the acceleration is probably more in the September and the December quarter.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. For the fourth fiscal quarter 2015, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.9 billion and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 27.2%, net income of $250 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.77. Overall, storage shipments for the June quarter were 52 exabytes, up 5% year-over-year with an average capacity per drive continuing to average over 1.1 terabytes per drive. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $515 million, reflecting expense control around the core business and new adjacencies in addition to lower variable compensation. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $228 million and capital expenditures were in line with our expectations. Our inventory levels were reduced 8% sequentially and we exited Q4 with the lowest level of HDD finished goods inventory value since 2009. Our balance sheet remains strong and we ended this quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents. 
Revenue challenges from macroeconomic pressures and PC systems demand have been persistent factors that have offset continued growth in other areas of our business. While the magnitude of these factors did not increase intraquarter in June, conditions did not improve as we expected, resulting in an impact to our revenue greater than our initial expectations. In light of the mix market dynamic conditions over the last few quarters, we are satisfied with the company's overall execution in fiscal year 2015. Highlights include total revenues of $13.7 billion, and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 28.1%; net income of $1.5 billion and diluted earnings per share of $4.57. Over the course of the fiscal year, we shipped over 228 exabytes of storage, up 13% from fiscal year 2014. Within that, Seagate's nearline cloud exabyte shipments increased more than 50%, indicating that we are gaining traction with the higher capacity offerings in our nearline portfolio and our longer-term thesis of data growth and shifts to cloud infrastructure and hyperscale deployments continue to progress. 
In fiscal year '15, Seagate generated over $2.6 billion in operating cash flow, including the legal settlement from Western Digital. We returned greater than 65% of our operating cash flow or $1.8 billion to shareholders in the form of dividend and share redemptions in fiscal year '15, increasing our dividend per share by 26% and decreasing our shares outstanding by 6%. We continue to believe our capital allocation policy is aligned with long-term shareholder value creation and reflects our confidence in our ability to generate strong cash flow from our businesses. 
From an R&D perspective, we have successfully transformed the good portion of our traditional storage hardware portfolio and made extensive progress towards pursuing our adjacencies in cloud systems and flash technology. We will have more discussion regarding our technology portfolio of advancements and related opportunities at our strategic update on September 2nd. For the September quarter, we are forecasting for relatively flat business environment as we continue to shape our top line revenue opportunities that preserve our business profitability and enable us to continue to invest in advancing our storage technology portfolio offerings. For the September quarter, we are planning for revenue of approximately $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion, and we anticipate margins to be relatively flat taking into account the anticipated seasonal mix and the lean production schedule. 
As of today, we have redeemed approximately 14.5 million shares of stock quarter-to-date and we are on pace to exit the quarter with less than 300 million shares outstanding, returning over $900 million to investors through dividend and share redemptions in the September quarter. Operationally, we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of our expense base and have identified areas where we can improve efficiency and lower costs in fiscal year '16. Through the September quarter, we are targeting operating expenses to be flat sequentially at approximately $515 million. We plan to actively address additional savings opportunities through the end of the calendar year, and we expect operating expenses will be comfortably under $500 million a quarter in the second half of fiscal year '16. These actions will decrease total operating expense by at least 10% for the fiscal year.  As a result of our business outlook, capital allocation and expense control, we are targeting at least 10% non-GAAP EPS growth in fiscal year '16. 
I thank our employees for their hard work and our customers, vendors, suppliers and shareholders for their ongoing support. I'll now open up the call for questions."

Probably the biggest change was the absorption issue. So we ran our factories really lean. Inventory levels are 35% below the competitions right now. And that absorption impact maybe was as much as 100 basis points, so that's significant. I think other issues are we've only had 24 hours to look at the other results, but it does seem like the competition attained revenue earlier in the quarter by virtue of the DSO, and that usually has a margin impact just because pricing sometimes gets more challenging through the quarter. And it looks also that they probably had some share gain and nearline distribution, which is probably a nice margin advantage as well. So we're off to kind of decide, to figure out where that opportunity lays for us in the next couple of quarters. I think the fourth point is probably that for the non-HDD businesses for both of us mature $250 million-ish well, I think both of us obviously are running margins below the corporate average. Our estimate is that ours are further below. And so we still have work to do there as we've talked before over the next couple of quarters to improve that margin profile. So I think the combination of things explains the delta to our original forecast and probably the delta to the competition as well but the single biggest point is we basically ran our factories really lean and reduced inventory and that has a big absorption impact."

The lead times are in-quarter usually and the test times are pretty short. So one of the reasons we ran inventories really lean is because at least -- if the pocket of upside is client, we can chase that very efficiently. Seagate's great at doing that. And as you know, we're also at the front end of a big product rotation in those categories, so it's smart for us to keep our inventories really lean as we go into the new cycle which we're very excited about. I think on the nearline, it's much tougher. Lead times on nearline are between wafer and test are well beyond 13 weeks. So unless you're staging inventory, which we can stage some inventory say for at wafer level or whatever to take some of that lead time out, chasing big upsides on nearline and mission-critical is much more difficult. So it just depends where the products come in."

The question is what's the ownership cost, all in, between 8 TB and 10 TB. It just seems to us that the the 8 TB platform is going to be a massive platform that will last for a long time relative to 10 TB. So the answer is probably 10 TB, but we're just leaning into the 6s and 8s right now and we think there's a huge run in front of us on that and those are really low cost platforms for us because we don't need to use helium."

I think on the client-side, I think for the next 18 and 24 months, it's a tough market because the existing definition of client probably isn't going to change much between desktop, notebook, tablet and phones of 2 different sizes. And I think the mix-and-match of that client is probably kind of a net zero sum game in terms of the trade-offs that people are making in platforms. Now the trend away from tablets to the big phones was probably also going to benefit notebooks because at some point, you need a bigger platform and a bigger screen to deal with. And then all of those have implications that they don't have a lot of storage onboard, and what I mean by a lot is certainly more than 128, maybe even more than 256. Then you have an external storage play which we continue to see the exabyte shipments on the branded business exceeding that, that goes in the cloud which people kind of still haven't really focused on. But I do think that in the commercial space for notebook will be the continued advancement of platforms with less onboard storage, and they'll probably be serviced by 120 gig -- 128 gigs of flash more and more. It's still not half the market, but I think it's growing. I think on the consumer side, the HDD play is still the obvious play because consumers are big users of content, the performance and cost obviously of HDD is if you want 1 or 2 terabytes is kind of untouchable. So I think then the issue is what happens, and again it's the idea around the new client whether or not it's 3D printers, or whether or not it's AR/VR, whether or not it's robotics or surveillance capture devices. There's going to be a whole host of new clients that we're particularly excited about that I think will benefit the client downstream. And also when we hit new capacity points which we'll likely hit this year, there could be a rejuvenation on the HDD side. On the enterprise side, you have legacy, which continues to kind of march along at stronger rates than people have expected, I think that will continue. And the real growth is in nearline, and I think that's where it's particularly exciting. Data science applications, machine-to-machine data creation, and of course just massive amounts of unstructured data mostly in the form of video, and especially high def or video. It's just growing rapidly and it's being deployed around the world and all of the implications for that at the application level obviously are what's exciting and that's obviously creating business for people who want to store their stuff. So we're particularly excited about that. We don't get really hung up on this. Is it a hybrid cloud model, everything's going to 5 [ph] big CSPs. We engage obviously with all of them. We believe it's a hybrid cloud model, which is probably going to form Phil's business to a greater degree because we think there will be lots of petabytes shipped into corporations that want to basically have their own quote cloud as well as leveraging off of any other private clouds. But we're well-positioned either way. So I think the excitement clearly on exabyte growth is in that category. And overall, I think you still see data in the data centers that shows exabyte growth still annually clipping above 50%, some 100%, depending  on the CSPs, and overall, we still think that the exabyte growth will be in excess of aerial density which means we're going to absorb more heads and disk and test times which is also critical. The other final point, and sorry for the long-winded answer, but it's not just about exabyte growth. It's about the package of the exabytes. And again, I think financial analysts has continued to miss this shift from client to cloud. The implications for that, not just in terms of heads and disk absorption in terms of units, but heads and disk absorption and test in terms of complexity are content people are missing. So as you move to a 6 and an 8 and a 10 beyond that terabyte drives, the process content inside of the heads and the disk and the related test codes increases dramatically. So in addition to the more piece parts that are required for more heads and disk for platform, the content inside those piece points is getting more intense, which also results in more absorption. So the trend is in our favor, sure, it would be great to have a bunch of client growth on top of it, but if the trend is just this, it's a good thing for the drive industry and we're positioning ourselves obviously from a technology perspective to have best-in-class products."

Someone may just be a little bit behind and someone may be a lot of it behind, but if you're running fabs, you're going to keep those fabs open. And if your flash isn't competitive, you got a problem, whereas with our technology, we can take that controller technology and apply to whoever has the best flash or achieve this flash or a combination thereof, and I'm not completely convinced yet that the companies that are actually media-independent might have a better advantage long-term in certain market segments, certainly not if you're talking about low-grade consumer flash. But certainly stuff that requires workload that we're experts at, we actually like having the optionality and our controller technology does inform us in terms of our overall systems strategy.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. For the fourth fiscal quarter 2015, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.9 billion and, on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 27.2%, net income of $250 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.77. Overall storage shipments for the June quarter were 52 exabytes, up 5% year-over-year, with an average capacity per drive continuing to average over 1.1 terabytes per drive. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $515 million, reflecting expense control around the core business and new adjacencies in addition to lower variable compensation. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $228 million, and capital expenditures were in line with our expectations. Our inventory levels were reduced 8% sequentially, and we exited Q4 with the lowest level of HDD finished goods inventory value since 2009. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we ended this quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents. 
Revenue challenges from macroeconomic pressures and PC systems demand have been persistent factors that have offset continued growth in other areas of our business. While the magnitude of these factors did not increase intra-quarter in June, conditions did not improve, as we expected, resulting in an impact to our revenue greater than our initial expectations. In light of the mixed market dynamic conditions over the last few quarters, we are satisfied with the company's overall execution in fiscal year '15. Highlights include total revenues of $13.7 billion and, on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 28.1%, net income of $1.5 billion and diluted earnings per share of $4.57. Over the course of the fiscal year, we shipped over 228 exabytes of storage, up 13% from fiscal year '14. Within that, Seagate's nearline cloud exabyte shipments increased more than 50%, indicating that we are gaining traction with the higher capacity offerings in our nearline portfolio. And our longer-term thesis of data growth and shifts to cloud infrastructure and hyperscale deployments continue to progress. 
In fiscal year '15, Seagate generated over $2.6 billion in operating cash flow, including the legal settlement from Western Digital. We returned greater than 65% of our operating cash flow or $1.8 billion to shareholders in the form of dividend and share redemptions in fiscal year '15, increasing our dividend per share by 26% and decreasing our shares outstanding by 6%. We continue to believe our capital allocation policy is aligned with long-term shareholder value creation, and reflects our confidence in our ability to generate strong cash flow from our businesses. 
From an R&D perspective, we have successfully transformed a good portion of our traditional storage hardware portfolio and made extensive progress towards pursuing our adjacencies in cloud systems and flash technology. We will have more discussion regarding our technology portfolio of advancements and related opportunities at our strategic update on September 2nd. For the September quarter, we are forecasting for a relatively flat business environment as we continue to shape our top line revenue opportunities that preserve our business profitability and enable us to continue to invest in advancing our storage technology portfolio offerings. For the September quarter, we are planning for revenue of approximately $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion. And we anticipate margins to be relatively flat, taking into account the anticipated seasonal mix and the lean production schedule. 
As of today, we have redeemed approximately 14.5 million shares of stock quarter-to-date, and we are on pace to exit the quarter with less than 300 million shares outstanding, returning over $900 million to investors through dividend and share redemptions in the September quarter. Operationally, we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of our expense base and have identified areas where we can improve efficiency and lower costs in fiscal year '16. For the September quarter, we are targeting operating expenses to be flat sequentially at approximately $515 million. We plan to actively address additional savings opportunities through the end of the calendar year, and we expect operating expenses will be comfortably under $500 million a quarter in the second half of fiscal year '16. These actions will decrease total operating expense by at least 10% for the fiscal year. As a result of our business outlook, capital allocation and expense control, we are targeting at least 10% non-GAAP EPS growth in fiscal year '16. 
I thank our employees for their hard work and our customers, vendors, suppliers and shareholders for their ongoing support. I'll now open up the call for questions."

And that usually has a margin impact just because pricing sometimes gets more challenging through the quarter. And it looks also that they probably had some share gain and nearline distribution, which is probably a nice margin advantage as well. And so we're off to kind of decide, figure out where that opportunity lays for us in the next couple of quarters. I think the fourth point is probably that for the non-HDD businesses for both of us, which are $250 million-ish, well, I think both of us obviously are running margins below the corporate average. Our estimate is that ours are further below. And so we still have work to do there, as we've talked before, over the next couple of quarters to improve that margin profile. So I think the combination of things explains the delta to our original forecast and probably the delta to the competition as well. But the single biggest point was we basically ran our factories really lean and reduced inventory. And that has a big absorption impact."

And as you know, we're also on the front end of a big product rotation in those categories. So it's smart for us to keep our inventories really lean as we go into the new cycle, which we're very excited about. I think on the nearline, it's much tougher. Lead times on nearline are -- between wafer and test are well beyond 13 weeks. So unless you're staging inventory, which we can stage some inventory, say, for at wafer level or whatever to take some of that lead time out. Chasing big upsides on nearline and mission-critical is much more difficult. So it just depends where the products come in."

I think on the client side, I think for the next 18 and 24 months, it's a tough market because the existing definition of client probably isn't going to change much between desktop, notebook, tablet and phones of 2 different sizes. And I think the mix-and-match of that client is probably kind of a net zero-sum game in terms of the trade-offs that people are making in platforms. Now the trend away from tablets to the big phones was probably also going to benefit notebooks because at some point, you need a bigger platform and a bigger screen to deal with. And then all of those have implications, but they don't have a lot of storage onboard. And what I mean by a lot is certainly more than 128, maybe even more than 256. Then you have an external storage play, which we continue to see the exabyte shipments on the branded business exceeding that, that goes in the cloud, which people kind of still haven't really focused on. But I do think that in the commercial space for notebook will be the continued advancement of platforms with less onboard storage, and they'll probably be serviced by 120-gig -- 128 gigs of flash more and more. It's still not half the market, but I think it's growing. I think on the consumer side, the HDD play is still the obvious play just because consumers are big users of content. The performance and cost, obviously, of HDD is if you want 1 or 2 terabytes is kind of untouchable. So I think then the issue is what happens. And again, I think it's the idea around the new client, whether or not it's 3D printers or whether or not it's AR, VR, whether or not it's robotics or surveillance capture devices. There's going to be a whole host of new clients that we're particularly excited about that I think will benefit the client downstream. And also, when we hit new capacity points, which we'll likely hit this year, there could be a rejuvenation on the HDD side. On the enterprise side, you have legacy, which continues to kind of march along at stronger rates than people have expected, I think that will continue. And the real growth is in nearline, and I think that's where it's particularly exciting. Data science applications, machine-to-machine data creation and, of course, just massive amounts of unstructured data mostly in the form of video, and especially high-def 4K video. It's just growing rapidly, and that's being deployed around the world. And all of the implications for that at the application level obviously are what's exciting. And then that's obviously creating business for people to want to store their stuff. So we're particularly excited about that. We don't get really hung up on this. Is it a hybrid cloud model or everything's going to 5 big CSPs. We engage obviously with all of them. We believe it's a hybrid cloud model, which is probably going to inform Phil's business to a greater degree because there will be, we think,  lots of petabytes shipped into corporations that want to basically have their own quote cloud as well as leveraging off of any other private clouds. But we're well-positioned either way. So I think the excitement clearly on exabyte growth is in that category. And overall, I think you still see data in the data centers that shows exabyte growth still annually clipping above 50% and some at 100% depending on the CSPs. And overall, we still think that the exabyte growth will be in excess of aerial density, which means we're going to absorb more heads and disks and test time, which is also critical. The other final point, I'm sorry for the super long-winded answer, but it's not just about exabyte growth, it's about the package in the exabytes. And again, I think financial analysts have continued to miss this shift from client to cloud. The implications for that, not just in terms of heads and disk absorption in terms of units, but heads and disk absorption and test in terms of complexity are content people are missing. So as you move to a 6 and an 8 and a 10 beyond that terabyte drives, the process content inside of the heads and the disk and the related test codes increases dramatically. So in addition to more piece parts that are required for more heads and disks for platform, the content inside those piece points is getting more intense, which also results in more absorption. So the trend is in our favor. Sure, it'd be great to have a bunch of client growth on top of it, but if the trend is just this, it's a good thing for the drive industry. And we're positioning ourselves obviously from a technology perspective to have best-in-class products."

The controller technology, in particular, is very interesting because it's flash-agnostic. And for a while, I've been kind of marching down a team that while the conventional wisdom is owning the media is a huge cost advantage. And therefore, you have to own the media. The reality is only one company can be leading in media and everybody else, by definition, is behind. Now someone may just be a little bit behind and someone may be a lot a bit behind, but if you're running fabs, you're going to keep those fabs open. And if your flash isn't competitive, you've got a problem. Whereas with our technology, we can take that controller technology and apply to whoever has the best flash or the cheapest flash or to a combination thereof. And I'm not completely convinced yet that the companies that are actually media-independent might have a better advantage long-term in certain market segments, certainly not if you're talking about low-grade consumer flash. But certainly stuff that requires workload that we're experts at. We actually like having the optionality, and our controller technology does inform us in terms of our overall systems strategy.

Yes, I'd say we're still feeling it's kind of a 60/40 back half to the first half of the year for the nearline cloud service providers. And then overall, as I said, it feels pretty flat to us right now. Obviously, generally, the second half is stronger. We do have some favorable things in the marketplace between a new Intel chip and Win 10. Maybe that drives some acceleration, but I was wrong last quarter anticipating that. I don't want to be wrong at least in the same direction twice in a row. So we're remaining conservative and just calling for a flat quarter in the other segments. But I do think we'll see strength in the nearline and legacy. And those, As you know, is kind of -- it's fits and starts. So we'll see where we're at on legacy.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. For the fourth fiscal quarter 2015, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.9 billion and, on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 27.2%, net income of $250 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.77. Overall storage shipments for the June quarter were 52 exabytes, up 5% year-over-year, with an average capacity per drive continuing to average over 1.1 terabytes per drive. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $515 million, reflecting expense control around the core business and new adjacencies in addition to lower variable compensation. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $228 million, and capital expenditures were in line with our expectations. Our inventory levels were reduced 8% sequentially, and we exited Q4 with the lowest level of HDD finished-goods inventory value since 2009. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we ended this quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents. 
Revenue challenges from macroeconomic pressures and PC systems demand have been persistent factors that have offset continued growth in other areas of our business. While the magnitude of these factors did not increase intra-quarter in June, conditions did not improve as we expected, resulting in an impact to our revenue greater than our initial expectations. In light of the mixed market dynamic conditions over the last few quarters, we are satisfied with the company's overall execution in fiscal year '15. Highlights include total revenues of $13.7 billion and, and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 28.1%, net income of $1.5 billion and diluted earnings per share of $4.57. Over the course of the fiscal year, we shipped over 228 exabytes of storage, up 13% from fiscal year '14. Within that, Seagate's nearline cloud exabyte shipments increased more than 50%, indicating that we are gaining traction with the higher capacity offerings in our nearline portfolio. And our longer-term thesis of data growth and shifts to cloud infrastructure and hyperscale deployments continue to progress. 
In fiscal year '15, Seagate generated over $2.6 billion in operating cash flow, including the legal settlement from Western Digital. We returned greater than 65% of our operating cash flow or $1.8 billion to shareholders in the form of dividend and share redemptions in fiscal year '15, increasing our dividend per share by 26% and decreasing our shares outstanding by 6%. We continue to believe our capital allocation policy is aligned with long-term shareholder value creation, and reflects our confidence in our ability to generate strong cash flow from our businesses. 
From an R&D perspective, we have successfully transformed a good portion of our traditional storage hardware portfolio and made extensive progress towards pursuing our adjacencies in cloud systems and flash technology. We will have more discussion regarding our technology portfolio of advancements and related opportunities at our strategic update on September 2nd. For the September quarter, we are forecasting for a relatively flat business environment as we continue to shape our top line revenue opportunities that preserve our business profitability and enable us to continue to invest in advancing our storage technology portfolio offerings. For the September quarter, we are planning for revenue of approximately $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion. And we anticipate margins to be relatively flat, taking into account the anticipated seasonal mix and the lean production schedule. 
As of today, we have redeemed approximately 14.5 million shares of stock quarter-to-date, and we are on pace to exit the quarter with less than 300 million shares outstanding, returning over $900 million to investors through dividend and share redemptions in the September quarter. Operationally, we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of our expense base and have identified areas where we can improve efficiency and lower costs in fiscal year '16. For the September quarter, we are targeting operating expenses to be flat sequentially at approximately $515 million. We plan to actively address additional savings opportunities through the end of the calendar year, and we expect operating expenses will be comfortably under $500 million a quarter in the second half of fiscal year '16. These actions will decrease total operating expense by at least 10% for the fiscal year. As a result of our business outlook, capital allocation and expense control, we are targeting at least 10% non-GAAP EPS growth in fiscal year '16. 
I thank our employees for their hard work and our customers, vendors, suppliers and shareholders for their ongoing support. I'll now open up the call for questions."

I think in terms of the gross margin, Aaron, the delta kind of makes sense to us all in all. Probably the biggest change was the absorption issue. So we ran our factories really lean. Inventory levels are 35% below the competition's right now. And that absorption impact maybe was as much as 100 basis points. So that's significant. I think other issues are we've only had 24 hours to look at the other results, but it does seem like the competition attained revenue earlier in the quarter by virtue of the DSO. And that usually has a margin impact just because pricing sometimes gets more challenging through the quarter. And it looks also that they probably had some share gain in nearline distribution, which is probably a nice margin advantage as well. And so we're off to kind of decide, figure out where that opportunity lays for us in the next couple of quarters. I think the fourth point is probably that for the non-HDD businesses for both of us, which are $250 million-ish, well, I think both of us obviously are running margins below the corporate average. Our estimate is that ours are further below. And so we still have work to do there, as we've talked before, over the next couple of quarters to improve that margin profile. So I think the combination of things explains the delta to our original forecast and probably the delta to the competition as well. But the single biggest point was we basically ran our factories really lean and reduced inventory. And that has a big absorption impact."

The lead times are in-quarter usually and the test times are pretty short. So one of the reasons we ran inventories really lean is because at least, if the pocket of upside is client, we can chase that very efficiently. Seagate's great at doing that. And as you know, we're also on the front end of a big product rotation in those categories. So it's smart for us to keep our inventories really lean as we go into the new cycle, which we're very excited about. I think on the nearline, it's much tougher. Lead times on nearline are -- between wafer and test are well beyond 13 weeks. So unless you're staging inventory, which we can stage some inventory, say, for -- at wafer level or whatever to take some of that lead time out. Chasing big upsides on nearline and mission-critical is much more difficult. So it just depends where the products come in."

In terms of taking out capacity, which may or may not be an action that the competition's taking -- it wasn't quite clear to us what was going on in that restructuring charge, and we didn't really understand the answer -- that we don't think that taking out a major asset right now is the right move just because, as you know, we still are very bullish on the long-term prospects of exabyte growth. And we're actually bullish on client, ultimately, as I've talked before. It just depends on how you define client. And we believe there'll be a whole new class of clients and they're going to need lots of storage. So we don't want to take a bunch of capacity off and then turn around and be putting capacity on. So if things stay low for a while, sure, you have options to do that. But that's not where we're at right now, but there are probably efficiencies that will flow through to the cost of goods lines as well."

I think on the client side, I think for the next 18 to 24 months, it's a tough market because the existing definition of client probably isn't going to change much between desktop, notebook, tablet and phones of 2 different sizes. And I think the mix-and-match of that client is probably kind of a net zero-sum game in terms of the trade-offs that people are making in platforms. Now the trend away from tablets to the big phones was probably also going to benefit notebooks because at some point, you need a bigger platform and a bigger screen to deal with. And then all of those have implications, but they don't have a lot of storage onboard. And what I mean by a lot is certainly more than 128, maybe even more than 256. Then you have an external storage play, which we continue to see the exabyte shipments on the branded business exceeding that, that goes in the cloud, which people kind of still haven't really focused on. But I do think that in the commercial space for notebook will be the continued advancement of platforms with less onboard storage, and they'll probably be serviced by 120-gig -- 128 gigs of flash more and more. It's still not half the market, but I think it's growing. I think on the consumer side, the HDD play is still the obvious play just because consumers are big users of content. The performance and cost, obviously, of HDDs if you want 1 or 2 terabytes is kind of untouchable. So I think then the issue is what happens. And again, I think it's the idea around the new client, whether or not it's 3D printers or whether or not it's AR or VR, whether or not it's robotics or surveillance capture devices. There's going to be a whole host of new clients that we're particularly excited about that I think will benefit the client downstream. And also, when we hit new capacity points, which we'll likely hit this year, there could be a rejuvenation on the HDD side. On the enterprise side, you have legacy, which continues to kind of march along at stronger rates than people have expected. I think that will continue. And the real growth is in nearline, and I think that's where it's particularly exciting. Data science applications, machine-to-machine data creation and, of course, just massive amounts of unstructured data mostly in the form of video, and especially high-def 4K video. It's just growing rapidly, and that's being deployed around the world. And all of the implications for that at the application level obviously are what's exciting. And then that's obviously creating the impetus for people to want to store this stuff. So we're particularly excited about that. We don't get really hung up on is it a hybrid cloud model or everything's going to 5 big CSPs. We engage obviously with all of them. We believe it's a hybrid cloud model, which is probably going to inform Phil's business to a greater degree because there will be, we think,  lots of petabytes shipped into corporations that want to basically have their own ""cloud"" as well as leveraging off of any other public clouds. But we're well positioned either way. So I think the excitement clearly on exabyte growth is in that category. And overall, I think you still see data in the data centers that shows exabyte growth still annually clipping above 50% and some at 100%, depending on the CSPs. And overall, we still think that the exabyte growth will be in excess of areal density, which means we're going to absorb more heads and disks and test time, which is also critical. The other final point, I'm sorry for the super long-winded answer, but it's not just about exabyte growth, it's about the packaging the exabytes. And again, I think financial analysts have continued to miss this shift from client to cloud. The implications for that, not just in terms of heads and disk absorption in terms of units, but heads and disk absorption and test in terms of complexity or content people are missing. So as you move to a 6 and an 8 and a 10 beyond that terabyte drives, the process content inside of the heads and the disk and the related test codes increases dramatically. So in addition to more piece parts that are required for more heads and disks per platform, the content inside those piece points is getting more intense, which also results in more absorption. So the trend is in our favor. Sure, it'd be great to have a bunch of client growth on top of it, but if the trend is just this, it's a good thing for the drive industry. And we're positioning ourselves obviously from a technology perspective to have best-in-class products."

But right now, the assumption is for -- think of it as a relatively flat revenue TAM, and then to your point, operating expense controls, as mentioned. And again, don't forget, some of these operating savings don't occur until the second half of the year. So it's a little different than just saying it's all coming from OpEx because the math actually doesn't say that. But it's generally -- you're right, generally, in terms of direction.

The controller technology, in particular, is very interesting because it's flash-agnostic. And for a while, I've been kind of marching down a theme that while the conventional wisdom is owning the media is a huge cost advantage, and therefore, you have to own the media, the reality is only one company can be leading in media and everybody else, by definition, is behind. Now someone may just be a little bit behind and someone may be a lot a bit behind, but if you're running fabs, you're going to keep those fabs open. And if your flash isn't competitive, you've got a problem. Whereas with our technology, we can take that controller technology and apply to whoever has the best flash or the cheapest flash or to a combination thereof. And I'm not completely convinced yet that the companies that are actually media-independent might have a better advantage long-term in certain market segments, certainly not if you're talking about low-grade consumer flash. But certainly stuff that requires workload that we're experts at. We actually like having the optionality, and our controller technology does inform us in terms of our overall systems strategy. So the intent obviously is to keep it internal. If someone would want to pay us $50 billion for it, we'd probably sell it."

Most of your flash product is actually not hanging off the storage bus; it's fast memory. So I think you have to be careful about where you're talking about where our devices go versus where flash is used. Most implementations of flash in a data center also have massive amounts of storage.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. For the fourth fiscal quarter 2015, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.9 billion and, on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 27.2%, net income of $250 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.77. Overall storage shipments for the June quarter were 52 exabytes, up 5% year-over-year, with an average capacity per drive continuing to average over 1.1 terabytes per drive. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $515 million, reflecting expense control around the core business and new adjacencies in addition to lower variable compensation. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $228 million, and capital expenditures were in line with our expectations. Our inventory levels were reduced 8% sequentially, and we exited Q4 with the lowest level of HDD finished goods inventory value since 2009. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we ended this quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents. 
Revenue challenges from macroeconomic pressures and PC systems demand have been persistent factors that have offset continued growth in other areas of our business. While the magnitude of these factors did not increase intra-quarter in June, conditions did not improve as we expected, resulting in an impact to our revenue greater than our initial expectations. In light of the mixed market dynamic conditions over the last few quarters, we are satisfied with the company's overall execution in fiscal year '15. Highlights include total revenues of $13.7 billion and, and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 28.1%, net income of $1.5 billion and diluted earnings per share of $4.57. Over the course of the fiscal year, we shipped over 228 exabytes of storage, up 13% from fiscal year '14. Within that, Seagate's nearline cloud exabyte shipments increased more than 50%, indicating that we are gaining traction with the higher capacity offerings in our nearline portfolio. And our longer-term thesis of data growth and shifts to cloud infrastructure and hyperscale deployments continue to progress. 
In fiscal year '15, Seagate generated over $2.6 billion in operating cash flow, including the legal settlement from Western Digital. We returned greater than 65% of our operating cash flow or $1.8 billion to shareholders in the form of dividend and share redemptions in fiscal year '15, increasing our dividend per share by 26% and decreasing our shares outstanding by 6%. We continue to believe our capital allocation policy is aligned with long-term shareholder value creation, and reflects our confidence in our ability to generate strong cash flow from our businesses. 
From an R&D perspective, we have successfully transformed a good portion of our traditional storage hardware portfolio and made extensive progress towards pursuing our adjacencies in cloud systems and flash technology. We will have more discussion regarding our technology portfolio of advancements and related opportunities at our strategic update on September 2nd. For the September quarter, we are forecasting for a relatively flat business environment as we continue to shape our top line revenue opportunities that preserve our business profitability and enable us to continue to invest in advancing our storage technology portfolio offerings. For the September quarter, we are planning for revenue of approximately $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion. And we anticipate margins to be relatively flat, taking into account the anticipated seasonal mix and the lean production schedule. 
As of today, we have redeemed approximately 14.5 million shares of stock quarter-to-date, and we are on pace to exit the quarter with less than 300 million shares outstanding, returning over $900 million to investors through dividend and share redemptions in the September quarter. Operationally, we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of our expense base and have identified areas where we can improve efficiency and lower costs in fiscal year '16. For the September quarter, we are targeting operating expenses to be flat sequentially at approximately $515 million. We plan to actively address additional savings opportunities through the end of the calendar year, and we expect operating expenses will be comfortably under $500 million a quarter in the second half of fiscal year '16. These actions will decrease total operating expense by at least 10% for the fiscal year. As a result of our business outlook, capital allocation and expense control, we are targeting at least 10% non-GAAP EPS growth in fiscal year '16. 
I thank our employees for their hard work and our customers, vendors, suppliers and shareholders for their ongoing support. I'll now open up the call for questions."

I think in terms of the gross margin, Aaron, the delta kind of makes sense to us all in all. Probably the biggest change was the absorption issue. So we ran our factories really lean. Inventory levels are 35% below the competition's right now. And that absorption impact maybe was as much as 100 basis points. So that's significant. I think other issues are we've only had 24 hours to look at the other results, but it does seem like the competition attained revenue earlier in the quarter by virtue of the DSO. And that usually has a margin impact just because pricing sometimes gets more challenging through the quarter. And it looks also that they probably had some share gain in nearline distribution, which is probably a nice margin advantage as well. And so we're off to kind of decide, figure out where that opportunity lays for us in the next couple of quarters. I think the fourth point is probably that for the non-HDD businesses for both of us, which are $250 million-ish, well, I think both of us obviously are running margins below the corporate average. Our estimate is that ours are further below. And so we still have work to do there, as we've talked before, over the next couple of quarters to improve that margin profile. So I think the combination of things explains the delta to our original forecast and probably the delta to the competition as well. But the single biggest point was we basically ran our factories really lean and reduced inventory. And that has a big absorption impact."

The lead times are in-quarter usually and the test times are pretty short. So one of the reasons we ran inventories really lean is because at least, if the pocket of upside is client, we can chase that very efficiently. Seagate's great at doing that. And as you know, we're also on the front end of a big product rotation in those categories. So it's smart for us to keep our inventories really lean as we go into the new cycle, which we're very excited about. I think on the nearline, it's much tougher. Lead times on nearline are -- between wafer and test are well beyond 13 weeks. So unless you're staging inventory, which we can stage some inventory, say, for -- at wafer level or whatever to take some of that lead time out. Chasing big upsides on nearline and mission-critical is much more difficult. So it just depends where the products come in."

In terms of taking out capacity, which may or may not be an action that the competition's taking -- it wasn't quite clear to us what was going on in that restructuring charge, and we didn't really understand the answer -- that we don't think that taking out a major asset right now is the right move just because, as you know, we still are very bullish on the long-term prospects of exabyte growth. And we're actually bullish on client, ultimately, as I've talked before. It just depends on how you define client. And we believe there'll be a whole new class of clients and they're going to need lots of storage. So we don't want to take a bunch of capacity off and then turn around and be putting capacity on. So if things stay low for a while, sure, you have options to do that. But that's not where we're at right now, but there are probably efficiencies that will flow through to the cost of goods lines as well."

I think on the client side, I think for the next 18 to 24 months, it's a tough market because the existing definition of client probably isn't going to change much between desktop, notebook, tablet and phones of 2 different sizes. And I think the mix-and-match of that client is probably kind of a net zero-sum game in terms of the trade-offs that people are making in platforms. Now the trend away from tablets to the big phones was probably also going to benefit notebooks because at some point, you need a bigger platform and a bigger screen to deal with. And then all of those have implications, but they don't have a lot of storage onboard. And what I mean by a lot is certainly more than 128, maybe even more than 256. Then you have an external storage play, which we continue to see the exabyte shipments on the branded business exceeding that, that goes in the cloud, which people kind of still haven't really focused on. But I do think that in the commercial space for notebook will be the continued advancement of platforms with less onboard storage, and they'll probably be serviced by 120-gig -- 128 gigs of flash more and more. It's still not half the market, but I think it's growing. I think on the consumer side, the HDD play is still the obvious play just because consumers are big users of content. The performance and cost, obviously, of HDDs if you want 1 or 2 terabytes is kind of untouchable. So I think then the issue is what happens. And again, I think it's the idea around the new client, whether or not it's 3D printers or whether or not it's AR or VR, whether or not it's robotics or surveillance capture devices. There's going to be a whole host of new clients that we're particularly excited about that I think will benefit the client downstream. And also, when we hit new capacity points, which we'll likely hit this year, there could be a rejuvenation on the HDD side. On the enterprise side, you have legacy, which continues to kind of march along at stronger rates than people have expected. I think that will continue. And the real growth is in nearline, and I think that's where it's particularly exciting. Data science applications, machine-to-machine data creation and, of course, just massive amounts of unstructured data mostly in the form of video, and especially high-def 4K video. It's just growing rapidly, and that's being deployed around the world. And all of the implications for that at the application level obviously are what's exciting. And then that's obviously creating the impetus for people to want to store this stuff. So we're particularly excited about that. We don't get really hung up on is it a hybrid cloud model or everything's going to 5 big CSPs. We engage obviously with all of them. We believe it's a hybrid cloud model, which is probably going to inform Phil's business to a greater degree because there will be, we think, lots of petabytes shipped into corporations that want to basically have their own ""cloud"" as well as leveraging off of any other public clouds. But we're well positioned either way. So I think the excitement clearly on exabyte growth is in that category. And overall, I think you still see data in the data centers that shows exabyte growth still annually clipping above 50% and some at 100%, depending on the CSPs. And overall, we still think that the exabyte growth will be in excess of areal density, which means we're going to absorb more heads and disks and test time, which is also critical. The other final point, I'm sorry for the super long-winded answer, but it's not just about exabyte growth, it's about the packaging the exabytes. And again, I think financial analysts have continued to miss this shift from client to cloud. The implications for that, not just in terms of heads and disk absorption in terms of units, but heads and disk absorption and test in terms of complexity or content people are missing. So as you move to a 6 and an 8 and a 10 beyond that terabyte drives, the process content inside of the heads and the disk and the related test codes increases dramatically. So in addition to more piece parts that are required for more heads and disks per platform, the content inside those piece points is getting more intense, which also results in more absorption. So the trend is in our favor. Sure, it'd be great to have a bunch of client growth on top of it, but if the trend is just this, it's a good thing for the drive industry. And we're positioning ourselves obviously from a technology perspective to have best-in-class products."

The controller technology, in particular, is very interesting because it's flash-agnostic. And for a while, I've been kind of marching down a theme that while the conventional wisdom is owning the media is a huge cost advantage, and therefore, you have to own the media, the reality is only one company can be leading in media and everybody else, by definition, is behind. Now someone may just be a little bit behind and someone may be a lot a bit behind, but if you're running fabs, you're going to keep those fabs open. And if your flash isn't competitive, you've got a problem. Whereas with our technology, we can take that controller technology and apply to whoever has the best flash or the cheapest flash or to a combination thereof. And I'm not completely convinced yet that the companies that are actually media-independent might have a better advantage long-term in certain market segments, certainly not if you're talking about low-grade consumer flash. But certainly stuff that requires workload that we're experts at. We actually like having the optionality, and our controller technology does inform us in terms of our overall systems strategy.

Most of your flash product is actually not hanging off the storage bus; it's fast memory. So I think you have to be careful about where you're talking about where our devices go versus where flash is used. Most implementations of flash in a data center also have massive amounts of storage.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. The first fiscal quarter 2016 Seagate achieved revenues of $2.9 billion; and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 24.2%, net income of $165 million and diluted earnings per share of $",1009,"Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. The first fiscal quarter 2016 Seagate achieved revenues of $2.9 billion; and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 24.2%, net income of $165 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.54. 
Overall shipments for the September quarter were 55.6 [ph] exabytes, up 7% sequentially with the average capacity per drive over 1.1 terabytes per drive. 
As we stated in our preannouncement, there were intra-quarter demand developments that brought our revenue in at the lower end of our forecasted range and impacted the profitability contribution of our HDD portfolio to corporate margins by approximately 300 basis points. 
While the September quarter nearline enterprise demand was marginally lower than expected in terms of both units and exabytes, we believe Seagate's CSP and OEM customer base is more highly concentrated than the competitors and therefore has a high degree -- higher degree of volatility. This dynamic led to a negative impact on Seagate in the September quarter, resulting in lower mix, higher inventory carry and reduced absorption, impacting the corporate gross margin by approximately 190 basis points.
The company needs to further leverage its technical leadership across its product offering to address the broader market opportunity and needs more active engagement with these customers on the sales and technical side. These issues are being addressed and progress will be achieved over the next 2 to 3 quarters. 
In addition, we saw upside in 2.5-inch notebook and gaining client applications, which have margins at the lower end of our product portfolio. The lower-margin contribution from the portfolio  shipped in volumes impacted the corporate margin by approximately 110 basis points.
While we are disappointed in our overall corporate margin results for the September quarter, we believe we have a path to sequential margin improvement that I will cover in our December quarter outlook. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $501 million, down 9% year-over-year, reflecting expense control around the core business, adjacencies, restructuring activities and lower variable compensation.
Drive inventory levels increased by approximately $160 million sequentially due primarily to the increase in finished goods from our enterprise products. Capital expenditures were in line with our expectations.
In the September quarter, we had strong cash flow from operations of $824 million and free cash flow of $615 million. We effectively executed on our long-term capital allocation goals for the shareholders and redeemed approximately 20 million shares in the September quarter, reducing our outstanding shares down to 299 million shares.
Our balance sheet remains healthy and we ended the quarter with $1.9 billion [ph] in cash and cash equivalents.
There are a few developments from the last few weeks that are meaningful to Seagate that I'd like to provide some additional context.
We closed our acquisition of Dot Hill on October 6 and we have begun integrating the business into our Cloud Systems and Solution business. We are pleased to have the Dot Hill team onboard and believe the expansion of our Cloud Systems and Solutions product portfolio will enable us to better serve our storage OEM customers and further leverage our core storage technology expertise.
On October 22, we were notified by China's Ministry of Commerce that the company can now integrate Samsung's hard disk drive business completely into Seagate. This now allows us to move forward in our plans to consolidate our product portfolio, leverage go-to-market synergies, broaden sales coverage and optimize design centers. All of these activities will benefit our customers.
At our board meeting last week, we approved the 17% increase in our dividend payment, raising our annual rate to $2.52 per share. This dividend raise reflects the confidence we have in the future cash flows of our business and fulfills our goal to increase our dividend by at least 10% for the fiscal year.
Our capital return to shareholders remains a top priority at Seagate and we continue to balance the effective investment in our technology portfolio with shareholder returns and within an investment grade framework.
Turning to our business outlook. We believe that overall storage market demand will continue to be relatively flat in the December quarter. This includes some slight uptick in enterprise, nearline demand and seasonal declines in the client and gaming markets. For the December quarter, we are planning for revenues to be between $2.9 billion and $3 billion and we are forecasting operating expense to continue to decline to approximately $485 million in the December quarter.
We plan to exit fiscal year '16 with operating expenses of $460 million per quarter, including Samsung integration synergies and the acquisition of Dot Hill.
Under these assumptions, we will reduce our fiscal non-GAAP year-over-year spend by approximately 12%. Our non-GAAP gross margins should be sequentially improved with mix, new product offerings and absorption cost benefit to approximately 25.5% to 26%. As enterprise exabyte demand continues to grow at 35%, along with our ability to monetize the demand of our product offerings, we believe we will be back in our targeted margin range of 27% to 32% by the June quarter. 
Before we open up for the questions, I would like to highlight the promotion of Dave Morton to Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Seagate. With over 20 years at the company, Dave is already a very active contributor of our management team. And the board and I are confident in his abilities to continue to provide effective leadership and financial stewardship for Seagate. 
I also thank Pat O'Malley for his 7 years of service in the CFO role and over 25 years of contributions at Seagate. Under Pat's leadership, we have refined our effective and resilient financial model, executed a very good track record on total shareholder return and return on invested capital and strengthened our balance sheet. I'm very pleased Pat will be continuing his career in Seagate as an Executive Vice President role reporting to me and working on a number of strategic initiatives. 
I would like to thank our customers, suppliers, employees for their continued support. And we're now ready for Q&A."

An it's not often that the CSP base in particular doesn't engage for more than 3 or 4 quarters and we're kind of in an outer end of that dimension right now. So we'd expect at some point here that there would be a capital cycle that would improve. For us, I think it's as much as broadening customer base. Some of that is product related and some of it is just engagement related. So that's opportunity in front us, I think regardless whether or not there is a market acceleration. But the fact that the second half of the year didn't develop the way I think the industry expected it would, I think that does probably say at some point it's going to be a capital cycle up. And right now, we don't have any signals that say it's going to be in the first half of the year, but we don't have any say that it's not either. I think a lot of it just depends to what happens in December and then people started in contracts. As you know, it's a cyclical business that's highly concentrated. And until there's more diversity in that customer set, it's going to kind of have an ebb and flow that can be challenging like it was for this quarter for us."

That's the bulk of what hurt as last quarter. I mean again, I'm reading some of the analysts and other industry observers work. I don't thin",532,"Well, the biggest thing, clearly, is better traction at our higher capacity, nearline and mission-critical drives. That's the bulk of what hurt as last quarter. I mean again, I'm reading some of the analysts and other industry observers work. I don't think there's still a great understanding about the leverage that's in the manufacturing system, especially on these enterprise drives, we're absorbing as many heads and disks and test time as we are. So unit misses in the 500,000 unit range, while it don't sound big relative to 45 million or 50 million shipment, they are. And especially obviously at the margin when the cost has been completely absorbed. And of course, decent price points, but they're obviously -- the good margin products to begin with. But they're sitting in the inventory than the really good margin products. And you can see it from our inventory uptick of $160 million, that translating into revenue accounts for a couple of 100 [ph] basis points of gross margin.
So clearing through that inventory in a responsible way is going to take a couple of quarters. And as we do that, then we're going to see a more regular trend back to the overall gross margin that we expect to deliver. The other thing about that is it kind of may feel like a big surprise, but the other reality is the industry moves a lot of drives in the last 2 weeks of the quarter. And really, with a week to go in this quarter, we could have still delivered the gross margin that we should have. And it was just basically not executing or not having customers take the drives that we thought they were going to take. So that being the case, we're hoping that we can get those drives moving on, and again in a reasonable way sooner rather than later so that we can back to the margin model that, that piece of the business delivers. I think in terms of the incremental margin improvement of Phil's business, we really have I think a nice path of saying where we're at today from a gross margin and operating margin perspective to make sequential quarter improvements in the direction that Phil talked about. And ultimately we do believe that at the gross margin level it's accretive to the range and certainly to the midpoint of the range. So I think that certainly will help. And then another big hunk of it as you pointed out is operating expense control. Like you said, we think we can still take another $20 million out of that number, which is, as you know, 2 quarters ago was on its way to 580 [ph]. So to get down to 460 [ph], we feel pretty good about it. So I think it's a combination of all 3. It's all stuff that's right in front of us. It's for us to execute against. The trickiest stuff is, frankly, finding those customers that are taking those higher capacity drives. And for the customers that we do engage with, understanding how we can get a better mix, because clearly right now we're not getting the mix that we should."

The Moscom thing, it's hard to answer the question. For us, of course, if we just looked at it from a synergy perspective on ""OpEx"", as you know we were basically maintaining a separate go-to market organization for that. It wasn't a huge go-to market organization. So the synergies isn't so much immediately OpEx-related, there will be some. There may be some OpEx related in that we were moving a lot of units, over 10 million units, with a pretty lean organization. And we are actually kind of reverse engineering that to say how can we take advantage of ""the Seagate operation"", to look more like that. So actually, synergies may effectively come from reduction in Seagate OpEx as opposed to the apparent reduction in the small single digit millions of dollars that we were spending on the Samsung side. I think the other big piece is revenue synergies. I mean clearly now that product line is the highest areal density product in the industry. It has been for a couple of years. And we can now broaden that to the broader Seagate sales force. I think there's going to be some nice revenue synergies from that. And then the other big synergy that is an OpEx synergy, but I can't tell you and it's going to save as many dollars is that design center, which is a very competent design center, is now free to design products that don't have to be subject of a whole separate. And so that allows us basically to start putting products into that design center or having products come out of that design center that aren't going to be limited to the Samsung sales force. And so in that sensors, nice operating leverage because of the design center is an expensive thing to keep. And so having a broader portfolio come out of that, we think, is beneficial. So net-net, we think it basically drives better revenue opportunity, clearly better margin opportunity as we mix across the portfolio and then better operating margin because of that more efficient dynamic on the design center as well as the go-to market side."

It's kind of the overall transaction. Because when you kind of go through it, it's a $10 billion premium to the 90-day average. 35x earnings for a company that hasn't had earnings growth in 5 years, actually has earnings decline in 5 years, isn't a technical cost leader. And you're going to finance it with 10 [ph] -- $18 billion of debt, which means that you have to somehow have a big OpEx cuts, because there's not enough SG&A to pay for that. When there appears to be enough revenue synergies because there's not a competitive technology relative to the leaders, so it's going to come down to engineering cuts. So I think that's the opportunity. It's not so much the distraction. Maybe there's a distraction, maybe there isn't. But the reality is in order to make that model work is going to have to be OpEx cuts to pay back that huge each debt load or we had to go to and build another fab. And this is just an industry where whether or not its the Flash side or the HDD side, massive cuts in R&D doesn't seem smart. But for us, it's good. So I think the opportunity is to make sure -- look, Seagate feels great about where we're at technically. We don't obviously feel great about having the broadest portfolio that we need, and we need to address that. But the good news is, we have the technical leadership to do that. So we'll keep pressing that case. That's, I think, what's going to translate into the market opportunity, whether or not it's the enterprise level of the client level or nearline level. And I do think that, that transaction gives as an opportunity just because the OpEx side of their business is going to be challenged to pay back all that debt."

But it feels like the PC market has kind of found its space and that there's probably a little bit of traction for some marginal growth. I think with respect to Seagate, kind of gets back to the technical point, we are excited about the product portfolio that we're about the roll. We do think when you transition to kind of 1 and 2 terabyte products, that's compelling for those client-based systems that actually do need onboard storage. And of course, we can do that in the form factors that fit into the new thin and light notebooks. So I think we're kind of -- we're, I think, look, Seagate is always a little bit bullish on client than maybe others. And I think within that segment, we feel that we're particularly well aligned and maybe begin that reflection of the fact that we're very OEM concentrated and we feel good about lining up with what the OEMs need in that space. So I feel okay about the clients space going forward. And as you know, I'm more encouraged also that there's some clients that go beyond what we're calling a client today. And I still think those opportunities continue to open up and they're going to need 1 and 2 and 4 terabytes of data. By the way, same could be said about the branded market. We've got a nice 4 terabyte market product out there right now and we're gaining traction with it. And we continue to believe that the direct attached storage business will be good on the client-side especially as people skinny down what they have onboard."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. The first fiscal quarter 2016, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.9 billion; and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 24.2%, net income of $165 million and diluted earnings per share of",1009,"Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. The first fiscal quarter 2016, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.9 billion; and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 24.2%, net income of $165 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.54.
Overall shipments for the September quarter were 55.6 exabytes, up 7% sequentially with the average capacity per drive over 1.1 terabytes per drive.
As we stated in our preannouncement, there were intra-quarter demand developments that brought our revenue in at the lower end of our forecasted range and impacted the profitability contribution of our HDD portfolio to corporate margins by approximately 300 basis points.
While the September quarter nearline and enterprise demand was marginally lower than expected in terms of both units and exabytes, we believe Seagate's CSP and OEM customer base is more highly concentrated than the competitors and therefore has a high degree -- higher degree of volatility. This dynamic led to a negative impact on Seagate in the September quarter, resulting in lower mix, higher inventory carry and reduced absorption, impacting the corporate gross margin by approximately 190 basis points.
The company needs to further leverage its technical leadership across its product offering to address the broader market opportunity and needs more active engagement with these customers on the sales and technical side. These issues are being addressed and progress will be achieved over the next 2 to 3 quarters.
In addition, we saw upside in 2.5-inch notebook and gaining client applications, which have margins at the lower end of our product portfolio. The lower-margin contribution from the portfolio shipped in volumes impacted the corporate margin by approximately 110 basis points.
While we are disappointed in our overall corporate margin results for the September quarter, we believe we have a path to sequential margin improvement that I will cover in our December quarter outlook. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $501 million, down 9% year-over-year, reflecting expense control around the core business, adjacencies, restructuring activities and lower variable compensation.
Drive inventory levels increased by approximately $160 million sequentially, due primarily to the increase in finished goods from our enterprise products. Capital expenditures were in line with our expectations.
In the September quarter, we had strong cash flow from operations of $824 million and free cash flow of $615 million. We effectively executed on our long-term capital allocation goals for the shareholders and redeemed approximately 20 million shares in the September quarter, reducing our outstanding shares down to 299 million shares.
Our balance sheet remains healthy and we ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents.
There are a few developments from the last few weeks that are meaningful to Seagate that I'd like to provide some additional context. We closed our acquisition of Dot Hill on October 6, and we have begun integrating the business into our Cloud Systems and Solution business. We are pleased to have the Dot Hill team onboard and believe the expansion of our Cloud Systems and Solutions product portfolio will enable us to better serve our storage OEM customers and further leverage our core storage technology expertise.
On October 22, we were notified by China's Ministry of Commerce that the company can now integrate Samsung's hard disk drive business completely into Seagate. This now allows us to move forward in our plans to consolidate our product portfolio, leverage go-to-market synergies, broaden sales coverage and optimize design centers. All of these activities will benefit our customers.
At our board meeting last week, we approved a 17% increase in our dividend payment, raising our annual rate to $2.52 per share. This dividend raise reflects the confidence we have in the future cash flows of our business and fulfills our goal to increase our dividend by at least 10% for the fiscal year.
Our capital return to shareholders remains a top priority at Seagate and we continue to balance the effective investment in our technology portfolio with shareholder returns and within an investment grade framework.
Turning to our business outlook. We believe the overall storage market demand will continue to be relatively flat in the December quarter. This includes some slight uptick in enterprise, nearline exabyte demand and seasonal declines in the client and gaming markets. For the December quarter, we are planning for revenues to be between $2.9 billion and $3 billion, and we are forecasting operating expense to continue to decline to approximately $485 million in the December quarter.
We plan to exit fiscal year '16 with operating expenses of $460 million per quarter, including Samsung integration synergies and the acquisition of Dot Hill.
Under these assumptions, we will reduce our fiscal non-GAAP year-over-year spend by approximately 12%. Our non-GAAP gross margins should be sequentially improved with mix, new product offerings and absorption cost benefit to approximately 25.5% to 26%. As enterprise exabyte demand continues to grow at 35%, along with our ability to monetize the demand with our product offerings, we believe we will be back in our targeted margin range of 27% to 32% by the June quarter.
Before we open up for the questions, I would like to highlight the promotion of Dave Morton to Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Seagate. With over 20 years at the company, Dave is already a very active contributor of our management team. And the board and I are confident in his abilities to continue to provide effective leadership and financial stewardship for Seagate.
I also thank Pat O'Malley for his 7 years of service in the CFO role and over 25 years of contributions at Seagate. Under Pat's leadership, we have refined our effective and resilient financial model, executed a very good track record on total shareholder return and return on invested capital and strengthened our balance sheet. I'm very pleased, Pat will be continuing his career at Seagate in an Executive Vice President role reporting to me and working on a number of strategic initiatives.
I would like to thank our customers, suppliers, employees for their continued support. And we're now ready for Q&A."

It's hard to say just given kind of the lack of traction that's developed even in the second half of the year. And again, our view is narrow than it should be. And it's not often that the CSP base in particular doesn't engage for more than 3 or 4 quarters and we're kind of on an outer end of that dimension right now. So we'd expect at some point here that there'd be a capital cycle that would improve. For us, I think it's as much as broadening customer base, some of that is product related and some of it is just engagement related. So that's opportunity in front us, so I think regardless of whether or not there is a market acceleration. But the fact that the second half of the year didn't develop the way I think the industry expected it would, I think that does probably say at some point it's going to be a capital cycle up. And right now, we don't have any signals that say it's going to be in the first half of the year, but we don't have any say that it's going to not either. So I think a lot of it just depends on what happens through December and then the people start letting contracts. As you know, it's a cyclical business that's highly concentrated. And until there's more diversity in that customer set, it's going to kind of have an ebb and flow that's -- that can be challenging like it was for this quarter for us."

I mean, again, I'm reading some of the analysts and other industry observers' work. I don't think there's still a great understanding about the leverage that's in the manufacturing system, especially on these enterprise drives. We are absorbing as many heads and disks and test time as we are. So unit misses in 500,000 unit range, while I don't sound big relative to 45 million or 50 million shipment, they are, and especially, obviously, at the margin when the cost has been completely absorbed. And of course, also our decent price points, but they're obviously -- the good margin products to begin with, but obviously if they're already built and sitting in inventory then they're really good margin products. And you could see it from our inventory uptick of $160 million, that translating into revenue accounts for a couple of hundred basis points of gross margin. So clearing through that inventory in a responsible way is going to take a couple of quarters. And as we do that, then we're going to see a more regular trend back to the overall gross margin that we expect to deliver. The other thing about that is it kind of may feel like a big surprise, but the other reality is the industry moves a lot of drives in the last 2 weeks of the quarter. And really, with a week to go in this quarter, we could have still delivered the gross margin that we should have. And it was just basically not executing or not having customers take the drives that we thought they were going to take. So that being the case, we're hoping that we can get those drives moving and again in a reasonable way sooner rather than later, so that we can back to the margin model that, that piece of the business delivers. I think in terms of the incremental margin improvement of Phil's business, we really have, I think, a nice path of saying where we're at today from a gross margin and an operating margin perspective to make sequential quarter improvements in the direction that Phil talked about. And ultimately, we do believe that, at the gross margin level, it's accretive to the range and certainly to the midpoint of the range. So I think that certainly will help. And then another big hunk of it as you pointed out is operating expense control. Like we said, we think that we can still take another $20 million out of that number, which is, as you know, 2 quarters ago was on its way to $580 million. So to get down to $460 million, we feel pretty good about it. So I think it's a combination of all 3. It's all stuff that's right in front of us. It's for us to execute against. The trickiest stuff is, frankly, finding those customers that are taking those higher capacity drives. And for the customers that we do engage with, understanding how we can get a better mix, because clearly right now we're not getting the mix that we should."

The MOFCOM thinks -- it's hard to answer the question. For us, of course, if you just looked at it from a synergy perspective on ""OpEx,"" as you know we were basically maintaining a separate go-to-market organization for that. It wasn't a huge go-to-market organization. So the synergies isn't so much immediately OpEx-related, there will be some. There may be some OpEx related in that. We were moving a lot of units, over 10 million units, with a pretty lean organization. And we are actually kind of reverse engineering that to say, how can we take advantage of ""the Seagate operation"" to may be look more like that. So actually, the synergies may effectively come from reduction in Seagate OpEx as opposed to the apparent reduction in the small single digit millions of dollars that we were spending on the Samsung side. I think the other big piece is revenue synergies. I mean, clearly now that product line is the highest areal density product in the industry. It has been for a couple of years. And we can now broaden that to the broader Seagate sales force. I think there's going to be some nice revenue synergies from that. And then the other big synergy that's in OpEx synergy, but I can't tell you and it's going to save these many dollars, is that design center, which is a very competent design center, is now free to design products that don't have to be subject of the whole separate. And so that allows us basically to start putting products into that design center or having products come out of that design center that aren't going to be limited to the Samsung sales force. And so in that sense, there's nice operating leverage because the design center is an expensive thing to keep. And so having a broader portfolio come out of that, we think is beneficial. So net-net, we think it basically drives better revenue opportunity, clearly better margin opportunity as we mix across the portfolio and then better operating margin because of that more efficient dynamic on the design center as well as the go-to-market side."

And you're going to finance it with $18 billion of debt, which means you have to somehow have big OpEx cuts, because there's not enough SG&A to pay for that. When appear to be enough revenue synergies because it's not a competitive technology relative to the leaders. So it's going to come down to engineering cuts. So I think that's the opportunity. It's not so much the distraction. Maybe there's a distraction, maybe there isn't. But the reality is in order to make that model work, there's going to have to be OpEx cuts to pay back that huge debt load or you never build another fab. And this is just an industry, where whether or not its the Flash side or the HDD side, massive cuts in R&D doesn't seem smart. But for us, it's good. So I think the opportunity is to make sure -- look, Seagate feels great about where we're at technically. We don't obviously feel great about having the broadest portfolio that we need, and we need to address that. But the good news is, we have the technical leadership to do that. So we'll keep pressing that case. That's, I think, what's going to translate into the market opportunity, whether or not it's the enterprise level or the client level or nearline level.

But it feels like the PC market has kind of found its space and that there's probably a little bit of traction for some marginal growth. I think with respect to Seagate, kind of gets back to the technical point, we are excited about the product portfolio that we're about to roll. We do think when you transition to kind of 1 and 2 terabyte products, that's compelling for those client-based systems that actually do need onboard storage. And of course, we can do that in the form factors that fit into the new thin and light notebooks. So I think we're kind of -- we're -- I think, look, Seagate has always been a little bit more bullish on client than maybe others. And I think within that segment, we feel that we're particularly well aligned and maybe again that's reflection of the fact that we're very OEM concentrated and we feel good about lining up with what the OEMs need in that space. So I feel okay about the clients space going forward. And as you know, I'm more encouraged also that there's some clients that goes beyond what we're calling a client today. And I still think those opportunities continue to open up and they're going to need 1 and 2 and 4 terabytes of data. By the way, same could be said about the branded market. We've got a nice 4-terabyte market product out there right now and we're gaining traction with it.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. The first fiscal quarter of 2016, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.9 billion; and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 24.2%, net income of $165 million and diluted earnings per share",1011,"Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. The first fiscal quarter of 2016, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.9 billion; and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 24.2%, net income of $165 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.54.
Overall shipments for the September quarter were 55.6 exabytes, up 7% sequentially with the average capacity per drive over 1.1 terabytes per drive.
As we stated in our preannouncement, there were intra-quarter demand developments that brought our revenue in at the lower end of our forecasted range and impacted the profitability contribution of our HDD portfolio to corporate margins by approximately 300 basis points.
While the September quarter nearline and enterprise demand was marginally lower than expected in terms of both units and exabytes, we believe Seagate's CSP and OEM customer base is more highly concentrated than the competitors and therefore has a high degree -- higher degree of volatility. This dynamic led to a negative impact on Seagate in the September quarter, resulting in lower mix, higher inventory carry and reduced absorption, impacting the corporate gross margin by approximately 190 basis points.
The company needs to further leverage its technical leadership across its product offering to address the broader market opportunity and needs more active engagement with these customers on the sales and technical side. These issues are being addressed and progress will be achieved over the next 2 to 3 quarters.
In addition, we saw upside in 2.5-inch notebook and gaining client applications, which have margins at the lower end of our product portfolio. The lower-margin contribution from the portfolio shipped in volumes impacted the corporate margin by approximately 110 basis points.
While we are disappointed in our overall corporate margin results for the September quarter, we believe we have a path to sequential margin improvement that I will cover in our December quarter outlook. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $501 million, down 9% year-over-year, reflecting expense control around the core business, adjacencies, restructuring activities and lower variable compensation.
Drive inventory levels increased by approximately $160 million sequentially, due primarily to the increase in finished goods from our enterprise products. Capital expenditures were in line with our expectations.
In the September quarter, we had strong cash flow from operations of $824 million and free cash flow of $615 million. We effectively executed on our long-term capital allocation goals for the shareholders and redeemed approximately 20 million shares in the September quarter, reducing our outstanding shares down to 299 million shares.
Our balance sheet remains healthy and we ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents.
There are a few developments from the last few weeks that are meaningful to Seagate, and I'd like to provide some additional context. We closed our acquisition of Dot Hill on October 6, and we have begun integrating the business into our Cloud Systems and Solution business. We are pleased to have the Dot Hill team onboard and believe the expansion of our Cloud Systems and Solutions product portfolio will enable us to better serve our storage OEM customers and further leverage our core storage technology expertise.
On October 22, we were notified by China's Ministry of Commerce that the company can now integrate Samsung's hard disk drive business completely into Seagate. This now allows us to move forward in our plans to consolidate our product portfolio, leverage go-to-market synergies, broaden sales coverage and optimize design centers. All of these activities will benefit our customers.
At our board meeting last week, we approved a 17% increase in our dividend payment, raising our annual rate to $2.52 per share. This dividend raise reflects the confidence we have in the future cash flows of our business and fulfills our goal to increase our dividend by at least 10% for the fiscal year.
Our capital return to shareholders remains a top priority at Seagate and we continue to balance the effective investment in our technology portfolio with shareholder returns and within an investment grade framework.
Turning to our business outlook. We believe the overall storage market demand will continue to be relatively flat in the December quarter. This includes some slight uptick in enterprise, nearline exabyte demand and seasonal declines in the client and gaming markets. For the December quarter, we are planning for revenues to be between $2.9 billion and $3 billion, and we are forecasting operating expense to continue to decline to approximately $485 million in the December quarter.
We plan to exit fiscal year '16 with operating expenses of $460 million per quarter, including Samsung integration synergies and the acquisition of Dot Hill.
Under these assumptions, we will reduce our fiscal non-GAAP year-over-year spend by approximately 12%. Our non-GAAP gross margins should be sequentially improved with mix, new product offerings and absorption cost benefit to approximately 25.5% to 26%. As enterprise exabyte demand continues to grow at 35%, along with our ability to monetize the demand with our product offerings, we believe we will be back in our targeted margin range of 27% to 32% by the June quarter.
Before we open up for the questions, I would like to highlight the promotion of Dave Morton to Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Seagate. With over 20 years at the company, Dave is already a very active contributor of our management team. And the board and I are confident in his abilities to continue to provide effective leadership and financial stewardship for Seagate.
I also thank Pat O'Malley for his 7 years of service in the CFO role and over 25 years of contributions at Seagate. Under Pat's leadership, we have refined our effective and resilient financial model, executed a very good track record on total shareholder return and return on invested capital and strengthened our balance sheet. I'm very pleased, Pat will be continuing his career at Seagate in an Executive Vice President role, reporting to me, and working on a number of strategic initiatives.
I would like to thank our customers, suppliers, and employees for their continued support. And we're now ready for Q&A."

And it's not often that the CSP base in particular doesn't engage for more than 3 or 4 quarters and we're kind of on an outer end of that dimension right now. So we'd expect at some point here that there'd be a capital cycle that would improve. For us, I think it's as much as broadening customer base, some of that is product related and some of it is just engagement related. So that's opportunity in front us, so I think regardless of whether or not there is a market acceleration. But the fact that the second half of the year didn't develop the way I think the industry expected it would, I think that does probably say at some point there's going to be a capital cycle up. And right now, we don't have any signals that say it's going to be in the first half of the year, but we don't have any say that it's going to not either. So I think a lot of it just depends on what happens through December and then the people start letting contracts. As you know, it's a cyclical business that's highly concentrated. And until there's more diversity in that customer set, it's going to kind of have an ebb and flow that's -- that can be challenging like it was for this quarter for us."

I mean, again, I'm reading some of the analysts and other industry observers' work. I don't think there's still a great understanding about the leverage that's in the manufacturing system, especially on these enterprise drives. We are absorbing as many heads and disks and test time as we are. So unit misses in the 500,000 unit range, while they don't sound big relative to 45 million or 50 million shipment, they are, and especially, obviously, at the margin when the cost has been completely absorbed. And of course, those are decent price points, but they're obviously -- they're good margin products to begin with, but obviously if they're already built and sitting in inventory then they're really good margin products. And you could see it from our inventory uptick of $160 million, that translating into revenue accounts for a couple of hundred basis points of gross margin. So clearing through that inventory in a responsible way is going to take a couple of quarters. And as we do that, then we're going to see a more regular trend back to the overall gross margin that we expect to deliver. The other thing about that is it kind of may feel like a big surprise, but the other reality is the industry moves a lot of drives in the last 2 weeks of the quarter. And really, with a week to go in this quarter, we could have still delivered the gross margin that we should have. And it was just basically not executing or not having customers take the drives that we thought they were going to take. So that being the case, we're hoping that we can get those drives moving and again in a reasonable way sooner rather than later, so that we can back to the margin model that, that piece of the business delivers. I think in terms of the incremental margin improvement of Phil's business, we really have, I think, a nice path of saying where we're at today from a gross margin and an operating margin perspective to make sequential quarter improvements in the direction that Phil talked about. And ultimately, we do believe that, at the gross margin level, it's accretive to the range and certainly to the midpoint of the range. So I think that certainly will help. And then another big hunk of it, as you pointed out, is operating expense control. Like we said, we think that we can still take another $20 million out of that number, which is, as you know, 2 quarters ago was on its way to $580 million. So to get down to $460 million, we feel pretty good about it. So I think it's a combination of all 3. It's all stuff that's right in front of us. It's for us to execute against. The trickiest stuff is, frankly, finding those customers that are taking those higher capacity drives. And for the customers that we do engage with, understanding how we can get a better mix, because clearly right now we're not getting the mix that we should."

The MOFCOM thinks -- it's hard to answer the question. For us, of course, if you just looked at it from a synergy perspective on ""OpEx,"" as you know we were basically maintaining a separate go-to-market organization for that. It wasn't a huge go-to-market organization. So the synergies isn't so much immediately OpEx-related, there will be some. There may be some OpEx related in that. We were moving a lot of units, over 10 million units, with a pretty lean organization. And we are actually kind of reverse engineering that and saying, how can we take advantage of ""the Seagate operation"" to maybe look more like that. So actually, the synergies may effectively come from reduction in Seagate OpEx as opposed to the apparent reduction in the small single digit millions of dollars that we were spending on the Samsung side. I think the other big piece is revenue synergies. I mean, clearly now that product line is the highest areal density product in the industry. It has been for a couple of years. And we can now broaden that to the broader Seagate sales force. I think there's going to be some nice revenue synergies from that. And then the other big synergy that's in OpEx synergy, but I can't tell you and it's going to save this many dollars, is that design center, which is a very competent design center, is now free to design products that don't have to be subject to the whole separate. And so that allows us basically to start putting products into that design center or having products come out of that design center that aren't going to be limited to the Samsung sales force. And so in that sense, there's nice operating leverage because the design center is an expensive thing to keep. And so having a broader portfolio come out of that, we think is beneficial. So net-net, we think it basically drives better revenue opportunity, clearly better margin opportunity as we mix across the portfolio and then better operating margin because of the more efficient dynamic on the design center as well as the go-to-market side."

Because when you kind of go through it, it's a $10 billion premium to the 90-day average, 35x earnings for a company that hasn't had earnings growth in 5 years, actually has earnings decline in 5 years, isn't a technical or cost leader. And you're going to finance it with $18 billion of debt, which means you have to somehow have big OpEx cuts, because there's not enough SG&A to pay for that. Wouldn't appear to be enough revenue synergies because it's not a competitive technology relative to the leaders. So it's going to come down to engineering cuts. So I think that's the opportunity. It's not so much the distraction. Maybe there's a distraction, maybe there isn't. But the reality is in order to make that model work, there's going to have to be OpEx cuts to pay back that huge debt load or you never build another fab. And this is just an industry where, whether or not it's the Flash side or the HDD side, massive cuts in R&D doesn't seem smart. But for us, it's good. So I think the opportunity is to make sure -- look, Seagate feels great about where we're at technically. We don't obviously feel great about having the broadest portfolio that we need, and we need to address that. But the good news is, we have the technical leadership to do that. So we'll keep pressing that case. That's, I think, what's going to translate into the market opportunity, whether or not it's the enterprise level or the client level or nearline level. And I do think that, that transaction gives us an opportunity just because the OpEx side of their business is going to be challenged to pay back all that debt."

But it feels like the PC market has kind of found its space and that there's probably a little bit of traction for some marginal growth. I think with respect to Seagate, kind of gets back to the technical point, we are excited about the product portfolio that we're about to roll. We do think when you transition to kind of 1 and 2 terabyte products, that's compelling for those client-based systems that actually do need onboard storage. And of course, we can do that in the form factors that fit into the new thin and light notebooks. So I think we're kind of -- we're -- I think, look, Seagate has always been a little bit more bullish on client than maybe others. And I think within that segment, we feel that we're particularly well aligned and maybe again that's reflection of the fact that we're very OEM concentrated and we feel good about lining up with what the OEMs need in that space. So I feel okay about the clients’ space going forward. And as you know, I'm more encouraged also that there's some clients that goes beyond what we're calling a client today. And I still think those opportunities continue to open up and they're going to need 1 and 2 and 4 terabytes of data. By the way, same could be said about the branded market. We've got a nice 4-terabyte market product out there right now and we're gaining traction with it. And we continue to believe that the direct attached storage business will be quite good on the client side, especially as people skinny down on what they have onboard."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. The first fiscal quarter of 2016, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.9 billion; and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 24.2%, net income of $165 million and diluted earnings per share",1011,"Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. The first fiscal quarter of 2016, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.9 billion; and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins of 24.2%, net income of $165 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.54.
Overall shipments for the September quarter were 55.6 exabytes, up 7% sequentially with the average capacity per drive over 1.1 terabytes per drive.
As we stated in our preannouncement, there were intra-quarter demand developments that brought our revenue in at the lower end of our forecasted range and impacted the profitability contribution of our HDD portfolio to corporate margins by approximately 300 basis points.
While the September quarter nearline and enterprise demand was marginally lower than expected in terms of both units and exabytes, we believe Seagate's CSP and OEM customer base is more highly concentrated than the competitors and therefore has a high degree -- higher degree of volatility. This dynamic led to a negative impact on Seagate in the September quarter, resulting in lower mix, higher inventory carry and reduced absorption, impacting the corporate gross margin by approximately 190 basis points.
The company needs to further leverage its technical leadership across its product offering to address the broader market opportunity and needs more active engagement with these customers on the sales and technical side. These issues are being addressed and progress will be achieved over the next 2 to 3 quarters.
In addition, we saw upside in 2.5-inch notebook and gaining client applications, which have margins at the lower end of our product portfolio. The lower-margin contribution from the portfolio shipped in volumes impacted the corporate margin by approximately 110 basis points.
While we are disappointed in our overall corporate margin results for the September quarter, we believe we have a path to sequential margin improvement that I will cover in our December quarter outlook. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $501 million, down 9% year-over-year, reflecting expense control around the core business, adjacencies, restructuring activities and lower variable compensation.
Drive inventory levels increased by approximately $160 million sequentially, due primarily to the increase in finished goods from our enterprise products. Capital expenditures were in line with our expectations.
In the September quarter, we had strong cash flow from operations of $824 million and free cash flow of $615 million. We effectively executed on our long-term capital allocation goals for the shareholders and redeemed approximately 20 million shares in the September quarter, reducing our outstanding shares down to 299 million shares.
Our balance sheet remains healthy and we ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents.
There are a few developments from the last few weeks that are meaningful to Seagate, and I'd like to provide some additional context. We closed our acquisition of Dot Hill on October 6, and we have begun integrating the business into our Cloud Systems and Solution business. We are pleased to have the Dot Hill team onboard and believe the expansion of our Cloud Systems and Solutions product portfolio will enable us to better serve our storage OEM customers and further leverage our core storage technology expertise.
On October 22, we were notified by China's Ministry of Commerce that the company can now integrate Samsung's hard disk drive business completely into Seagate. This now allows us to move forward in our plans to consolidate our product portfolio, leverage go-to-market synergies, broaden sales coverage and optimize design centers. All of these activities will benefit our customers.
At our board meeting last week, we approved a 17% increase in our dividend payment, raising our annual rate to $2.52 per share. This dividend raise reflects the confidence we have in the future cash flows of our business and fulfills our goal to increase our dividend by at least 10% for the fiscal year.
Our capital return to shareholders remains a top priority at Seagate and we continue to balance the effective investment in our technology portfolio with shareholder returns and within an investment grade framework.
Turning to our business outlook. We believe the overall storage market demand will continue to be relatively flat in the December quarter. This includes some slight uptick in enterprise, nearline exabyte demand and seasonal declines in the client and gaming markets. For the December quarter, we are planning for revenues to be between $2.9 billion and $3 billion, and we are forecasting operating expense to continue to decline to approximately $485 million in the December quarter.
We plan to exit fiscal year '16 with operating expenses of $460 million per quarter, including Samsung integration synergies and the acquisition of Dot Hill.
Under these assumptions, we will reduce our fiscal non-GAAP year-over-year spend by approximately 12%. Our non-GAAP gross margins should be sequentially improved with mix, new product offerings and absorption cost benefit to approximately 25.5% to 26%. As enterprise exabyte demand continues to grow at 35%, along with our ability to monetize the demand with our product offerings, we believe we will be back in our targeted margin range of 27% to 32% by the June quarter.
Before we open up for the questions, I would like to highlight the promotion of Dave Morton to Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Seagate. With over 20 years at the company, Dave is already a very active contributor of our management team. And the board and I are confident in his abilities to continue to provide effective leadership and financial stewardship for Seagate.
I also thank Pat O'Malley for his 7 years of service in the CFO role and over 25 years of contributions at Seagate. Under Pat's leadership, we have refined our effective and resilient financial model, executed a very good track record on total shareholder return and return on invested capital and strengthened our balance sheet. I'm very pleased, Pat will be continuing his career at Seagate in an Executive Vice President role, reporting to me, and working on a number of strategic initiatives.
I would like to thank our customers, suppliers, and employees for their continued support. And we're now ready for Q&A."

It's hard to say just given kind of the lack of traction that's developed even in the second half of the year. And again, our view is narrower than it should be. And it's not often that the CSP base in particular doesn't engage for more than 3 or 4 quarters and we're kind of on an outer end of that dimension right now. So we'd expect at some point here that there'd be a capital cycle that would improve. For us, I think it's as much as broadening customer base, some of that is product related and some of it is just engagement related. So that's opportunity in front us, so I think regardless of whether or not there is a market acceleration. But the fact that the second half of the year didn't develop the way I think the industry expected it would, I think that does probably say at some point there's going to be a capital cycle up. And right now, we don't have any signals that say it's going to be in the first half of the year, but we don't have any say that it's going to not either. So I think a lot of it just depends on what happens through December and then the people start letting contracts. As you know, it's a cyclical business that's highly concentrated. And until there's more diversity in that customer set, it's going to kind of have an ebb and flow that's -- that can be challenging like it was for this quarter for us."

I mean, again, I'm reading some of the analysts and other industry observers' work. I don't think there's still a great understanding about the leverage that's in the manufacturing system, especially on these enterprise drives. We are absorbing as many heads and disks and test time as we are. So unit misses in the 500,000 unit range, while they don't sound big relative to 45 million or 50 million shipment, they are, and especially, obviously, at the margin when the cost has been completely absorbed. And of course, those are decent price points, but they're obviously -- they're good margin products to begin with, but obviously if they're already built and sitting in inventory then they're really good margin products. And you could see it from our inventory uptick of $160 million, that translating into revenue accounts for a couple of hundred basis points of gross margin. So clearing through that inventory in a responsible way is going to take a couple of quarters. And as we do that, then we're going to see a more regular trend back to the overall gross margin that we expect to deliver. The other thing about that is it kind of may feel like a big surprise, but the other reality is the industry moves a lot of drives in the last 2 weeks of the quarter. And really, with a week to go in this quarter, we could have still delivered the gross margin that we should have. And it was just basically not executing or not having customers take the drives that we thought they were going to take. So that being the case, we're hoping that we can get those drives moving and again in a reasonable way sooner rather than later, so that we can back to the margin model that, that piece of the business delivers. I think in terms of the incremental margin improvement of Phil's business, we really have, I think, a nice path of saying where we're at today from a gross margin and an operating margin perspective to make sequential quarter improvements in the direction that Phil talked about. And ultimately, we do believe that, at the gross margin level, it's accretive to the range and certainly to the midpoint of the range. So I think that certainly will help. And then another big hunk of it, as you pointed out, is operating expense control. Like we said, we think that we can still take another $20 million out of that number, which is, as you know, 2 quarters ago was on its way to $580 million. So to get down to $460 million, we feel pretty good about it. So I think it's a combination of all 3. It's all stuff that's right in front of us. It's for us to execute against. The trickiest stuff is, frankly, finding those customers that are taking those higher capacity drives. And for the customers that we do engage with, understanding how we can get a better mix, because clearly right now we're not getting the mix that we should."

The MOFCOM thinks -- it's hard to answer the question. For us, of course, if you just looked at it from a synergy perspective on ""OpEx,"" as you know we were basically maintaining a separate go-to-market organization for that. It wasn't a huge go-to-market organization. So the synergies isn't so much immediately OpEx-related, there will be some. There may be some OpEx related in that. We were moving a lot of units, over 10 million units, with a pretty lean organization. And we are actually kind of reverse engineering that and saying, how can we take advantage of ""the Seagate operation"" to maybe look more like that. So actually, the synergies may effectively come from reduction in Seagate OpEx as opposed to the apparent reduction in the small single digit millions of dollars that we were spending on the Samsung side. I think the other big piece is revenue synergies. I mean, clearly now that product line is the highest areal density product in the industry. It has been for a couple of years. And we can now broaden that to the broader Seagate sales force. I think there's going to be some nice revenue synergies from that. And then the other big synergy that's in OpEx synergy, but I can't tell you and it's going to save this many dollars, is that design center, which is a very competent design center, is now free to design products that don't have to be subject to the whole separate. And so that allows us basically to start putting products into that design center or having products come out of that design center that aren't going to be limited to the Samsung sales force. And so in that sense, there's nice operating leverage because the design center is an expensive thing to keep. And so having a broader portfolio come out of that, we think is beneficial. So net-net, we think it basically drives better revenue opportunity, clearly better margin opportunity as we mix across the portfolio and then better operating margin because of the more efficient dynamic on the design center as well as the go-to-market side."

Because when you kind of go through it, it's a $10 billion premium to the 90-day average, 35x earnings for a company that hasn't had earnings growth in 5 years, actually has earnings decline in 5 years, isn't a technical or cost leader. And you're going to finance it with $18 billion of debt, which means you have to somehow have big OpEx cuts, because there's not enough SG&A to pay for that. Wouldn't appear to be enough revenue synergies because it's not a competitive technology relative to the leaders. So it's going to come down to engineering cuts. So I think that's the opportunity. It's not so much the distraction. Maybe there's a distraction, maybe there isn't. But the reality is in order to make that model work, there's going to have to be OpEx cuts to pay back that huge debt load or you never build another fab. And this is just an industry where, whether or not it's the Flash side or the HDD side, massive cuts in R&D doesn't seem smart. But for us, it's good. So I think the opportunity is to make sure -- look, Seagate feels great about where we're at technically. We don't obviously feel great about having the broadest portfolio that we need, and we need to address that. But the good news is, we have the technical leadership to do that. So we'll keep pressing that case. That's, I think, what's going to translate into the market opportunity, whether or not it's the enterprise level or the client level or nearline level. And I do think that, that transaction gives us an opportunity just because the OpEx side of their business is going to be challenged to pay back all that debt."

But it feels like the PC market has kind of found its space and that there's probably a little bit of traction for some marginal growth. I think with respect to Seagate, kind of gets back to the technical point, we are excited about the product portfolio that we're about to roll. We do think when you transition to kind of 1 and 2 terabyte products, that's compelling for those client-based systems that actually do need onboard storage. And of course, we can do that in the form factors that fit into the new thin and light notebooks. So I think we're kind of -- we're -- I think, look, Seagate has always been a little bit more bullish on client than maybe others. And I think within that segment, we feel that we're particularly well aligned and maybe again that's reflection of the fact that we're very OEM concentrated and we feel good about lining up with what the OEMs need in that space. So I feel okay about the clients’ space going forward. And as you know, I'm more encouraged also that there's some clients that goes beyond what we're calling a client today. And I still think those opportunities continue to open up and they're going to need 1 and 2 and 4 terabytes of data. By the way, same could be said about the branded market. We've got a nice 4-terabyte market product out there right now and we're gaining traction with it.
