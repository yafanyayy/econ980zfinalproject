In the second quarter of fiscal year 2015, we continued to pursue the long-term development of the company as well as delivering positive results in the here and now, with reported revenues of $2.3 billion, up 2%, stable EBITDA of $328 million and a rather healthy free cash flow. Importantly, excluding currency fluctuations during a patently volatile period in the Forex market, acquisitions and other nonoperating costs, our adjusted EBITDA grew by a robust 4%.
That makes 2 successive quarters of improving revenues year-over-year, signaling that the transformation is on track and that most of our core businesses are delivering solid results. At the heart of the metamorphosis of a company with a proud prominence, a very proud prominence, is our promise to become more digital and increasingly global and both of those characteristics are clear in the numbers today. 
It is also worth noting that these achievements come despite a very uneven global advertising market. Advertising remains distinctly short term, making prognostication difficult, but the diversity and the depth of our portfolio have provided a solid buffer. 
This quarter marks the first time partial results from Move are included. Although we don't yet have a full quarter performance, it is fair to say that the expansion of our Digital Real Estate portfolio should provide a firm foundation for future growth and our confidence has only increased post closing. 
For example, average unique users at realtor.com grew at a record rate of approximately 33% in January to $37 million. Total visits to the site rose 46% on a year earlier and importantly, total mobile visits rose 79%. While there is much toil ahead, there's also much reason for optimism. 
Our other major acquisition to date, Harlequin, has continued to benefit our Book Publishing business hoping to usher in a new era of international and digital expansion at HarperCollins. Harlequin has access to over 100 markets and publishers in 34 languages, which is a far broader base for us and have already begun using that reach to take more advantage of successful titles. 
Here, are a few top line observations about our Q2 performance. With Harlequin integrated into it's table brands and solid results in other divisions, HarperCollins continues to show great strengths. Sales of The Divergent series have exceeded our expectations again, with 1.5 million units sold in the second quarter and we are keenly looking forward to the second film in the Divergent series, Insurgent, scheduled for release next month. 
We have also benefited significantly from the release of the film American Sniper, which has obviously stimulated sales of the eponymous book, now atop bestseller charts in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. The Term had strong momentum in the month of January when it sold 1.2 million units. To date, Chris Cowles' American Sniper has sold 3.9 million copies and that title is driving rapidly. 
HarperCollins announced this week, the acquisition of the North American rights to the newly discovered novel by Harper Lee, the author of the monumental To Kill A Mockingbird. The novel -- Watchmen will be published in July 14 this year, and gives HarperCollins a head start for next fiscal year. If the overwhelming interest in the announcement is reflected in book sales, we can expect robust performance this summer and beyond. 
During the quarter, we also saw increased monetization of the Blacklist by Brian Murray's team at HarperCollins through dynamic pricing and subscription offerings, demonstrating how digital drives value for titles. Going forward, we are optimistic about the rich scene, that is our back catalogue.
The net effect of the development this quarter at our Book Publishing segment, revenues improved by 20% and EBITDA by a healthy 13% versus the prior period. The Dow Jones continues to make progress at the Professional Information business, but we were particularly pleased that advertising at The Wall Street Journal was higher than in the prior year. 
One reason was an increase in advertising by technology and finance companies in the print edition of the journal. It is certainly meaningful that tech companies see the value and power of print as a platform and it's desirable demographic. 
At News Australia, we again saw sequential year-over-year improvement with advertising declining only 3% in local currency and EBITDA again up versus the prior year. At digital subscriptions and are approaching 250,000, almost 30% higher versus the prior year, but it is still early days in our digital development. 
We've been revamping the product offerings, including the launch of new apps at our mastheads and we have reduced costs, including the closing of our Gulf Coast printing site, while we have successfully raised newsstand pricing and subscription rates to drive circulation revenues.
The News U.K., it's worth noting progress at Sun+, The Sun's digital offering, which reported a total 225,000 paid subscriptions in late November. This was double the prior-year figure, representing over 10% of the market's overall circulation and helped offset print volume declines. There is no precedent or template for this project in the popular masthead market, so we are still learning about churn, loyalty and seasonality. 
What we do know is that the advertising climate in the U.K. remains very difficult, but we are renewing our efforts on digital ad sales and assiduously cultivating core clients. The Times has distinguished itself by being the only U.K. newspaper to show an increase in print circulation in the most recent audited reports and have been the best-performing national newspaper for 7 consecutive months. 
We've seen both print and digital volume growth and ARPU continues to increase year-over-year. At a time of media transformation, with a flood of low-grade and cheesy chart, it is clear that high-quality journalism attracts high-quality revenue and reader engagement across all platforms. 
Importantly, as we highlighted last month, The Times reported an increase in profitability in the last fiscal year, thanks to the success of its digital strategy and higher print sales. 
Turning to News America Market, it is operating in a challenging environment particularly with respect to its SSI products where the competition is particularly intense. The ENSTAR sector showed growth but is a smaller proportion of the overall revenue in the sector. We are exploring partnerships to digitize the ENSTAR business and leverage our strategic relationships with retailers and consumer packaged goods companies.
In Australia, we are pleased with the early results of the new pricing strategy at Foxtel. The company's market penetration had stalled for several years and so we agreed with our partner, Telstra, to lower the entry price and market this uniquely rich service with extra vigor. Early results are encouraging with an increase of just over 80% in news sales volume and a lower than envisaged percentage of existing clients taking cheaper packages. 
Bedi will furnish more details in a few moments, but these early numbers and they are early numbers, are a tribute to the efforts of Rich and his team. Foxtel also announced this week the commercial launch of its Triple-Play bundle and shortly will unveil its advanced IQ 3 set-top boxes, broadening its product offerings with a view to solidifying its leadership in the market. 
FOX SPORTS Australia celebrated the success of the national sports teams in recent weeks with Australia winning the Asian cup at the weekend, which itself will further stimulate interest in soccer. We should benefit as we hold the rights to local soccer matches as well as to the increasingly popular English Premier League matches. Meanwhile, the Australian team is also favored to win the Cricket World Cup, which begins in coming days. Cricket, while a mystery to some in the outside world, is an important component of the offering in Australia. 
Also in Australia, REA had a very good quarter, not only demonstrating growth, but an improvement from the fiscal first quarter in revenues and profitability in local currency. It continues to extend its position as the market leader and has expanded its international footprint, raising its stake in the property in the digital side to around 20% and acquiring a strategic 20% stake in Move. 
At Move, Ryan O'Hara has just taken over as CEO, and there is already a profound difference in the metrics as the company is being integrated into the broader News Corp platforms. Those of you who access WSJ.com or the New York Post online will see search boxes for realtor.com and you will increasingly see sophisticated targeted subscription ads for the Journal and the New York Post on realtor.com, as we leverage unique charter to drive precisely targeted offerings. 
While realtor.com's core business is real estate, we believe its audience can be monetized in many other creative ways, given the vast array of demographically desirable data, we will derive from home buyers.
At realtor.com, we've also begun layering in content from Dow Jones. The Wall Street Journal, MarketWatch and the New York Post. We're improving engagement, driving more impressions particularly on mobile as a dramatic increase in traffic in January attests, and this improvement comes largely from organic improvements not from increased marketing expense. We launched a new homepage with improved user experience and search functionality, and we are working to incorporate realtor.com into the News Corp programmatic ad exchange, which is well positioned to drive higher CPMs.
We are also making a concerted push in the New York City market, which had not been well served in the past. We are leveraging the audience at The Post and The Journal and our partnership with a leading real estate companies. We expect a stronger presence in New York to increase the flow of prestige properties, but also to raise the profile of realtor.com on Madison Avenue and elsewhere, and create a more lucrative digital advertising platform. 
Let us be very clear, we are at the earliest of stages with the development of realtor.com and the U.S. market itself is at an early stage of development, but having looked more closely at the company since the acquisition, we are even more excited about its potential both for the group and as a business in one of the fastest growing digital sectors. 
Macro conditions are also more auspicious as mortgage lending restrictions have been relaxed, housing starts are on the rise and the real estate booms in the U.S. market, generally are positive. We've been candid with you about the importance of the seasonal selling season at Amplify. There is no doubt that the digital curriculum is the most advanced of its kind and we have a remarkable creative and committed team under Joe Klein's astute leadership. 
Furthermore, we are very realistic about the of the marketplace and the importance of a robust sales network. Our focus is to drive both scalability and profitability, and we expect a meaningful reduction in investment spend next year. 
Taken together, the second quarter of fiscal 2015 tells a compelling story of News Corp's evolution as a business. We are definitely more digital and global, thanks to the success with digital subscriptions at our masthead, the expansion of subscribers at Foxtel, the development at HarperCollins through the Harlequin purchase and the addition of realtor.com and our other Asian real estate related investments. 
Advertising trends are difficult to forecast and the situation in Greece remains a potential catalyst for more widespread economic upheaval, so we have resolved to be vigilant in reducing costs. Having explained that we would be reconfiguring the company over the first 2 years and having seen that plan unfold on schedule, we'll continue to review our capital allocation priorities. Our goal remains to be balanced, and our organic investment, strategic M&A and as we have indicated, the return of capital.
Now let me turn it over to Bedi, who will provide background detail and texture on today's results."
212741644,281937359,756199,"News Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Robert.

We reported fiscal 2015 second quarter revenue of $2.28 billion, a 2% increase versus the prior year period. Excluding the impact of",1765,"Thanks, Robert. First, I'll cover some high level financial highlights and then discuss each segment in further detail. 
We reported fiscal 2015 second quarter revenue of $2.28 billion, a 2% increase versus the prior year period. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenues were in line with the prior year. 
With regard to EBITDA, we reported total segment EBITDA of $328 million compared to the prior year period of $327 million. This quarter includes $30 million of costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters net of indemnification and $16 million of transaction-related costs with the Move acquisition, which closed in mid-November. 
Excluding those costs, the remaining impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency fluctuations, our adjusted total segment EBITDA grew by 4% versus the prior year. As Robert noted, we were impacted by currency headwinds, primarily the Australian dollar which negatively impacted Q2 total revenues by $72 million or 3%, and total segment EBITDA by $16 million or 5%. 
Reported EPS were $0.24 versus $0.26 in the prior year period due to higher effective tax rate and lower interest income. Excluding these structuring and impairment charges, U.K. Newspaper Matter costs and other one-time items, our adjusted EPS were $0.26 versus $0.31 in the prior year. 
The results again, underscores the strength and diversity of our asset portfolio, which continues to show underlying EBITDA and free cash flow improvement despite the uneven global ad marketplace. We continue to extract cost efficiencies while strengthening 2 of our 4 key pillars, Digital Real Estate and Book Publishing, which we believe will materially reshape the growth profile of News Corp.
Turning to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter declined $89 million or 6% versus the prior-year period and adjusted segment revenue declined 3%. Within the segment revenues, advertising, which was 58% of segment revenues this quarter, declined around 9% or 6% in local currency, relatively similar to the first quarter. 
If we look at the performance across our key units starting at News Corp Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined around 10% or approximately 3% in local currency, again showing sequential year-over-year improvement versus fiscal first quarter and last year's fiscal fourth quarter on a local currency basis, helped by market share gains in print and higher digital advertising sales. 
We saw strong improvement there in international notably government and travel, real estate and classified ad categories. News Corp Australia EBITDA also improved due to low costs, including overhead reductions and from the closure of the Gulf Coast printing facility in the prior fiscal year.
At The Wall Street Journal, advertising grew 2% versus the prior year, a big improvement from the first quarter, benefiting from strength in 2 key categories, finance and technology combined with strong demand for the WSJ magazine. We saw advertising growth in both print and digital this quarter.
At News U.K., advertising revenues remain soft this quarter, declining around 18% or 16% in local currency, which was slightly worse than Q1 still impacted by weakness in grocers, telecom, finance and automotive. 
At News America Marketing, revenues declined due to continuing weakness in freestanding inputs, which have been under pressure over the past 2 quarters, impacted by lower spending from consumer packaged goods companies. The decline was partially offset by in-store advertising growth.
Total circulation and subscription revenues, which account for 35% of segment revenues this quarter declined by 3%. The decline was driven by the Professional Information business at Dow Jones, which had a negative $11 million impact of revenues this quarter, but again, continues to show sequential year-over-year improvement as the pipeline of business is strengthening. As Robert has noted, we expect to see further improvements in the second half and hopefully, reposition for growth next fiscal year.
Total newspaper circulation revenues, however, showed modest year-over-year growth on a local currency basis in every region, driven by subscription and cover price increases, on a number of our mastheads, coupled with higher revenue from digital subscribers, which more than offset print volume declines. Of note, starting in January, we have begun to migrate legacy Wall Street Journal subscribers to higher price point tiers.
Segment EBITDA decreased $39 million in the quarter or 15% as compared to the prior year period and adjusted segment EBITDA about 12%. Included in segment EBITDA was $8 million impact related to the relocation of our London operations for deal, rent and other facility costs. As I have mentioned on past calls, we do not expect any material deal rate and other facility costs from the second half and onwards. 
This quarter we also incurred roughly 9 million higher legal expenses at News America Marketing related to ongoing litigations.
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues improved 20% and segment EBITDA grew 13% versus the prior year quarter. Excluding the results from the Harlequin acquisition, which closed in August 1 and foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenues were in line with the prior year and adjusted segment EBITDA declined 4% due to tough comparison from the Divergent series in the prior year period. 
While the Divergent series continues to fare well this quarter totaling over 1.5 million net units, this as expected, was lower than the 5.7 million net units sold in the prior-year period, creating a 33 million revenue challenge. Despite that challenge, the core HarperCollins business performed very well to nearly match year-over-year levels, with solid contributions in General Books, Yes Please, Patricia Cornwell's Fresh and Blood, and Chris Kyles' American Sniper, as well as continued demand of Sarah Young's Jesus Calling series in Christian publishing. 
Total e-book sales for the quarter grew 14% and accounted for the 17% of consumer revenues. Harlequin contributed $80 million of revenues and $11 million of EBITDA in the quarter. It's worth highlighting that Harlequin's profitability is improving and we are implementing a number of initiatives to reduce costs, including streamlining, manufacturing and distribution as well as harmonizing sales strategies.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues improved $2 million or 2% compared to the prior year quarter. Subscription revenues grew 3%, benefiting from higher affiliate fees from Foxtel and increased number of subscribers. 
Advertising revenues decline modestly due to adverse foreign currency fluctuations with revenues [indiscernible] up slightly in local currency despite a soft TV market place. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was up 2% compared to the prior year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenues increased 11% and adjusted segment EBITDA improved by 9%.
In Digital Real Estate Services, we now include results from both REA group and from Move, effective from November 14. Total revenues for the segment increased $51 million or 50%, and EBITDA improved 4% compared to the prior year period. Again, included in the reported results are $16 million of transaction-related fees from the Move acquisition. 
Excluding foreign currency fluctuations, REA's adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA grew 26% and 38%, respectively, an improvement from the prior quarter driven by higher pricing and increase penetration for enhanced products.
The quarter's results also include $34 million in revenue and $3 million of EBITDA for Move for the period November 14 through the quarter-end, as the business continue to benefit from higher traffic this quarter. EBITDA does include 4 million of stock-based compensation expense and as a point of reference, Move excluded stock-based compensation when reporting their adjusted EBITDA. 
Audience growth at realtor.com has accelerated through the year with fiscal second quarter average monthly unique users up 26%, led by mobile platforms, which were up 16%. And also importantly, lead volume growth improved by 38%. 
As Robert noted, our focus for realtor.com is on product development, we refresh the homepage added and links across The Wall Street Journal, Digital Network and The New York Post and integrating our content across the site. Our goal is to drive significant revenue growth and material contribution to profitability in the coming years and early results are encouraging, the January monthly unique users up over 30% was 37 million. 
In the second half of this fiscal year, we expect to see revenue growth accelerate, driven by the continues success of our buyer agent, cobroke product, which grew over 100% last quarter, combined with higher usage levels and we also intend to reinvest judiciously in marketing and product development, as I previously said. Overall, we are very pleased about Move's trajectory and we're really excited about it's potential.
At business and education, revenues were flat compared to the prior year quarter and segment EBITDA improved $20 million to a loss of $24 million. Again, about $14 million of that improvement was due to the capitalization of software development costs related to our digital ELA Learning products and the balance came from operating efficiencies.
With respect to earnings from affiliate's, Foxtel ended the quarter with around 2.7 million total subscribers, up 5% versus the prior year, driven by cable satellite subscribers. Foxtel revenues for the quarter in local currency were in line with prior year and EBITDA improved 2%. 
Churn declining to 11.8% from 12.8% in the prior year quarter. Foxtel launched its new revamp pricing and packaging on the November 3 last year with an expectation of improving cable satellite subscriber penetration over the course of the year. Again, while it's early in the rollout, results overall are encouraging. 
Total new sales volume has improved by approximately 80% since launch and churn has reduced. Despite the impact of the lower selling price point, ARPU remains favorable year-over-year, reflecting the limited spend down to date of existing customers.
Turning now to cash flow, News Corp's cash flow from operations in the first half of fiscal '15 improved to $492 million compared to $407 million in the prior year and free cash flow available to News Corp improved to $275 million compared to $217 million in the prior year. The vast majority of our 1.9 billion cash on hand is in U.S. dollars. 
We continue to expect full year CapEx to be relatively similar to the prior year at around $400 million, including around $70 [ph] million for the London relocation, which is now complete and $16 [ph] million related to capitalized software at Amplify Learning. 
In summer, we believe this quarter and the first half results demonstrate that News Corp is on the right track and the ad market has been predictable and currency has been and remains a headwind, we believe the steps we're taking both in reinvestments and operating efficiencies are positioning the company for long-term growth. 
With that, let me hand it back to the operator for Q&A."

And we're particularly gratified by the increase in mobile usage and for example, the mobile app, the number of visits in January was up close to 65% and when you look at the app feed, the number of page views per visit as best we can tell as the app is around, just over 18 pages per visit. So you're not only getting a lot of visitors, but you're getting very sticky business and that comes frankly, very little or no marketing costs.

In the second quarter of fiscal year 2015, we continued to pursue the long-term development of the company as well as delivering positive results in the here and now with reported revenues of $2.3 billion, up 2%; stable EBITDA of $328 million; and a rather healthy free cash flow. Importantly, excluding currency fluctuations during a patently volatile period in the ForEx market, acquisitions and other nonoperating costs, our adjusted EBITDA grew by a robust 4%. That makes 2 successive quarters of improving revenues year-over-year, signaling that the transformation is on track and that most of our core businesses are delivering solid results. At the heart of the metamorphosis of a company with a proud prominence, a very proud prominence, is our promise to become more digital and increasingly global, and both of those characteristics are clear in the numbers today.
It is also worth noting that these achievements come despite a very uneven global advertising market. Advertising remains distinctly short term, making prognostication difficult, but the diversity and the depth of our portfolio have provided a solid buffer. This quarter marks the first time partial results from Move are included. Although we don't yet have a full quarter of performance, it is fair to say that the expansion of our Digital Real Estate portfolio should provide a firm foundation for future growth, and our confidence has only increased post closing.
For example, average unique users at realtor.com grew at a record rate of approximately 33% in January to $37 million. Total visits to the site rose 46% on a year earlier, and importantly, total mobile visits rose 79%. While there is much toil ahead, there's also much reason for optimism. 
Our other major acquisition to date, Harlequin, has continued to benefit our Book Publishing business hoping to usher in a new era of international and digital expansion at HarperCollins. Harlequin has access to over 100 markets and publishes in 34 languages, which is a far broader base for us, and we have already begun using that reach to take more advantage of successful titles.
Here are a few top line observations about our Q2 performance. With Harlequin integrated into its stable of brands and solid results in other divisions, HarperCollins continues to show great strengths. Sales of the Divergent series have exceeded our expectations again with 1.5 million units sold in the second quarter, and we are keenly looking forward to the second film in the Divergent series, Insurgent, scheduled for release next month. 
We have also benefited significantly from the release of the film American Sniper, which has obviously stimulated sales of the eponymous book, now atop bestseller charts in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. The Term [ph] had strong momentum in the month of January when it sold 1.2 million units. To date, Chris Kyle's American Sniper has sold 3.9 million copies, and that title is rising rapidly.
HarperCollins announced this week the acquisition of the North American rights to the newly discovered novel by Harper Lee, the author of the monumental To Kill a Mockingbird. The novel Go Set a Watchman will be published on July 14 this year and gives HarperCollins a head start for next fiscal year. If the overwhelming interest in the announcement is reflected in book sales, we can expect robust performance this summer and beyond.
During the quarter, we also saw increased monetization of the backlist by Brian Murray's team at HarperCollins through dynamic pricing and subscription offerings, demonstrating how digital drives value for titles. Going forward, we are optimistic about the rich scene that is our back catalog.
The net effect of the developments this quarter at our Book Publishing segment, revenues improved by 20% and EBITDA by a healthy 13% versus the prior period. The Dow Jones continues to make progress at the professional information business, but we were particularly pleased that advertising at The Wall Street Journal was higher than in the prior year. One reason was an increase in advertising by technology and finance companies in the print edition of The Journal. It is certainly meaningful that tech companies see the value and power of print as a platform and its desirable demographic. 
At News Australia, we again saw sequential year-over-year improvement with advertising declining only 3% in local currency and EBITDA again up versus the prior year. Our digital subscriptions are now approaching 250,000, almost 30% higher versus the prior year, but it is still early days in our digital development. We've been revamping the product offerings, including the launch of new apps at our metro mastheads, and we have reduced costs, including the closing of our Gold Coast printing site, while we have successfully raised newsstand pricing and subscription rates to drive circulation revenues.
For News UK, it's worth noting progress at Sun+, The Sun's digital offering, which reported a total 225,000 paid subscriptions in late November. This was double the prior year figure, representing over 10% of the masthead's overall circulation and helped to offset print volume declines. There is no precedent or template for this project in the popular masthead market, so we are still learning about churn, loyalty and seasonality. What we do know is that the advertising climate in the U.K. remains very difficult, but we are renewing our efforts on digital ad sales and assiduously cultivating core clients.
The Times has distinguished itself by being the only U.K. newspaper to show an increase in print circulation in the most recent audited reports and been the best-performing national newspaper for 7 consecutive months. We've seen both print and digital volume growth, and ARPU continues to increase year-over-year. At a time of media transformation with a flood of low-grade listicles and cheesy charticles, it is clear that high-quality journalism attracts high-quality revenue and reader engagement across all platforms. Importantly, as we highlighted last month, The Times reported an increase in profitability in the last fiscal year, thanks to the success of its digital strategy and higher print sales.
Turning to News America Marketing. It is operating in a challenging environment, particularly with respect to its FSI products, where the competition is particularly intense. The in-store sector showed growth but is a smaller proportion of overall revenue in the sector. We are exploring partnerships to digitize the insert business and leverage our strategic relationships with retailers and consumer packaged good companies.
In Australia, we are pleased with the early results of the new pricing strategy at Foxtel. The company's market penetration had stalled for several years, and so we agreed with our partner, Telstra, to lower the entry price and market this uniquely rich service with extra vigor. Early results are encouraging with an increase of just over 80% in new sales volume and a lower-than-envisaged percentage of existing clients taking cheaper packages. Bedi will furnish more details in a few moments, but these early numbers, and they are early numbers, are a tribute to the efforts of Richard Freudenstein and his team. Foxtel also announced this week the commercial launch of its triple-play bundle and shortly will unveil its advanced IQ 3 set-top boxes, broadening its product offerings with a view to solidifying its leadership in the market.
Fox Sports Australia celebrated the success of the national sports teams in recent weeks with Australia winning the Asian Cup at the weekend, which itself will further stimulate interest in soccer. We should benefit as we hold the rights to local soccer matches as well as to the increasingly popular English Premier League matches. Meanwhile, the Australian team is also favored to win the Cricket World Cup, which begins in coming days. Cricket, while a mystery to some in the outside world, is an important component of the offering in Australia.
Also in Australia, REA had a very good quarter not only demonstrating growth but an improvement from the fiscal first quarter in revenues and profitability in local currency. It continues to extend its position as the market leader and has expanded its international footprint, raising its stake in iProperty, the East Asian digital side, to around 20% and acquiring a strategic 20% stake in Move.
At Move, Ryan O'Hara has just taken over as CEO, and there is already a profound difference in the metrics as the company is being integrated into the broader News Corp platforms. Those of you who access WSJ.com or the New York Post online will see search boxes for realtor.com, and you will increasingly see sophisticated targeted subscription ads for The Journal and the New York Post on realtor.com, as we leverage unique garter to drive precisely targeted offerings.
While realtor.com's core business is real estate, we believe its audience can be monetized in many other creative ways given the vast array of demographically desirable data we will derive from homebuyers. At realtor.com, we have also begun layering in content from Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal, MarketWatch and the New York Post. We're improving engagement, driving more impressions, particularly on mobile, as the dramatic increase in traffic in January attests, and this improvement comes largely from organic improvements, not from increased marketing expense. We launched a new homepage with improved user experience and search functionality, and we are working to incorporate realtor.com into the News Corp programmatic ad exchange, which is well positioned to drive higher CPMs.
We are also making a concerted push in the New York City market, which had not been well served in the past. We are leveraging the audience at The Post and The Journal and our partnership with the leading real estate companies. We expect a stronger presence in New York to increase the flow of prestige properties but also to raise the profile of realtor.com on Madison Avenue and elsewhere and create a more lucrative digital advertising platform.
Let us be very clear. We are at the earliest of stages with the development of realtor.com, and the U.S. market itself is at an early stage of development. But having looked more closely at the company since the acquisition, we are even more excited about its potential both for the group and as a business in one of the fastest growing digital sectors. Macro conditions are also more auspicious as mortgage lending restrictions have been relaxed, housing starts are on the rise and the real estate runes in the U.S. market generally are positive.
We have been candid with you about the importance of the seasonal selling season at Amplify. There is no doubt that the digital curriculum is the most advanced of its kind, and we have a remarkable, creative and committed team under Joel Klein's astute leadership.
Furthermore, we are very realistic about the exigencies of the marketplace and the importance of a robust sales network. Our focus is to drive both scalability and profitability, and we expect a meaningful reduction in investment spend next year.
Taken together, the second quarter of fiscal 2015 tells a compelling story of News Corp's evolution as a business. We are definitely more digital and global, thanks to the success with digital subscriptions at our mastheads, the expansion of subscribers at Foxtel, the development at HarperCollins through the Harlequin purchase and the addition of realtor.com and our other Asian real-estate-related investments. Advertising trends are difficult to forecast, and the situation in Greece remains a potential catalyst for more wide-spread economic upheaval, so we are resolved to be vigilant in reducing costs.
Having explained that we would be reconfiguring the company over the first 2 years and having seen that plan unfold on schedule, we will continue to review our capital allocation priorities. Our goal remains to be balanced among organic investment, strategic M&A and as we had indicated, the return of capital.
Now let me turn it over to Bedi, who will provide background detail and texture on today's results."
212741644,281937359,756470,"News Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Robert.

First, I'll cover some high-level financial highlights and then discuss each segment in further detail. We reported fiscal 2015 second quarter revenue of $2.28 billion, a 2% increase versus the prior year period. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenues were in line with the prior year.
With regard to EBITDA, we reported total segment EBITDA of $328 million compared to the prior year period of $327 million. This quarter includes $30 million of costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters net of indemnification and $16 million of transaction-related costs for the Move acquisition, which closed in mid-November.  Excluding those costs plus the remaining impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency fluctuations, our adjusted total segment EBITDA grew by 4% versus the prior year. As Robert noted, we were impacted by currency headwinds, primarily the Australian dollar, which negatively impacted Q2 total revenues by $72 million or 3% and total segment EBITDA by $16 million or 5%.
Reported EPS were $0.24 versus $0.26 in the prior year period due to higher effective tax rate and lower interest income. Excluding restructuring and impairment charges, U.K. Newspaper Matter costs and other onetime items, our adjusted EPS were $0.26 versus $0.31 in the prior year.
The results, again, underscores the strength and diversity of our asset portfolio, which continues to show underlying EBITDA and free cash flow improvement despite the uneven global ad marketplace. We continue to extract cost efficiencies while strengthening 2 of our key pillars, Digital Real Estate and Book Publishing, which we believe will materially reshape the growth profile of News Corp.
Turning to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter declined $89 million or 6% versus the prior year period, and adjusted segment revenue declined 3%. Within the segment revenues, advertising, which was 58% of segment revenues this quarter, declined around 9% or 6% in local currency relatively similar to the first quarter.  If we look at the performance across our key units starting at News Corp Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined around 10% or approximately 3% in local currency, again, showing sequential year-over-year improvement versus fiscal first quarter and last year's fiscal fourth quarter on a local currency basis, helped by market share gains in print and higher digital advertising sales. We saw strong improvements there in the national, notably government and travel, real estate and classified ad categories. News Corp Australia EBITDA also improved due to low costs, including overhead reductions and from the closure of the Gold Coast printing facility in the prior fiscal year.
At The Wall Street Journal, advertising grew 2% versus the prior year, a big improvement from the first quarter, benefiting from strength in 2 key categories, finance and technology, combined with strong demand for the WSJ magazine. We saw advertising growth in both print and digital this quarter.
At News UK, advertising revenues remain soft this quarter, declining around 18% or 16% in local currency, which was slightly worse than Q1, still impacted by weakness in grocers, telecom, finance and automotive.
At News America Marketing, revenues declined due to continuing weakness in free-standing inserts, which have been under pressure over the past 2 quarters, impacted by lower spending from consumer packaged goods companies. The decline was partially offset by in-store advertising growth.
Total circulation and subscription revenues, which account for 35% of segment revenues this quarter declined by 3%. The decline was driven by the professional information business at Dow Jones, which had a negative $11 million impact to revenues this quarter but again, continues to show sequential year-over-year improvement as the pipeline of business is strengthening. As Robert had noted, we expect to see further improvements in the second half and hopefully, reposition for growth next fiscal year.
Total newspaper circulation revenues, however, showed modest year-over-year growth on a local currency basis in every region driven by subscription and cover product price increases at a number of our mastheads, coupled with higher revenue from digital subscribers, which more than offset print volume declines. Of note, starting in January, we have begun to migrate legacy Wall Street Journal subscribers to higher price point tiers.
Segment EBITDA decreased $39 million in the quarter or 15% as compared to the prior year period and adjusted segment EBITDA was down 12%. Included in segment EBITDA was $8 million impact related to the relocation of our London operations for deal rent and other facility costs. As I mentioned on past calls, we do not expect any material deal rent and other facility costs from the second half and onwards. This quarter we also incurred roughly 9 million higher legal expenses at News America Marketing related to ongoing litigations.
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues improved 20%, and segment EBITDA grew 13% versus the prior year quarter. Excluding the results from the Harlequin acquisition, which closed in August 1, and foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenues were in line with the prior year, and adjusted segment EBITDA declined 4% due to tough comparison from the Divergent series in the prior year period.
While the Divergent series continues to sell well this quarter totaling over 1.5 million net units, this, as expected, was lower than the 5.7 million net units sold in the prior year period, creating a $33 million revenue challenge. Despite that challenge, the core HarperCollins business performed very well to nearly match year-ago levels with solid contributions in General Books, from Amy Poehler's Yes Please, Patricia Cornwell's Flesh and Blood and Chris Kyle's American Sniper as well as continued demand of Sarah Young's Jesus Calling series in Christian Publishing.
Total e-book sales for the quarter grew 14% and accounted for the 17% of consumer revenues. Harlequin contributed $80 million of revenues and $11 million of EBITDA in the quarter. It's worth highlighting that Harlequin's profitability is improving, and we are implementing a number of initiatives to reduce costs, including streamlining, manufacturing and distribution as well as harmonizing sales strategies.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues improved $2 million or 2% compared to the prior year quarter. Subscription revenues grew 3% benefiting from higher affiliate fees from Foxtel and increased number of subscribers. Advertising revenues decline modestly due to adverse foreign currency fluctuations, but revenues were up slightly in local currency despite a soft TV marketplace. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was up 2% compared to the prior year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenues increased 11% and adjusted segment EBITDA improved by 9%.
In Digital Real Estate Services, we now include results from both REA Group and from Move effective from November 14. Total revenues for the segment increased $51 million or 50%, and EBITDA improved 4% compared to the prior year period. Again, included in the reported results are $16 million of transaction-related fees for the Move acquisition. Excluding foreign currency fluctuations, REA's adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA grew 26% and 38%, respectively, an improvement from the prior quarter driven by higher pricing and increased penetration for enhanced products.
The quarter's results also include $34 million in revenue and $3 million of EBITDA for Move for the period November 14 through the quarter end, as the business continued to benefit from higher traffic this quarter. EBITDA does include $4 million of stock-based compensation expense though, and as a point of reference, Move excluded stock-based compensation when reporting their adjusted EBITDA.
Audience growth at realtor.com has accelerated through the year with fiscal second quarter average monthly unique users up 26% led by mobile platforms, which were up 60%. And also importantly, lead volume growth improved by 38%. 
As Robert noted, our immediate focus for realtor.com is on product development. We've already refreshed the homepage, added widgets and links across The Wall Street Journal Digital Network and The New York Post, and are integrating our content across the site. Our goal is to drive significant revenue growth and material contribution to profitability in the coming years, and early results are encouraging with January monthly unique users up over 30% or 37 million.
In the second half of this fiscal year, we expect to see revenue growth accelerate driven by the continued success of our buyer agent, co-broked product, which grew over 100% last quarter combined with higher usage levels. And we also intend to reinvest judiciously in marketing and product development as I've previously said. Overall, we are very pleased about Move's trajectory and remain excited about it's potential.
At business and education, revenues were flat compared to the prior year quarter, and segment EBITDA improved $20 million to a loss of $24 million. Again, about $14 million of that improvement was due to the capitalization of software development costs related to our digital ELA learning products, and the balance came from operating efficiencies.
With respect to earnings from affiliate's, Foxtel ended the quarter with around 2.7 million total subscribers, up 5% versus the prior year driven by cable satellite subscribers. Foxtel revenues for the quarter in local currency were in line with prior year, and EBITDA improved 2%. Churn declined to 11.8% from 12.8% in the prior year quarter. Foxtel launched its new revamped pricing and packaging on November 3 last year with an expectation of improving cable satellite subscriber penetration over the course of the year. Again, while it's early in the rollout, results overall are encouraging. Total new sales volume has improved by approximately 80% since launch, and churn has reduced. Despite the impact of the lower selling price point, ARPU remains favorable year-over-year, reflecting the limited spend down to date of existing customers.
Turning now to cash flow. News Corp's cash flow from operations in the first half of fiscal '15 improved to $492 million compared to $407 million in the prior year, and free cash flow available to News Corp improved to $275 million compared to $217 million in the prior year. The vast majority of our $1.9 billion cash on hand is in U.S. dollars.
We continue to expect full year CapEx to be relatively similar to the prior year at around $400 million, including around $70 million for the London relocation, which is now complete and $60 million related to capitalized software at Amplify Learning.
So in summary, we believe this quarter and the first half results demonstrate that News Corp is on the right track. While the ad market has been unpredictable and currency has been and remains a headwind, we believe the steps we're taking both in reinvestments and operating efficiencies are positioning the company for long-term growth.
With that, let me hand it back to the operator for Q&A."

The winds are fluky, but what Mike Darcey and the team are doing in particular: one, focusing on digital advertising where we do believe that there is room for growth; two, we're constantly looking at circulation revenue; and three, the team is going out and arguing in a very competitive market about the value of the unused mastheads, which is very clear. And it's very clear, indeed, when you look at the circulation uptick in The Times, where -- while other newspapers are struggling, The Times is doing very well.

And we're particularly gratified by the increase in mobile usage, and for example, the mobile app, the number of visits in January was up close to 65%, and when you look at the app feed, the number of page views per visit, as best we can tell, at the app is around just over 18 pages per visit. So you're not only getting a lot of visitors, but you're getting very sticky visitors. And that comes at, frankly, very little or no marketing cost. So whatever we do longer term with marketing spend -- and there will be marketing spend, and our guidance has to be that it will be dilutive.

In the second quarter of fiscal year 2015, we continued to pursue the long-term development of the company as well as delivering positive results in the here and now with reported revenues of $2.3 billion, up 2%; stable EBITDA of $328 mil",1966,"Thank you, Mike. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2015, we continued to pursue the long-term development of the company as well as delivering positive results in the here and now with reported revenues of $2.3 billion, up 2%; stable EBITDA of $328 million; and a rather healthy free cash flow. Importantly, excluding currency fluctuations during a patently volatile period in the ForEx market, acquisitions and other nonoperating costs, our adjusted EBITDA grew by a robust 4%. That makes 2 successive quarters of improving revenues year-over-year, signaling that the transformation is on track and that most of our core businesses are delivering solid results. At the heart of the metamorphosis of a company with a proud provenance, a very proud provenance, is our promise to become more digital and increasingly global, and both of those characteristics are clear in the numbers today.
It is also worth noting that these achievements come despite a very uneven global advertising market. Advertising remains distinctly short term, making prognostication difficult, but the diversity and the depth of our portfolio have provided a solid buffer. This quarter marks the first time partial results from Move are included. Although we don't yet have a full quarter of performance, it is fair to say that the expansion of our Digital Real Estate portfolio should provide a firm foundation for future growth, and our confidence has only increased post-closing.
For example, average unique users at realtor.com grew at a record rate of approximately 33% in January to 37 million. Total visits to the site rose 46% on a year earlier, and importantly, total mobile visits rose 79%. While there is much toil ahead, there's also much reason for optimism. 
Our other major acquisition to date, Harlequin, has continued to benefit our Book Publishing business hoping to usher in a new era of international and digital expansion at HarperCollins. Harlequin has access to over 100 markets and publishes in 34 languages, which is a far broader base for us, and we have already begun using that reach to take more advantage of successful titles.
Here are a few top line observations about our Q2 performance. With Harlequin integrated into its stable of brands and solid results in other divisions, HarperCollins continues to show great strengths. Sales of the Divergent series have exceeded our expectations again with 1.5 million units sold in the second quarter, and we are keenly looking forward to the second film in the Divergent series, Insurgent, scheduled for release next month. 
We have also benefited significantly from the release of the film American Sniper, which has obviously stimulated sales of the eponymous book, now atop bestseller charts in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. The tome had strong momentum in the month of January when it sold 1.2 million units. To date, Chris Kyle's American Sniper has sold 3.9 million copies, and that title is rising rapidly.
HarperCollins announced this week the acquisition of the North American rights to the newly discovered novel by Harper Lee, the author of the monumental To Kill a Mockingbird. The novel Go Set a Watchman will be published on July 14 this year and gives HarperCollins a head start for next fiscal year. If the overwhelming interest in the announcement is reflected in book sales, we can expect robust performance this summer and beyond.
During the quarter, we also saw increased monetization of the backlist by Brian Murray's team at HarperCollins through dynamic pricing and subscription offerings, demonstrating how digital drives value for titles. Going forward, we are optimistic about the rich scene that is our back catalog.
The net effect of the developments this quarter at our Book Publishing segment, revenues improved by 20% and EBITDA by a healthy 13% versus the prior period. 
The Dow Jones continues to make progress at the professional information business, but we were particularly pleased that advertising at The Wall Street Journal was higher than in the prior year. One reason was an increase in advertising by technology and finance companies in the print edition of The Journal. It is certainly meaningful that tech companies see the value and power of print as a platform and its desirable demographic. 
At News Australia, we again saw sequential year-over-year improvement with advertising declining only 3% in local currency and EBITDA again up versus the prior year. Our digital subscriptions are now approaching 250,000, almost 30% higher versus the prior year, but it is still early days in our digital development. We've been revamping the product offerings, including the launch of new apps at our metro mastheads, and we have reduced costs, including the closing of our Gold Coast printing site, while we have successfully raised newsstand pricing and subscription rates to drive circulation revenues.
For News UK, it's worth noting progress at Sun+, The Sun's digital offering, which reported a total 225,000 paid subscriptions in late November. This was double the prior year figure, representing over 10% of the masthead's overall circulation and helped to offset print volume declines. There is no precedent or template for this project in the popular masthead market, so we are still learning about churn, loyalty and seasonality. What we do know is that the advertising climate in the U.K. remains very difficult, but we are renewing our efforts on digital ad sales and assiduously cultivating core clients.
The Times has distinguished itself by being the only U.K. newspaper to show an increase in print circulation in the most recent audited reports and been the best-performing national newspaper for 7 consecutive months. We've seen both print and digital volume growth, and ARPU continues to increase year-over-year. At a time of media transformation with a flood of low-grade listicles and cheesy charticles, it is clear that high-quality journalism attracts high-quality revenue and reader engagement across all platforms. Importantly, as we highlighted last month, The Times reported an increase in profitability in the last fiscal year, thanks to the success of its digital strategy and higher print sales.
Turning to News America Marketing. It is operating in a challenging environment, particularly with respect to its FSI products, where the competition is particularly intense. The in-store sector showed growth but is a smaller proportion of overall revenue in the sector. We are exploring partnerships to digitize the insert business and leverage our strategic relationships with retailers and consumer packaged goods companies.
In Australia, we are pleased with the early results of the new pricing strategy at Foxtel. The company's market penetration had stalled for several years, and so we agreed with our partner, Telstra, to lower the entry price and market this uniquely rich service with extra vigor. Early results are encouraging with an increase of just over 80% in new sales volume and a lower-than-envisaged percentage of existing clients taking cheaper packages. Bedi will furnish more details in a few moments, but these early numbers, and they are early numbers, are a tribute to the efforts of Richard Freudenstein and his team. Foxtel also announced this week the commercial launch of its triple-play bundle and shortly will unveil its advanced iQ3 set-top boxes, broadening its product offerings with a view to solidifying its leadership in the market.
Fox Sports Australia celebrated the success of the national sports teams in recent weeks with Australia winning the Asian Cup at the weekend, which itself will further stimulate interest in soccer. We should benefit as we hold the rights to local soccer matches as well as to the increasingly popular English Premier League matches. Meanwhile, the Australian team is also favored to win the Cricket World Cup, which begins in coming days. Cricket, while a mystery to some in the outside world, is an important component of the offering in Australia.
Also in Australia, REA had a very good quarter not only demonstrating growth but an improvement from the fiscal first quarter in revenues and profitability in local currency. It continues to extend its position as the market leader and has expanded its international footprint, raising its stake in iProperty, the East Asian digital site, to around 20% and acquiring a strategic 20% stake in Move.
At Move, Ryan O'Hara has just taken over as CEO, and there is already a profound difference in the metrics as the company is being integrated into the broader News Corp platforms. Those of you who access WSJ.com or the New York Post online will see search boxes for realtor.com, and you will increasingly see sophisticated targeted subscription ads for The Journal and the New York Post on realtor.com, as we leverage unique data to drive precisely targeted offerings.
While realtor.com's core business is real estate, we believe its audience can be monetized in many other creative ways given the vast array of demographically desirable data we will derive from home buyers. At realtor.com, we have also begun layering in content from Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal, MarketWatch and the New York Post. We're improving engagement, driving more impressions, particularly on mobile, as the dramatic increase in traffic in January attests, and this improvement comes largely from organic improvements, not from increased marketing expense. We launched a new homepage with improved user experience and search functionality, and we are working to incorporate realtor.com into the News Corp programmatic ad exchange, which is well-positioned to drive higher CPMs.
We are also making a concerted push in the New York City market, which had not been well served in the past. We are leveraging the audience at The Post and The Journal and our partnership with the leading real estate companies. We expect a stronger presence in New York to increase the flow of prestige properties but also to raise the profile of realtor.com on Madison Avenue and elsewhere and create a more lucrative digital advertising platform.
Let us be very clear. We are at the earliest of stages with the development of realtor.com, and the U.S. market itself is at an early stage of development. But having looked more closely at the company since the acquisition, we are even more excited about its potential both for the group and as a business in one of the fastest growing digital sectors. Macro conditions are also more auspicious as mortgage lending restrictions have been relaxed, housing starts are on the rise and the real estate runes in the U.S. market generally are positive.
We have been candid with you about the importance of the seasonal selling season at Amplify. There is no doubt that the digital curriculum is the most advanced of its kind, and we have a remarkable, creative and committed team under Joel Klein's astute leadership.
Furthermore, we are very realistic about the exigencies of the marketplace and the importance of a robust sales network. Our focus is to drive both scalability and profitability, and we expect a meaningful reduction in investment spend next year.
Taken together, the second quarter of fiscal 2015 tells a compelling story of News Corp's evolution as a business. We are definitely more digital and global, thanks to the success with digital subscriptions at our mastheads, the expansion of subscribers at Foxtel, the development at HarperCollins through the Harlequin purchase and the addition of realtor.com and our other Asian real-estate-related investments. Advertising trends are difficult to forecast, and the situation in Greece remains a potential catalyst for more wide-spread economic upheaval, so we have resolved to be vigilant in reducing costs.
Having explained that we would be reconfiguring the company over the first 2 years and having seen that plan unfold on schedule, we will continue to review our capital allocation priorities. Our goal remains to be balanced among organic investment, strategic M&A and as we had indicated, the return of capital.
Now let me turn it over to Bedi, who will provide background detail and texture on today's results."
212741644,281937359,756568,"News Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Robert.

First, I'll cover some high-level financial highlights and then discuss each segment in further detail. We reported fiscal 2015 second quarter revenue of $2.28 billion, a 2% increase versus the prior year period. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenues were in line with the prior year.
With regard to EBITDA, we reported total segment EBITDA of $328 million compared to the prior year period of $327 million. This quarter includes $13 million of costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters net of indemnification and $16 million of transaction-related costs for the Move acquisition, which closed in mid-November.  Excluding those costs plus the remaining impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency fluctuations, our adjusted total segment EBITDA grew by 4% versus the prior year. As Robert noted, we were impacted by currency headwinds, primarily the Australian dollar, which negatively impacted Q2 total revenues by $72 million or 3% and total segment EBITDA by $16 million or 5%.
Reported EPS were $0.24 versus $0.26 in the prior year period due to higher effective tax rate and lower interest income. Excluding restructuring and impairment charges, U.K. Newspaper Matter costs and other onetime items, our adjusted EPS were $0.26 versus $0.31 in the prior year.
The results, again, underscores the strength and diversity of our asset portfolio, which continues to show underlying EBITDA and free cash flow improvement despite the uneven global ad marketplace. We continue to extract cost efficiencies while strengthening 2 of our key pillars, Digital Real Estate and Book Publishing, which we believe will materially reshape the growth profile of News Corp.
Turning to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter declined $89 million or 6% versus the prior year period, and adjusted segment revenue declined 3%. Within the segment revenues, advertising, which was 58% of segment revenues this quarter, declined around 9% or 6% in local currency relatively similar to the first quarter.  If we look at the performance across our key units starting at News Corp Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined around 10% or approximately 3% in local currency, again, showing sequential year-over-year improvement versus fiscal first quarter and last year's fiscal fourth quarter on a local currency basis, helped by market share gains in print and higher digital advertising sales. We saw strong improvements there in the national, notably government and travel, real estate and classified ad categories. News Corp Australia EBITDA also improved due to low costs, including overhead reductions and from the closure of the Gold Coast printing facility in the prior fiscal year.
At The Wall Street Journal, advertising grew 2% versus the prior year, a big improvement from the first quarter, benefiting from strength in 2 key categories, finance and technology, combined with strong demand for the WSJ magazine. We saw advertising growth in both print and digital this quarter.
At News UK, advertising revenues remain soft this quarter, declining around 18% or 16% in local currency, which was slightly worse than Q1, still impacted by weakness in grocers, telecom, finance and automotive.
At News America Marketing, revenues declined due to continuing weakness in free-standing inserts, which have been under pressure over the past 2 quarters, impacted by lower spending from consumer packaged goods companies. The decline was partially offset by in-store advertising growth.
Total circulation and subscription revenues, which account for 35% of segment revenues this quarter declined by 3%. The decline was driven by the professional information business at Dow Jones, which had a negative $11 million impact to revenues this quarter but again, continues to show sequential year-over-year improvement as the pipeline of business is strengthening. As Robert had noted, we expect to see further improvements in the second half and hopefully be positioned for growth next fiscal year.
Total newspaper circulation revenues, however, showed modest year-over-year growth on a local currency basis in every region driven by subscription and cover price increases at a number of our mastheads, coupled with higher revenue from digital subscribers, which more than offset print volume declines. Of note, starting in January, we have begun to migrate legacy Wall Street Journal subscribers to higher price point tiers.
Segment EBITDA decreased $39 million in the quarter or 15% as compared to the prior year period and adjusted segment EBITDA was down 12%. Included in segment EBITDA was $8 million impact related to the relocation of our London operations for deal rent and other facility costs. As I mentioned on past calls, we do not expect any material deal rent and other facility costs from the second half and onwards. This quarter we also incurred roughly $9 million higher legal expenses at News America Marketing related to ongoing litigations.
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues improved 20%, and segment EBITDA grew 13% versus the prior year quarter. Excluding the results from the Harlequin acquisition, which closed in August 1, and foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenues were in line with the prior year, and adjusted segment EBITDA declined 4% due to tough comparison from the Divergent series in the prior year period.
While the Divergent series continues to sell well, this quarter totaling over 1.5 million net units, this, as expected, was lower than the 5.7 million net units sold in the prior year period, creating a $33 million revenue challenge. Despite that challenge, the core HarperCollins business performed very well to nearly match year-ago levels with solid contributions in General Books, from Amy Poehler's Yes Please, Patricia Cornwell's Flesh and Blood and Chris Kyle's American Sniper as well as continued demand of Sarah Young's Jesus Calling series in Christian Publishing.
Total e-book sales for the quarter grew 14% and accounted for the 17% of consumer revenues. Harlequin contributed $80 million of revenues and $11 million of EBITDA in the quarter. It's worth highlighting that Harlequin's profitability is improving, and we are implementing a number of initiatives to reduce costs, including streamlining, manufacturing and distribution as well as harmonizing sales strategies.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues improved $2 million or 2% compared to the prior year quarter. Subscription revenues grew 3% benefiting from higher affiliate fees from Foxtel and increased number of subscribers. Advertising revenues decline modestly due to adverse foreign currency fluctuations, but revenues were up slightly in local currency despite a soft TV marketplace. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was up 2% compared to the prior year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenues increased 11% and adjusted segment EBITDA improved by 9%.
In Digital Real Estate Services, we now include results from both REA Group and from Move effective from November 14. Total revenues for the segment increased $51 million or 50%, and EBITDA improved 4% compared to the prior year period. Again, included in the reported results are $16 million of transaction-related fees for the Move acquisition. Excluding foreign currency fluctuations, REA's adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA grew 26% and 38%, respectively, an improvement from the prior quarter driven by higher pricing and increased penetration for enhanced products.
The quarter's results also include $34 million in revenue and $3 million of EBITDA for Move for the period November 14 through the quarter end, as the business continued to benefit from higher traffic this quarter. EBITDA does include $4 million of stock-based compensation expense though, and as a point of reference, Move excluded stock-based compensation when reporting their adjusted EBITDA.
Audience growth at realtor.com has accelerated through the year with fiscal second quarter average monthly unique users up 26% led by mobile platforms, which were up 60%. And also importantly, lead volume growth improved by 38%. 
As Robert noted, our immediate focus for realtor.com is on product development. We've already refreshed the homepage, added widgets and links across The Wall Street Journal Digital Network and The New York Post, and are integrating our content across the site. Our goal is to drive significant revenue growth and material contribution to profitability in the coming years, and early results are encouraging with January monthly unique users up over 30% to 37 million.
In the second half of this fiscal year, we expect to see revenue growth accelerate driven by the continued success of our buyer agent, co-broked (sic) [ co-brokered ] product, which grew over 100% last quarter combined with higher usage levels. And we also intend to reinvest judiciously in marketing and product development as I've previously said. Overall, we are very pleased about Move's trajectory and remain excited about it's potential.
At business and education, revenues were flat compared to the prior year quarter, and segment EBITDA improved $20 million to a loss of $24 million. Again, about $14 million of that improvement was due to the capitalization of software development costs related to our digital ELA learning products, and the balance came from operating efficiencies.
With respect to earnings from affiliate's, Foxtel ended the quarter with around 2.7 million total subscribers, up 5% versus the prior year driven by cable satellite subscribers. Foxtel revenues for the quarter in local currency were in line with prior year, and EBITDA improved 2%. Churn declined to 11.8% from 12.8% in the prior year quarter. Foxtel launched its new revamped pricing and packaging on November 3 last year with an expectation of improving cable satellite subscriber penetration over the course of the year. Again, while it's early in the rollout, results overall are encouraging. Total new sales volume has improved by approximately 80% since launch, and churn has reduced. Despite the impact of the lower selling price point, ARPU remains favorable year-over-year, reflecting the limited spin down to date of existing customers.
Turning now to cash flow. News Corp's cash flow from operations in the first half of fiscal '15 improved to $492 million compared to $407 million in the prior year, and free cash flow available to News Corp improved to $275 million compared to $217 million in the prior year. The vast majority of our $1.9 billion cash on hand is in U.S. dollars.
We continue to expect full year CapEx to be relatively similar to the prior year at around $400 million, including around $70 million for the London relocation, which is now complete and $60 million related to capitalized software at Amplify Learning.
So in summary, we believe this quarter and the first half results demonstrate that News Corp is on the right track. While the ad market has been unpredictable and currency has been and remains a headwind, we believe the steps we're taking both in reinvestments and operating efficiencies are positioning the company for long-term growth.
With that, let me hand it back to the operator for Q&A."

The winds are fluky, but what Mike Darcey and the team are doing in particular: one, focusing on digital advertising where we do believe that there is room for growth; two, we're constantly looking at circulation revenue; and three, the team is going out and arguing in a very competitive market about the value of the unused mastheads, which is very clear. And it's very clear, indeed, when you look at the circulation uptick in The Times, where -- while other newspapers are struggling, The Times is doing very well. And that message, when advertisers hear it and understand it, will resonate not only with advertisers but with potential consumers. So Mike and the team are very much on the case, and they certainly have levers to pull."

But what I have to say that's been gratifying is that the -- what we presume to be the case, the bringing together of the platforms of the Dow Jones network and Move, realtor.com, that, that would have, of itself, for example, increased the power of organic search, and that is what you're seeing behind that rapid rise in usership in recent times. And we're particularly gratified by the increase in mobile usage. And for example, the mobile app, the number of visits in January was up close to 65%, and when you look at the app deep, the number of page views per visit, as best we can tell, at the app is around just over 18 pages per visit. So you're not only getting a lot of visitors, but you're getting very sticky visitors. And that comes at, frankly, very little or no marketing cost. So whatever we do longer term with marketing spend -- and there will be marketing spend, and our guidance has to be that it will be dilutive.

While we faced headwinds this quarter with particularly blustery currency conditions, we remain on course for the goals articulated when the new News was christened almost 2 years ago. The company has remained true to its proud traditions and now has a firm foundation for the future. 
In the third quarter of fiscal year 2015, revenues were $2.1 billion and EBITDA was $163 million. Excluding currency fluctuations during this volatile period and certain other costs, our adjusted EBITDA was relatively stable. Bedi will provide greater granularity, but there are a few developments worthy of accentuation. 
The integration of Move Inc. acquired late last year is ahead of schedule. With traffic on realtor.com accelerating at a record rate and healthy revenue growth and robust lead volume for realtors. Mortgage lending trends are heartening for the long-term health of the U.S. housing market. HarperCollins performed impressively, thanks to a strong backlist and the addition of Harlequin's powerful international and digital distribution network.
Fox Sports strategy of revenues expanded in local currency thanks in part to the conscious success in the Asian cup football tournament and Cricket World Cup, which drove audiences, advertising and a certain amount of adulation. Foxtel is necessary investment in long-term growth also produced an immediate increase in subscriptions. While churn remained at record low levels, indicating the inherent price elasticity in the offering. These returns highlight why Foxtel is such an integral part of News Corp's future. 
At the same time, beign a global company, we are subject to international trends with foreign exchange variations negatively affecting revenue by around 6% and EBITDA by 7%. And regional variations in advertising currents particularly in the U.S. resulted in ad sales at The Wall Street Journal below expectations and prior year. We did, however, see an improvement in April though the marketplace remains volatile and short-term in orientation. 
We have been candid from day 1 about print advertising trends globally and we continue to innovate to deliver a suite of leading products that extend leadership across multiple platforms and expand engagement throughout the day. In so doing, our print mastheads are becoming stronger branded assets in the digital age and our audience relationship is itself a platform, which we can leverage to benefit our real estate and other digital ventures.
In REA grid, part of our Digital Real State segment had a lower rate of revenue growth than in the first half, magnified by certain seasonal factors, 2 of which will obviously not be a factor in the fourth quarter, elections in 2 [ph] Australian states and a relatively early Easter. More broadly with continued expansion additional applications and associated revenues in our newspapers, we expect a more positive final quarter, an improved EBITDA versus the prior year. Bedi will elaborate expertly on that thing shortly. 
In the meantime, I would like to emphasize the efficacy of our 2 major acquisitions as the new News, Harlequin and Move, better known to many as realtor.com. Each has complemented existing strengths and extended our expertise. Our profile and prowess as a book publisher in print and in digital have grown globally, allowing us to better leverage successful books at higher margins. And today, we are a global leader in real estate. With an influential presence on 4 continents including an expanded investment in India where we are linking a recently acquired personal finance side, big decisions, our news flow and our large minority state in prop target to build a coherent, integrated identity in a country that is growing at a significant clip.
Let me begin with Move, which has given us for the first time, a full quarter performance in Q3. Revenues accelerated on a standalone basis in the third quarter and we have seen real growth in the core business, realtor.com, which was up 34% in unique uses in the quarter year-over-year. That growth has accelerated further in April, up another record 38% with 44 million monthly unique users. Importantly, consumer engagement including page views is improving markedly and lead volume this quarter continues to outpace usage growth. 
One early success and we are clearly early in the evolution is the enhancement of the News and Advise section. Traffic to this feature now powered by property news from around News Corp was up 600% in March compared to the same month last year. There is of course, much toil head but notably, mobile hit an impressive 71% unique user growth versus the prior year. Users of our mobile app are consuming about 16 pages per visit and that does not include photo galleries, so you can get a sense of the deep engagement, allowing us to harvest permissions, precious data, which can then be further leveraged. 
According to third-party measurements, realtor.com surpassed Trulia in fiscal third quarter to become the second most popular real estate web site in America and it became the fastest-growing of the leading sites. Overall, both March and April were record-breaking months in terms of traffic and we expect to continue to drive and deepen engagement and monetization over the coming year. There is no doubt that realtor.com's audience growth is benefiting from News Corp content and context. 
Our relationships with New York realtors, fashion during the launch of Mansion at The Wall Street Journal have played an important role in building out realtor.com fast-growing presence in the city. And the new sensibility that is inherent in the character of News Corp has allowed us to generate a stream of stories and alerts far more informative than the drivel and, masquerading as news on many listing sites. The News Corp links mean more revenue too because we have integrated realtor.com into our global programmatic Ad Exchage and we expect that to be a catalyst for CPM improvement. 
You will certainly be hearing more about realtor.com in coming weeks. We will be launching a fresh marketing campaign for the company, highlighting our crucial links to the industry, but also stressing the real value and real results that come from realtor in real terms. We also believe the integration and other challenges being experienced by Zillow, open the door even wider for realtor.com as a healthy and recharged competitor, particularly since realtor.com has strengthened its standing as the most accurate, up-to-date source of real estate listings in the country. 
One modest launch worth mentioning is the unveiling last week of Mansion Global. A global luxury real estate side operated by Dow Jones. People feature original content as well as news and information from our publications and websites around the world and has English, Spanish and Chinese language editions reflecting the reality, that property is an international asset class whose importance is burgeoning. 
Harlequin. Harlequin continues to fulfill its promise of helping HarperCollins low it's global footprint with the most recent step forward being the establishment of foreign language offices in the Netherlands, Japan, the Nordic region and Poland to add to the previously announced rebranding in Germany and Iberia this quarter, all building an impressive Harlequin infrastructure. 
We also have, have as predicted expanded our international language offerings including the announcement last month that we'd be publishing 5 orders in 15 languages, including the prolific and popular, Daniel Silver. And for the first time, we announced the signing of an author publication in both English and a dozen international language, the best-selling novelist Karen Slaughter. Meanwhile, we have a fresh contract with the gifted Veronica Roth, author of one of the most successful series in recent years, the Virgin Trilogy and there is much anticipation for the release of the monumental Go Set A Watchman, To Kill a Mockingbird prequel sequel by Harper Lee. Having read the manuscript, I can say that I expected to have a profound impact. 
HarperCollins is also publishing the title in Spanish, a feat that would've been beyond us without Harlequin. Overall, we saw revenue growth of 14% in Book Publishing and EBITDA growth of 6%. Keep in mind that this growth came despite the obviously difficult Divergent comps, which we referenced at the last call. The latest Divergent film is a catalyst for further sales in Q3 went 2.3 million books were sold, while American Sniper had a strong quarter with 2.7 million books purchased. Speaking of which, American Wife by, Tyer Kyle, the widow of American Sniper author, Chris Kyle, has been released this week. 
As for Amazon, HarperCollins has reached agreement on extended terms meaning that there'll be no disruption to the distribution of our works, digitally and traditionally. At News and Information Services, we are pleased with the improvement and the professional information business at Dow Jones, as we focus on product enhancement and customers. We've seen favorable trends in both risk and compliance, and expected the company will benefit from the direct linking of professional products to The Wall Street Journal itself. More on that project in coming months. 
At The Journal, despite a tough national ad marketplace, we saw an increase in circulation revenues, thanks in part to the Meg Time. The first brand campaign in 4 years. WSJ+ also continues to have traction with less churn in a disciplined approach to pricing. In other words, discounting. WSJ Digital only subs are now over 700,000 and that total should be bolstered given that we have just unveiled a more contemporary WSJ.com. Early results from that relaunch show a significant improvement in engagement, including page views, unique visitors and video players. 
At News UK, the team did a fine job of reducing costs and strategically raising both the cover price on the Sun Saturday and Sunday, and subscription pricing at The Times in a measured manner. The Times continues to grow volume and notably, outperform the market both in terms of ad market share and in circulation. In March, we announced the total subscriptions at the time at Sunday Times broke through the 400,000 mark including 171,000 digital only. At The Sun, while advertising revenues were soft, having just visited the team there last week, I know they are focused on diversifying the advertiser client base and on reinvesting in a new and improved website.
At News Corp Australia, advertising was reasonably stable and thanks to improved pricing, circulation revenues in the local currency accelerated. We're continuing to grow our paid digital subscriber at the mastheads led by the Australian where digital subs now account for 40% of its overall weekday volume. 
At Foxtail as is referenced earlier, churn was a record low of less than 11% and new subscriber volume is significantly higher and spin down to cheaper offerings has been lower than forecast as we build out the audience. As has been highlighted in the past, we are determined to increase our market penetration in Australia beyond the high 20s percentage points and the early signs are indeed promising. 
At Amplify, we continue to concentrate on scalability and profitability, counting on a strong sales network to make progress in this selling season armed with the world-class digital. Let me be clear on this point, a review of progress thus far, indicates that investment spend will be significantly reduced next fiscal year. 
In conclusion, while Q3 had its challenges, we expect to finish fiscal 2015 with a stronger quarter and year-over-year growth in EBITDA. Our strategic trajectory is very much on track and we are confident that all shareholders will benefit as we build on the base fortified over the past 2 years. 
With that, we turn to Bedi Singh, our CFO for a more textured exposition in our accounts."
212741644,290566882,804237,"News Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Robert. First, I'd like to share with you some high level financial highlights and then we'll discuss each segment in further detail. We reported fiscal '15 third quarter total revenues of $2.1 billion, almost flat with the prior year period. E",1991,"Thank you, Robert. First, I'd like to share with you some high level financial highlights and then we'll discuss each segment in further detail. We reported fiscal '15 third quarter total revenues of $2.1 billion, almost flat with the prior year period. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenue declined 2% compared to the prior year. 
On EBITDA, we reported total segment EBITDA for $163 million compared to prior year period of $175 million. This quarter includes $15 million of costs related to the U.K. newspapers matters, net of indemnification. Excluding those costs plus the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency fluctuation, adjusted total segment EBITDA was relatively flat with the prior year.
While we reported a decline in segment EBITDA this quarter, this was mainly driven by currency headwinds. One-time or nonrecurring items including an acceleration of stock-based comp at Move and additional legal cost at News America. We do not believe these results are reflected of any run rate and we expect to see an improvement in the fourth quarter, which I'll discuss shortly. Just as a reminder, for the first 9 months ended March 31, our reported and adjusted EBITDA increased 3% and 6%, respectively. As Robert noted, we were impacted by currency headwinds, primarily the weaker Australian dollar was negatively impacted Q3 total reported revenues by $119 million or 6% and total reported segment EBITDA by $13 million or 7%. 
Adjusted EPS was $0.05 versus $0.11 in the prior year and this year's results include a higher effective tax rate, lower equity earnings and lower interest income. 
Now let's turn to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter declined $135 million or 9% versus the prior year period. Approximately 60% of the revenue decline was related to currency. Adjusted segment revenues declined 3%. Within segment revenues, advertising, which was 54% of segment revenues this quarter declined around 10% or 7% in local currency, which is relatively similar to last quarter. 
Looking at performance across our key units, at News Corp Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined around 16%, however, the decline was only 4% in local currency, relatively stable versus the prior quarter, helped by further market share gains in print and higher digital advertising sales. We saw continued improvement in yields, which was offset by weakness in a few categories including retail, national spending including tourism and energy were flat this quarter. 
At The Wall Street Journal, advertising declined around 11% versus the prior year. We saw weakness in print advertising across the board and telecom and to a lesser extent in finance. That said, while the market remains volatile, we expect a sequential improvement in the fourth quarter driven by digital.
In the News UK, advertising revenues remain soft this quarter, declining around 18% while 11% in local currency. The bid shows sequential improvement on a local currency basis. We were impacted by weakness in a few categories including telecom, automotive and retail. As Robert noted, The Times performed well with ad revenues and local currencies down only slightly while the Sun remain soft this quarter. 
In News America Marketing, revenue declined 7% versus the prior year quarter due to continued weakness and freestanding inserts and a decline in sales of in-store products this quarter. This is related to consumer packaged goods spending, which was impacted by lower commodity prices, timing of product launches and a very tough year of comp, which was up more than 20%. Total circulation and subscription revenues, which accounted for 39% of segment revenues this quarter, declined 6% and they're relatively flat in local currency. 
The Dow Jones professional information business had a negative $11 million impact to revenues this quarter or $6 million excluding foreign currencies, an improvement from the sequential prior quarter. We remain encouraged by the underlying trends and the pipeline. We again saw growth in consumer circulation revenues in local currency led by improvement at The Wall Street Journal, which rose nearly 7% and Australia, which rose around 4%, largely driven by cover and subscription price increases. 
Segment EBITDA decreased $33 million in the quarter or 23% as compared to the prior year period and adjusted segment EBITDA was down 21%. Included in segment EBITDA was an $8 million negative impact related to higher legal expenses at News America Marketing for the ongoing litigations. And to date, in fiscal 2015, litigation expenses at News America Marketing have totaled around $24 million. This quarter, also included roughly $5 million of additional marketing spend at Dow Jones that's currently running Make Time campaign. Total segment cost continued to decline due to the benefits of past restructurings and lower printing and distribution costs. News Corp Australia continues to benefit from cost savings and relatively stable revenues in local currency.
Turning now to the Book Publishing segment, revenues improved 14% and segment EBITDA grew 6% versus the prior year quarter. Excluding the results from the Harlequin acquisition, which closed on August 1 and foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenues fell 5% versus the prior year and adjusted segment EBITDA declined 8% due to very tough comparisons from the Divergent series in the prior year period. 
While the Divergent series continue to sell well, this quarter totaling approximately 2.3 million net units, as expected this was lower than the 8.5 million net units sold in the prior year period, creating a $44 million revenue challenge. Despite that challenge, the core HarperCollins business performed well thanks to the strength of its backlist, most notably Chris Kyle's American Sniper, which sold 2.7 million net units this quarter. 
Other notable titles included Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird, Annie Polar's Yes Please, as well as continued demand for Sarah Young's Jesus Calling series Christian publishing. Total e-book sales for the quarter declined 3% and accounted for 22% of consumer revenues due to the Divergent year-ago comp combined with strong demand and nonfiction this quarter, which historically has had a lower conversion to e-books, which was partially offset by the inclusion of Harlequin. Regarding Harlequin, HarperCollins announced the rebranding of additional foreign language officers in the Netherlands, Japan, Nordic and Poland, drag to the previously announced rebranding in Germany and Iberia this quarter. 
We remain on track with our cost synergy target of 20 million, most of which will be realized in our next fiscal year. In Cable Network Programming. Revenues improved by $3 million or 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Subscription revenues grew 1% benefiting from higher affiliate fees and increased subscribers. Advertising revenues rose 13% driven by viewership gains from major events such as the Cricket World Cup and the Asian Cup, which we didn't have in the prior year period. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was flat despite higher cost and negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenues and EBITDA growth increased by 15%.
In Digital Real Estate Services, total segment revenues increased $68 million or 67% and EBITDA declined 21% compared to the prior year period due to foreign currency and the inclusion of new results. Excluding foreign currency fluctuations, REA adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA grew 9% and 7%, respectively as higher debt penetration and pricing was partially offset by lower listing volume across the Australian market, most notably in March impacted as Robert said, by the earlier Easter break and the elections in 2 states. 
Please also note the reported numbers vary from REA's reported numbers due to foreign currency translation as well as differences between Australian IFRS and U.S. GAAP. REA will be assuring their 9 months results under Australian IFRS and in Australia dollars, shortly after this call. Reported segment results also include $73 million in revenues and an EBITDA loss of $9 million from Move. 
Move's EBITDA loss includes $11 million of stock-based compensation expense related to a large assumed in the acquisition including acceleration of stock-based compensation resulting from the departures of senior executives. Excluding Move's stock-based comp, EBITDA would have been a positive 3 million this quarter. On a standalone basis, Move's revenue would've grown in the 25% versus the prior year quarter led by connections for product, which grew 130% versus the prior year. As Robert noted, audience growth at realtor.com continues to accelerate, average monthly unique users in the third quarter was $39 million growing 34% versus the prior year including record traffic in April, or 44 million unique users. 
Mobile continues to drive realtor.com traffic growth up over 71% year-over-year in the quarter. We're very pleased with the product development at realtor.com, which is broadly be in line if not ahead of expectations and are now starting to dial up brand marketing to drive further market share gains. 
At Digital Education, revenues were flat with the prior year quarter and segment EBITDA improved $24 million to a loss of $21 million, about $12 million of that improvement was due to capitalization of software development costs related to our digital ELA learning product and the balance from lower operating expenses. With respect to earnings of affiliates, Foxtel ended the quarter with around 2.8 million total subscribers, up 70% versus the prior year driven by cable satellite subscribers. Churn declined to a record low of 10.9% from 13.1% in the prior year quarter. Foxtel revenues for the quarter and local currency were up 1% versus the prior year and EBITDA declined midteens due to higher sports programming cost related to the acquisition of V8 Super Cars and Formula One rights, higher fees paid to Fox Sports Australia, combined with higher investment in marketing and customer service related to the new pricing and packaging offerings. Foxtel also incurred additional cost for triple play and, Foxtel's SVOD product. However, these planned investments positioned Foxtel for sustainable growth and we believe the results are very encouraging. Subscriber growth remains strong with total subscribers up 182,000 year-over-year with growth of 85,000 in Q3. Year-to-date new customers sales are up more than 50% over the prior period and spend on volume remains below our expectations. Turning now to free cash flow News Corp. Castle from operations for the 9 months was $702 million compared to $802 million in the prior year free cash flow available to News comp was $391 million compared to $496 million in the prior year. This decline was primarily due to the absence of Metro seats related to the foreign tax refund of $73 million received last year coupled with approximately $45 million of fire deferred compensation payments related to the acquisition of wireless iteration. The foreign currency had a $50 million negative impact year-to-date available free cash flow. The vast majority of our $2 billion cash in hand asked the quadrant is a new us dollars. Let me turn briefly to our current fiscal fourth quarter. Currencies likely to remain a headwind in the short-term we expect to see year-over-year EBITDA improvement in the fourth quarter including information services we expect the benefit from lower costs in the U.K. which last year included severance cost higher promotional spending around the World Cup and the London relocation. At Dow Jones we anticipate a sequential improvement and in advertising combined of the ongoing operating efficiencies. At Book Publishing the year ago comp related to the virgins with the significantly and should benefit from the Harlequin acquisition. Cable network should benefit from higher subs partially offset by modestly higher acquisition costs and Amplify we expect to see continued operating expense declines in addition to the amounts capitalized. So in summary, we remain focused on driving long-term growth and believe used courses in the right trend on the end market has been an even and currency year headwind we believe the steps we've taken and we're taking both in real investments in operating efficiencies and positioning the company's and long-term growth. But with that let me hand it over to the operator to the Q&A."

News Corp is well set on its trajectory for digital and global growth. While we faced headwinds this quarter with particularly blustery currency conditions, we remain on course for the goals articulated when the new News was christened almost 2 years ago. The company has remained true to its proud traditions and now has a firm foundation for the future.
In the third quarter of fiscal year 2015, revenues were $2.1 billion and EBITDA was $163 million. Excluding currency fluctuations during this volatile period and certain other costs, our adjusted EBITDA was relatively stable. Bedi will provide greater granularity, but there are a few developments worthy of accentuation.
The integration of Move, Inc. acquired late last year is ahead of schedule, with traffic on realtor.com accelerating at a record rate and healthy revenue growth and robust lead volume for realtors. Mortgage lending trends are heartening for the long-term health of the U.S. housing market. HarperCollins performed impressively thanks to a strong backlist and the addition of Harlequin's powerful international and digital distribution network.
Fox Sports Australia revenues expanded in local currency thanks in part to the country's success in the Asian Cup Football Tournament and Cricket World Cup, which drove audiences, advertising and a certain amount of adulation. Foxtel's necessary investment in long-term growth also produced an immediate increase in subscriptions, while churn remained at record low levels, indicating the inherent price elasticity in the offering. These returns highlight why Foxtel is such an integral part of News Corp's future.
At the same time, being a global company, we are subject to international trends with foreign exchange variations negatively affecting revenue by around 6% and EBITDA by 7%. And regional variations in advertising currents, particularly in the U.S., resulted in ad sales at The Wall Street Journal below expectations and prior year. We did, however, see an improvement in April though the marketplace remains volatile and short term in orientation.
We have been candid from day 1 about print advertising trends globally, and we continue to innovate to deliver a suite of leading products that extend readership across multiple platforms and expand engagement throughout the day. In so doing, our print mastheads are becoming stronger branded assets in the digital age, and our audience relationship is itself a platform which we can leverage to benefit our real estate and other digital ventures.
In REA Group, part of our Digital Real State segment, had a lower rate of revenue growth than in the first half magnified by certain seasonal factors, 2 of which will obviously not be a factor in the fourth quarter: elections in 2 Australian states and a relatively early Easter. More broadly, with continued expansion of digital applications and associated revenues in our newspapers, we expect a more positive final quarter, an improved EBITDA versus the prior year. Bedi will elaborate expertly on that thing shortly.
In the meantime, I would like to emphasize the efficacy of our 2 major acquisitions as the new News, Harlequin and Move, better known to many as realtor.com. Each has complemented existing strengths and extended our expertise. Our profile and prowess as a book publisher in print and in digital have grown globally, allowing us to better leverage successful books at higher margins. And today, we are a global leader in real estate, with an influential presence on 4 continents including an expanded investment in India where we are linking a recently acquired personal finance site, big decisions, our news flow and our large minority stake in prop [ph] target to build a coherent, integrated identity in a country that is growing at a significant clip.
Let me begin with Move, which has given us for the first time a full quarter performance in Q3. Revenues accelerated on a standalone basis in the third quarter, and we have seen real growth in the core business realtor.com, which was up 34% in unique users in the quarter year-over-year. That growth has accelerated further in April, up another record 38% with 44 million monthly unique users. Importantly, consumer engagement including page views is improving markedly, and lead volume this quarter continues to outpace usage growth.
One early success, and we are clearly early in the site's evolution, is the enhancement of the News and Advice section. Traffic to this feature, now powered by property news from around News Corp, was up 600% in March compared to the same month last year. There is, of course, much thrill ahead but notably, mobile hit an impressive 71% unique user growth versus the prior year. Users of our mobile app are consuming about 16 pages per visit and that does not include photo galleries. So you can get a sense of the deep engagement, allowing us to harvest permissions, precious data, which can then be further leveraged.
According to third-party measurements, realtor.com surpassed Trulia in fiscal third quarter to become the second most popular real estate web site in America, and it became the fastest-growing of the leading sites. Overall, both March and April were record-breaking months in terms of traffic, and we expect to continue to drive and deepen engagement and monetization over the coming year. There is no doubt that realtor.com's audience growth is benefiting from News Corp's content and context.
Our relationships with New York realtors fashioned during the launch of Mansion at The Wall Street Journal have played an important role in building out realtor.com's fast-growing presence in the city. And the new sensibility that is inherent in the character of News Corp has allowed us to generate a stream of stories and alerts far more informative than the drivel and dross masquerading as news on many listing sites. The News Corp links mean more revenue, too, because we have integrated realtor.com into our global programmatic ad exchange, and we expect that to be a catalyst for CPM improvement.
You will certainly be hearing more about realtor.com in the coming weeks. We will be launching a fresh marketing campaign for the company, highlighting our crucial links to the industry, but also stressing the real value and real results that come from realtor in real time. We also believe the integration and other challenges being experienced by Zillow open the door even wider for realtor.com as a healthy and recharged competitor, particularly since realtor.com has strengthened its standing as the most accurate, up-to-date source of real estate listings in the country.
One modest launch worth mentioning is the unveiling last week of Mansion Global, a global luxury real estate site operated by Dow Jones. It will feature original content as well as news and information from our publications and websites around the world and has English, Spanish and Chinese language editions, reflecting the reality that property is an international asset class whose importance is burgeoning.
Harlequin. Harlequin continues to fulfill its promise of helping HarperCollins grow its global footprint, with the most recent step forward being the establishment of foreign language offices in the Netherlands, Japan, the Nordic region and Poland to add to the previously announced rebranding in Germany and Iberia this quarter, all building on the impressive Harlequin infrastructure.
We also have, as predicted, expanded our international language offerings including the announcement last month that we'd be publishing 5 authors in 15 languages, including the prolific and popular, Daniel Silva. And for the first time, we announced the signing of an author for publication in both English and a dozen international languages, the best-selling novelist Karin Slaughter. Meanwhile, we have a fresh contract with the gifted Veronica Roth, author of one of the most successful series in recent years, the Divergent Trilogy. And there is much anticipation for the release of the monumental Go Set A Watchman, To Kill a Mockingbird's prequel/sequel by Harper Lee. Having read the manuscript, I can say that I expect it to have a profound impact. So order early. HarperCollins is also publishing the title in Spanish, a feat that would've been beyond us without Harlequin.
Overall, we saw revenue growth of 14% in Book Publishing and EBITDA growth of 6%. Keep in mind that this growth came despite the obviously difficult Divergent comps, which we referenced at the last call. The latest Divergent film was a catalyst for further sales in Q3 when 2.3 million books were sold, while American Sniper had a strong quarter with 2.7 million books purchased. Speaking of which, American Wife by Taya Kyle, the widow of American Sniper author, Chris Kyle, has been released this week. As for Amazon, HarperCollins has reached agreement on extended terms meaning that there will be no disruption to the distribution of our works, digitally and traditionally.
At News and Information Services, we are pleased with the improvement in the professional information business at Dow Jones as we focus on product enhancement and customers. We've seen favorable trends in both risk and compliance and Factiva and expect that the company will benefit from the direct linking of professional products to The Wall Street Journal itself. More on that project in coming months.
At The Journal, despite a tough national ad marketplace, we saw an increase in circulation revenues thanks in part to Make Time, the first brand campaign in 4 years. WSJ+ also continues to have traction with less churn and a disciplined approach to pricing. In other words, no deleterious discounting. WSJ digital-only subs are now over 700,000 and that total should be bolstered given that we have just unveiled a more contemporary WSJ.com. Early results from that relaunch show a significant improvement in engagement including page views, unique visitors and video plays.
At News UK, the team did a fine job of reducing costs and strategically raising both the cover price of The Sun on Saturday and Sunday and subscription pricing at The Times in a measured manner. The Times continues to grow volume and notably outperformed the market both in terms of ad market share and in circulation. In March, we announced the total subscriptions at The Times and Sunday Times broke through the 400,000 mark, including 171,000 digital-only. At The Sun, while advertising revenues were soft, having just visited the team there last week, I know they are focused on diversifying the advertiser client base and on reinvesting in a new and improved website.
At News Corp Australia, advertising was reasonably stable and thanks to improved pricing, circulation revenues in the local currency accelerated. We're continuing to grow our paid digital subscribers at the mastheads led by The Australian, where digital subs now account for 40% of its overall weekday volume.
At Foxtel, as referenced earlier, churn was a record low of less than 11%, and new subscriber volume is significantly higher and spin down to cheaper offerings has been lower than forecast as we build out the audience. As has been highlighted in the past, we are determined to increase our market penetration in Australia beyond the high 20s percentage points, and the early signs are indeed promising. 
At Amplify, we continue to concentrate on scalability and profitability, counting on a strong sales network to make progress in this selling season, armed with a world-class digital group. Let me be clear on this point. A review of progress thus far indicates that investment spend will be significantly reduced next fiscal year.
In conclusion, while Q3 had its challenges, we expect to finish fiscal 2015 with a stronger quarter and year-over-year growth in EBITDA. Our strategic trajectory is very much on track, and we are confident that all shareholders will benefit as we build on the base fortified over the past 2 years.
With that, we turn to Bedi Singh, our CFO, for a more textured exposition on our accounts."

First, I'd like to share with you some high-level financial highlights and then we'll discuss each segment in further detail.We reported fiscal '15 third quarter total revenues of $2.1 billion, almost flat with the prior year period.",2003,"Thank you, Robert. First, I'd like to share with you some high-level financial highlights and then we'll discuss each segment in further detail.
We reported fiscal '15 third quarter total revenues of $2.1 billion, almost flat with the prior year period. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenue declined 2% compared to the prior year. On EBITDA, we reported total segment EBITDA of $163 million compared to the prior year period of $175 million. This quarter includes $15 million of costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters, net of indemnification. Excluding those costs plus the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency fluctuation, our adjusted total segment EBITDA was relatively flat with the prior year.
While we reported a decline in segment EBITDA this quarter, this was mainly driven by currency headwinds, onetime or nonrecurring items including an acceleration of stock-based comp at Move and additional legal costs at News America. We do not believe these results are reflective of any run rate and expect to see an improvement in the fourth quarter, which I'll discuss shortly. And just as a reminder, for the first 9 months ended March 31, our reported and adjusted EBITDA increased 3% and 6%, respectively. As Robert noted, we were impacted by currency headwinds, primarily the weaker Australian dollar which negatively impacted Q3 total reported revenues by $119 million or 6% and total reported segment EBITDA by $13 million or 7%. Adjusted EPS were $0.05 versus $0.11 in the prior year, and this year's results include a higher effective tax rate, lower equity earnings and lower interest income.
Now let's turn to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter declined $135 million or 9% versus the prior year period. Approximately 60% of the revenue decline was related to currency. Adjusted segment revenues declined 3%. Within segment revenues, advertising, which was 54% of segment revenues this quarter, declined around 12% or 7% in local currency, which is relatively similar to last quarter.
Looking at performance across our key units. At News Corp Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined around 16%. However, the decline was only 4% in local currency, relatively stable versus the prior quarter, helped by further market share gains in print and higher digital advertising sales. We saw continued improvement in yields, which was offset by weakness in a few categories including retail. National spending including tourism and energy were flat this quarter.
At The Wall Street Journal, advertising declined around 11% versus the prior year. We saw weakness in print advertising across the board, in telecom and to a lesser extent, in finance. That said, while the market remains volatile, we expect a sequential improvement in the fourth quarter driven by digital.
At News UK, advertising revenues remained soft this quarter, declining around 18% or 11% in local currency, but did show sequential improvement on a local currency basis. We were impacted by weakness in a few categories including telecom, automotive and retail. As Robert noted, The Times performed well with ad revenues and local currency down only slightly, while The Sun remained soft this quarter.
At News America Marketing, revenue declined 7% versus the prior year quarter due to continued weakness in freestanding inserts and a decline in sales of in-store products this quarter. This was related to consumer packaged goods spending, which was impacted by lower commodity prices, timing of product launches and a very tough year-ago comp, which was up more than 20%.
Total circulation and subscription revenues, which accounted for 39% of segment revenues this quarter, declined 6% and were relatively flat in local currency. Dow Jones professional information business had a negative $11 million impact to revenues this quarter or $6 million excluding foreign currencies, an improvement from the sequential prior quarter. We remain encouraged by the underlying trends and the pipeline. We again saw growth in consumer circulation revenues in local currency led by improvement at The Wall Street Journal, which rose nearly 7% and at News Australia, which rose around 4%, largely driven by cover and subscription price increases.
Segment EBITDA decreased $33 million in the quarter or 23% as compared to the prior year period and adjusted segment EBITDA was down 21%. Included in segment EBITDA was an $8 million negative impact related to higher legal expenses at News America Marketing for the ongoing litigations. And to date, in fiscal 2015, litigation expenses at News America Marketing have totaled around $24 million. This quarter also included roughly $5 million of additional marketing spend at Dow Jones for its currently running Make Time campaign. Total segment cost continued to decline due to the benefits of past restructurings and lower printing and distribution costs. News Corp Australia continues to benefit from cost savings and relatively stable revenues in local currency.
Turning now to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues improved 14% and segment EBITDA grew 6% versus the prior year quarter. Excluding the results from the Harlequin acquisition, which closed on August 1, and foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenues fell 5% versus the prior year and adjusted segment EBITDA declined 8% due to very tough comparisons from the Divergent series in the prior year period. While the Divergent series continue to sell well this quarter, totaling approximately 2.3 million net units, as expected, this was lower than the 8.5 million net units sold in the prior year period, creating a $44 million revenue challenge. Despite that challenge, the core HarperCollins business performed well thanks to the strength of its backlist, most notably Chris Kyle's American Sniper, which sold 2.7 million net units this quarter. Other notable titles included Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird, Amy Poehler's Yes Please as well as continued demand for Sarah Young's Jesus Calling series in Christian publishing.
Total e-book sales for the quarter declined 3% and accounted for 22% of consumer revenues due to the Divergent year-ago comp combined with strong demand in nonfiction this quarter, which historically has had a lower conversion to e-books which was partially offset by the inclusion of Harlequin. Regarding Harlequin, HarperCollins announced the rebranding of additional foreign language offices in the Netherlands, Japan, Nordic and Poland to add to the previously announced rebranding in Germany and Iberia this quarter. We remain on track with our cost synergy target of $20 million, most of which should be realized in our next fiscal year.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues improved by $3 million or 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Subscription revenues grew 1%, benefiting from higher affiliate fees and increased subscribers. Advertising revenues rose 13% driven by viewership gains from major events, such as the Cricket World Cup and the Asian Cup, which we didn't have in the prior year period. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was flat despite higher cost and negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenues and EBITDA both increased by 15%.
In Digital Real Estate Services, total segment revenues increased $68 million or 67% and EBITDA declined 21% compared to the prior year period due to foreign currency and the inclusion of Move results. Excluding foreign currency fluctuations, REA's adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA grew 9% and 7%, respectively, as higher depth penetration and pricing was partially offset by lower-listing volume across the Australian market, most notably in March impacted, as Robert said, by the earlier Easter break and elections in 2 states. Please also note that the reported numbers vary from REA's reported numbers due to foreign currency translation as well as differences between Australian IFRS and U.S. GAAP. REA will be issuing their 9 months results under Australian IFRS and in Australian dollars shortly after this call.
Reported segment results also included $73 million in revenues and an EBITDA loss of $9 million from Move. Move's EBITDA loss includes $11 million of stock-based compensation expense related to a loss [ph] assumed in the acquisition, including acceleration of stock-based compensation resulting from the departures of senior executives. Excluding Move's stock-based comp, EBITDA would have been a positive $3 million this quarter. On a standalone basis, Move's revenue would've grown over 25% versus the prior year quarter led by connections for covered [ph] product, which grew 130% versus the prior year.
As Robert noted, audience growth at realtor.com continues to accelerate. Average monthly unique users in the third quarter were 39 million, growing 34% versus the prior year including record traffic in April of 44 million unique users. Mobile continues to drive realtor.com traffic growth, up over 71% year-over-year in the quarter. We're very pleased with the product development at realtor.com, which has broadly been in line, if not ahead, of our expectations and are now starting to dial up brand marketing to drive further market share gains.
At Digital Education, revenues were flat with the prior year quarter and segment EBITDA improved $24 million to a loss of $21 million. About $12 million of that improvement was due to the capitalization of software development costs related to our digital ELA learning product with the balance from lower operating expenses.
With respect to earnings from affiliates, Foxtel ended the quarter with around 2.8 million total subscribers, up 7% versus the prior year driven by cable satellite subscribers. Churn declined to a record low of 10.9% from 13.1% in the prior year quarter. Foxtel revenues for the quarter in local currency were up 1% versus the prior year and EBITDA declined mid-teens due to higher sports programming costs related to the acquisition of V8 Supercars and Formula 1 rights, higher fees paid to Fox Sports Australia combined with higher investment in marketing and customer service related to the new pricing and packaging offerings.
Foxtel also incurred additional cost for triple play and Presto, Foxtel's SVOD product. However, these planned investments position Foxtel for sustainable growth, and we believe the results are very encouraging. Subscriber growth remains strong, with total subscribers up 182,000 year-over-year with growth of 85,000 in Q3. Year-to-date, new customer sales are up more than 50% [ph] over the prior period and spin-down volume remains below our expectations.
Turning now to free cash flow. News Corp's cash flow from operations for the 9 months was $702 million compared to $803 million in the prior year, and free cash flow available to News Corp was $391 million compared to $496 million in the prior year. This decline was primarily due to the absence of Metro seats related to the foreign tax refund of $73 million received last year, coupled with approximately $45 million of higher deferred compensation payments related to the acquisition of Wireless Generation. To note, foreign currency had a $15 million negative impact to year-to-date available free cash flow. The vast majority of our $2 billion cash on hand at the quarter end is in U.S. dollars.
Let me turn briefly to our current fiscal fourth quarter. While currency is likely to remain a headwind in the short term, we expect to see year-over-year EBITDA improvement in the fourth quarter including, at News and Information Services, we expect to benefit from lower costs at News U.K., which last year included severance costs, higher promotional spending around the World Cup and the London relocation. At Dow Jones, we anticipate a sequential improvement in advertising combined with ongoing operating efficiencies. At Book Publishing, the year-ago comp related to Divergent should ease significantly and should benefit from the Harlequin acquisition. Cable Network should benefit from higher subs, partially offset by modestly higher acquisition costs. And at Amplify, we expect to see continued operating expense declines in addition to the amounts capitalized.
So in summary, we remain focused on driving long-term growth and believe News Corp is on the right track. While the ad market has been uneven and currency a clear headwind, we believe the steps we've taken and we're taking, both in reinvestments and operating efficiencies, are positioning the company for long-term growth.
And with that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

News Corp is well set on its trajectory for digital and global growth. While we faced headwinds this quarter with particularly blustery currency conditions, we remain on course for the goals articulated when the new News was christened almost 2 years ago. The company has remained true to its proud traditions and now has a firm foundation for the future.
In the third quarter of fiscal year 2015, revenues were $2.1 billion and EBITDA was $163 million. Excluding currency fluctuations during this volatile period and certain other costs, our adjusted EBITDA was relatively stable. Bedi will provide greater granularity, but there are a few developments worthy of accentuation.
The integration of Move, Inc., acquired late last year, is ahead of schedule, with traffic on realtor.com accelerating at a record rate and healthy revenue growth and robust lead volume for realtors. Mortgage lending trends are heartening for the long-term health of the U.S. housing market. HarperCollins performed impressively thanks to a strong backlist and the addition of Harlequin's powerful international and digital distribution network.
Fox Sports Australia revenues expanded in local currency thanks in part to the country's success in the Asian Cup Football Tournament and Cricket World Cup, which drove audiences, advertising and a certain amount of adulation. Foxtel's necessary investment in long-term growth also produced an immediate increase in subscriptions, while churn remained at record low levels, indicating the inherent price elasticity in the offering. These returns highlight why Foxtel is such an integral part of News Corp's future.
At the same time, being a global company, we are subject to international trends, with foreign exchange variations negatively affecting revenue by around 6% and EBITDA by 7%. And regional variations in advertising currents, particularly in the U.S., resulted in ad sales at The Wall Street Journal below expectations and prior year. We did, however, see an improvement in April though the marketplace remains volatile and short term in orientation.
We have been candid from day 1 about print advertising trends globally, and we continue to innovate to deliver a suite of leading products that extend readership across multiple platforms and expand engagement throughout the day. In so doing, our print mastheads are becoming stronger branded assets in the digital age, and our audience relationship is itself a platform which we can leverage to benefit our real estate and other digital ventures.
And REA Group, part of our Digital Real Estate segment, had a lower rate of revenue growth than in the first half magnified by certain seasonal factors, 2 of which will obviously not be a factor in the fourth quarter: elections in 2 Australian states and a relatively early Easter. More broadly, with continued expansion of digital applications and associated revenues in our newspapers, we expect a more positive final quarter, and improved EBITDA versus the prior year. Bedi will elaborate expertly on that thing shortly.
In the meantime, I would like to emphasize the efficacy of our 2 major acquisitions as the new News, Harlequin and Move, better known to many as realtor.com. Each has complemented existing strengths and extended our expertise. Our profile and prowess as a book publisher in print and in digital have grown globally, allowing us to better leverage successful books at higher margins. And today, we are a global leader in real estate, with an influential presence on 4 continents including an expanded investment in India where we are linking a recently acquired personal finance site, BigDecisions, our news flow and our large minority stake in PropTiger to build a coherent, integrated identity in a country that is growing at a significant clip.
Let me begin with Move, which has given us for the first time a full quarter of performance in Q3. Revenues accelerated on a standalone basis in the third quarter, and we have seen real growth in the core business, realtor.com, which was up 34% in unique users in the quarter year-over-year. That growth has accelerated further in April, up another record 38% with 44 million monthly unique users. Importantly, consumer engagement, including page views, is improving markedly, and lead volume this quarter continues to outpace usage growth.
One early success, and we are clearly early in the site's evolution, is the enhancement of the News and Advice section. Traffic to this feature, now powered by property news from around News Corp, was up 600% in March compared to the same month last year. There is, of course, much toil ahead, but notably, mobile hit an impressive 71% unique user growth versus the prior year. Users of our mobile app are consuming about 16 pages per visit and that does not include photo galleries. So you can get a sense of the deep engagement, allowing us to harvest permissions, precious data, which can then be further leveraged.
According to third-party measurements, realtor.com surpassed Trulia in fiscal third quarter to become the second most popular real estate web site in America, and it became the fastest-growing of the leading sites. Overall, both March and April were record-breaking months in terms of traffic, and we expect to continue to drive and deepen engagement and monetization over the coming year. There is no doubt that realtor.com's audience growth is benefiting from News Corp's content and contacts.
Our relationships with New York realtors fashioned during the launch of Mansion at The Wall Street Journal have played an important role in building out realtor.com's fast-growing presence in the city. And the new sensibility that is inherent in the character of News Corp has allowed us to generate a stream of stories and alerts far more informative than the drivel and dross masquerading as news on many listing sites. The News Corp links mean more revenue, too, because we have integrated realtor.com into our global programmatic ad exchange, and we expect that to be a catalyst for CPM improvement.
You will certainly be hearing more about realtor.com in the coming weeks. We will be launching a fresh marketing campaign for the company, highlighting our crucial links to the industry, but also stressing the real value and real results that come from realtor in real time. We also believe the integration and other challenges being experienced by Zillow open the door even wider for realtor.com as a healthy and recharged competitor, particularly since realtor.com has strengthened its standing as the most accurate, up-to-date source of real estate listings in the country.
One modest launch worth mentioning is the unveiling last week of Mansion Global, a global luxury real estate site operated by Dow Jones. It will feature original content as well as news and information from our publications and websites around the world and has English, Spanish and Chinese language editions, reflecting the reality that property is an international asset class whose importance is burgeoning.
Harlequin. Harlequin continues to fulfill its promise of helping HarperCollins grow its global footprint, with the most recent step forward being the establishment of foreign language offices in the Netherlands, Japan, the Nordic region and Poland to add to the previously announced rebranding in Germany and Iberia this quarter, all building on the impressive Harlequin infrastructure.
We also have, as predicted, expanded our international language offerings, including the announcement last month that we'd be publishing 5 authors in 15 languages, including the prolific and popular Daniel Silva. And for the first time, we announced the signing of an author for publication in both English and a dozen international languages, the best-selling novelist Karin Slaughter. Meanwhile, we have a fresh contract with the gifted Veronica Roth, author of one of the most successful series in recent years, the Divergent Trilogy. And there is much anticipation for the release of the monumental Go Set a Watchman, To Kill a Mockingbird's prequel/sequel by Harper Lee. Having read the manuscript, I can say that I expect it to have a profound impact. So order early. HarperCollins is also publishing the title in Spanish, a feat that would've been beyond us without Harlequin.
Overall, we saw revenue growth of 14% in Book Publishing and EBITDA growth of 6%. Keep in mind that this growth came despite the obviously difficult Divergent comps, which we referenced at the last call. The latest Divergent film was a catalyst for further sales in Q3 when 2.3 million books were sold, while American Sniper had a strong quarter with 2.7 million books purchased. Speaking of which, American Wife by Taya Kyle, the widow of American Sniper author, Chris Kyle, has been released this week. As for Amazon, HarperCollins has reached agreement on extended terms meaning that there will be no disruption to the distribution of our works, digitally and traditionally.
At News and Information Services, we are pleased with the improvement in the professional information business at Dow Jones as we focus on product enhancement and customers. We've seen favorable trends in both risk and compliance and Factiva and expect that the company will benefit from the direct linking of professional products to The Wall Street Journal itself. More on that project in coming months.
At The Journal, despite a tough national ad marketplace, we saw an increase in circulation revenues thanks in part to Make Time, the first brand campaign in 4 years. WSJ+ also continues to have traction with less churn and a disciplined approach to pricing. In other words, no deleterious discounting. WSJ digital-only subs are now over 700,000 and that total should be bolstered given that we have just unveiled a more contemporary WSJ.com. Early results from that relaunch show a significant improvement in engagement, including page views, unique visitors and video plays.
At News UK, the team did a fine job of reducing costs and strategically raising both the cover price of The Sun on Saturday and Sunday and subscription pricing at The Times in a measured manner. The Times continues to grow volume and notably outperformed the market both in terms of ad market share and in circulation. In March, we announced the total subscriptions at The Times and Sunday Times broke through the 400,000 mark, including 171,000 digital-only. At The Sun, while advertising revenues were soft, having just visited the team there last week, I know they are focused on diversifying the advertiser client base and on reinvesting in a new and improved website.
At News Corp Australia, advertising was reasonably stable and thanks to improved pricing, circulation revenues in the local currency accelerated. We're continuing to grow our paid digital subscribers at the mastheads, led by The Australian, where digital subs now account for 40% of its overall weekday volume.
At Foxtel, as referenced earlier, churn was a record low of less than 11%, and new subscriber volume is significantly higher and spin down to cheaper offerings has been lower than forecast as we build out the audience. As has been highlighted in the past, we are determined to increase our market penetration in Australia beyond the high 20s percentage points, and the early signs are indeed promising. 
At Amplify, we continue to concentrate on scalability and profitability, counting on a strong sales network to make progress in this selling season, armed with a world-class digital curriculum. Let me be clear on this point. A review of progress thus far indicates that investment spend will be significantly reduced next fiscal year.
In conclusion, while Q3 had its challenges, we expect to finish fiscal 2015 with a stronger quarter and year-over-year growth in EBITDA. Our strategic trajectory is very much on track, and we are confident that all shareholders will benefit as we build on the base fortified over the past 2 years.
With that, we turn to Bedi Singh, our CFO, for a more textured exposition on our accounts."
212741644,290566882,804652,"News Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Robert. First, I'd like to share with you some high-level financial highlights and then we'll discuss each segment in further detail.We reported fiscal '15 third quarter total revenues of $2.1 billion, almost flat with the prior year period.",2001,"Thank you, Robert. First, I'd like to share with you some high-level financial highlights and then we'll discuss each segment in further detail.
We reported fiscal '15 third quarter total revenues of $2.1 billion, almost flat with the prior year period. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenue declined 2% compared to the prior year. On EBITDA, we reported total segment EBITDA of $163 million compared to the prior year period of $175 million. This quarter includes $15 million of costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters, net of indemnification. Excluding those costs plus the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency fluctuation, our adjusted total segment EBITDA was relatively flat with the prior year.
While we reported a decline in segment EBITDA this quarter, this was mainly driven by currency headwinds; onetime or nonrecurring items, including an acceleration of stock-based comp at Move; and additional legal costs at News America. We do not believe these results are reflective of any run rate and expect to see an improvement in the fourth quarter, which I'll discuss shortly. And just as a reminder, for the first 9 months ended March 31, our reported and adjusted EBITDA increased 3% and 6%, respectively. As Robert noted, we were impacted by currency headwinds, primarily the weaker Australian dollar, which negatively impacted Q3 total reported revenues by $119 million or 6% and total reported segment EBITDA by $13 million or 7%. Adjusted EPS were $0.05 versus $0.11 in the prior year, and this year's results include a higher effective tax rate, lower equity earnings and lower interest income.
Now let's turn to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter declined $135 million or 9% versus the prior year period. Approximately 60% of the revenue decline was related to currency. Adjusted segment revenues declined 3%. Within segment revenues, advertising, which was 54% of segment revenues this quarter, declined around 12% or 7% in local currency, which is relatively similar to last quarter.
Looking at performance across our key units. At News Corp Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined around 16%. However, the decline was only 4% in local currency, relatively stable versus the prior quarter, helped by further market share gains in print and higher digital advertising sales. We saw continued improvement in yields, which was offset by weakness in a few categories including retail. National spending including tourism and energy were flat this quarter.
At The Wall Street Journal, advertising declined around 11% versus the prior year. We saw weakness in print advertising across the board, in telecom and to a lesser extent, in finance. That said, while the market remains volatile, we expect a sequential improvement in the fourth quarter driven by digital.
At News UK, advertising revenues remained soft this quarter, declining around 18% or 11% in local currency, but did show sequential improvement on a local currency basis. We were impacted by weakness in a few categories, including telecom, automotive and retail. As Robert noted, The Times performed well with ad revenues and local currency down only slightly, while The Sun remained soft this quarter.
At News America Marketing, revenue declined 7% versus the prior year quarter due to continued weakness in freestanding inserts and a decline in sales of in-store products this quarter. This was related to consumer packaged goods spending, which was impacted by lower commodity prices, timing of product launches and a very tough year-ago comp, which was up more than 20%.
Total circulation and subscription revenues, which accounted for 39% of segment revenues this quarter, declined 6% and were relatively flat in local currency. Dow Jones professional information business had a negative $11 million impact to revenues this quarter or $6 million excluding foreign currencies, an improvement from the sequential prior quarter. We remain encouraged by the underlying trends and the pipeline. We again saw growth in consumer circulation revenues in local currency led by improvement at The Wall Street Journal, which rose nearly 7% and at News Australia, which rose around 4%, largely driven by cover and subscription price increases.
Segment EBITDA decreased $33 million in the quarter or 23% as compared to the prior year period, and adjusted segment EBITDA was down 21%. Included in segment EBITDA was an $8 million negative impact related to higher legal expenses at News America Marketing for the ongoing litigations. And to date, in fiscal 2015, litigation expenses at News America Marketing have totaled around $24 million. This quarter also included roughly $5 million of additional marketing spend at Dow Jones for its currently running Make Time campaign. Total segment cost continued to decline due to the benefits of past restructurings and lower printing and distribution costs. News Corp Australia continues to benefit from cost savings and relatively stable revenues in local currency.
Turning now to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues improved 14% and segment EBITDA grew 6% versus the prior year quarter. Excluding the results from the Harlequin acquisition, which closed on August 1, and foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenues fell 5% versus the prior year and adjusted segment EBITDA declined 8% due to very tough comparisons from the Divergent series in the prior year period. While the Divergent series continued to sell well, this quarter totaling approximately 2.3 million net units, as expected, this was lower than the 8.5 million net units sold in the prior year period, creating a $44 million revenue challenge. Despite that challenge, the core HarperCollins business performed well thanks to the strength of its backlist, most notably Chris Kyle's American Sniper, which sold 2.7 million net units this quarter. Other notable titles included Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, Amy Poehler's Yes Please, as well as continued demand for Sarah Young's Jesus Calling series in Christian publishing.
Total e-book sales for the quarter declined 3% and accounted for 22% of consumer revenues due to the Divergent year-ago comp combined with strong demand in nonfiction this quarter, which historically has had a lower conversion to e-books, which was partially offset by the inclusion of Harlequin. Regarding Harlequin, HarperCollins announced the rebranding of additional foreign language offices in the Netherlands, Japan, Nordic and Poland to add to the previously announced rebranding in Germany and Iberia this quarter. We remain on track with our cost synergy target of $20 million, most of which should be realized in our next fiscal year.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues improved by $3 million or 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Subscription revenues grew 1%, benefiting from higher affiliate fees and increased subscribers. Advertising revenues rose 13%, driven by viewership gains from major events, such as the Cricket World Cup and the Asian Cup, which we didn't have in the prior year period. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was flat despite higher cost and negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenues and EBITDA both increased by 15%.
In Digital Real Estate Services, total segment revenues increased $68 million or 67% and EBITDA declined 21% compared to the prior year period due to foreign currency and the inclusion of Move results. Excluding foreign currency fluctuations, REA's adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA grew 9% and 7%, respectively, as higher depth penetration and pricing was partially offset by lower-listing volume across the Australian market, most notably in March impacted, as Robert said, by the earlier Easter break and elections in 2 states. Please also note that the reported numbers vary from REA's reported numbers due to foreign currency translation as well as differences between Australian IFRS and U.S. GAAP. REA will be issuing their 9 months results under Australian IFRS and in Australian dollars shortly after this call.
Reported segment results also include $73 million in revenues and an EBITDA loss of $9 million from Move. Move's EBITDA loss includes $11 million of stock-based compensation expense related to awards assumed in the acquisition, including acceleration of stock-based compensation resulting from the departures of senior executives. Excluding Move's stock-based comp, EBITDA would have been a positive $3 million this quarter. On a standalone basis, Move's revenue would've grown over 25% versus the prior year quarter led by Connection for Co-Brokerage [ph] product, which grew 130% versus the prior year.
As Robert noted, audience growth at realtor.com continues to accelerate. Average monthly unique users in the third quarter were 39 million, growing 34% versus the prior year including record traffic in April of 44 million unique users. Mobile continues to drive realtor.com traffic growth, up over 71% year-over-year in the quarter. We're very pleased with the product development at realtor.com, which has broadly been in line, if not ahead, of our expectations and are now starting to dial up brand marketing to drive further market share gains.
At Digital Education, revenues were flat with the prior year quarter and segment EBITDA improved $24 million to a loss of $21 million. About $12 million of that improvement was due to the capitalization of software development costs related to our digital ELA learning product with the balance from lower operating expenses.
With respect to earnings from affiliates, Foxtel ended the quarter with around 2.8 million total subscribers, up 7% versus the prior year driven by cable satellite subscribers. Churn declined to a record low of 10.9% from 13.1% in the prior year quarter. Foxtel revenues for the quarter in local currency were up 1% versus the prior year and EBITDA declined mid-teens due to higher sports programming costs related to the acquisition of V8 Supercars and Formula 1 rights, higher fees paid to Fox Sports Australia combined with higher investment in marketing and customer service related to the new pricing and packaging offerings.
Foxtel also incurred additional cost for triple play and Presto, Foxtel's SVOD product. However, these planned investments position Foxtel for sustainable growth, and we believe the results are very encouraging. Subscriber growth remains strong, with total subscribers up 182,000 year-over-year with growth of 85,000 in Q3. Year-to-date, new customer sales are up more than 50% [ph] over the prior period and spin-down volume remains below our expectations.
Turning now to free cash flow. News Corp's cash flow from operations for the 9 months was $702 million compared to $803 million in the prior year, and free cash flow available to News Corp was $391 million compared to $496 million in the prior year. This decline was primarily due to the absence of net receipts related to the foreign tax refund of $73 million received last year, coupled with approximately $45 million of higher deferred compensation payments related to the acquisition of Wireless Generation. To note, foreign currency had a $15 million negative impact to year-to-date available free cash flow. The vast majority of our $2 billion cash on hand at the quarter end is in U.S. dollars.
Let me turn briefly to our current fiscal fourth quarter. While currency is likely to remain a headwind in the short term, we expect to see year-over-year EBITDA improvement in the fourth quarter including, at News and Information Services, we expect to benefit from lower costs at News UK, which last year included severance costs, higher promotional spending around the World Cup and the London relocation. At Dow Jones, we anticipate a sequential improvement in advertising combined with ongoing operating efficiencies. At Book Publishing, the year-ago comp related to Divergent should ease significantly and should benefit from the Harlequin acquisition. Cable Network should benefit from higher subs, partially offset by modestly higher acquisition costs. And at Amplify, we expect to see continued operating expense declines in addition to the amounts capitalized.
So in summary, we remain focused on driving long-term growth and believe News Corp is on the right track. While the ad market has been uneven and currency a clear headwind, we believe the steps we've taken and we're taking, both in reinvestments and operating efficiencies, are positioning the company for long-term growth.
And with that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

In particular, if you look where large companies are spending at least some of their money, there are too many meaningless placements on frivolous sites. And in the end, we're very confident about our mastheads. We're very confident about the power of print. We're also very confident about the halo effect of a masthead in digital formats.

Today, we completed our first 2 years as the new News Corp with a strong finish in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Without being particularly Panglossian, I'm confident in saying that the company is financially stronger and strategically better positioned than when we started our journey. We have aggressively shifted to digital across our businesses through smart and disciplined investments that also expanded our reach . 
Our acquisition of realtor.com signaled a major expansion of our expertise in digital real estate, making us a global leader in the field that we believe has tremendous growth potential in the years ahead.
We have reduced operating costs where appropriate, and we'll continue to be vigilant in that area. 
We returned capital with the declaration of a dividend, and we have been executing on our repurchase program. And we have rigorously reviewed our assets portfolio.
You will see from today's press release that we are very advanced in a strategic review of Amplify, our digital education business. We'll update you on our progress, but our goal is to drive value per share for News Corp shareholders and to ensure our portfolio is a powerful platform for future growth.
First, let me address the financials, on which Bedi will elaborate in a few minutes.  For the year, revenues were $8.6 billion, a 1% increase, while total segment EBITDA was $852 million, up 11% on the prior year.  
These results come despite global and financial instability. Quite obviously, currency headwinds buffeted the business, and in particular, our revenues and EBITDA were affected by 4% and 6% respectively. Even though our company was not unique in being impacted by these macro trends, we were able to deliver free cash flow available to News Corp of $368 million, and we expect healthy free cash flow going forward.
We were optimistic that we would grow segment EBITDA in the fourth quarter. And in fact, reported EBITDA rose by 50% versus the prior year and over 60% on an adjusted basis.
Let me be more specific about some key themes. The reality is that the media landscape is undergoing profound change. The traditional ways of creating and distributing news and information are changing. We are not treading water in the rolling sea of change. We are increasingly determined to gather high-quality data to ensure that our users have the best possible experience, while our advertisers can be confident that our readers have a connection to our content that is particularly strong in its intensity and its affinity, both of which are distinctive in an age of digital promiscuity and digital disloyalty.
We are not simply a collection of unique powerful assets. We are a company with complementary platforms. And what makes our businesses so complementary is how much they have in common, namely, the uncommon power of the news and content in data, data about customers, businesses and markets that is global in scale and precise in its target.  In the coming year, we will be enhancing our ability to deliver customized offerings to our readers, clients and advertisers. Some existing examples indicate the future ahead.
Realtor.com have experienced industry-leading growth in part because of the quality of our real estate news and analyses, which are an important service to anyone in the U.S. contemplating to purchase or sell their property. The moment of moving is a particularly opportune time to influence purchasing decisions. News America marketing has benefited from the precise demographic data that we are able to gather from realtor.com. Our clients know that we are able to identify when families are moving, and that's when they need television, cable contracts or a car for garage.
Checkout 51, the digital coupon company we acquired last month, provides precious information about broad consumer habits, but also about specific purchases. While social media companies attempt to identify the intention of shoppers, we have detailed data about actual actions. We will get purchase from purchases. 
News Australia launched just last week News Connect Powered by Quantum, which will combine News Corp Australia's scale, touching 7.2 million people each day, with a huge database of transaction information who offer customized audiences based on specific buying behaviors.
On our acquisition strategy. During the first 2 years, we've had a clear plan to expand our expertise, build our platforms for our content and our clients. Our first acquisition as the new News was Storyful, the world's first social media news agency. Since that time, this online video pioneer has partnered with Facebook, vice, YouTube and many others to authenticate and to distribute compelling video content that has grown hundreds of millions of views. We expect to see increased integration of Storyful across our master as we build out and distribute native content solutions. It is also a powerful marketing tool for brands and businesses.
In early fiscal '15, we acquired Harlequin, which became part of one of the world's preeminent publishing companies, HarperCollins. Harlequin's global expertise has helped HarperCollins extend its international footprint and provides a platform for growth in many lands and many languages. The virtue of that capability became clear when we won the global Spanish rights for Harper Lee's second novel, Go a Watchman, whose publication in the U.S. was in the book event of the year. 
We completed the acquisition of Move, which operates realtor.com. We have forecast that the mastheads of News Corp would be powerful platforms in driving digital traffic to realtor.com, and that has patently been the case. The site rose from being third place to a clear second and became the fastest growing in the sector. We expect that realtor.com will become an increasingly important platform and profit center of the News Corp. To give you a sense of the scale of the site, we had over 48 million monthly unique visitors in July, each of whom viewed an average of 25 pages.
As we promised at the time of acquisition, the digital networks of News Corp helped turbocharge traffic, which is gaining market share and positioned to be a core pillar of News Corp's future profitability. In fact, we expect to see positive EBITDA this year and further growth in coming years. We ended July with traffic up 43% versus the prior year and more than 70% since our acquisition in November 2014.
News Corp has also invested in other businesses to extend our reach. The REA Group, in which we have a 61.6% stake, bought and increased its own stake in the Southeast Asian online property business, Buy Property. We made moves in India acquiring a stake in Technologies, which owns target.com, a leading digital real estate marketing platform. We also acquired VC Circle, a top digital data, information, training and conferences network, and bigdecisions.com, which helps Indian consumers make informed financial decisions. These are companies that complement each other and our global businesses.
Simply business highlights. At Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal is premier player in financial news. Today we have over 700,000 digital-only subscribers, and we expect that number to rise. Digital is 1/3 of our paid subscriber base at present. We acknowledge that the Journal was underpriced, and we've taken steps to address that through a combination of new rates and flexible packaging. This quarter, circulation revenues of the Journal grew 7%, an impressive rate of growth in this marketplace.  Our ad revenues at the Journal showed strong sequential improvement in the fourth quarter, and early signs for the first quarter of the current year are particularly promising. This trend highlights the increasing importance of market brand and the desirable demographic in a , confusing and sometimes confounding advertising market.
We launched WSJ+ this year, the Wall Street Journal's customers loyalty program. And it's showing traction with nearly 200,000 active members, vastly improving engagement and lowering churn. We've incorporated similar programs across our markets in Australia and the U.K.
We announced new global print editions of Journal to grow our audience and advertising revenues internationally as we focused on key financial hubs and using digital to extend our reach more efficiently in smaller markets. Our team at Dow Jones is continuing to innovate, having just launched Global, a new website which leverages our unique customer base to create a premier international and digital luxury real estate platform in English, Chinese and Spanish.
We saw improvement in the personal information business including favorable trends in risk and compliance, where growth is particularly strong as financial institutions and other companies adapt to tougher regulatory regimes. And we expect continued stability in fiscal 2016.
We need to more aggressively push video and mobile products and expand the engagement with consumers throughout the day. We're empowering video journalists with better tools and integrating the video team with the rest of the news room. We are now implementing the new systems to better and more effectively monetize this valuable inventory. 
HarperCollins Publishers have successfully integrated its acquisition of Harlequin, reducing costs, consolidating international offices and launching more than a dozen authors in multiple languages and countries. The company was able to take advantage of the unexpected surge in interest in American Sniper after the release of the eponymous film as well as the ongoing popularity of the Divergent trilogy. Capping the fiscal year was the announcement of Go Set a Watchman, which sold a record number of copies in its first week and also boosted sales of the legendary To Kill a Mockingbird. 
In Australia, Fox Sports has successfully monetized its first-class roster of sports rights. It's gaining advertising market share and benefiting from Foxtel's new pricing and packaging strategy to drive subscriber growth. 
At Foxtel, we saw a very strong improvement in cable satellite subscribers. And we also expect the rollout of triple play and improved content offerings at Presto, its subscription video on-demand product to be accretive to growth. Foxtel also announced plans to acquire approximately 58% stake in 10 Network Holdings, subject to regulatory approval.
REA continued robust growth in revenue and EBITDA despite some earlier softness in recent volume. It is worth noting that early prospects of fiscal 2016 are encouraging. Growth again accelerated in the fourth quarter, and we are confident in the long-term trajectory and REA extends its footprint, expands into adjacencies and chives premium penetration. 
At News Australia, of particular note was the improved EBITDA in local currency this year, thanks in part to -- measured increases in both cover price and subscription rates, innovative digital offerings and efforts by the sales team to stabilize advertising trends. 
Our leadership team in Australia is continuing to develop our masters, which are powerful platforms for advertisers in print and in digital. They have launched a new pay-per-view in the country and continue the development of news.com.au, which is the country's leading net website. News Corp Australia also launched Think, its own programmatic ad exchange, which we believe will have the most scale with the highest-quality content in the marketplace. And we will continue to invest in products that play to that commercial opportunity. For example, the Australian launch of the Australian Business Review and a premium benefits program for readers, Australian Plus. 
In the U.K., The Times gained market share and revenues through innovative products and new pricing. One of the world's oldest existing newspapers continues to show great strength in the digital age, thanks to high quality journalism and constant innovation.
Advertising remains challenging for a number of our businesses, particularly The Sun in the U.K. We are clearly taking steps to address this issue, including new products to encourage engagement and to help drive higher traffic. We plan a deeper role for our programmatic ad exchange and increased monetization of video and mobile, which we believe are drivers of future growth.
As is the case for all companies with extensive global operations, there has been a significant impact from currency fluctuations, and there will, no doubt, be more volatility in the macroeconomic environment in the current year. Our clear aim, currencies aside, is to pursue our core digital and global strategy, develop our businesses and prudently cut costs to ensure that there is a long-term and meaningful return for our investors.
In conclusion, News Corp has created the evolved from our launch 2 years ago. We are the custodians of a proud tradition, and we are also fashioning a profitable future in an era of profound change. We have had a strategy that is consistent with our message to investors at the time of our separation. We are more digital and more global. And we have begun to execute on our buyback program and announced semiannual cash dividend of $0.10 a share in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 for payment in the second quarter. The decision by the board to pay a dividend is a sign of confidence in the state of our business and faith in our prospects for the future.
We plan to continue our strategy of balancing capital returns with prudent reinvestment that we realize our goal of long-term growth and value creation. With stable revenues, EBITDA growth and robust free cash flow in fiscal 2015, we have real reason to be optimistic about the year ahead, building on our success for the benefit of all our customers, employees and shareholders.
As always, we thank you for your support as we continue this journey together. Now we turn to Bedi for the details of our fourth quarter earnings and some insights into fiscal 2016. Thank you."

We further digitized our asset portfolio, streamlined costs and began to return capital to shareholders. We finished the quarter with strong EBITDA growth, and we believe we are well positioned to build on that success in the year ahead.
Just some key financial highlights for the year, and this included the seamless integration of the Move and Harlequin acquisitions, moderating EBITDA declines at our News and Information Services segment including stabilization at the Dow Jones professional information business and growing consumer circulation revenues, further penetration of our digital subscription and improved pricing, continuing advertising market share gains in Australia, subscriber growth at new pricing in the packaging services and product offering expansion; and initiating a capital return program including the declaration of a semiannual cash dividend and the commencement of share repurchases.
Turning to the financial results. For the full year, we reported revenues of $8.6 billion, a 1.0% increase over the prior year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenue was 1% lower than the prior year. 
We reported full year total segment EBITDA of $852 million, which was an 11% increase versus the prior year.  Reported results included costs related to the U.K. newspaper matters net of indemnification which were $50 million for the year.  Excluding all acquisitions and divestitures, costs related to the U.K. newspaper matters and foreign exchange fluctuations, adjusted total segment EBITDA was up 15% versus the prior year.
As Robert mentioned, we were impacted by currency headwinds throughout the year, primarily due to the weaker Australian dollar. Foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted full year reported revenues by $319 million or 4% and reported segment EBITDA by $39 million or 6%.
Fiscal 2015 reported EPS were a loss of $0.26, which includes an impairment charge at Amplify in fiscal 2015 and restructuring costs. Including the impact of these and other items, our adjusted EPS were $0.47 compared to $0.46 last year. 
And free cash flow available to News Corp was $368 million, modestly higher than the prior year.
Turning to the fourth quarter. The company reported total revenues of $2.14 billion, a 2% decrease versus the prior year period. And our adjusted revenue declined by 1%, similar to the full year rate.
Fiscal fourth quarter total segment EBITDA was $191 million, a 50% increase versus the prior year period. Reported results includes $8 million related to the U.K newspaper matters net of indemnification. Adjusted total segment EBITDA this quarter  grew by 62%. 
Adjusted EPS were $0.07 compared to $0.01 the prior year.
Currency headwinds negatively impacted fourth quarter reported revenues by $168 million or 8% and total reported segment EBITDA by $23 million or 19%.
With that as a brief overview, let's look at our fourth quarter performance for our key segments.
In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter declined $154 million or 10% versus the prior year period. More than 70% of the revenue decline was related to foreign currency. Adjusted segment revenue declined 2%, an improvement from the prior quarter rate.
Within segment revenues, advertising, which was 55% of segment revenues this quarter, declined around 13% or 7% in local currency, a similar rate to both the quarter and the full year.  At the Wall Street Journal, domestic advertising was slightly higher versus the prior year quarter, a notable sequential improvement as we have expected. We saw improvement in technology, science and luxury goods categories.
At News Corp Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined 23% but only 8% in local currency as the market was a bit weaker than the prior 2 quarters. And we saw weakness in some categories including retail, national and auto this quarter.
At News U.K., the advertising revenues remained soft this quarter, relatively similar to last quarter and the year. We saw year-over-year declines across most of segments, particularly the retail, IT and telecom, utilities and automotive. The Sun remains a challenge, and we're continuing to look at additional ways to better monetize our digital offerings and broaden our advertising base.
At News American Marketing, revenue declined 9% versus the prior year due to continued weakness in freestanding inserts, partially offset by growth in advertising.
Total circulation and subscription revenues, which accounted for 38% of segment revenues this quarter, declined 5%, but is up 2% in local currency. Dow Jones professional information business had a negative $7 million impact to revenues this quarter, but was down only $3 million excluding foreign currency impacts, a significant improvement from the prior quarter.
We continue to see growth in consumer circulation revenues, led again by the Wall Street Journal, which grew 7% this quarter thanks to pricing packages.
Segment EBITDA increased $38 million in the quarter or 29% as compared to the prior year period, and adjusted segment EBITDA was up 234%.  We benefited this quarter from a combination of increased operating efficiencies at Dow Jones and at News America marketing, combined with higher prior year costs at News U.K., which have included severance and the World Cup marketing.
One item to note in the U.K. results. The quarter included $11 million onetime charge related to termination of distribution contract as part of our ongoing cost initiatives.
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues increased 8% and segment EBITDA was flat compared to the prior year. Adjusted revenue fell 9% versus the prior year, and adjusted segment EBITDA fell 18% primarily due to difficult year-ago comparisons, which had higher Divergent sales. Total digital revenues for the quarter were 23% of consumer revenues, down from 24% in the prior year, again primarily due to the Divergent year-ago comparisons that's impacted total revenues by almost $22 million this quarter.
In Digital Real Estate Services, total segment revenues increased $76 million or 67% and EBITDA declined $17 million or 27% compared to the prior year period due to foreign currency and the inclusion of Move's results.  Excluding foreign currency fluctuations, RES adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA grew 15% and 18% respectively, an improvement from the prior quarter, driven by higher penetration, even though listing volumes in the market remained below prior year levels. That said, listing volumes have improved in June and July.
The 40% Move results include $81 million in revenue and an EBITDA loss of $15 million for Move, which includes $5 million of stock-based compensation and $7 million in legal fees in the litigation against Zillow.
For the full year, excluding stock-based comp and legal fees, Move was EBITDA net positive.  On a stand-alone basis, Move's revenue would have grown 32% versus the prior year quarter, which is an acceleration from the March quarter. The improvement was led by the products and on listing media revenues benefiting from the successful integration into the Dow Jones programmatic exchange and higher audience levels.
In Cable Network Programming, revenue decreased by $3 million or 2% compared to the prior year quarter. Subscription revenues fell 3% benefiting from higher affiliate fees and increased subscribers, which was more than asset by foreign exchange headwinds. Advertising revenue was flat [indiscernible] with currency. 
Segment EBITDA in the grew 16% despite higher costs and negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenue grew by 15% and adjusted EBITDA by 37%.
At Digital Education, revenues rose compared to the prior year quarter due in part to early grade print hybrid sales. And segment EBITDA improved due to development cost reductions. 
As Robert mentioned, we are in the advanced stages of reviewing alternatives for Amplify. [indiscernible] for the News Corp for our digital curriculum has been disappointing and the marketplace in digital curriculum has been much slower to develop than we initially expected. Additionally, we are no longer accepting new tablet customers, and we'll only be providing service and support to existing customers.
We have reduced our long-range outlook on Amplify, resulting in a noncash impairment charge of $371 million this quarter, and we will keep you undated on further developments.
With respect to earnings from affiliates. Foxtel ended the quarter with over 2.8 million subscribers, up 9% versus the prior year driven by cable satellite subscribers. Churn improved to 9.9% from 12% in the prior year quarter.
Foxtel revenues for the quarter in local currency were up 2% versus the prior year. And EBITDA declined 16% due to higher sports programming costs related to the acquisition and of Formula One race. Our subscriber fees the FOX SPORTS Australia combined with higher support costs related to the new pricing and packaging strategy and triple play.
Subscriber growth remained strong with closing subscribers around 330,000 year-over-year and growth of 94,000 in Q4. We will be including the full Foxtel financials in our 10-K, which we expect to file shortly.
Overall, while the investment, we expect Foxtel to return to EBITDA growth in fiscal '16 in local currency.
Turning to free cash flow. free cash flow available to News Corporation in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 was $368 million compared to $365 million in the prior year. It's worth noting that foreign currency had approximately a $30 million negative impact to our available free cash flow in fiscal '15.
Turning now to a few themes for fiscal '16. At News and Information Services, advertising remains volatile and visibility is limited.  As spending in the U.S. is up versus the prior year, the trends in Australian and the U.K. remain soft. We hope to see more stability in the segment driven by prior year cost initiatives, increased penetration of digital subscribers and continued stabilization of the Dow Jones professional information business.
At Book Publishing, we're very excited about our pipeline for fiscal '16, which was highlighted by the releases in July of Harper Lee's Go Set a Watchman including, as Robert noted, the Spanish rights for Watchman. However, unlike Divergent, Watchman is skewed heavily toward physical books. And given the higher marketing costs and author advance, it will result in more managed [indiscernible]
Regarding Harlequin, we remain on track with our cost synergy targets of $30 million and expect bulk of savings to be realized in fiscal '16. 
At Move, we are very pleased with the progress at realtor.com. While there's still work to be done and we expect to reinvest in marketing and in product development in fiscal '16 to further drive market share, we expect Move to be modestly accretive to reported segment EBITDA in fiscal 2016 and expect to further ramp in fiscal '17, driven by strong audience gains, lead volumes and improved ad inventory monetization.
REA Group, as mentioned on their earnings call yesterday, listing volumes improved in June, and we expect another year of solid growth.
At cable networks, we expect continued solid performance in local currency driven by subscriber revenue growth. In the first half of fiscal '16, programming costs are expected to be higher though due to the inclusion of the Rugby World Cup in September and October.
And for the first quarter of fiscal '16, given that current spot rate for the Australian dollar, we would expect currency headwinds relatively similar to fourth quarter of fiscal '15. Last year, Australian dollar rate was $0.93 for the first quarter. That's $0.20 higher than the current rate.  To help frame the currency impact, our 10-K will be disclosing that the impact of a $0.01 change in the U.S. dollar versus the Australian dollar impacted fiscal 2015 annual revenues by approximately $31 million and total segment EBITDA by approximately $6 million.
CapEx for fiscal '15 was approximately $380 million, which in line with our expectations. And we expect CapEx to be a reduced level in fiscal '16.
And lastly on capital returns. In August 2015, the company declared a semiannual cash dividend of $0.10 per share for Class A common stock and Class B common stock. This dividend is payable on October 21, 2015 with a record date for determining dividend entitlements of September 16, 2015.
To date, we've repurchased about 3 million shares for $45 million and have approximately $455 million remaining under our share purchase authorization. And we continue to view share repurchases as opportunistic.
So in summary, fiscal 2015 was a busy year for News Corp as we balanced ongoing operational efficiencies with prudent investments and strategic acquisitions to expand our global footprint and digital offerings. We initiated a capital return program, and we are in the advanced stages of reviewing our strategic alternatives at Amplify.
Overall, we ended the year with stable revenues, EBITDA growth and significant free cash flow, and we expect that to continue next year.

Today, we completed our first 2 years as the new News Corp, with a strong finish in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Without being particularly Panglossian, I am confident in asserting that the company is financially stronger and strategically better positioned than when we started our journey. We have aggressively shifted to digital across our businesses through smart and disciplined investments that also expanded our reach globally.
Our acquisition of realtor.com signaled a major expansion of our expertise in digital real estate, making us a global leader in a field that we believe has tremendous growth potential in the years ahead.
We have reduced operating costs, where appropriate, and we'll continue to be vigilant in that area. 
We returned capital, with a declaration of a dividend, and we have been executing on our repurchase program. And we have rigorously reviewed our asset portfolio.
You will see from today's press release that we are very advanced in a strategic review of Amplify, our digital education business. We'll update you on our progress, but our goal is to drive value per share for News Corp shareholders and to ensure our portfolio is a powerful platform for future growth.
First, let me address the financials, on which Bedi will elaborate in a few moments.  For the year, revenues were $8.6 billion, a 1% increase, while total segment EBITDA was $852 million, up 11% on the prior year.  These results come despite global and financial instability. Quite obviously, currency headwinds buffeted the business, and in particular, our revenues and EBITDA were affected by 4% and 6%, respectively. 
Even though our company was not unique in being impacted by these macro trends, we were able to deliver free cash flow available to News Corp of $368 million, and we expect healthy free cash flow going forward.
We were optimistic that we would grow segment EBITDA in the fourth quarter. And in fact, reported EBITDA rose by 50% versus the prior year, and over 60% on an adjusted basis.
Let me be more specific about some key themes. The reality is that the media landscape is undergoing profound change. The traditional ways of creating and distributing news and information are changing. We are not treading water in the roiling sea of change. We are increasingly determined to gather high-quality data to ensure that our users have the best possible experience, while our advertisers can be confident that our readers have a connection to our content that is particularly strong in its intensity and its affinity, both of which, are distinctive in an age of digital promiscuity and digital disloyalty.
We are not simply a collection of unique powerful assets, we are a company with complementary platforms. And what makes our businesses so complementary is how much they have in common, namely: the uncommon power of their news and content, and their data, data about customers, businesses and markets, that is global in scale and precise in its targeting. 
In the coming year, we will be enhancing our ability to deliver customized offerings to our readers, clients and advertisers. Some existing examples indicate the future ahead.
realtor.com has experienced industry-leading growth, in part, because of the quality of our real estate news and analysis, which are an important service to anyone in the U.S. contemplating the purchase or the sale of a property. The moment of moving is a particularly opportune time to influence purchasing decisions. 
News America Marketing is benefiting from the precise demographic data that we are able to gather from realtor.com. Our clients know that we are able to identify when families are moving, and that's when they'll need a new television, cable contracts or a car for the garage.
Checkout 51, the digital coupon company we acquired last month, provides precious information about broad consumer habits, but also about specific purchases. While social media companies attempt to identify the intention of shoppers, we have detailed data about actual actions. We will get purchase from purchases. 
News Australia launched just last week News Connect, powered by Quantium, which will combine News Corp Australia's scale, touching 7.2 million people each day, with a huge database of transaction information, who offer customized audiences based on specific buying behaviors.
On our acquisition strategy. During the first 2 years, we've had a clear plan to extend our expertise, build and create powerful platforms for our content and our clients. 
Our first acquisition as the new News was Storyful, the world's first social media news agency. Since that time, this online video pioneer has partnered with Facebook, Vice, YouTube and many others to authenticate and to distribute compelling video content that has drawn hundreds of millions of views. We expect to see increased integration of Storyful across our masthead as we build out and distribute native content solutions. It is also a powerful marketing tool for brands and businesses.
In early fiscal '15, we acquired Harlequin, which became part of one of the world's preeminent publishing houses, HarperCollins. Harlequin's global expertise has helped HarperCollins extend its international footprint and provides a platform for growth in many lands and many languages. The virtue of that capability became clear when we won the global Spanish rights for Harper Lee's second novel, Go Set a Watchman, whose publication in the U.S. was indubitably the book event of the year. 
We completed the acquisition of Move, which operates realtor.com. We had forecast that the mastheads of News Corp would be powerful platforms in driving digital traffic to realtor.com, and that has patently been the case. The site rose from being third place to a clear second, and became the fastest growing in the sector. We expect that realtor.com will become an increasingly important platform and profit center of the News Corp. To give you a sense of the scale of the site, we had over 48 million monthly unique visitors in July, each of whom viewed an average of 25 pages.
As we promised at the time of acquisition, the digital networks of News Corp helped turbocharge traffic, which is gaining market share and is positioned to be a core pillar of News Corp's future profitability. In fact, we expect to see positive EBITDA this year and further growth in coming years. We ended July with traffic up 43% versus the prior year, and more than 70% since our acquisition in November 2014.
News Corp has also invested thoughtfully in other businesses to extend our reach. The REA Group, in which, we have a 61.6% stake, bought and increased its own stake in the Southeast Asian online property business, BuyProperty. We made moves in India, acquiring a stake in Elara Technologies, which owns Prop-Tiger.com, a leading digital real estate marketing platform. We also acquired VCCircle, a top digital data, information, training and conferences network; and BigDecisions.com, which helps Indian consumers make informed financial decisions. These are companies that complement each other and our global businesses.
Some key business highlights. At Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal is the premier player in financial news. Today, we have over 700,000 digital-only subscribers, and we obviously expect that number to rise. Digital is 1/3 of our paid subscriber base at present. We acknowledge that the Journal was underpriced, and we've taken steps to address that through a combination of new rates and flexible packaging. This quarter, circulation revenues of the Journal grew 7%, an impressive rate of growth in this marketplace.  Our ad revenues at the Journal showed strong sequential improvement in the fourth quarter, and early signs for the first quarter of the current year are particularly promising. This trend highlights the increasing importance of a marquee brand and a desirable demographic in a cluttered, confusing and sometimes, confounding advertising market.
We launched WSJ+ this year, the Wall Street Journal's customer loyalty program, and it's showing traction with nearly 200,000 active members, thus, improving engagement and lowering churn. We've incorporated similar programs across our mastheads in Australia and the U.K.
We announced new global print editions of the Journal to grow our audience and advertising revenues internationally, as we focus on key financial hubs and using digital to extend our reach more efficiently in smaller markets. 
Our team at Dow Jones is continuing to innovate, having just launched Mansion Global, a new website which leverages our unique customer base to create a premier international and digital luxury real estate platform in English, Chinese and Spanish.
We saw improvement in the personal information business, including favorable trends in risk and compliance, where growth has particularly strong, as financial institutions and other companies adapt to tougher regulatory regimes. And we expect continued stability in fiscal 2016.
We need to more aggressively push video and mobile products and expand the engagement with consumers throughout the day. We're empowering video journalists with better tools and integrating the video team with the rest of the news room. We are now implementing the new systems to better and more effectively monetize this valuable inventory. 
HarperCollins Publishers has successfully integrated its acquisition of Harlequin, reducing costs, consolidating and opening international offices and launching more than a dozen authors in multiple languages and countries. The company was able to take advantage of the unexpected surge in interest in American Sniper after the release of the eponymous film as well as the ongoing popularity of the Divergent trilogy. Capping the fiscal year was the announcement of Go Set a Watchman, which sold a record number of copies in its first week and also boosted sales of the legendary To Kill a Mockingbird. 
In Australia, Fox Sports has successfully monetized its first-class roster of sports rights. It's gaining advertising market share and benefiting from Foxtel's new pricing and packaging strategy to drive subscriber growth. 
At Foxtel, we saw a very strong improvement in cable satellite subscribers. And we also expect the rollout of triple play and improved content offerings at Presto, its subscription video on-demand product, to be accretive to growth. Foxtel also announced plans to acquire approximately 58% stake in Ten Network Holdings, subject to regulatory approval.
REA continued robust growth in revenue and EBITDA, despite some earlier softness in listing volume. It is worth noting that early prospects of fiscal 2016 are encouraging. Growth again accelerated in the fourth quarter, and we are confident in the long-term trajectory as REA extends its footprint, expands into adjacencies and drives premium penetration. 
At News Australia, of particular note, was the improved EBITDA in local currency this year, thanks in part to measures -- measured increases in both cover price and subscription rates, innovative digital offerings and the efforts by the sales team to stabilize advertising trends. 
Our leadership team in Australia is continuing to develop our mastheads, which are powerful platforms for advertisers in print and in digital. They have launched new apps for our papers around the country and continued the development of news.com.au, which is the country's leading news website. News Corp Australia also launched Think, [ph] its own programmatic ad exchange, which we believe will have the most scale with the highest-quality content in the marketplace. And we will continue to invest in products that play to that commercial opportunity, for example, the Australian launch of the Australian Business Review, and a premium benefits program for readers, The Australian Plus. 
In the U.K., The Times gained market share and revenues through innovative products and new pricing. One of the world's oldest existing newspapers continues to show great strength in the digital age, thanks to high-quality journalism and constant innovation.
Advertising remains challenging for a number of our businesses, particularly The Sun in the U.K. We are clearly taking steps to address this issue, including -- with new products to encourage engagement and to help drive higher traffic. We plan a deeper role for our programmatic ad exchange and increased monetization of video and mobile, which we believe are drivers of future growth.
As is the case for all companies with extensive global operations, there has been a significant impact from currency fluctuations, and there will, no doubt, be more volatility in the macroeconomic environment in the current year. Our clear aim, currencies aside, is to pursue our core digital and global strategy, develop our businesses and prudently cut costs to ensure that there is a long term and meaningful return for our investors.  
In conclusion, News Corp has clearly evolved from our launch 2 years ago. We are the custodians of a proud tradition, and we are also fashioning a profitable future in an era of profound change. We have had a strategy that is consistent with our message to investors at the time of our separation. We are more digital and more global. And we have begun to execute on our buyback program, and a announced semiannual cash dividend of $0.10 a share in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 for payment in the second quarter. The decision by the board to pay a dividend is a sign of confidence in the state of our business and faith in our prospects for the future.
We plan to continue our strategy of balancing capital returns with prudent reinvestment, so that we realize our goal of long-term growth and value creation. With stable revenues, EBITDA growth and robust free cash flow in fiscal 2015, we have real reason to be optimistic about the year ahead, building on our success for the benefit of all our customers, employees and shareholders.
As always, we thank you for your support as we continue this journey together. 
Now we turn to Bedi for the details of our fourth quarter earnings and some insight into fiscal 2016. Thank you."
212741644,306361836,858269,"News Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 12, 2015",2015-08-12,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Robert. News Corp clearly made strong progress in our second full year. We further digitized our asset portfolio, streamlined costs and began to return capital to shareholders.

We further digitized our asset portfolio, streamlined costs and began to return capital to shareholders. We finished the quarter with strong EBITDA growth, and we believe we are well positioned to build on that success in the year ahead.
Just some key financial highlights of the year, and these included the seamless integration of the Move and the Harlequin acquisitions; moderating EBITDA declines at our News and Information Services segment, including stabilization at the Dow Jones professional information business and growing consumer circulation revenues; further penetration of our masthead digital subscriptions and improved pricing; continued advertising market share gains at Fox Sports Australia; successful subscriber growth at Foxtel due to its repricing and repackaging strategy and product offering expansion; and initiating a capital return program, including the declaration of a semiannual cash dividend and the commencement of share repurchases.
Turning to the financial results. For the full year, we reported revenues of $8.6 billion, a 1% increase versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenue was 1% lower than the prior year. 
We reported full year total segment EBITDA of $852 million, which was an 11% increase versus the prior year.  Reported results included costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters, net of indemnification, which were $15 million for the year.  Excluding all acquisitions and divestitures, costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters and foreign exchange fluctuations, adjusted total segment EBITDA was up 15% versus the prior year.
As Robert mentioned, we were impacted by currency headwinds throughout the year, primarily due to the weaker Australian dollar. Foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted full year reported revenues by $319 million or 4% and total reported segment EBITDA by $39 million or 6%.
Fiscal 2015 reported EPS were a loss of $0.26, which includes an impairment charge at Amplify in fiscal 2015 and restructuring costs. Excluding the impact of these and other items, our adjusted EPS were $0.47 compared to $0.46 last year. 
And free cash flow available to News Corp was $368 million, modestly higher than the prior year.
Turning to the fourth quarter. The company reported total revenues of $2.14 billion, a 2% decrease versus the prior year period. And our adjusted revenues declined by 1%, similar to the full year rate.
Fiscal fourth quarter total segment EBITDA was $191 million, a 50% increase versus the prior year period. Reported results includes $8 million related to the U.K Newspaper Matters, net of indemnification. Our adjusted total segment EBITDA this quarter grew by 62%. 
Adjusted EPS were $0.07 compared to $0.01 in the prior year.
Currency headwinds negatively impacted fourth quarter reported revenues by $168 million or 8% and total reported segment EBITDA by $23 million or 19%.
With that as a brief overview, let's look at our fourth quarter performance for our key segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter declined $154 million or 10% versus the prior year period. More than 70% of the revenue decline was related to foreign currency. Adjusted segment revenues declined 2%, an improvement from the prior quarter rate.
Within segment revenues, advertising, which was 55% of segment revenues this quarter, declined around 13%, or 7% in local currency, a similar rate to both the quarter and the full year.  
At the Wall Street Journal, domestic advertising was slightly higher versus the prior year quarter, a notable sequential improvement as we had expected. We saw improvement in technology, science and luxury goods categories.
At News Corp Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined 23%, but only 8% in local currency, as the market growth was a bit weaker than the prior 2 quarters. And we saw weakness in several categories, including retail, national and auto this quarter.
At News U.K., advertising revenues remained soft this quarter, relatively similar to last quarter and the year. We saw year-over-year declines across most of segments, particularly retail, IT and telecom, utilities and automotive. The Sun remains a challenge, and we're continuing to look at additional ways to better monetize our digital offerings and broaden our advertising base.
At News American Marketing, revenues declined 9% versus the prior year quarter, due to continued weakness in freestanding inserts, partially offset by growth in advertising.
Total circulation and subscription revenues, which accounted for 38% of segment revenues this quarter, declined 5%, but was up 2% in local currency. 
Dow Jones professional information business had a negative $7 million impact to revenues this quarter, but was down only $3 million, excluding foreign currency impacts, a significant improvement from the prior quarter.
We continued to see growth in consumer circulation revenues, led again by the Wall Street Journal, which grew 7% this quarter, thanks to new pricing and packages.
Segment EBITDA increased $38 million in the quarter or 29% as compared to the prior year period, and adjusted segment EBITDA was up 34%.  We benefited this quarter from a combination of increased operating efficiencies at Dow Jones and at News America Marketing, combined with higher prior year costs at News U.K., which had included severance and the World Cup marketing.
One item to note in the U.K. results. The quarter included $11 million onetime charge related to termination of a distribution contract as part of our ongoing cost initiatives.
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues increased 8% and segment EBITDA was flat compared to the prior year. Adjusted revenues fell 9% versus the prior year, and adjusted segment EBITDA fell 18%, primarily due to difficult year-ago comparisons, which had higher Divergent sales. Total digital revenues for the quarter were 23% of consumer revenues, down from 24% in the prior year, again, primarily due to the Divergent year-ago comparisons that's impacted total revenues by almost $23 million this quarter.
In Digital Real Estate Services, total segment revenues increased $76 million or 67%, and EBITDA declined $17 million or 27% compared to the prior year period due to foreign currency and the inclusion of Move's results.  
Excluding foreign currency fluctuations, REA's adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA grew 15% and 18%, respectively, an improvement from the prior quarter, driven by higher depth penetration, even though listing volumes for the market remained below prior year levels. That said, listing volumes has improved in June and July.
Reported segment results include $81 million in revenues and an EBITDA loss of $15 million for Move, which includes $5 million of stock-based compensation and $7 million in legal fees for litigation against Zillow.
For the full year, excluding stock-based comp and legal fees, Move was EBITDA net positive.  On a stand-alone basis, Move's revenue would have grown 32% versus the prior year quarter, which is an acceleration from the March quarter. The improvement was led by the co-broke products and on listing media revenues, benefiting from the successful integration into the Dow Jones programmatic exchange and higher audience levels.
In Cable Network Programming, revenue decreased by $3 million or 2% compared to the prior year quarter. Subscription revenues fell 3%, benefiting from higher affiliate fees and increased subscribers, which was more than offset by foreign exchange headwinds. Advertising revenues were flat, but up strongly in local currency. 
Segment EBITDA in this quarter grew 16%, despite higher costs and negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenue grew by 15% and adjusted EBITDA by 37%.
At Digital Education, revenues rose compared with the prior year quarter due, in part, to higher early-grade print hybrid sales. And segment EBITDA improved due to development cost reductions. 
As Robert mentioned, we are in the advanced stages of reviewing alternatives for Amplify. The recent selling season for the new school year for our digital ELA curriculum, all the while, has been disappointing. And the marketplace for digital curriculum has been much slower to develop than we initially expected. Additionally, we are no longer accepting new tablet customers, and we'll only be providing service and support to existing customer.  We have reduced our long-range outlook on Amplify, resulting in a noncash impairment charge of $371 million this quarter, and we will keep you updated on further developments.
With respect to earnings from affiliates. Foxtel ended the quarter with over 2.8 million total subscribers, up 9% versus the prior year, driven by cable satellite subscribers. Churn improved to 9.9% from 12% in the prior year quarter.
Foxtel revenues for the quarter in local currency were up 2% versus the prior year. And EBITDA declined 16% due to higher sports programming costs related to the acquisition of V8 Supercars and Formula One race, higher subscriber fees paid to Fox Sports Australia, combined with higher support costs related to the new pricing and packaging strategy and triple play.
Subscriber growth remained strong, with total subscribers around 330,000 year-over-year and growth of 94,000 in Q4. We will be including full Foxtel financials in our 10-K, which we expect to file shortly.
Overall, while we also saw the year of reinvestment, we expect Foxtel to return to EBITDA growth in fiscal '16 in local currency.
Turning to free cash flow. Free cash flow available to News Corporation in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 was $368 million compared to $365 million in the prior year. It's worth noting that foreign currency had approximately a $30 million negative impact to our available free cash flow in fiscal '15.
Turning now to a few themes for fiscal '16. At News and Information Services, advertising remains volatile and visibility is limited.  Ad spending in the U.S. is up versus the prior year, though trends in Australian and the U.K. remain soft. We hope to see more stability in the segment, driven by prior year cost initiatives, increased penetration of digital subscribers and continued stabilization of the Dow Jones professional information business.
At Book Publishing, we're very excited about our pipeline for fiscal '16, which was highlighted by the releases in July of Harper Lee's Go Set a Watchman including, as Robert noted, the Spanish rights for Watchman. However, unlike Divergent, Watchman is -- will skew heavily towards physical books, and given the higher marketing costs and author advance, it will result in more modest profitability.
Regarding Harlequin, we remain on track with our cost synergy targets of $30 million, and expect the bulk of the savings to be realized in fiscal '16. 
At Move, we are very pleased with the progress at realtor.com. While there's still work to be done and we expect to reinvest in marketing and in product development in fiscal '16 to further drive market share, we expect Move to be modestly accretive to reported segment EBITDA in fiscal 2016 and expect to further ramp in fiscal '17, driven by strong audience gains, lead volumes and improved ad inventory monetization.
REA Group, as mentioned on their earnings call yesterday, listing volume has improved in June, and we expect another year of solid growth.
At cable networks, we expect continued solid performance in local currency, driven by subscriber revenue growth. In the first half of fiscal '16, programming costs are expected to be higher though, due to the inclusion of the Rugby World Cup in September and October.
And for the first quarter of fiscal '16, given the current spot rate for the Australian dollar, we would expect currency headwinds relatively similar to fourth quarter of fiscal '15. Last year, the Australian dollar rate was $0.93 for the first quarter, roughly $0.20 higher than the current rate.  To help frame the currency impact, our 10-K will be disclosing that the impact of a $0.01 change in the U.S. dollar versus the Australian dollar impacted fiscal 2015 annual revenues by approximately $31 million and total segment EBITDA by approximately $6 million.
CapEx for fiscal '15 was approximately $380 million, which was in line with our expectations. And we expect CapEx to be at a reduced level in fiscal '16.
And lastly, on capital returns. In August 2015, the company declared a semiannual cash dividend of $0.10 per share for Class A common stock and Class B common stock. This dividend is payable on October 21, 2015, with a record date for determining dividend entitlements of September 16, 2015.
To date, we've repurchased about 3 million shares for $45 million, and have approximately $455 million remaining under our share purchase authorization. And we continue to view share repurchases as opportunistic.
So in summary, fiscal 2015 was a very busy year for News Corp as we balanced ongoing operational efficiencies with prudent investments and strategic acquisitions to expand our global footprint and digital offerings. We initiated a capital return program, and we are in the advanced stages of reviewing our strategic alternatives at Amplify.
Overall, we ended the year with stable revenues, EBITDA growth and significant free cash flow, and we expect that to continue next year.
With that, let me turn back to the operator for Q&A."

Today, we completed our first 2 years as the new News Corp, with a strong finish in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Without being particularly Panglossian, I am confident in asserting that the company is financially stronger and strategically better positioned than when we started our journey. We have aggressively shifted to digital across our businesses through smart and disciplined investments that also expanded our reach globally.
Our acquisition of realtor.com signaled a major expansion of our expertise in digital real estate, making us a global leader in a field that we believe has tremendous growth potential in the years ahead.
We have reduced operating costs, where appropriate, and we'll continue to be vigilant in that area. 
We returned capital, with a declaration of a dividend, and we have been executing on our repurchase program. And we have rigorously reviewed our asset portfolio.
You will see from today's press release that we are very advanced in a strategic review of Amplify, our digital education business. We'll update you on our progress, but our goal is to drive value per share for News Corp shareholders and to ensure our portfolio is a powerful platform for future growth.
First, let me address the financials, on which Bedi will elaborate in a few moments.  For the year, revenues were $8.6 billion, a 1% increase, while total segment EBITDA was $852 million, up 11% on the prior year.  These results come despite global and financial instability. Quite obviously, currency headwinds buffeted the business, and in particular, our revenues and EBITDA were affected by 4% and 6%, respectively. 
Even though our company was not unique in being impacted by these macro trends, we were able to deliver free cash flow available to News Corp of $368 million, and we expect healthy free cash flow going forward.
We were optimistic that we would grow segment EBITDA in the fourth quarter. And in fact, reported EBITDA rose by 50% versus the prior year, and over 60% on an adjusted basis.
Let me be more specific about some key themes. The reality is that the media landscape is undergoing profound change. The traditional ways of creating and distributing news and information are changing. We are not treading water in the roiling sea of change. We are increasingly determined to gather high-quality data to ensure that our users have the best possible experience, while our advertisers can be confident that our readers have a connection to our content that is particularly strong in its intensity and its affinity, both of which, are distinctive in an age of digital promiscuity and digital disloyalty.
We are not simply a collection of unique powerful assets, we are a company with complementary platforms. And what makes our businesses so complementary is how much they have in common, namely: the uncommon power of their news and content, and their data, data about customers, businesses and markets, that is global in scale and precise in its targeting. 
In the coming year, we will be enhancing our ability to deliver customized offerings to our readers, clients and advertisers. Some existing examples indicate the future ahead.
realtor.com has experienced industry-leading growth, in part, because of the quality of our real estate news and analysis, which are an important service to anyone in the U.S. contemplating the purchase or the sale of a property. The moment of moving is a particularly opportune time to influence purchasing decisions. 
News America Marketing is benefiting from the precise demographic data that we are able to gather from realtor.com. Our clients know that we are able to identify when families are moving, and that's when they'll need a new television, cable contracts or a car for the garage.
Checkout 51, the digital coupon company we acquired last month, provides precious information about broad consumer habits, but also about specific purchases. While social media companies attempt to identify the intention of shoppers, we have detailed data about actual actions. We will get purchase from purchases. 
News Australia launched just last week News Connect, powered by Quantium, which will combine News Corp Australia's scale, touching 7.2 million people each day, with a huge database of transaction information, who offer customized audiences based on specific buying behaviors.
On our acquisition strategy. During the first 2 years, we've had a clear plan to extend our expertise, build and create powerful platforms for our content and our clients. 
Our first acquisition as the new News was Storyful, the world's first social media news agency. Since that time, this online video pioneer has partnered with Facebook, Vice, YouTube and many others to authenticate and to distribute compelling video content that has drawn hundreds of millions of views. We expect to see increased integration of Storyful across our masthead as we build out and distribute native content solutions. It is also a powerful marketing tool for brands and businesses.
In early fiscal '15, we acquired Harlequin, which became part of one of the world's preeminent publishing houses, HarperCollins. Harlequin's global expertise has helped HarperCollins extend its international footprint and provides a platform for growth in many lands and many languages. The virtue of that capability became clear when we won the global Spanish rights for Harper Lee's second novel, Go Set a Watchman, whose publication in the U.S. was indubitably the book event of the year. 
We completed the acquisition of Move, which operates realtor.com. We had forecast that the mastheads of News Corp would be powerful platforms in driving digital traffic to realtor.com, and that has patently been the case. The site rose from being third place to a clear second, and became the fastest growing in the sector. We expect that realtor.com will become an increasingly important platform and profit center of the News Corp. To give you a sense of the scale of the site, we had over 48 million monthly unique visitors in July, each of whom viewed an average of 25 pages.
As we promised at the time of acquisition, the digital networks of News Corp helped turbocharge traffic, which is gaining market share and is positioned to be a core pillar of News Corp's future profitability. In fact, we expect to see positive EBITDA this year and further growth in coming years. We ended July with traffic up 43% versus the prior year, and more than 70% since our acquisition in November 2014.
News Corp has also invested thoughtfully in other businesses to extend our reach. The REA Group, in which, we have a 61.6% stake, bought and increased its own stake in the Southeast Asian online property business, BuyProperty. We made moves in India, acquiring a stake in Elara Technologies, which owns Prop-Tiger.com, a leading digital real estate marketing platform. We also acquired VCCircle, a top digital data, information, training and conferences network; and BigDecisions.com, which helps Indian consumers make informed financial decisions. These are companies that complement each other and our global businesses.
Some key business highlights. At Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal is the premier player in financial news. Today, we have over 700,000 digital-only subscribers, and we obviously expect that number to rise. Digital is 1/3 of our paid subscriber base at present. We acknowledge that the Journal was underpriced, and we've taken steps to address that through a combination of new rates and flexible packaging. This quarter, circulation revenues of the Journal grew 7%, an impressive rate of growth in this marketplace.  Our ad revenues at the Journal showed strong sequential improvement in the fourth quarter, and early signs for the first quarter of the current year are particularly promising. This trend highlights the increasing importance of a marquee brand and a desirable demographic in a cluttered, confusing and sometimes, confounding advertising market.
We launched WSJ+ this year, the Wall Street Journal's customer loyalty program, and it's showing traction with nearly 200,000 active members, thus, improving engagement and lowering churn. We've incorporated similar programs across our mastheads in Australia and the U.K.
We announced new global print editions of the Journal to grow our audience and advertising revenues internationally, as we focus on key financial hubs and using digital to extend our reach more efficiently in smaller markets. 
Our team at Dow Jones is continuing to innovate, having just launched Mansion Global, a new website which leverages our unique customer base to create a premier international and digital luxury real estate platform in English, Chinese and Spanish.
We saw improvement in the personal information business, including favorable trends in risk and compliance, where growth has particularly strong, as financial institutions and other companies adapt to tougher regulatory regimes. And we expect continued stability in fiscal 2016.
We need to more aggressively push video and mobile products and expand the engagement with consumers throughout the day. We're empowering video journalists with better tools and integrating the video team with the rest of the news room. We are now implementing the new systems to better and more effectively monetize this valuable inventory. 
HarperCollins Publishers has successfully integrated its acquisition of Harlequin, reducing costs, consolidating and opening international offices and launching more than a dozen authors in multiple languages and countries. The company was able to take advantage of the unexpected surge in interest in American Sniper after the release of the eponymous film as well as the ongoing popularity of the Divergent trilogy. Capping the fiscal year was the announcement of Go Set a Watchman, which sold a record number of copies in its first week and also boosted sales of the legendary To Kill a Mockingbird. 
In Australia, Fox Sports has successfully monetized its first-class roster of sports rights. It's gaining advertising market share and benefiting from Foxtel's new pricing and packaging strategy to drive subscriber growth. 
At Foxtel, we saw a very strong improvement in cable satellite subscribers. And we also expect the rollout of triple play and improved content offerings at Presto, its subscription video on-demand product, to be accretive to growth. Foxtel also announced plans to acquire approximately 15% stake in Ten Network Holdings, subject to regulatory approval.
REA continued robust growth in revenue and EBITDA, despite some earlier softness in listing volume. It is worth noting that early prospects of fiscal 2016 are encouraging. Growth again accelerated in the fourth quarter, and we are confident in the long-term trajectory as REA extends its footprint, expands into adjacencies and drives premium penetration. 
At News Australia, of particular note, was the improved EBITDA in local currency this year, thanks in part to measures -- measured increases in both cover price and subscription rates, innovative digital offerings and the efforts by the sales team to stabilize advertising trends. 
Our leadership team in Australia is continuing to develop our mastheads, which are powerful platforms for advertisers in print and in digital. They have launched new apps for our papers around the country and continued the development of news.com.au, which is the country's leading news website. News Corp Australia also launched Think, [ph] its own programmatic ad exchange, which we believe will have the most scale with the highest-quality content in the marketplace. And we will continue to invest in products that play to that commercial opportunity, for example, the Australian launch of the Australian Business Review, and a premium benefits program for readers, The Australian Plus. 
In the U.K., The Times gained market share and revenues through innovative products and new pricing. One of the world's oldest existing newspapers continues to show great strength in the digital age, thanks to high-quality journalism and constant innovation.
Advertising remains challenging for a number of our businesses, particularly The Sun in the U.K. We are clearly taking steps to address this issue, including -- with new products to encourage engagement and to help drive higher traffic. We plan a deeper role for our programmatic ad exchange and increased monetization of video and mobile, which we believe are drivers of future growth.
As is the case for all companies with extensive global operations, there has been a significant impact from currency fluctuations, and there will, no doubt, be more volatility in the macroeconomic environment in the current year. Our clear aim, currencies aside, is to pursue our core digital and global strategy, develop our businesses and prudently cut costs to ensure that there is a long term and meaningful return for our investors.  
In conclusion, News Corp has clearly evolved from our launch 2 years ago. We are the custodians of a proud tradition, and we are also fashioning a profitable future in an era of profound change. We have had a strategy that is consistent with our message to investors at the time of our separation. We are more digital and more global. And we have begun to execute on our buyback program, and a announced semiannual cash dividend of $0.10 a share in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 for payment in the second quarter. The decision by the board to pay a dividend is a sign of confidence in the state of our business and faith in our prospects for the future.
We plan to continue our strategy of balancing capital returns with prudent reinvestment, so that we realize our goal of long-term growth and value creation. With stable revenues, EBITDA growth and robust free cash flow in fiscal 2015, we have real reason to be optimistic about the year ahead, building on our success for the benefit of all our customers, employees and shareholders.
As always, we thank you for your support as we continue this journey together. 
Now we turn to Bedi for the details of our fourth quarter earnings and some insight into fiscal 2016. Thank you."
212741644,306361836,858303,"News Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 12, 2015",2015-08-12,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Robert. News Corp clearly made strong progress in our second full year. We further digitized our asset portfolio, streamlined costs and began to return capital to shareholders. We finished the quarter with strong EBITDA growth, and we believe w",2156,"Thank you, Robert. News Corp clearly made strong progress in our second full year. We further digitized our asset portfolio, streamlined costs and began to return capital to shareholders. We finished the quarter with strong EBITDA growth, and we believe we are well positioned to build on that success in the year ahead.
Just some key financial highlights of the year, and these included the seamless integration of the Move and the Harlequin acquisitions; moderating EBITDA declines at our News and Information Services segment, including stabilization at the Dow Jones professional information business and growing consumer circulation revenues; further penetration of our masthead digital subscriptions and improved pricing; continued advertising market share gains at Fox Sports Australia; successful subscriber growth at Foxtel due to its repricing and repackaging strategy and product offering expansion; and initiating a capital return program, including the declaration of a semiannual cash dividend and the commencement of share repurchases.
Turning to the financial results. For the full year, we reported revenues of $8.6 billion, a 1% increase versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenue was 1% lower than the prior year. 
We reported full year total segment EBITDA of $852 million, which was an 11% increase versus the prior year.  Reported results included costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters, net of indemnification, which were $50 million for the year.  Excluding all acquisitions and divestitures, costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters and foreign exchange fluctuations, adjusted total segment EBITDA was up 15% versus the prior year.
As Robert mentioned, we were impacted by currency headwinds throughout the year, primarily due to the weaker Australian dollar. Foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted full year reported revenues by $319 million or 4% and total reported segment EBITDA by $39 million or 6%.
Fiscal 2015 reported EPS were a loss of $0.26, which includes an impairment charge at Amplify in fiscal 2015 and restructuring costs. Excluding the impact of these and other items, our adjusted EPS were $0.47 compared to $0.46 last year. 
And free cash flow available to News Corp was $368 million, modestly higher than the prior year.
Turning to the fourth quarter. The company reported total revenues of $2.14 billion, a 2% decrease versus the prior year period. And our adjusted revenues declined by 1%, similar to the full year rate.
Fiscal fourth quarter total segment EBITDA was $191 million, a 50% increase versus the prior year period. Reported results includes $8 million related to the U.K Newspaper Matters, net of indemnification. Our adjusted total segment EBITDA this quarter grew by 62%. 
Adjusted EPS were $0.07 compared to $0.01 in the prior year.
Currency headwinds negatively impacted fourth quarter reported revenues by $168 million or 8% and total reported segment EBITDA by $23 million or 19%.
With that as a brief overview, let's look at our fourth quarter performance for our key segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter declined $154 million or 10% versus the prior year period. More than 70% of the revenue decline was related to foreign currency. Adjusted segment revenues declined 2%, an improvement from the prior quarter rate.
Within segment revenues, advertising, which was 55% of segment revenues this quarter, declined around 13%, or 7% in local currency, a similar rate to both the quarter and the full year.  
At the Wall Street Journal, domestic advertising was slightly higher versus the prior year quarter, a notable sequential improvement as we had expected. We saw improvement in technology, science and luxury goods categories.
At News Corp Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined 23%, but only 8% in local currency, as the marketplace was a bit weaker than the prior 2 quarters. And we saw weakness in several categories, including retail, national and auto this quarter.
At News U.K., advertising revenues remained soft this quarter, relatively similar to last quarter and the year. We saw year-over-year declines across most of segments, particularly retail, IT and telecom, utilities and automotive. The Sun remains a challenge, and we're continuing to look at additional ways to better monetize our digital offerings and broaden our advertising base.
At News American Marketing, revenues declined 9% versus the prior year quarter, due to continued weakness in freestanding inserts, partially offset by growth in-store advertising.
Total circulation and subscription revenues, which accounted for 38% of segment revenues this quarter, declined 5%, but was up 2% in local currency. 
Dow Jones professional information business had a negative $7 million impact to revenues this quarter, but was down only $3 million, excluding foreign currency impacts, a significant improvement from the prior quarter.
We continued to see growth in consumer circulation revenues, led again by the Wall Street Journal, which grew 7% this quarter, thanks to new pricing and packages.
Segment EBITDA increased $38 million in the quarter or 29% as compared to the prior year period, and adjusted segment EBITDA was up 34%.  We benefited this quarter from a combination of increased operating efficiencies at Dow Jones and at News America Marketing, combined with higher prior year costs at News U.K., which had included severance and the World Cup marketing.
One item to note in the U.K. results. The quarter included $11 million onetime charge related to termination of a distribution contract as part of our ongoing cost reduction initiatives.
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues increased 8% and segment EBITDA was flat compared to the prior year. Adjusted revenues fell 9% versus the prior year, and adjusted segment EBITDA fell 18%, primarily due to difficult year-ago comparisons, which had higher Divergent sales. Total digital revenues for the quarter were 23% of consumer revenues, down from 24% in the prior year, again, primarily due to the Divergent year-ago comparisons that's impacted total revenues by almost $23 million this quarter.
In Digital Real Estate Services, total segment revenues increased $76 million or 67%, and EBITDA declined $17 million or 27% compared to the prior year period due to foreign currency and the inclusion of Move's results.  
Excluding foreign currency fluctuations, REA's adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA grew 15% and 18%, respectively, an improvement from the prior quarter, driven by higher depth penetration, even though listing volumes for the market remained below prior year levels. That said, listing volumes has improved in June and July.
Reported segment results include $81 million in revenues and an EBITDA loss of $15 million for Move, which includes $5 million of stock-based compensation and $7 million in legal fees for litigation against Zillow.
For the full year, excluding stock-based comp and legal fees, Move was EBITDA net positive.  On a stand-alone basis, Move's revenue would have grown 32% versus the prior year quarter, which is an acceleration from the March quarter. The improvement was led by the co-broke products and on listing media revenues, benefiting from the successful integration into the Dow Jones programmatic exchange and higher audience levels.
In Cable Network Programming, revenue decreased by $3 million or 2% compared to the prior year quarter. Subscription revenues fell 3%, benefiting from higher affiliate fees and increased subscribers, which was more than offset by foreign exchange headwinds. Advertising revenues were flat, but up strongly in local currency. 
Segment EBITDA in this quarter grew 16%, despite higher costs and negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenue grew by 15% and adjusted EBITDA by 37%.
At Digital Education, revenues rose compared with the prior year quarter due, in part, to higher early-grade print hybrid sales. And segment EBITDA improved due to development cost reductions. 
As Robert mentioned, we are in the advanced stages of reviewing strategic alternatives for Amplify. The recent selling season for the new school year for our digital ELA curriculum, overall, has been disappointing. And the marketplace for digital curriculum has been much slower to develop than we initially expected. Additionally, we are no longer accepting new tablet customers, and we'll only be providing service and support to existing customers.  We have reduced our long-range outlook on Amplify, resulting in a noncash impairment charge of $371 million this quarter, and we will keep you updated on further developments.
With respect to earnings from affiliates. Foxtel ended the quarter with over 2.8 million total subscribers, up 9% versus the prior year, driven by cable satellite subscribers. Churn improved to 9.9% from 12% in the prior year quarter.
Foxtel revenues for the quarter in local currency were up 2% versus the prior year. And EBITDA declined 16% due to higher sports programming costs related to the acquisition of V8 Supercars and Formula One rights, higher subscriber fees paid to Fox Sports Australia, combined with higher support costs related to the new pricing and packaging strategy and triple play.
Subscriber growth remained strong, with total subscribers around 330,000 year-over-year and growth of 94,000 in Q4. We will be including full Foxtel financials in our 10-K, which we expect to file shortly.
Overall, while we also saw the year of reinvestment, we expect Foxtel to return to EBITDA growth in fiscal '16 in local currency.
Turning to free cash flow. Free cash flow available to News Corporation in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 was $368 million compared to $365 million in the prior year. It's worth noting that foreign currency had approximately a $30 million negative impact to our available free cash flow in fiscal '15.
Turning now to a few themes for fiscal '16. At News and Information Services, advertising remains volatile and visibility is limited.  Ad spending in the U.S. is up versus the prior year, though trends in Australia and the U.K. remain soft. We hope to see more stability in the segment, driven by prior year cost initiatives, increased penetration of digital subscribers and continued stabilization of the Dow Jones professional information business.
At Book Publishing, we're very excited about our pipeline for fiscal '16, which was highlighted by the releases in July of Harper Lee's Go Set a Watchman including, as Robert noted, the Spanish rights for Watchman. However, unlike Divergent, Watchman is -- will skew heavily towards physical books, and given the higher marketing costs and author advance, it will result in more modest profitability.
Regarding Harlequin, we remain on track with our cost synergy targets of $30 million, and expect the bulk of the savings to be realized in fiscal '16. 
At Move, we are very pleased with the progress at realtor.com. While there's still work to be done and we expect to reinvest in marketing and in product development in fiscal '16 to further drive market share, we expect Move to be modestly accretive to reported segment EBITDA in fiscal 2016 and expect to further ramp in fiscal '17, driven by strong audience gains, lead volumes and improved ad inventory monetization.
REA Group, as mentioned on their earnings call yesterday, listing volume has improved in June, and we expect another year of solid growth.
At cable networks, we expect continued solid performance in local currency, driven by subscriber revenue growth. In the first half of fiscal '16, programming costs are expected to be higher though, due to the inclusion of the Rugby World Cup in September and October.
And for the first quarter of fiscal '16, given the current spot rate for the Australian dollar, we would expect currency headwinds relatively similar to fourth quarter of fiscal '15. Last year, the Australian dollar rate was $0.93 for the first quarter, roughly $0.20 higher than the current rate.  To help frame the currency impact, our 10-K will be disclosing that the impact of a $0.01 change in the U.S. dollar versus the Australian dollar impacted fiscal 2015 annual revenues by approximately $31 million and total segment EBITDA by approximately $6 million.
CapEx for fiscal '15 was approximately $380 million, which was in line with our expectations. And we expect CapEx to be at a reduced level in fiscal '16.
And lastly, on capital returns. In August 2015, the company declared a semiannual cash dividend of $0.10 per share for Class A common stock and Class B common stock. This dividend is payable on October 21, 2015, with a record date for determining dividend entitlements of September 16, 2015.
To date, we've repurchased about 3 million shares for $45 million, and have approximately $455 million remaining under our share purchase authorization. And we continue to view share repurchases as opportunistic.
So in summary, fiscal 2015 was a very busy year for News Corp as we balanced ongoing operational efficiencies with prudent investments and strategic acquisitions to expand our global footprint and digital offerings. We initiated a capital return program, and we are in the advanced stages of reviewing our strategic alternatives at Amplify.
Overall, we ended the year with stable revenues, EBITDA growth and significant free cash flow, and we expect that to continue next year.
With that, let me turn back to the operator for Q&A."

What's particularly gratifying, apart from the great work that Ryan O’Hara and the team are doing at realtor, is that the audience growth rate is continuing to increase. And so if you look at our mobile audience, which is clearly key in the contemporary environment, in June, that was up 79% year-on-year.

We have completed our first 2 years as the new News Corp, with a strong finish in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Without being particularly Panglossian, I am confident in asserting that the company is financially stronger and strategically better positioned than when we started our journey. We have aggressively shifted to digital across our businesses through smart and disciplined investments that also expanded our reach globally.
Our acquisition of realtor.com signaled a major expansion of our expertise in digital real estate, making us a global leader in a field that we believe has tremendous growth potential in the years ahead.
We have reduced operating costs, where appropriate, and we'll continue to be vigilant in that area. 
We returned capital, with a declaration of a dividend, and we have been executing on our repurchase program. And we have rigorously reviewed our asset portfolio.
You will see from today's press release that we are very advanced in a strategic review of Amplify, our digital education business. We'll update you on our progress, but our goal is to drive value per share for News Corp shareholders and to ensure our portfolio is a powerful platform for future growth.
First, let me address the financials, on which Bedi will elaborate in a few moments.  For the year, revenues were $8.6 billion, a 1% increase, while total segment EBITDA was $852 million, up 11% on the prior year.  These results come despite global and financial instability. Quite obviously, currency headwinds buffeted the business, and in particular, our revenues and EBITDA were affected by 4% and 6%, respectively. 
Even though our company was not unique in being impacted by these macro trends, we were able to deliver free cash flow available to News Corp of $368 million, and we expect healthy free cash flow going forward.
We were optimistic that we would grow segment EBITDA in the fourth quarter. And in fact, reported EBITDA rose by 50% versus the prior year, and over 60% on an adjusted basis.
Let me be more specific about some key themes. The reality is that the media landscape is undergoing profound change. The traditional ways of creating and distributing news and information are changing. We are not treading water in the roiling sea of change. We are increasingly determined to gather high-quality data to ensure that our users have the best possible experience, while our advertisers can be confident that our readers have a connection to our content that is particularly strong in its intensity and its affinity, both of which, are distinctive in an age of digital promiscuity and digital disloyalty.
We are not simply a collection of unique powerful assets, we are a company with complementary platforms. And what makes our businesses so complementary is how much they have in common, namely: the uncommon power of their news and content, and their data, data about customers, businesses and markets, that is global in scale and precise in its targeting. 
In the coming year, we will be enhancing our ability to deliver customized offerings to our readers, clients and advertisers. Some existing examples indicate the future ahead.
realtor.com has experienced industry-leading growth, in part, because of the quality of our real estate news and analysis, which are an important service to anyone in the U.S. contemplating the purchase or the sale of a property. The moment of moving is a particularly opportune time to influence purchasing decisions. 
News America Marketing is benefiting from the precise demographic data that we are able to gather from realtor.com. Our clients know that we are able to identify when families are moving, and that's when they'll need a new television, cable contracts or a car for the garage.
Checkout 51, the digital coupon company we acquired last month, provides precious information about broad consumer habits, but also about specific purchases. While social media companies attempt to identify the intention of shoppers, we have detailed data about actual actions. We will get purchase from purchases. 
News Australia launched just last week News Connect, powered by Quantium, which will combine News Corp Australia's scale, touching 7.2 million people each day, with a huge database of transaction information, who offer customized audiences based on specific buying behaviors.
On our acquisition strategy. During the first 2 years, we've had a clear plan to extend our expertise, build and create powerful platforms for our content and our clients. 
Our first acquisition as the new News was Storyful, the world's first social media news agency. Since that time, this online video pioneer has partnered with Facebook, Vice, YouTube and many others to authenticate and to distribute compelling video content that has drawn hundreds of millions of views. We expect to see increased integration of Storyful across our masthead as we build out and distribute native content solutions. It is also a powerful marketing tool for brands and businesses.
In early fiscal '15, we acquired Harlequin, which became part of one of the world's preeminent publishing houses, HarperCollins. Harlequin's global expertise has helped HarperCollins extend its international footprint and provides a platform for growth in many lands and many languages. The virtue of that capability became clear when we won the global Spanish rights for Harper Lee's second novel, Go Set a Watchman, whose publication in the U.S. was indubitably the book event of the year. 
We completed the acquisition of Move, which operates realtor.com. We had forecast that the mastheads of News Corp would be powerful platforms in driving digital traffic to realtor.com, and that has patently been the case. The site rose from being third place to a clear second, and became the fastest growing in the sector. We expect that realtor.com will become an increasingly important platform and profit center of the News Corp. To give you a sense of the scale of the site, we had over 48 million monthly unique visitors in July, each of whom viewed an average of 25 pages.
As we promised at the time of acquisition, the digital networks of News Corp helped turbocharge traffic, which is gaining market share and is positioned to be a core pillar of News Corp's future profitability. In fact, we expect to see positive EBITDA this year and further growth in coming years. We ended July with traffic up 43% versus the prior year, and more than 70% since our acquisition in November 2014.
News Corp has also invested thoughtfully in other businesses to extend our reach. The REA Group, in which, we have a 61.6% stake, bought and increased its own stake in the Southeast Asian online property business, iProperty. We made moves in India, acquiring a stake in Elara Technologies, which owns PropTiger.com, a leading digital real estate marketing platform. We also acquired VCCircle, a top digital data, information, training and conferences network; and BigDecisions.com, which helps Indian consumers make informed financial decisions. These are companies that complement each other and our global businesses.
Some key business highlights. At Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal is the premier player in financial news. Today, we have over 700,000 digital-only subscribers, and we obviously expect that number to rise. Digital is 1/3 of our paid subscriber base at present. We acknowledge that the Journal was underpriced, and we've taken steps to address that through a combination of new rates and flexible packaging. This quarter, circulation revenues of the Journal grew 7%, an impressive rate of growth in this marketplace.  Our ad revenues at the Journal showed strong sequential improvement in the fourth quarter, and early signs for the first quarter of the current year are particularly promising. This trend highlights the increasing importance of a marquee brand and a desirable demographic in a cluttered, confusing and sometimes, confounding advertising market.
We launched WSJ+ this year, the Wall Street Journal's customer loyalty program, and it's showing traction with nearly 200,000 active members, thus, improving engagement and lowering churn. We've incorporated similar programs across our mastheads in Australia and the U.K.
We announced new global print editions of the Journal to grow our audience and advertising revenues internationally, as we focus on key financial hubs and using digital to extend our reach more efficiently in smaller markets. 
Our team at Dow Jones is continuing to innovate, having just launched Mansion Global, a new website which leverages our unique customer base to create a premier international and digital luxury real estate platform in English, Chinese and Spanish.
We saw improvement in the professional information business, including favorable trends in risk and compliance, where growth has particularly strong, as financial institutions and other companies adapt to tougher regulatory regimes. And we expect continued stability in fiscal 2016.
We need to more aggressively push video and mobile products and expand the engagement with consumers throughout the day. We're empowering video journalists with better tools and integrating the video team with the rest of the news room. We are now implementing the new systems to better and more effectively monetize this valuable inventory. 
HarperCollins Publishers has successfully integrated its acquisition of Harlequin, reducing costs, consolidating and opening international offices and launching more than a dozen authors in multiple languages and countries. The company was able to take advantage of the unexpected surge in interest in American Sniper after the release of the eponymous film as well as the ongoing popularity of the Divergent trilogy. Capping the fiscal year was the announcement of Go Set a Watchman, which sold a record number of copies in its first week and also boosted sales of the legendary To Kill a Mockingbird. 
In Australia, Fox Sports has successfully monetized its first-class roster of sports rights. It's gaining advertising market share and benefiting from Foxtel's new pricing and packaging strategy to drive subscriber growth. 
At Foxtel, we saw a very strong improvement in cable satellite subscribers. And we also expect the rollout of triple play and improved content offerings at Presto, its subscription video on-demand product, to be accretive to growth. Foxtel also announced plans to acquire approximately 15% stake in Ten Network Holdings, subject to regulatory approval.
REA continued robust growth in revenue and EBITDA, despite some earlier softness in listing volume. It is worth noting that early prospects of fiscal 2016 are encouraging. Growth again accelerated in the fourth quarter, and we are confident in the long-term trajectory as REA extends its footprint, expands into adjacencies and drives premium penetration. 
At News Australia, of particular note, was the improved EBITDA in local currency this year, thanks in part to measures -- measured increases in both cover price and subscription rates, innovative digital offerings and the efforts by the sales team to stabilize advertising trends. 
Our leadership team in Australia is continuing to develop our mastheads, which are powerful platforms for advertisers in print and in digital. They have launched new apps for our papers around the country and continued the development of news.com.au, which is the country's leading news website. News Corp Australia also launched Think [ph] its own programmatic ad exchange, which we believe will have the most scale with the highest-quality content in the marketplace. And we will continue to invest in products that play to that commercial opportunity, for example, the Australian launch of the Australian Business Review, and a premium benefits program for readers, The Australian Plus. 
In the U.K., The Times gained market share and revenues through innovative products and new pricing. One of the world's oldest existing newspapers continues to show great strength in the digital age, thanks to high-quality journalism and constant innovation.
Advertising remains challenging for a number of our businesses, particularly The Sun in the U.K. We are clearly taking steps to address this issue, including -- with new products to encourage engagement and to help drive higher traffic. We plan a deeper role for our programmatic ad exchange and increased monetization of video and mobile, which we believe are drivers of future growth.
As is the case for all companies with extensive global operations, there has been a significant impact from currency fluctuations, and there will, no doubt, be more volatility in the macroeconomic environment in the current year. Our clear aim, currencies aside, is to pursue our core digital and global strategy, develop our businesses and prudently cut costs to ensure that there is a long term and meaningful return for our investors.  
In conclusion, News Corp has clearly evolved from our launch 2 years ago. We are the custodians of a proud tradition, and we are also fashioning a profitable future in an era of profound change. We have had a strategy that is consistent with our message to investors at the time of our separation. We are more digital and more global. And we have begun to execute on our buyback program, and announced a semiannual cash dividend of $0.10 a share in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 for payment in the second quarter. The decision by the board to pay a dividend is a sign of confidence in the state of our business and faith in our prospects for the future.
We plan to continue our strategy of balancing capital returns with prudent reinvestment, so that we realize our goal of long-term growth and value creation. With stable revenues, EBITDA growth and robust free cash flow in fiscal 2015, we have real reason to be optimistic about the year ahead, building on our success for the benefit of all our customers, employees and shareholders.
As always, we thank you for your support as we continue this journey together. 
Now we turn to Bedi for the details of our fourth quarter earnings and some insight into fiscal 2016. Thank you."

Just some key financial highlights of the year, and these included the seamless integration of the Move and the Harlequin acquisitions; moderating EBITDA declines at our News and Information Services segment, including stabilization at the Dow Jones professional information business and growing consumer circulation revenues; further penetration of our masthead digital subscriptions and improved pricing; continued advertising market share gains at Fox Sports Australia; successful subscriber growth at Foxtel due to its repricing and repackaging strategy and product offering expansion; and initiating a capital return program, including the declaration of a semiannual cash dividend and the commencement of share repurchases.
Turning to the financial results. For the full year, we reported revenues of $8.6 billion, a 1% increase versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenue was 1% lower than the prior year. 
We reported full year total segment EBITDA of $852 million, which was an 11% increase versus the prior year.  Reported results included costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters, net of indemnification, which were $50 million for the year.  Excluding all acquisitions and divestitures, costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters and foreign exchange fluctuations, adjusted total segment EBITDA was up 15% versus the prior year.
As Robert mentioned, we were impacted by currency headwinds throughout the year, primarily due to the weaker Australian dollar. Foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted full year reported revenues by $319 million or 4% and total reported segment EBITDA by $39 million or 6%.
Fiscal 2015 reported EPS were a loss of $0.26, which includes an impairment charge at Amplify in fiscal 2015 and restructuring costs. Excluding the impact of these and other items, our adjusted EPS were $0.47 compared to $0.46 last year. 
And free cash flow available to News Corp was $368 million, modestly higher than the prior year.
Turning to the fourth quarter. The company reported total revenues of $2.14 billion, a 2% decrease versus the prior year period. And our adjusted revenues declined by 1%, similar to the full year rate.
Fiscal fourth quarter total segment EBITDA was $191 million, a 50% increase versus the prior year period. Reported results includes $8 million related to the U.K Newspaper Matters, net of indemnification. Our adjusted total segment EBITDA this quarter grew by 62%. 
Adjusted EPS were $0.07 compared to $0.01 in the prior year.
Currency headwinds negatively impacted fourth quarter reported revenues by $168 million or 8% and total reported segment EBITDA by $23 million or 19%.
With that as a brief overview, let's look at our fourth quarter performance for our key segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter declined $154 million or 10% versus the prior year period. More than 70% of the revenue decline was related to foreign currency. Adjusted segment revenues declined 2%, an improvement from the prior quarter rate.
Within segment revenues, advertising, which was 55% of segment revenues this quarter, declined around 13%, or 7% in local currency, a similar rate to both the quarter and the full year.  
At The Wall Street Journal, domestic advertising was slightly higher versus the prior year quarter, a notable sequential improvement as we had expected. We saw improvement in technology, finance and luxury goods categories.
At News Corp Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined 23%, but only 8% in local currency, as the marketplace was a bit weaker than the prior 2 quarters. And we saw weakness in several categories, including retail, national and auto this quarter.
At News U.K., advertising revenues remained soft this quarter, relatively similar to last quarter and the year. We saw year-over-year declines across most of segments, particularly retail, IT and telecom, utilities and automotive. The Sun remains a challenge, and we're continuing to look at additional ways to better monetize our digital offerings and broaden our advertiser base.
At News America Marketing, revenues declined 9% versus the prior year quarter, due to continued weakness in freestanding inserts, partially offset by growth in in-store advertising.
Total circulation and subscription revenues, which accounted for 38% of segment revenues this quarter, declined 5%, but was up 2% in local currency. 
Dow Jones professional information business had a negative $7 million impact to revenues this quarter, but was down only $3 million, excluding foreign currency impacts, a significant improvement from the prior quarter.
We continued to see growth in consumer circulation revenues, led again by the Wall Street Journal, which grew 7% this quarter, thanks to new pricing and packages.
Segment EBITDA increased $38 million in the quarter or 29% as compared to the prior year period, and adjusted segment EBITDA was up 34%.  We benefited this quarter from a combination of increased operating efficiencies at Dow Jones and at News America Marketing, combined with higher prior year costs at News U.K., which had included severance and the World Cup marketing.
One item to note in the U.K. results. The quarter included $11 million onetime charge related to termination of a distribution contract as part of our ongoing cost reduction initiatives.
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues increased 8% and segment EBITDA was flat compared to the prior year. Adjusted revenues fell 9% versus the prior year, and adjusted segment EBITDA fell 18%, primarily due to difficult year-ago comparisons, which had higher Divergent sales. Total digital revenues for the quarter were 23% of consumer revenues, down from 24% in the prior year, again, primarily due to the Divergent year-ago comparisons that's impacted total revenues by almost $23 million this quarter.
In Digital Real Estate Services, total segment revenues increased $76 million or 67%, and EBITDA declined $17 million or 27% compared to the prior year period due to foreign currency and the inclusion of Move's results.  
Excluding foreign currency fluctuations, REA's adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA grew 15% and 18%, respectively, an improvement from the prior quarter, driven by higher depth penetration, even though listing volumes for the market remained below prior year levels. That said, listing volumes has improved in June and July.
Reported segment results include $81 million in revenues and an EBITDA loss of $15 million from Move, which includes $5 million of stock-based compensation and $7 million in legal fees for litigation against Zillow.
For the full year, excluding stock-based comp and legal fees, Move was EBITDA net positive.  On a stand-alone basis, Move's revenue would have grown 32% versus the prior year quarter, which is an acceleration from the March quarter. The improvement was led by the co-broke products and non-listing media revenues, benefiting from the successful integration into the Dow Jones programmatic exchange and higher audience levels.
In Cable Network Programming, revenue decreased by $3 million or 2% compared to the prior year quarter. Subscription revenues fell 3%, benefiting from higher affiliate fees and increased subscribers, which was more than offset by foreign exchange headwinds. Advertising revenues were flat, but up strongly in local currency. 
Segment EBITDA in this quarter grew 16%, despite higher costs and negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenue grew by 15% and adjusted EBITDA by 37%.
At Digital Education, revenues rose compared with the prior year quarter due, in part, to higher early-grade print hybrid sales. And segment EBITDA improved due to development cost reductions. 
As Robert mentioned, we are in the advanced stages of reviewing strategic alternatives for Amplify. The recent selling season for the new school year for our digital ELA curriculum, overall, has been disappointing. And the marketplace for digital curriculum has been much slower to develop than we initially expected. Additionally, we are no longer accepting new tablet customers, and we'll only be providing service and support to existing customers.  We have reduced our long-range outlook on Amplify, resulting in a noncash impairment charge of $371 million this quarter, and we will keep you updated on further developments.
With respect to earnings from affiliates. Foxtel ended the quarter with over 2.8 million total subscribers, up 9% versus the prior year, driven by cable and satellite subscribers. Churn improved to 9.9% from 12% in the prior year quarter.
Foxtel revenues for the quarter in local currency were up 2% versus the prior year. And EBITDA declined 16% due to higher sports programming costs related to the acquisition of V8 Supercars and Formula One rights, higher subscriber fees paid to Fox Sports Australia, combined with higher support costs related to the new pricing and packaging strategy and triple play.
Subscriber growth remained strong, with total subscribers around 230,000 year-over-year and growth of 94,000 in Q4. We will be including full Foxtel financials in our 10-K, which we expect to file shortly.
Overall, while we also saw the year of reinvestment, we expect Foxtel to return to EBITDA growth in fiscal '16 in local currency.
Turning to free cash flow. Free cash flow available to News Corporation in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 was $368 million compared to $365 million in the prior year. It's worth noting that foreign currency had approximately a $30 million negative impact to our available free cash flow in fiscal '15.
Turning now to a few themes for fiscal '16. At News and Information Services, advertising remains volatile and visibility is limited.  Ad spending in the U.S. is up versus the prior year, though trends in Australia and the U.K. remain soft. We hope to see more stability in the segment, driven by prior year cost initiatives, increased penetration of digital subscribers and continued stabilization of the Dow Jones professional information business.
At Book Publishing, we're very excited about our pipeline for fiscal '16, which was highlighted by the releases in July of Harper Lee's Go Set a Watchman including, as Robert noted, the Spanish rights for Watchman. However, unlike Divergent, Watchman is -- will skew heavily towards physical books, and given the higher marketing costs and author advance, it will result in more modest profitability.
Regarding Harlequin, we remain on track with our cost synergy targets of $30 million, and expect the bulk of the savings to be realized in fiscal '16. 
At Move, we are very pleased with the progress at realtor.com. While there's still work to be done and we expect to reinvest in marketing and in product development in fiscal '16 to further drive market share, we expect Move to be modestly accretive to reported segment EBITDA in fiscal 2016 and expect to further ramp in fiscal '17, driven by strong audience gains, lead volumes and improved ad inventory monetization.
REA Group, as mentioned on their earnings call yesterday, listing volume has improved in June, and we expect another year of solid growth.
At cable networks, we expect continued solid performance in local currency, driven by subscriber revenue growth. In the first half of fiscal '16, programming costs are expected to be higher though, due to the inclusion of the Rugby World Cup in September and October.
And for the first quarter of fiscal '16, given the current spot rate for the Australian dollar, we would expect currency headwinds relatively similar to fourth quarter of fiscal '15. Last year, the Australian dollar rate was $0.93 for the first quarter, roughly $0.20 higher than the current rate.  To help frame the currency impact, our 10-K will be disclosing that the impact of a $0.01 change in the U.S. dollar versus the Australian dollar impacted fiscal 2015 annual revenues by approximately $31 million and total segment EBITDA by approximately $6 million.
CapEx for fiscal '15 was approximately $380 million, which was in line with our expectations. And we expect CapEx to be at a reduced level in fiscal '16.
And lastly, on capital returns. In August 2015, the company declared a semiannual cash dividend of $0.10 per share for Class A common stock and Class B common stock. This dividend is payable on October 21, 2015, with a record date for determining dividend entitlements of September 16, 2015.
To date, we've repurchased about 3 million shares for $45 million, and have approximately $455 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. And we continue to view share repurchases as opportunistic.
So in summary, fiscal 2015 was a very busy year for News Corp as we balanced ongoing operational efficiencies with prudent investments and strategic acquisitions to expand our global footprint and digital offerings. We initiated a capital return program, and we are in the advanced stages of reviewing our strategic alternatives at Amplify.
Overall, we ended the year with stable revenues, EBITDA growth and significant free cash flow, and we expect that to continue next year.
With that, let me turn back to the operator for Q&A."

What's particularly gratifying, apart from the great work that Ryan O’Hara and the team are doing at realtor, is that the audience growth rate is continuing to increase. And so if you look at our mobile audience, which is clearly key in the contemporary environment, in June, that was up 79% year-on-year. But quarter after quarter, month after month, we are seeing increases in both audience and revenue, and we're very optimistic about the future."

News Corp is on track in its transition to a more digital and increasingly global future, having integrated several recent acquisitions and built a powerful platform for sustained growth. We are focused on driving a long-term expansion of revenue and profit and leveraging the potency of our brands while diligently confronting costs to maximize long-term returns for all investors. 
During the last quarter, foreign exchange fluctuations obviously negatively affected revenue and EBITDA in our international operations but this should not obscure the real progress made at many of our businesses. In fact, News Corp's revenues, excluding the effects of currency, grew 4% in the last quarter, underscoring the value of our shift to higher growth businesses and our prudent reinvestment strategy.
We believe the global economy is still in relatively uncharted territory, with the U.S. interest rate rise pending and emerging markets still subject to political and economic volatility. From a macro perspective, our core markets are growing but not at an optimum level. 
We are particularly pleased with the progress at realtor.com, which is significantly ahead of schedule on key metrics. We are now, by some reckoning, the world's largest digital property listings company. Our majority-owned REA has just announced plans to acquire iProperty Group, the leading digital real estate operator in Southeast Asia. 
We also see a bright future in the U.S., where the national real estate market is still gradually returning to health with recent increases in the volume of units sold and the potential for further expansion. 
The company's digital expertise and ability to harvest commissioned data has been enhanced by the addition of Unruly, Storyful and Checkout 51, all of which will have a positive impact across our businesses and around the world. We are already seeing significant new contracts and business opportunity because of Storyful's and Unruly's unique skills in measuring the social and viral penetration of advertising campaigns. And Checkout 51, acquired by News America Marketing, will provide us with real-time information about consumers' buying choices. 
In the areas of data and advertise, we believe markets are on the cusp of significant upheaval. Contemporary advertising has been distorted by trash traffic, invisible impressions and markable metrics to the detriment of advertisers, large and small. Needless to say and thus worth reinforcing, all newspaper ads are 100% viewable. Respected brand and quality journalism will have a particularly [indiscernible] value at a time when so many so-called audiences are artificial. 
While musing on the value of the genuine and verifiable, it is worth noting the healthy multiples of financial news brands with some but limited global reach. There is no business news brand with the authority, the credibility or the reach of The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones. What Luis and our team at the company are striving to make the most of our brand, our content set and an audience that are uniquely valuable. 
Bedi will provide further depth and detail in our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, where our reported revenues were $2.01 billion compared to $2.11 billion in the previous year. Clearly, currency fluctuations had a negative impact. 
Income from continuing operations was $143 million compared to $109 million, while total segment EBITDA was $165 million compared to $194 million, again reflecting the significance of currency movements. Reported earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.22 compared to $0.15 in the prior year.
As I signaled, our expanding digital real estate operations are a powerful source of growth and reason for optimism. REA revenues and EBITDA accelerated versus the fourth quarter, with a notable improvement in listing volume in Australia and a higher uptake of premium listing passengers. 
Realtor.com continued to benefit from its integration into the broader News Corp. family and is reporting robust revenue growth, with a 33% increase year-on-year, significantly higher than our competition. Traffic continue to expand rapidly in the most recent quarter, with average monthly unique users of 46 million, a 43% increase year-over-year while mobile users rose by 64%. 
Engagement at realtor.com is also strong, with our enhanced editorial coverage seeing a more than 200% increase in traffic year-over-year and reflecting the crucial role that the company's traditional skills can play in the contemporary marketplace. Extra attention is being devoted to our software and service business, which today accounts for approximately 20% of news revenues to ensure that we provide realtors and vendors and purchasers with the freshest and most accurate listings information and to improve lead generation and conversion.
With realtor.com gaining market share and momentum, we continue to expect Move to be EBITDA positive this year, and that number should ramp up in fiscal 2017. We are also heartened by the performance of both WSJ advertising and the professional information business at Dow Jones. Advertising at The Wall Street Journal rose against the comparable period both for print and for digital, with the technology sector being a significant contributor to revenue. 
It is perhaps not surprising that those who strayed as purely digital should appreciate the power of the print platform, which is, in essence, a succession of prominent billboards from influential, affluent, self-selecting audience. 
Meanwhile, circulation revenue at the journal grew mid-single digits, thanks to a new pricing schedule and healthy volumes. Keep in mind that circulation revenue at Dow Jones has grown every quarter since News Corporation acquired it in 2007. 
The professional information business crew, adjusting for currency vicissitude for the first time in more than 2 years and certainly appears to be headed in a positive direction. Our risk and compliance business is thriving at a time of intensified regulation and government scrutiny. And we are launching a suite of WSJ PRO products aimed at professionals who require a sector-specific briefing about changes, opportunities and threats in their areas of expertise. That higher level of business intelligence obviously demands a higher price.
Speaking of launches, just this week, the Journal released its new WSJ , bringing the best business news to people who are in or care about the city of London. This is but one example, along with the new global addition to the Journal, of the potential growth internationally. 
I'd also like to point out the success at Barron's, which experienced growth in circulation and advertising revenue both in digital and print in the U.S. and internationally, especially with the launch of a digital edition in Asia. 
Sports in Australia performed admirably in the first quarter in local currency. Advertising grew significantly and continued to gain market share as advertisers recognize the loyalty of the viewer base, the quality of the sports rights and the work done to create compelling programming between sports events. 
The digital presence has increased through its FOX Sports Now and the large audiences for the Rugby World Cup despite the time difference with London. We are also excited by the expanded and extended relationship with Australian Football, with the agreement that FOX Sports will broadcast matches through 2022. We are confident that FOX Sports has the most valuable rights for Australian sports, which generate by far the highest ratings. 
Foxtel continue to expand its cable and satellite subscriber base, and penetration has certainly been improving. The situation is very different to that of the U.S., where the vast majority of households already have cable and satellite contracts. In Australia, the figure is a relatively modest 30% penetration. 
Meanwhile, we are pleased that the [indiscernible] has approved the Foxtel investment in the Ten Network, and we expect to benefit from the use of the multichannel network joint venture for advertising sales and services.
As previously indicated, we completed the sale of the Amplify Insight and Learning businesses, and our decision to exit from the Digital Education business should begin to show earnings and free cash flow improvement. We are proud of the work done by the Amplify team in creating a unique curriculum for the contemporary classroom and have no doubt that the new owners will continue to develop this remarkable resource.
From our perspective, the departure from Digital Education is consistent with our increasing focus on free cash flow and imperative to drive higher value for shareholders. 
was, as expected, partly a victim of its previous year success with the Divergent Trilogy, which has inevitably reached its maturity, a value will enjoy some of many years to come. Go Set a Watchman, the sequel of To Kill a Mockingbird became the fastest-selling book in the company's history, having sold more than 3 million units during the period. But that success was balanced by a general softness in the e-book market, a trend evident to all publishers and one we are watching closely. 
Our news and information services segment declined this quarter, primarily due to advertising softness in Australia and currency weakness. News U.K. faced some advertising challenges but was vigilant controlling expenses, and the rate of advertising decline improved modestly versus the fourth quarter in local currency. 
Given this advertising weakness in both countries, there are renewed efforts to establish direct relationships with advertisers and to provide them with improved reach and returns. Our new executive team in the U.K. is much energized, and News UK is also leading in digital expansion, having overseen with our tech team in New York the acquisition of Unruly, now being leveraged by our businesses around the world. 
At a time when some are struggling to discern the difference between ad tech and fad tech, Unruly is able to instruct clients on the relative virality and sharing potential of their advertisements, given its sophisticated algorithmic metrics, which contract consumer penetration. The value of its market intelligence is certainly clear to our own properties in the U.S., Australia and U.K. 
[indiscernible] collaboration is intensifying around the company. We expect to use the powerful distribution channels that are MarketWatch and the New York Post to help drive downloads of Checkout 51 at News America Marketing. At the same time, we expect Checkout 51 will be a valuable source of sophisticated consumer metrics that will benefit many external clients of News Corp and can also help us target internal marketing with greater accuracy and effectiveness. 
There is certainly no shortage of data in the world, but much of it is ill-defined and superficial. We are aiming to create a data network effect among our businesses, with companies like News America Marketing, The Wall Street Journal, realtor.com and others all providing leads to one another in a virtuous data circle. 
And within the real estate sector itself, we're already sharing expertise in software and content. We expect to be able to repurpose techniques and tactics across that network, which now stretches from Texas to Thailand and from Indiana to Italy. 
In conclusion, while we have experienced understandable challenges in a couple of our businesses this quarter, we remain confident in our overall plans for digital and global expansion. And we are certainly pleased by the growth potential of the increasingly powerful platform that is our digital real estate business. 
With that, I'd turn things over to our CFO, Bedi Singh, to expand on the financial details."

During the first quarter, we approved the planned disposal of the company's Digital Education business, and we completed the sale of Amplify Learning and Insight businesses on September 30. Results for that segment are now reflected as discontinued operations. For comparability, this call will focus on continuing operations, excluding the impact from the Digital Education segment in both periods.
We reported fiscal 2016 first quarter total revenues of $2 billion, down 4% from the prior year period. As Robert noted, we were again impacted by currency headwinds, primarily the weaker Australian dollar, which declined over 20% versus the prior year and negatively impacted Q1 total reported revenues by $188 million or 8%. 
Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted revenue declined less than 1% compared to the prior year. We reported total segment EBITDA of $165 million compared to the prior year period of $194 million. Currency fluctuations, again primarily the weaker Australian dollar, impacted total reported segment EBITDA by $29 million or 15%. 
This quarter also includes $5 million of costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters, net of indemnification. Excluding these, as well as acquisitions and divestitures, our total adjusted segment EBITDA was down 7% compared to the prior year. Reported EPS from continuing operations were $0.22 versus $0.15 in the prior year. The current quarter EPS includes a tax benefit from the release of valuation allowances due to the planned exit of the Digital Education business, which resulted in increased expected utilizations of the NOLs that we acquired from the purchase of Move. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.05 versus $0.13 in the prior year.
Now let's turn to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter declined $161 million or 11% versus the prior year period. More than 2/3 of that decline was related to the impact of foreign currency. Adjusted segment revenue declined 3%.
Within segment revenues, advertising, which was 53% of segment revenue this quarter, declined around 13% or about 5% in local currency, which is a modest sequential improvement from last quarter.
Looking at advertising performance across our key units. At The Wall Street Journal, domestic advertising improved 3% versus the prior year quarter and an acceleration versus the Q4 rate, with both print and digital ad revenue up versus the prior year. We saw strength in technology, particularly in print. We also had solid gains in luxury goods and professional services.
At News Corp Australia, advertising revenue for the quarter declined 30% or 11% in local currency as the marketplace was weaker than the prior year quarter. We again saw softness in several categories, including retail, employment, finance and auto, with the real estate category showing modest year-over-year growth.
We are actively examining the cost structure at News Australia and looking for additional operating efficiencies in the near term.
In News UK overall, advertising revenue declined mid-single digits in local currency, a slight sequential improvement from last quarter. We saw some improvements in the real estate category like in Australia but more than offset by continued weakness in retail, most notably, the grocers. 
The Times and Sunday Thames outperformed the market, down low single digits this quarter while the Sun remained weak, down low double digits. As Robert mentioned, we made several management changes in September, including appointing Rebekah Brooks as Chief Executive. And a key focus is on improving the performance at The Sun, particularly its digital proposition. We expect to leverage the capability of the recently acquired Unruly to help achieve this. 
We announced last week that The Sun's digital content will be transitioning to a largely free model by the end of November. And we would expect the increase in audience to drive improved revenue and EBITDA. News UK also continues to look very closely at its cost base.
At News America Marketing, revenue declined 5% versus the prior year quarter. with the weakness in FSI, impacted by weaker industry pricing. Domestic in-store advertising grew modestly this quarter.
Total circulation and subscription revenues, which accounted for 41% of segment revenues, declined 6% but was up 2% in local currency. Dow Jones professional information business, excluding currency, grew modestly this quarter, the first increase in 10 quarters, led by strength in risk and compliance and stability at Factiva. 
In consumer, we saw mid-single-digit growth again at The Wall Street Journal and at News Australia in local currency, driven by subscription and a couple price increases and higher digital paid sales.
Segment EBITDA decreased $22 million in the quarter or 21% as compared to the prior year period and adjusted segment EBITDA was down 15%. While we benefited from strong performance at Dow Jones, results were more than offset by weakness at News Australia and the impact of currency this quarter. Also included in segment EBITDA was an incremental $5 million negative impact related to higher legal expenses at News America Marketing for ongoing litigations.
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues increased 1% and segment EBITDA declined 24% versus the prior year. Adjusted revenues fell 2% versus the prior year, and adjusted segment EBITDA fell 33%, primarily due to the difficult year-ago comparison, which had higher divergent sales and weaker e-book sales in Q1, consistent with industry trends. 
Total digital revenues for the quarter were 20% of consumer revenues, down from 23% in the prior year, primarily due to the higher e-book skewing divergent year-ago comparison, which impacted total revenues by $23 million this quarter. Divergent sold around 400,000 units this quarter versus approximately 3.7 million units in Q1 last year. The release of Go Set a Watchman in July, which shipped around 3.4 million units, with the vast majority and physical copies at only a modest uplift to profits as we expected.
In Digital Real Estate Services, segment revenues increased $79 million or 71% [ph] driven by the inclusion of Move results. Segment EBITDA was flat compared to the prior year period as operating result improvement at REA Group were more than offset by foreign currency fluctuations.
Excluding foreign currency fluctuations, REA's adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA grew 21% and 31%, respectively, an improvement from the prior year quarter, driven by higher listing volume in Australia and increased penetration. 
As you may have seen earlier this week, REA announced plans to acquire the balance of iProperty it doesn't already own for AUD 4 per share. The total cost of the acquisition is expected to be approximately AUD 500 million or approximately USD 350 million, which REA plans to fund primarily through new debt facilities. 
The deal is subject to court and shareholder approval and will likely close in the Q1 calendar quarter 2016. iProperty, as Robert mentioned, has leading portals in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Hong Kong and a strong presence in Singapore. The deal is consistent with REA and News Corp's plans to expand geographically and invest in high growth regions. Southeast Asia is particularly attractive, given favorable macroeconomic backdrop, increasing property transaction and low online share of real estate advertising.
Reported segment results include $85 million in revenue and an EBITDA loss of $4 million for Move, including approximately $4 million of stock compensation expense. Excluding the stock-based comp expense, Move will have been breakeven this quarter, and we continue to expect it to be EBITDA positive for this fiscal year. 
On a standalone basis, Move's revenue would have grown 33% versus the prior year quarter. The improvement was led again by the connection of co-brokerage product and non-listing media revenues, benefiting from the successful integration into the Dow Jones programmatic exchange and higher audience levels. We also saw a year-over-year and sequential improvement in the software and services segment, led by an increase in subscribers to its Top Producer CRM product.
In Cable Network Programming, revenue decreased by $15 million or 11% compared to the prior year quarter. Subscription revenues fell 12% as higher affiliate fees and subscriber gains were more than offset by foreign exchange headwinds. 
Advertising revenues were down 8%, impacted by negative foreign currency fluctuations but up strongly in local currency, benefiting from the Rugby World Cup and the new and Formula 1 motor sport properties, combined with higher underlying market share. 
Segment EBITDA in the quarter fell 13% due to negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations and expected higher programming rights cost related to the Rugby World Cup. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenues grew by 10%, and adjusted EBITDA grew by 9%. 
With respect to earnings from affiliates, Foxtel ended the quarter with over 2.9 million total subscribers, with the majority of growth from cable and satellite subscribers, which increased 8% compared to the prior year period. In the quarter, cable and satellite churn improved to 10.1% from 10.9% in the prior year. 
Foxtel revenues for the quarter in local currency were up 3% versus the prior year, and EBITDA was down 21% due to expected higher programming cost, primarily sports rights rates and fees and an expected increase in cost associated with higher sales volume and the public launch of Triple Play [ph] 
Last week, Ten Network received ACCC and ACMA approvals for Foxtel's 15% investment for a total contribution of AUD 77 million, subject to confirmation from The Australian Foreign Investment Review Board. Ten will also hold roughly a 25% stake in the multichannel networks ad sales venture Foxtel and Fox Sports.
Included within income loss from discontinued operations in the first quarter of fiscal '16, the company recognized a pretax noncash impairment charge of $76 million, reflecting a write-down of the digital education business to its fair value. 
As I noted, the sale of Amplify's Learning and Insight business was completed on September 30. The gross proceeds from the sale of Amplify Learning and Insight will more than offset any costs relating to these businesses, including severance. 
And importantly, we recognized a tax benefit of $151 million as a result of the plan to dispose of the digital education business. We will continue to maintain support for the amplifier type of business. We expect future cost to be minimal, and these will be reflected in discontinued operations as classified as an asset held for sale. We expect the full free cash flow and earnings benefit from the exit of the digital education business from fiscal 27 (sic) [ 2017 ] onwards.
So in summary, we remain focused on driving long-term growth and believe News Corp is on the right track. We're always examining our asset portfolio and willing to make changes that maximize value per share on long-term growth. Our decision to exit Digital Education reflects our view that free cash flow is a priority for News Corp, and that the ongoing investment spend at Amplify was better suited within a different structure. 
We have aggressively shifted our focus to digital real estate, and we believe that Move and REA Group will be core pillars of our profitability for the future. We've extended our real estate reach and expertise through investments in India and through REA's investment in Southeast Asia, which should be magnified by its land buying of iProperty.
While Book Publishing faced some tough comparables this quarter, we are very pleased with the successful integration of our past acquisitions. We continue to leverage international distribution network and our annualized cost synergies from the Harlequin acquisition are on target at $20 million. 
While the News and Information Services segment remains volatile with advertising trends geographically uneven, we're investing in digital products, actively addressing our cost base and using different levels to drive growth in circulation revenues. 
As we shift more steadily to digital and towards a more balanced revenue mix, our mastheads are evolving into unique platforms that provide valuable audiences which we can leverage across our properties as is evident with the success of realtor.com and in REA in Australia. We believe that the steps we've been taking have put News Corp in a better position to drive long-term value per share. We're pivoting the company into faster growth segments and will continue to reinvest and be balanced with capital returns. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

News Corp is on track in its transition to a more digital and increasingly global future, having integrated several recent acquisitions and built a powerful platform for sustained growth.

News Corp is on track in its transition to a more digital and increasingly global future, having integrated several recent acquisitions and built a powerful platform for sustained growth. We are focused on driving a long-term expansion of revenue and profit and leveraging the potency of our brands while diligently confronting costs to maximize long-term returns for all investors.
During the last quarter, foreign exchange fluctuations obviously negatively affected revenue and EBITDA in our international operations, but this should not obscure the real progress made at many of our businesses. In fact, News Corp's revenues, excluding the effects of currency, grew 4% in the last quarter, underscoring the value of our shift to higher-growth businesses and our prudent reinvestment strategy.
We believe the global economy is still in relatively unchartered territory, with the U.S. interest rate rise pending and emerging markets still subject to political and economic volatility. From a macro perspective, our core markets are growing, but not at an optimum level. 
We are particularly pleased with the progress at realtor.com, which is significantly ahead of schedule on key metrics. We are now, by some reckoning, the world's largest digital property listings company. Our majority-owned REA has just announced plans to acquire iProperty Group, the leading digital real estate operator in Southeast Asia.  We also see a bright future in the U.S., where the national real estate market is still gradually returning to health, with recent increases in the volume of units sold and the potential for further expansion. 
The company's digital expertise and ability to harvest commissioned data has been enhanced by the addition of Unruly, Storyful and Checkout 51, all of which will have a positive impact across our businesses and around the world. We are already seeing significant new contracts and business opportunities because of Storyful's and Unruly's unique skills in measuring the social and viral penetration of advertising campaigns. And Checkout 51, acquired by News America Marketing, will provide us with real-time information about consumers' buying choices. 
In the areas of data and advertised, we believe markets are on the cusp of significant upheaval. Contemporary advertising has been distorted by trash traffic, invisible impressions and mockable metrics, to the detriment of advertisers, large and small. Needless to say and thus worth reinforcing, all newspaper ads are 100% viewable. Respected brand and quality journalism will have a particularly profound value at a time when so many so-called audiences are artificial. 
While musing on the value of the genuine and verifiable, it is worth noting the healthy multiples of financial news brands with some, but limited global reach. There is no business news brand with the authority, the credibility or the reach of The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones, what Louis and our team at the company are striving to make the most of our brand, our content set and an audience that are uniquely valuable. 
Bedi will provide further depth and detail in our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, where our reported revenues were $2.01 billion compared to $2.11 billion in the previous year. Clearly, currency fluctuations had a negative impact. 
Income from continuing operations was $143 million compared to $109 million, while total segment EBITDA was $165 million compared to $194 million, again reflecting the significance of currency movements. Reported earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.22 compared to $0.15 in the prior year.
As I signaled, our expanding digital real estate operations are a powerful source of growth and reason for optimism. REA revenues and EBITDA accelerated versus the fourth quarter, with a notable improvement in listing volume in Australia and a higher uptake of premium listing passengers. 
realtor.com continued to benefit from its integration into the broader News Corp. family and is reporting robust revenue growth, with a 33% increase year-on-year, significantly higher than our competition. Traffic continued to expand rapidly in the most recent quarter, with average monthly unique users of 46 million, a 43% increase year-over-year, while mobile users rose by 64%. 
Engagement at realtor.com is also strong, with our enhanced editorial coverage seeing a more than 200% increase in traffic year-over-year and reflecting the crucial role that the company's traditional skills can play in the contemporary marketplace. Extra attention is being devoted to our software and service business, which today accounts for approximately 20% of Move's revenues to ensure that we provide realtors and vendors and purchasers with the freshest and most accurate listings information and to improve lead generation and conversion.  With realtor.com gaining market share and momentum, we continue to expect Move to be EBITDA positive this year, and that number should ramp up in fiscal 2017. 
We are also heartened by the performance of both WSJ advertising and the professional information business at Dow Jones. Advertising at The Wall Street Journal rose against the comparable period, both for print and for digital, with the technology sector being a significant contributor to revenue. 
It is perhaps not surprising that those who strayed as the purely digital should appreciate the power of the print platform, which is, in essence, a succession of prominent daily billboards for an influential, affluent, self-selecting audience. 
Meanwhile, circulation revenue at the Journal grew mid-single digits, thanks to a new pricing schedule and healthy volumes. Keep in mind that circulation revenue at Dow Jones has grown every quarter since News Corporation acquired it in 2007. 
The professional information business grew, adjusting for currency vicissitude for the first time in more than 2 years and certainly appears to be headed in a positive direction. Our risk and compliance business is thriving at a time of intensified regulation and government scrutiny. And we are launching a suite of WSJ PRO products aimed at professionals who require a sector-specific briefing about changes, opportunities and threats in their areas of expertise. That higher level of business intelligence obviously demands a higher price.
Speaking of launches, just this week, the Journal released its new WSJ City app, bringing the best business news to people who are in, or care about the City of London. This is but one example, along with the new global addition to the Journal, of the potential growth internationally. 
I'd also like to point out the success at Barron's, which experienced growth in circulation and advertising revenue, both in digital and print in the U.S. and internationally, especially with the launch of a digital edition in Asia. 
Fox Sports in Australia performed admirably in the first quarter in local currency. Advertising grew significantly and continued to gain market share, as advertisers recognized the loyalty of the viewer base, the quality of the sports rights and the work done to create compelling programming between sports events.  The digital presence has increased through its FOX Sports Now and the large audiences for the Rugby World Cup despite the time difference with London. 
We are also excited by the expanded and extended relationship with Australian rules football, with the agreement that FOX Sports will broadcast matches through 2022. We are confident that FOX Sports has the most valuable rights for Australian sports, which generate by far the highest ratings. 
Foxtel continued to expand its cable and satellite subscriber base, and penetration has certainly been improving. The situation is very different to that of the U.S., where the vast majority of households already have cable or satellite contracts. In Australia, the figure is a relatively modest 30% penetration. 
Meanwhile, we are pleased that the ACCC has approved the Foxtel investment in the Ten Network, and we expect to benefit from use of the multichannel network joint venture for advertising sales and services.
As previously indicated, we completed the sale of the Amplify Insight and Learning businesses, and our decision to exit from the Digital Education business should begin to show earnings and free cash flow improvement. We are proud of the work done by the Amplify team in creating a unique curriculum for the contemporary classroom, and have no doubt that the new owners will continue to develop this remarkable resource.  From our perspective, the departure from Digital Education is consistent with our increasing focus on free cash flow and imperative to drive higher value for shareholders. 
HarperCollins was, as expected, partly a victim of its previous-year success with the Divergent Trilogy, which has inevitably reached its maturity, though its backwards value will endure for many years to come. 
Go Set a Watchman, the sequel of To Kill a Mockingbird became the fastest-selling book in the company's history, having sold more than 3 million units during the period. But that success was balanced by a general softness in the e-book market, a trend evident to all publishers and one we are watching closely.
Our news and information services segment declined this quarter, primarily due to advertising softness in Australia and currency weakness. 
News UK faced some advertising challenges, but was vigilant controlling expenses, and the rate of advertising decline improved modestly versus the fourth quarter in local currency. 
Given this advertising weakness in both countries, there are renewed efforts to establish direct relationships with advertisers and to provide them with improved reach and returns. Our new executive team in the U.K. is much energized, and News UK is also leading in digital expansion, having overseen with our tech team in New York the acquisition of Unruly, now being leveraged by our businesses around the world. 
At a time when some are struggling to discern the difference between ad tech and fad tech, Unruly is able to instruct clients on the relative virality and sharing potential of their advertisements, given its sophisticated algorithmic metrics, which contract consumer penetration. The value of its market intelligence is certainly clear to our own properties in the U.S., Australia and the U.K. 
Creative commercial collaboration is intensifying around the company. We expect to use the powerful distribution channels that are MarketWatch and the New York Post to help drive downloads of Checkout 51 at News America Marketing. At the same time, we expect Checkout 51 will be a valuable source of sophisticated consumer metrics that will benefit many external clients of News Corp and can also help us target internal marketing with greater accuracy and effectiveness. 
There is certainly no shortage of data in the world, but much of it is ill-defined and superficial. We are aiming to create a data network effect among our businesses, with companies like News America Marketing, The Wall Street Journal, realtor.com and others all providing leads to one another in a virtuous data circle.  And within the real estate sector itself, we're already sharing expertise in software and content. We expect to be able to re-purpose techniques and tactics across that network, which now stretches from Texas to Thailand and from Indiana to Italy. 
In conclusion, while we have experienced understandable challenges in a couple of our businesses this quarter, we remain confident in our overall plans for digital and global expansion. And we are certainly pleased by the growth potential of the increasingly powerful platform that is our digital real estate business. 
With that, I turn things over to our CFO, Bedi Singh, to expand on the financial details."
212741644,314643963,894558,"News Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2015",2015-11-05,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Robert. During the first quarter, we approved the planned disposal of the company's Digital Education business, and we completed the sale of Amplify's Learning and Insight businesses on September 30. Results for that segment are now reflected as d",2039,"Thanks, Robert. During the first quarter, we approved the planned disposal of the company's Digital Education business, and we completed the sale of Amplify's Learning and Insight businesses on September 30. Results for that segment are now reflected as discontinued operations. For comparability, this call will focus on continuing operations, excluding the impact from the Digital Education segment in both periods.
We reported fiscal 2016 first quarter total revenues of $2 billion, down 4% from the prior year period. As Robert noted, we were again impacted by currency headwinds, primarily the weaker Australian dollar, which declined over 20% versus the prior year and negatively impacted Q1 total reported revenues by $188 million or 8%. 
Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted revenue declined less than 1% compared to the prior year. We reported total segment EBITDA of $165 million compared to the prior year period of $194 million. Currency fluctuations, again primarily the weaker Australian dollar, impacted total reported segment EBITDA by $29 million or 15%. 
This quarter also includes $5 million of costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters, net of indemnification. Excluding these as well as acquisitions and divestitures, our total adjusted segment EBITDA was down 7% compared to the prior year. 
Reported EPS from continuing operations were $0.22 versus $0.15 in the prior year. The current quarter EPS includes a tax benefit from the release of valuation allowances due to the planned exit of the Digital Education business, which resulted in increased expected utilizations of the NOLs that we acquired from the purchase of Move. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.05 versus $0.13 in the prior year.
Now let's turn to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter declined $161 million or 11% versus the prior year period. More than 2/3 of that decline was related to the impact of foreign currency. Adjusted segment revenue declined 3%.
Within segment revenues, advertising, which was 53% of segment revenue this quarter, declined around 13%, or about 5% in local currency, which is a modest sequential improvement from last quarter.
Looking at advertising performance across our key units. At The Wall Street Journal, domestic advertising improved 3% versus the prior year quarter and an acceleration versus the Q4 rate, with both print and digital ad revenue up versus the prior year. We saw strength in technology, particularly in print. We also had solid gains in luxury goods and professional services.
At News Corp Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined 30%, or 11% in local currency as the marketplace was weaker than the prior year quarter. We again saw softness in several categories, including retail, employment, finance and auto, with the real estate category showing modest year-over-year growth.
We are actively examining the cost structure at News Australia and looking for additional operating efficiencies in the near term.
At News UK, overall advertising revenues declined mid-single digits in local currency, a slight sequential improvement from last quarter. We saw some improvements in the real estate category like in Australia, but more than offset by continued weakness in retail, most notably, the grocers. 
The Times and Sunday Times outperformed the market, down low single digits this quarter, while the Sun remained weak, down low double digits. 
As Robert mentioned, we made several management changes in September, including appointing Rebekah Brooks as Chief Executive. And a key focus is on improving the performance at The Sun, particularly its digital proposition. We expect to leverage the capabilities of the recently acquired Unruly to help achieve this. 
We announced last week that The Sun's digital content will be transitioning to a largely free model by the end of November, and we would expect the increase in audience to drive improved revenue and EBITDA. News UK also continues to look very closely at its cost base.
At News America Marketing, revenues declined 5% versus the prior year quarter due to continued weakness in FSI, impacted by weaker industry pricing. Domestic in-store advertising grew modestly this quarter.
Total circulation and subscription revenues, which accounted for 41% of segment revenues, declined 6% but was up 2% in local currency. Dow Jones professional information business, excluding currency, grew modestly this quarter, the first increase in 10 quarters, led by strength in risk and compliance and stability at Factiva. 
In consumer, we saw mid-single-digit growth again at The Wall Street Journal and at News Australia in local currency, driven by subscription and a couple of price increases and higher digital paid sales.
Segment EBITDA decreased $22 million in the quarter or 21% as compared to the prior year period, and adjusted segment EBITDA was down 15%. While we benefited from strong performance at Dow Jones, results were more than offset by weakness at News Australia and the impact of currency this quarter. Also included in segment EBITDA was an incremental $5 million negative impact related to higher legal expenses at News America Marketing for ongoing litigations.
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues increased 1% and segment EBITDA declined 24% versus the prior year. Adjusted revenues fell 2% versus the prior year, and adjusted segment EBITDA fell 33%, primarily due to the difficult year-ago comparison, which had higher Divergent sales and weaker e-book sales in Q1, consistent with industry trends. 
Total digital revenues for the quarter were 20% of consumer revenues, down from 23% in the prior year, primarily due to the higher e-book skewing Divergent year-ago comparison, which impacted total revenues by $23 million this quarter. Divergent sold around 400,000 units this quarter versus approximately 3.7 million units in Q1 last year.  The release of Go Set a Watchman in July, which shipped around 3.4 million units, with the vast majority in physical copies had only a modest uplift to profits as we expected.
In Digital Real Estate Services, total segment revenues increased $79 million or 71%, driven by the inclusion of Move results. Segment EBITDA was flat compared to the prior year period, as operating result improvement at REA Group were more than offset by foreign currency fluctuations.
Excluding foreign currency fluctuations, REA's adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA grew 21% and 31%, respectively, an improvement from the prior year quarter, driven by higher listing volume in Australia and increased depth penetration. 
As you may have seen earlier this week, REA announced plans to acquire the balance of iProperty it doesn't already own for AUD 4 per share. The total cost of the acquisition is expected to be approximately AUD 500 million or approximately USD 350 million, which REA plans to fund primarily through new debt facilities.  The deal is subject to court and shareholder approval and will likely close in the Q1 calendar quarter 2016. 
iProperty, as Robert mentioned, has leading portals in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Hong Kong and a strong presence in Singapore. The deal is consistent with REA and News Corp's plans to expand geographically and invest in high-growth regions. Southeast Asia is particularly attractive, given favorable macroeconomic backdrop, increasing property transactions and low online share of real estate advertising.
Reported segment results include $85 million in revenue and an EBITDA loss of $4 million for Move, including approximately $4 million of stock compensation expense. Excluding the stock-based comp expense, Move will have been breakeven this quarter, and we continue to expect it to be EBITDA positive for this fiscal year. 
On a standalone basis, Move's revenue would have grown 33% versus the prior year quarter. The improvement was led again by the collections of co-brokerage product and nonlisting media revenues, benefiting from the successful integration into the Dow Jones programmatic exchange and higher audience levels. We also saw a year-over-year and sequential improvement in the software and services segment, led by an increase in subscribers to its Top Producer CRM product.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues decreased by $15 million or 11% compared to the prior year quarter. Subscription revenues fell 12%, as higher affiliate fees and subscriber gains were more than offset by foreign exchange headwinds. 
Advertising revenues were down 8%, impacted by negative foreign currency fluctuations, but up strongly in local currency, benefiting from the Rugby World Cup and the new V8 and Formula 1 motor sport properties, combined with higher underlying market share. 
Segment EBITDA in the quarter fell 13% due to negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations and expected higher programming rights cost related to the Rugby World Cup. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenues grew by 10%, and adjusted EBITDA grew by 9%. 
With respect to earnings from affiliates, Foxtel ended the quarter with over 2.9 million total subscribers, with the majority of growth from cable and satellite subscribers, which increased 8% compared to the prior year period. In the quarter, cable and satellite churn improved to 10.1% from 10.9% in the prior year. 
Foxtel revenues for the quarter in local currency were up 3% versus the prior year, and EBITDA was down 21% due to expected higher programming costs, primarily sports rights and fees and an expected increase in costs associated with higher sales volume and the public launch of triple play.
Last week, Ten Network received ACCC and ACMA approvals for Foxtel's 15% investment for a total contribution of AUD 77 million, subject to confirmation from the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board. Ten will also hold roughly a 25% stake in the multichannel network ad sales venture with Foxtel and Fox Sports.
Included within income loss from discontinued operations in the first quarter of fiscal '16, the company recognized a pretax noncash impairment charge of $76 million, reflecting a write-down of the Digital Education business to its fair value. 
As I noted, the sale of Amplify's Learning and Insight business was completed on September 30. The gross proceeds from the sale of Amplify Learning and Insight will more than offset any exit costs relating to these businesses, including severance.  And importantly, we recognized a tax benefit of $151 million as a result of the plan to dispose of the Digital Education business. 
We will continue to maintain support for the Amplify access type of business. We expect future costs to be minimal, and these will be reflected in discontinued operations as access is classified as an asset held for sale. 
We expect the full free cash flow and earnings benefit from the exit of the Digital Education business from fiscal 27 (sic) [ 2017 ] onwards.
So in summary, we remain focused on driving long-term growth and believe News Corp is on the right track. We're always examining our asset portfolio and willing to make changes that maximize value per share on long-term growth. Our decision to exit Digital Education reflects our view that free cash flow is a priority for News Corp, and that the ongoing investment spend at Amplify was better suited within a different structure. 
We have aggressively shifted our focus to digital real estate, and we believe that Move and REA Group will be core pillars of our profitability for the future.  We've extended our real estate reach and expertise through investments in India and through REA's investment in Southeast Asia, which should be magnified by its planned buying of iProperty.
While Book Publishing faced some tough comparables this quarter, we are very pleased with the successful integration of our past acquisitions. We continue to leverage Harlequin's international distribution network, and our annualized cost synergies from the Harlequin acquisition are on target at $20 million. 
While the News and Information Services segment remains volatile, with advertising trends geographically uneven, we're investing in digital products, actively addressing our cost base and using different levels to drive growth in circulation revenues. 
As we shift more steadily to digital and towards a more balanced revenue mix, our mastheads are evolving into unique platforms that provide valuable audiences, which we can leverage across our properties as is evident with the success of realtor.com and at REA in Australia. 
We believe that the steps we've been taking have put News Corp in a better position to drive long-term value per share. We're pivoting the company into faster growth segments and will continue to reinvest and be balanced with capital returns.

News Corp is on track in its transition to a more digital and increasingly global future, having integrated several recent acquisitions and built a powerful platform for sustained growth. We are focused on driving a long-term expansion of revenue and profit and leveraging the potency of our brands while diligently confronting costs to maximize long-term returns for all investors.
During the last quarter, foreign exchange fluctuations obviously negatively affected revenue and EBITDA in our international operations, but this should not obscure the real progress made at many of our businesses. In fact, News Corp's revenues, excluding the effects of currency, grew 4% in the last quarter, underscoring the value of our shift to higher-growth businesses and our prudent reinvestment strategy.
We believe the global economy is still in relatively unchartered territory, with U.S. interest rate rise pending and emerging markets still subject to political and economic volatility. From a macro perspective, our core markets are growing, but not at an optimum level. 
We are particularly pleased with the progress at realtor.com, which is significantly ahead of schedule on key metrics. We are now, by some reckoning, the world's largest digital property listings company. Our majority-owned REA has just announced plans to acquire iProperty Group, the leading digital real estate operator in Southeast Asia.  We also see a bright future in the U.S., where the national real estate market is still gradually returning to health, with recent increases in the volume of units sold and the potential for further expansion. 
The company's digital expertise and ability to harvest commissioned data has been enhanced by the addition of Unruly, Storyful and Checkout 51, all of which will have a positive impact across our businesses and around the world. We are already seeing significant new contracts and business opportunities because of Storyful's and Unruly's unique skills in measuring the social and viral penetration of advertising campaigns. And Checkout 51, acquired by News America Marketing, will provide us with real-time information about consumers' buying choices. 
In the areas of data and advertise, we believe markets are on the cusp of significant upheaval. Contemporary advertising has been distorted by trash traffic, invisible impressions and mockable metrics, to the detriment of advertisers, large and small. Needless to say and thus worth reinforcing, all newspaper ads are 100% viewable. Respected brand and quality journalism will have a particularly profound value at a time when so many so-called audiences are artificial. 
While musing on the value of the genuine and verifiable, it is worth noting the healthy multiples for financial news brands with some but limited global reach. There is no business news brand with the authority, the credibility or the reach of The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones. Where Louis and our team at the company are striving to make the most of a brand, a content set and an audience that are uniquely valuable. 
Bedi will provide further depth and detail on our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, where our reported revenues were $2.01 billion compared to $2.11 billion in the previous year. Clearly, currency fluctuations had a negative impact. 
Income from continuing operations was $143 million compared to $109 million, while total segment EBITDA was $165 million compared to $194 million, again reflecting the significance of currency movements. Reported earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.22 compared to $0.15 in the prior year.
As I signaled, our expanding digital real estate operations are a powerful source of growth and reason for optimism. REA revenues and EBITDA accelerated versus the fourth quarter, with a notable improvement in listing volume in Australia and a higher uptake of premium listing passages.
realtor.com continued to benefit from its integration into the broader News Corp. family and is reporting robust revenue growth, with a 33% increase year-on-year, significantly higher than our competition. Traffic continued to expand rapidly in the most recent quarter, with average monthly unique users of 46 million, a 43% increase year-over-year, while mobile users rose by 64%. 
Engagement at realtor.com is also strong, with our enhanced editorial coverage seeing a more than 200% increase in traffic year-over-year and reflecting the crucial role that the company's traditional skills can play in the contemporary marketplace. 
Extra attention is being devoted to our software and service business, which today accounts for approximately 20% of Move's revenues to ensure that we provide realtors and vendors and purchasers with the freshest and most accurate listings information and to improve lead generation and conversion.  With realtor.com gaining market share and momentum, we continue to expect Move to be EBITDA positive this year, and that number should ramp up in fiscal 2017. 
We are also heartened by the performance of both WSJ advertising and the professional information business at Dow Jones. Advertising at The Wall Street Journal rose against the comparable period, both for print and for digital, with the technology sector being a significant contributor to revenue. 
It is perhaps not surprising that those whose trade is the purely digital should appreciate the power of the print platform, which is, in essence, a succession of prominent daily billboards for an influential, affluent, self-selecting audience. 
Meanwhile, circulation revenue at the Journal grew mid-single digits, thanks to a new pricing schedule and healthy volumes. Keep in mind that circulation revenue at Dow Jones has grown every quarter since News Corporation acquired it in 2007. 
The professional information business grew, adjusting for currency vicissitudes for the first time in more than 2 years and certainly appears to be headed in a positive direction. Our risk and compliance business is thriving at a time of intensified regulation and government scrutiny. 
And we are launching a suite of WSJ PRO products aimed at professionals who require a sector-specific briefing about changes, opportunities and threats in their areas of expertise. That higher level of business intelligence obviously demands a higher price.
Speaking of launches, just this week, the Journal released its new WSJ City app, bringing the best business news to people who are in, or care about the City of London. This is but one example, along with the new global addition to the Journal, of the potential growth internationally. 
I'd also like to point out the success at Barron's, which experienced growth in circulation and advertising revenue, both in digital and print in the U.S. and internationally, especially with the launch of a digital edition in Asia. 
Fox Sports in Australia performed admirably in the first quarter in local currency. Advertising grew significantly and continued to gain market share, as advertisers recognized the loyalty of the viewer base, the quality of the sports rights and the work done to create compelling programming between sports events.  The digital presence has increased through its FOX Sports Now and the large audiences for the Rugby World Cup despite the time difference with London. 
We are also excited by the expanded and extended relationship with Australian rules football, with the agreement that FOX Sports will broadcast matches through 2022. We are confident that FOX Sports has the most valuable rights for Australian sports, which generate by far the highest ratings. 
Foxtel continued to expand its cable and satellite subscriber base, and penetration has certainly been improving. The situation is very different to that of the U.S., where the vast majority of households already have cable or satellite contracts. In Australia, the figure is a relatively modest 30% penetration. 
Meanwhile, we are pleased that the ACCC has approved the Foxtel investment in the Ten Network, and we expect to benefit from use of the multichannel network joint venture for advertising sales and services.
As previously indicated, we completed the sale of the Amplify Insight and Learning businesses, and our decision to exit from the Digital Education business should begin to show earnings and free cash flow improvement. We are proud of the work done by the Amplify team in creating a unique curriculum for the contemporary classroom, and have no doubt that the new owners will continue to develop this remarkable resource.  From our perspective, the departure from Digital Education is consistent with our increasing focus on free cash flow and the imperative to drive higher value for shareholders. 
HarperCollins was, as expected, partly a victim of its previous-years' success with the Divergent Trilogy, which has inevitably reached its maturity, though its backlist value will endure for many years to come. 
Go Set a Watchman, the sequel of To Kill a Mockingbird became the fastest-selling book in the company's history, having sold more than 3 million units during the period. But that success was balanced by a general softness in the e-book market, a trend evident to all publishers and one we are watching closely.
Our news and information services segment declined this quarter, primarily due to advertising softness in Australia and currency weakness. 
News UK faced some advertising challenges, but was vigilant controlling expenses, and the rate of advertising decline improved modestly versus the fourth quarter in local currency. 
Given this advertising weakness in both countries, there are renewed efforts to establish direct relationships with advertisers and to provide them with improved reach and returns. Our new executive team in the U.K. is much energized, and News UK is also leading in digital expansion, having overseen, with our tech team in New York, the acquisition of Unruly, now being leveraged by our businesses around the world. 
At a time when some are struggling to discern the difference between ad tech and fad tech, Unruly is able to instruct clients on the relative virality and sharing potential of their advertisements, given its sophisticated algorithmic metrics, which can track consumer penetration. The value of its market intelligence is certainly clear to our own properties in the U.S., Australia and the U.K. 
Creative commercial collaboration is intensifying around the company. We expect to use the powerful distribution channels that are MarketWatch and the New York Post to help drive downloads of Checkout 51 at News America Marketing. At the same time, we expect Checkout 51 will be a valuable source of sophisticated consumer metrics that will benefit many external clients of News Corp and can also help us target internal marketing with greater accuracy and effectiveness. 
There is certainly no shortage of data in the world, but much of it is ill-defined and superficial. We are aiming to create a data network effect among our businesses, with companies like News America Marketing, The Wall Street Journal, realtor.com and others all providing leads to one another in a virtuous data circle.  
And within the real estate sector itself, we're already sharing expertise in software and content. We expect to be able to re-purpose techniques and tactics across that network, which now stretches from Texas to Thailand and from Indiana to Italy. 
In conclusion, while we have experienced understandable challenges in a couple of our businesses this quarter, we remain confident in our overall plans for digital and global expansion. And we are certainly pleased by the growth potential of the increasingly powerful platform that is our digital real estate business. 
With that, I turn things over to our CFO, Bedi Singh, to expand on the financial details."
212741644,314643963,894663,"News Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2015",2015-11-05,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Robert. During the first quarter, we approved the planned disposal of the company's Digital Education business, and we completed the sale of Amplify's Learning and Insight businesses on September 30.

During the first quarter, we approved the planned disposal of the company's Digital Education business, and we completed the sale of Amplify's Learning and Insight businesses on September 30. Results for that segment are now reflected as discontinued operations. For comparability, this call will focus on continuing operations, excluding the impact from the Digital Education segment in both periods.
We reported fiscal 2016 first quarter total revenues of $2 billion, down 4% from the prior year period. As Robert noted, we were again impacted by currency headwinds, primarily the weaker Australian dollar, which declined over 20% versus the prior year and negatively impacted Q1 total reported revenues by $188 million or 8%. 
Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted revenue declined less than 1% compared to the prior year. We reported total segment EBITDA of $165 million compared to the prior year period of $194 million. Currency fluctuations, again primarily the weaker Australian dollar, impacted total reported segment EBITDA by $29 million or 15%. 
This quarter also includes $5 million of costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters, net of indemnification. Excluding these as well as acquisitions and divestitures, our total adjusted segment EBITDA was down 7% compared to the prior year. 
Reported EPS from continuing operations were $0.22 versus $0.15 in the prior year. The current quarter EPS includes a tax benefit from the release of valuation allowances due to the planned exit of the Digital Education business, which resulted in increased expected utilizations of the NOLs that we acquired from the purchase of Move. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.05 versus $0.13 in the prior year.
Now let's turn to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter declined $161 million or 11% versus the prior year period. More than 2/3 of that decline was related to the impact of foreign currency. Adjusted segment revenue declined 3%.
Within segment revenues, advertising, which was 53% of segment revenues this quarter, declined around 13%, or about 5% in local currency, which is a modest sequential improvement from last quarter.
Looking at advertising performance across our key units. At The Wall Street Journal, domestic advertising improved 3% versus the prior year quarter and an acceleration versus the Q4 rate, with both print and digital ad revenue up versus the prior year. We saw strength in technology, particularly in print. We also had solid gains in luxury goods and professional services.
At News Corp Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined 30%, or 11% in local currency as the marketplace was weaker than the prior year quarter. We again saw softness in several categories, including retail, employment, finance and auto, with the real estate category showing modest year-over-year growth.
We are actively examining the cost structure at News Australia and looking for additional operating efficiencies in the near term.
At News UK, overall advertising revenues declined mid-single digits in local currency, a slight sequential improvement from last quarter. We saw some improvements in the real estate category like in Australia, but more than offset by continued weakness in retail, most notably, the grocers. 
The Times and Sunday Times outperformed the market, down low single digits this quarter, while the Sun remained weak, down low double digits. 
As Robert mentioned, we made several management changes in September, including appointing Rebekah Brooks as Chief Executive. And a key focus is on improving the performance at The Sun, particularly its digital proposition. We expect to leverage the capabilities of the recently acquired Unruly to help achieve this. 
We announced last week that The Sun's digital content will be transitioning to a largely free model by the end of November, and we would expect the increase in audience to drive improved revenue and EBITDA. News UK also continues to look very closely at its cost base.
At News America Marketing, revenues declined 5% versus the prior year quarter due to continued weakness in FSI, impacted by weaker industry pricing. Domestic in-store advertising grew modestly this quarter.
Total circulation and subscription revenues, which accounted for 41% of segment revenues, declined 6% but was up 2% in local currency. Dow Jones professional information business, excluding currency, grew modestly this quarter, the first increase in 10 quarters, led by strength in risk and compliance and stability at Factiva. 
In consumer, we saw mid-single-digit growth again at The Wall Street Journal and at News Australia in local currency, driven by subscription and cover price increases and higher digital paid sales.
Segment EBITDA decreased $22 million in the quarter or 21% as compared to the prior year period, and adjusted segment EBITDA was down 15%. While we benefited from strong performance at Dow Jones, results were more than offset by weakness at News Australia and the impact of currency this quarter. Also included in segment EBITDA was an incremental $5 million negative impact related to higher legal expenses at News America Marketing for ongoing litigations.
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues increased 1% and segment EBITDA declined 24% versus the prior year. Adjusted revenues fell 2% versus the prior year, and adjusted segment EBITDA fell 33%, primarily due to the difficult year-ago comparison, which had higher Divergent sales and weaker e-book sales in Q1, consistent with industry trends. 
Total digital revenues for the quarter were 20% of consumer revenues, down from 23% in the prior year, primarily due to the higher e-book skewing Divergent year-ago comparison, which impacted total revenues by $23 million this quarter. Divergent sold around 400,000 units this quarter versus approximately 3.7 million units in Q1 last year.  The release of Go Set a Watchman in July, which shipped around 3.4 million units, with the vast majority in physical copies had only a modest uplift to profits, as we expected.
In Digital Real Estate Services, total segment revenues increased $79 million or 71%, driven by the inclusion of Move results. Segment EBITDA was flat compared to the prior year period, as operating results improvement at REA Group were more than offset by foreign currency fluctuations.
Excluding foreign currency fluctuations, REA's adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA grew 21% and 31%, respectively, an improvement from the prior year quarter, driven by higher listing volume in Australia and increased depth penetration. 
As you may have seen earlier this week, REA announced plans to acquire the balance of iProperty it doesn't already own, for AUD 4 per share. The total cost of the acquisition is expected to be approximately AUD 500 million or approximately USD 350 million, which REA plans to fund primarily through new debt facilities.  The deal is subject to court and shareholder approval and will likely close in the Q1 calendar quarter 2016. 
iProperty, as Robert mentioned, has leading portals in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Hong Kong and a strong presence in Singapore. The deal is consistent with REA and News Corp's plans to expand geographically and invest in high-growth regions. Southeast Asia is particularly attractive, given favorable macroeconomic backdrop, increasing property transactions and low online share of real estate advertising.
Reported segment results include $85 million in revenue and an EBITDA loss of $4 million for Move, including approximately $4 million of stock compensation expense. Excluding the stock-based comp expense, Move will have been breakeven this quarter, and we continue to expect it to be EBITDA positive for this fiscal year. 
On a standalone basis, Move's revenue would have grown 33% versus the prior year quarter. The improvement was led again by the connections for co-brokerage product and nonlisting media revenues, benefiting from the successful integration into the Dow Jones programmatic exchange and higher audience levels. We also saw a year-over-year and sequential improvement in the software and services segment, led by an increase in subscribers to its Top Producer CRM product.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues decreased by $15 million or 11% compared to the prior year quarter. Subscription revenues fell 12%, as higher affiliate fees and subscriber gains were more than offset by foreign exchange headwinds. 
Advertising revenues were down 8%, impacted by negative foreign currency fluctuations, but up strongly in local currency, benefiting from the Rugby World Cup and the new V8 and Formula 1 motor sport properties, combined with higher underlying market share. 
Segment EBITDA in the quarter fell 13% due to negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations and expected higher programming rights costs related to the Rugby World Cup. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenues grew by 10%, and adjusted EBITDA grew by 9%. 
With respect to earnings from affiliates, Foxtel ended the quarter with over 2.9 million total subscribers, with the majority of growth from cable and satellite subscribers, which increased 8% compared to the prior year period. In the quarter, cable and satellite churn improved to 10.1% from 10.9% in the prior year. 
Foxtel revenues for the quarter in local currency were up 3% versus the prior year, and EBITDA was down 21% due to expected higher programming costs, primarily sports rights and fees and an expected increase in costs associated with higher sales volume and the public launch of triple play.
Last week, Ten Network received ACCC and ACMA approvals for Foxtel's 15% investment for a total contribution of AUD 77 million, subject to confirmation from the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board. Ten will also hold roughly a 25% stake in the multichannel network ad sales venture with Foxtel and Fox Sports.
Included within income loss from discontinued operations in the first quarter of fiscal '16, the company recognized a pretax noncash impairment charge of $76 million, reflecting a write-down of the Digital Education business to its fair value. 
As I noted, the sale of Amplify's Learning and Insight business was completed on September 30. The gross proceeds from the sale of Amplify Learning and Insight will more than offset any exit costs relating to these businesses, including severance.  And importantly, we recognized a tax benefit of $151 million as a result of the plan to dispose of the Digital Education business. 
We will continue to maintain support for the Amplify access tablet business. We expect future costs to be minimal, and these will be reflected in discontinued operations as access is classified as an asset held for sale. 
We expect the full free cash flow and earnings benefit from the exit of the Digital Education business from fiscal 27 (sic) [ 2017 ] onwards.
So in summary, we remain focused on driving long-term growth and believe News Corp is on the right track. We're always examining our asset portfolio and willing to make changes that maximize value per share and long-term growth. Our decision to exit Digital Education reflects our view that free cash flow is a priority for News Corp, and that the ongoing investment spend at Amplify was better suited within a different structure. 
We have aggressively shifted our focus to digital real estate, and we believe that Move and REA Group will be core pillars of our profitability for the future.  We've extended our real estate reach and expertise through investments in India and through REA's investment in Southeast Asia, which should be magnified by its planned buying of iProperty.
While Book Publishing faced some tough comparables this quarter, we are very pleased with the successful integration of our past acquisitions. We continue to leverage Harlequin's international distribution network, and our annualized cost synergies from the Harlequin acquisition are on target at $20 million. 
While the News and Information Services segment remains volatile, with advertising trends geographically uneven, we're investing in digital products, actively addressing our cost base and using different levels to drive growth in circulation revenues. 
As we shift more steadily to digital and towards a more balanced revenue mix, our mastheads are evolving into unique platforms that provide valuable audiences, which we can leverage across our properties, as is evident with the success of realtor.com and at REA in Australia. 
We believe that the steps we've been taking have put News Corp in a better position to drive long-term value per share. We're pivoting the company into faster growth segments and will continue to reinvest and be balanced with capital returns. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."
