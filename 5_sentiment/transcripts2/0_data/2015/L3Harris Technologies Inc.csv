So",1287,"Okay, very good. Thank you, Pam. I want to start by expressing our deepest condolences on behalf of Harris to the family and friends of Joe Nadal, an analyst who was followed Harris for almost a decade and who tragically passed away earlier this week. So today, we're announcing a transformational acquisition for Harris that will create significant and lasting value for our shareholders, our customers and our employees. With the acquisition of Exelis, we're increasing our scale, broadening our technology base and expanding our customer set in markets where we have decades of successful performance.
So before jumping into the transaction, Mick and I will briefly cover second quarter results and updated Harris guidance. And then, with Dave's help, walk you through the acquisition before opening the call for questions.
So turning to our second quarter earnings presentation, Slides 3 and 4. Harris performed well in the second quarter with earnings per share of $1.32. Operating results were solid, reflecting good execution and lower costs. Earnings per share also benefited from lower-than-expected taxes, including the 2014 R&D tax credit. Revenue for the company was down 1%, with growth in Government Communications systems, international tactical radios and Commercial CapRock, more than offset by continued weakness in U.S. tactical radios and by the previously reported wind-down of 2 major IT Services programs. International revenue was up 5% in the quarter and was 31% of total revenue. And our strategy of expanding already strong franchises within the government market is providing revenue strength for the company.
So touching briefly on the segments. Government Communications systems posted its fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth and generated excellent operating income, demonstrating yet again the strength of its core franchises in space and intelligence, avionics, air traffic management, geospatial imagery and weather. In the area of avionics, the F-35 program was a major revenue driver in the quarter, and we also received a $60 million [ph] follow-on contract for the LRIP 9. [ph] Into traffic management, where we had a long-standing relationship with the FAA and recently expanded with more than $900 million in awards over the last 3 years, we were awarded a 10-year, $98 million follow-on contract for OASIS II that supports flight services in Alaska by integrating real-time weather and flight planning information. Our strong franchise in space and intelligence have also been rich with expansion opportunities. Classified programs were a revenue driver in the second quarter. And following the close of the quarter, we had 2 strategic classified wins, a 3-year, $23 million contract from a new customer for space situational awareness and support of Air Force missions and a 5-year, $300 million single award IDIQ contract to integrate the government's various intelligence systems. In our space business, we introduced 2 new space reflector products, a first-to-market, 5-meter, unfurl-able KA band antenna serving the growing market for high throughput satellites and a new lightweight, fixed mesh reflector, where we also won our first order.
In Communications, the international tactical radio business continued to show strength with higher revenue, good orders and solid opportunities firming up in our $2.5 billion opportunity pipeline. We signed a $101 million follow-on contract with a country in Africa and expect to begin booking orders against it late in the fiscal year. And we have visibility into several FMS orders in the pipeline that are moving fairly quickly towards award.
Australia was tactical modernization continues. And in the second quarter, we booked a $38 million order for wideband, handheld and Manpack radios for the special forces, bringing orders to date to $560 million [ph] with an additional opportunity of about $90 million on the horizon. This latest award positions Harris very well as the future provider of wideband radios for a fully networked architecture of the Australian Defense force.
In Iraq in the second quarter, we shipped a significant portion of the $99 million of orders booked in Q1, and additional requirements and opportunities were added to the pipeline. There was $1.6 billion authorized in GFY '15 for the Iraq train and equip fund and another $1.3 billion in the president's budget request for 2016 that will support significant opportunities for Harris, making Iraq one of the larger components in our near-term tactical pipeline. Also in the quarter, we received a $50 million order from a nation in the Middle East for integrated, countrywide tactical communications system based on Falcon III wideband radios. This nation represents a new special forces customer for us in the Middle East, and the award further strengthens our preferred supplier position in the region.
As expected, the U.S. tactical radio market remains constrained, but I'm encouraged by the recent pickup in procurement activity. The RFP for Rifleman Radio was finally released, and bids are due next week. And the final IDIQ contract is now much bigger than we had previously anticipated. $3.9 billion over 10 years, with $1.4 billion for the Rifleman itself and $2.5 billion for objective requirements like a 2-channel handheld radio, waveforms and vehicle adapters. We submitted a bid for the $390 million NextGen handheld portion of the SOCOM Tactical Communications modernization effort, which we followed over the coming months with RFPs for wideband HF and multichannel Manpack radios. We now believe that the total SOCOM modernization opportunity could reach $900 million. Also in the quarter, we submitted a bid for Air Force IDIQ conduct to integrate and field management capabilities. Before leaving tactical, I'll make a few comments on the president's budget request. In a tactical line, the support of business, we saw some pickup in [indiscernible] 16 across the Marines, Navy, Air Force and SOCOM, so at least beginning to move in the right direction. For Army modernization, MNVR funding is higher over the 5-year period than in the previous year's budget, reflecting the program's good progress towards production. For HMS, funding was $65 million for GFY '16, which for us was a positive surprise, given they're still sitting on about $300 million on unspent funds and since the procurement has been pushed out to GFY '17. In the out-years for HMS, the budget matches the procurement schedule with funding picking up in GFY '17 to $291 million and rising to $470 million annually in '18 and out. In Public Safety, revenue was weak in the second quarter, and competitive pressures remain intense. Our execution is slowly progressing and will become more evident as the market improves. Process improvements in all the key areas are resulting in better program execution, lower cost, a more effective sales force and positive customer feedback on new product releases. We've made measurable progress, but we still have a lot more to do.
In Integrated Network Solutions, revenue was about as expected, with high single-digit growth in CapRock, more than offset by the wind-down of 2 IT Services programs. Commercial CapRock revenue was up 15%, driven by our previous Carnival Cruise line win. And we had a particularly good quarter in energy, despite the market turmoil with revenue up 8% and orders up 23%.
In Healthcare Solutions, we continue to receive positive feedback from customers on our fusion FX software solution, and we're making progress in our efforts to find a partner for the business with better domain expertise and channels to market. We also recently decided to eliminate the INS headquarters function to reduce indirect expenses at the segment level with Sheldon Fox, President of Government Communication Systems, named as the acting President of INS. This move also better aligns our CapRock business with GCS, where we know we have significant technology sharing opportunities that can help us bring more differentiated solutions to CapRock customers.
Now I'll turn it over to Mick to comment on guidance. Mick?"

We've included out typical segment detail and financial highlights in Slides 5 through 8. But instead of reading them, in the interest of time, I'll go directly to Slide 9 for our updated fiscal 2015 out",359,"Thank you much, Bill, and good morning to everyone. We've included out typical segment detail and financial highlights in Slides 5 through 8. But instead of reading them, in the interest of time, I'll go directly to Slide 9 for our updated fiscal 2015 outlook. We're increasing our fiscal '15 earnings per share guidance to a range of $4.95 to $5.05 per share from the previous range of $4.75 to $5 per share. Revenue guidance remains unchanged and is expected to decline 1% to 3%. Our guidance doesn't consider the acquisitions being announced today. In RF Communications, we've announced the guidance range and expect revenue to be flat to down 2%. Within this segment, we expect Public Safety to be weaker, offset by higher international tactical. U.S. tactical expectations are unchanged. A bit stronger back half revenue compared to the first half due to the passing of GFY '15 budget and timing of funds flowing down to customers. In Government Communications Systems, we now expect revenue to be up 2% to 4%, and operating margin in the range of 15% to 15.5%. And that's a little bit better than before. We expect modest sequential revenue growth in the back half. In Integrated Network Solutions, first half revenue was generally in line with expectations. Strength in Commercial CapRock more than offset by program wind-downs in IT Services. While IT Services is showing signs of bottoming, we're no longer expecting any pickup in second half revenue, and we're assuming that revenue pressure in the CapRock energy market materializes due to the impact of lower oil prices. As a result, we now expect fiscal '15 revenue to be down about 10% and operating margin of about 7%. We're still expecting free cash flow of about 100% of net income and a full year tax rate between 30.5% and 31%, which translates into an average tax rate of about 33.8% in the back half. About half of the decrease in actuarial guidance is due to calendar 2014 R&D tax credit and the remainder from other favorable tax items.
With that, I'll now turn it over back to Bill to comment on the acquisition."

And as Pamela mentioned earlier, I'm joined here in the room by Dave Melchor, President and CEO of Exelis, who will offer a couple of comments as well.

And as Pamela mentioned earlier, I'm joined here in the room by Dave Melchor, President and CEO of Exelis, who will offer a couple of comments as well. So let me turn now to the separate acquisition deck, and I'll begin on Slide 3. This acquisition brings together 2 engineering-driven companies with similar cultures that value technology and innovation to solve some of our customers' toughest, mission-critical challenges. The combined pro forma company has LTM revenue of $8.2 billion and EBITDA of about $1.6 billion. This powerful combination creates an industry innovator with much greater scale, providing a broad spectrum of technology-based advanced communication solutions.
Let me start by providing a high-level overview of Exelis and reviewing transaction detail before diving a bit more to the strategic rationale. So now turning to Slide 4. Exelis has a number of leading positions across diverse markets. Electronic systems, which is about 29% of company revenue, is a leader in electronic warfare technologies for the Air Force and Navy. The principal strengths are in electronic protection and onboard processing on platforms such as the P8, the B-52, the C-130, the Apache helicopter and the international F-16. Exelis's flagship product is integrated defensive electronics countermeasures or iDeck for the F-18, a multibillion-dollar, decades-long program, with about 400 systems delivered to date. About 21% of the company is geospatial system, a leader in space and airborne sensing. Exelis is well known for their world-class space imaging business, acquired about a decade ago from Kodak, the weather sensors, as well as their GPS technology. The imaging business has traditionally served intelligence community, but is more recently expanded to include commercial, international and unmanned vehicle payloads. Their products range from a 21-foot wide mirror on the James Webb telescope down to small commercial payloads for the worldview and GUI satellites. They provide the Gorgon stare, wide area surveillance for defense UAVs and have recently launched [indiscernible] a smaller commercial version targeting the public safety, international markets demonstrating Exelis's skill and translating government technology to the commercial world. Exelis's weather payloads have been on all NOAA weather satellites launched since 1978. The criss or the cross track infrared sounder is a primary instrument on the joint polar satellite system, and ABI that's baseline imager, is the main mission sensor on GOES-R. ABI has also been selected as the main mission sensor for Japan's [indiscernible] and South Korea's Geo Comsat 2a weather satellite. In GPS, Exelis has been on all U.S. GPS navigation systems ever launched and is currently delivering the first payloads for the GPS 3 program. Information systems is about 34% of the company and provides full life cycle mission-critical solutions for customers like NASA, where Exelis manages 2 NASA's largest communications contracts; and the FAA, where Exelis owns and operates the ADS-B network, a core element of the FAA's NextGen program. Night vision and Tactical Communications represents about 13% of company revenue. Exelis has been the industry leader in night vision for over 50 years and is one of only 2 U.S. manufacturers of image intensification tubes. And the Tactical Communications business a large installed base of more than 600,000 radios. The remaining 3% of Exelis provides composite aerostructures for commercial and military aircraft. They have 10,000 employees, including about 3,000 engineers, $3.25 billion in revenue and funded backlog of about $2.8 billion.
So turning to Slide 5 in the transaction details. Total purchase price is $4.75 billion at $23.75 per share, 70% in cash, 30% in Harris shares. Bridge financing is in place, and we anticipate a combination of term loans and new bonds to both finance the acquisition debt and refinance parts of existing Harris and Exelis debt at what are historically low interest rates. Pro forma net leverage will be about 2.9x net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA at closing, with significant repayable debt and the opportunity to rapidly deleverage. This structure provides balance sheet flexibility and preserves our ability to invest for growth, while we reduced net leverage to about 1.5x by year 3. Of course, this is subject to approval by Exelis shareholders as well as customary regulatory approval. And we expect the transaction to close in June of this year.
On Slide 6, as you may know, Exelis has a very large pension liability relating to legacy ITT business, with an unfunded liability of $1.9 billion at the end of 2014. Current historically low interest rates should provide a strong positive bias to net underfunding over time. We've done significant due diligence work with specialists outside advisers. And with the high level of government cash reimbursements and this smoothing that's allowed in the recent [indiscernible] 21 legislation, pension funding requirements are clear and fully factored into our thinking. On a pro forma basis, pension liability as a percentage of market cap is well in line with defense peers.
Turning to Slide 7. This is a highly strategic and compelling combination that generate significant value for our customers. The complementarity between the 2 companies' technology and capabilities strengthens our core franchises and provides optionality for portfolio shaping. It also builds a stronger platform for growth and immediately creates significant scale and more balanced earnings for Harris. Cost synergies are meaningful, and the timing of the transaction is excellent given the confluence of an improving budget environment, low interest rates and a team with a background and experience to successfully integrate the 2 companies. So let me say a few words about each in turn.
Now turning to Slide 8. We bring together complementary technologies and capabilities that strengthen our core franchises in space and intelligence, advanced weather systems, air traffic management and tactical communications. On a pro forma basis, our classified business is about $1 billion in size, with significant growth potential. For example, by combining Exelis's world-class selector optical technology with our market-leading RF capability, we'll be able to offer responsive, multi-mission solutions to the intelligence community. In weather, a tighter linkage between Exelis's on-orbit sensors and Harris's ground processing capabilities can help customers increase performance, lower cost and improve time-to-market for new weather systems. By having increased access to unique data sets, we can accelerate our portion to value-added services and predictive analytics. In air traffic management, Exelis's strong in surveillance, while Harris is the leader in communications. And the combined company will be the prime contractor on 4 key FAA NextGen programs. And finally, our combined Tactical Communications businesses will drive significant scale efficiencies across our supply chain and our manufacturing assets. But the combination also provides a stronger platform for growth. And on Slide 9, we highlight a few examples, leveraging our complementary the national channels, pairing our world-leading radios with Exelis's night vision offering and putting our avionics onto Exelis's existing platforms. And then finally, accelerating growth in value-added services in geospatial, weather and airport operations.
So moving to Slide 10. This acquisition creates scale and improves our competitive position in the government market and also results in a more balanced earnings profile for Harris.
In Slide 11, our diligence work has been thorough, and we are confident we can achieve run rate cost synergies of $100 million to $120 million net of what is returned to customers through cost plus contracts and fixed price contracts that periodically reset. The breakout of savings is roughly 1/3 from consolidating headquarters and eliminating public company costs; 1/3 from operational improvements like manufacturing, supply chain and program efficiencies; and 1/3 from functional efficiencies and overhead reductions. The cash payback is under 2 years.
Now turning to Slide 12. Transaction value was $4.75 billion, a multiple of 9.3x 2014 EBITDA. We expect GAAP EPS to be slightly accretive in the first year and a significant contributor thereafter with free cash flow approaching $1 billion in year 4.
And then finally, on Slide 13. The timing for such a transformational acquisition is excellent, both internally and externally. Over the last 3 years since joining the company, we focused on improving fundamentals and shaping our portfolio. And in the face of a constrained government budget and declining revenue environment, we aggressively address our cost structure by taking restructuring actions and establishing a formal, company-wide operational excellence program. Our Harris Business Excellence program is now in its third year, and it's embedded in our culture. And the management team stands ready to integrate the 2 companies to achieve our cost synergy targets. A full time, senior level integration team is being assembled from the best of both companies and includes my direct oversight. The timing is also excellent from an external point of view. The U.S. government spending cycle has bottomed, and recent world events only stressed the importance of defense and national security spending. The president's DoD base budget for fiscal '16 is up about 8%. And even under sequestration, is up modestly with steady growth in the out-years. Interest rates are at historic lows, and we estimate that our pro forma cost of debt will be about 200 basis points below where Harris is to date, with a weighted average time to maturity of an additional 2 years. So as we enter an improving macro environment, our combined company becomes a strong platform for top line growth with our lower cost structure and greater operating leverage driving excellent earnings growth.
Now before opening the line for questions, I'd like to turn to Dave for his perspective on the transaction. Dave?"

We really ended up having a strong second quarter, as I mentioned, with orders very strong and revenue up solidly in energy, double-digit. We feel pretty good about that. But with oil sitting today below $50, we're sitting in a more pressure coming in the back half, coming in more the form of pricing. We have quite a few long-term contracts in CapRock. But even on the long-term contracts, we will see -- we do expect to see some pricing pressure. And that's going to pressure margin. That's going to pressure top line growth as well. So we would accommodated for that in our new earnings guidance for INS. And this is why we sort of decided to bring revenue down about 10%.

And some of that it's going to be, frankly, noncash. So there's a real benefit there that GAAP will mask. And it was a great some tax shelters. If you wouldn't mind, sort of providing a little bit of structure to that, I'd really appreciate it."

I think I got most of the points, but perhaps, between Mick and I, we'll hit your points. And if we miss one, let's keep going on with that. So on terms of the structure, we expect we will close in June. So there will be a number of transaction-based costs that will hit in June and will be impacting our fiscal '15. So as we go into fiscal '16, we do see the transaction to be slightly accretive. We do expect that, of course, we'll have the Exelis EBIT coming in in our fiscal '16. So that could be a positive. We see integration cost, which are going to be a little more front-end loaded, like a lot more front-end loaded, hitting fiscal '16 and will be more than the savings we get from integration. We do see in the first full fiscal year some benefit from the pickup of unamortized pension losses that we know exist at Exelis. And it's going to be offset by deal amortization, which will be substantial, and that will be in fiscal '16. So all of those pieces come together. And we do see a very slight accretion in our fiscal '16, again hinging on a close in June. Should that move into July or thereabouts, our fiscal '16, of course, will be impacted by that. question why the cost of borrowing about 4%. We do expect to be lower than that. And we were thinking, Mick, on our weighted average basis it will be -- sort of between 3% and 4%, about 3.5%. Other comments, Mick, on that?"

We see the intangible amortization to be in the range of about $130 million, $140 million, is our estimate of that. We do see savings starting to flow in in fiscal '16.

So today, we're announcing a transformational acquisition for Harris that will create significant and lasting value for our shareholders, our customers and our employees. With the acquisition of Exelis, we're increasing our scale, broadening our technology base and expanding our customer set in markets where we have decades of successful performance.
So before jumping into the transaction, Mick and I will briefly cover second quarter results and updated Harris guidance. And then, with Dave's help, walk you through the acquisition before opening the call for questions.
So turning to our second quarter earnings presentation, Slides 3 and 4. Harris performed well in the second quarter with earnings per share of $1.32. Operating results were solid, reflecting good execution and lower costs. Earnings per share also benefited from lower-than-expected taxes, including the 2014 R&D tax credit. 
Revenue for the company was down 1%, with growth in Government Communications Systems, international tactical radios and commercial CapRock more than offset by continued weakness in U.S. tactical radios and by the previously reported wind-down of 2 major IT Services programs. 
International revenue was up 5% in the quarter and was 31% of total revenue. And our strategy of expanding already strong franchises within the government market is providing revenue strength for the company.
So touching briefly on the segments. Government Communications Systems posted its fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth and generated excellent operating income, demonstrating yet again the strength of its core franchises in space and intelligence, avionics, air traffic management, geospatial imagery and weather. 
In the area of avionics, the F-35 program was a major revenue driver in the quarter, and we also received a $60 million follow-on contract for the LRIP 9. 
In air traffic management where we had a long-standing relationship with the FAA and recently expanded it with more than $900 million in awards over the last 3 years, we were awarded a 10-year, $98 million follow-on contract for OASIS II that supports flight services in Alaska by integrating real-time weather and flight planning information. 
Our strong franchises in space and intelligence have also been rich with expansion opportunities. Classified programs were a revenue driver in the second quarter. And following the close of the quarter, we had 2 strategic classified wins, a 3-year $23 million contract from a new customer for space situation awareness in support of Air Force missions and a 5-year $300 million single-award IDIQ contract to integrate the government's various intelligence systems. 
In our space business, we introduced 2 new space reflector products, a first-to-market, 5-meter, unfurlable Ka-band antenna serving the growing market for high-throughput satellites and new lightweight fixed mesh reflector where we also won our first order.
In RF Communications, the international tactical radio business continued to show strength, with higher revenue, good orders and solid opportunities firming up in our $2.5 billion opportunity pipeline. We signed a $101 million follow-on contract with a country in Africa and expect to begin booking orders against it late in the fiscal year. And we have visibility into several FMS orders in the pipeline that are moving fairly quickly towards award.
Australia's tactical modernization continues. And in the second quarter, we booked a $38 million order for wideband, handheld and manpack radios for the special forces, bringing orders to date to $560 million with an additional opportunity of about $90 million on the horizon. This latest award positions Harris very well as the future provider of wideband radios for a fully networked architecture of the Australian Defense Force.
In Iraq in the second quarter, we shipped a significant portion of the $99 million of orders booked in Q1, and additional requirements and opportunities were added to the pipeline. There was $1.6 billion authorized in GFY '15 for the Iraq Train and Equip Fund and another $1.3 billion in the president's budget request for 2016 that will support significant opportunities for Harris, making Iraq one of the larger components in our near-term tactical pipeline. 
Also in the quarter, we received a $50 million order from a nation in the Middle East for an integrated, countrywide tactical communications system based on Falcon III wideband radios. This nation represents a new special forces customer for us in the Middle East, and the award further strengthens our preferred supplier position in the region.
As expected, the U.S. tactical radio market remains constrained, but I'm encouraged by the recent pickup in procurement activity. The RFP for Rifleman Radio was finally released, and bids are due next week. And the final IDIQ contract is now much bigger than we had previously anticipated. $3.9 billion over 10 years, with $1.4 billion for the Rifleman itself and $2.5 billion for objective requirements like a 2-channel handheld radio, waveforms and vehicle adapters. 
We submitted a bid for the $390 million NextGen handheld portion of the SOCOM tactical communications modernization effort, which we followed over the coming months with RFPs for wideband HF and multichannel manpack radios. We now believe that the total SOCOM modernization opportunity could reach $900 million. 
Also in the quarter, we submitted a bid for an Air Force IDIQ contract to integrate and field battle management capabilities. 
Before leaving tactical, I'll make a few comments on the president's budget request. In tactical lines that support our business, we saw some pickup in GFY '16 across the Marines, Navy, Air Force and SOCOM to at least beginning to move in the right direction. For Army modernization, MNVR funding is higher over the 5-year period than in the previous year's budget, reflecting the program's good progress towards production. 
For HMS, funding was $65 million for GFY '16, which for us was a positive surprise given they're still sitting on about $300 million in unspent funds and, since the procurement, has been pushed out to GFY '17. In the out-years for HMS, the budget matches the procurement schedule, with funding picking up in GFY '17 to $291 million and rising to $470 million annually in '18 and out. 
In Public Safety, revenue was weak in the second quarter, and competitive pressures remain intense. Our execution is slowly progressing and will become more evident as the market improves. Process improvements in all the key areas are resulting in better program execution, lower cost, a more effective sales force and positive customer feedback on new product releases. We've made measurable progress, but we still have a lot more to do.
In Integrated Network Solutions, revenue was about as expected, with high single digit growth in CapRock, more than offset by the wind-down of 2 IT Services programs. Commercial CapRock revenue was up 15% driven by our previous Carnival Cruise Line win. And we had a particularly good quarter in energy despite the market turmoil, with revenue up 8% and orders up 23%.
In Healthcare Solutions, we continue to receive positive feedback from customers on our FusionFX software solution, and we're making progress in our efforts to find a partner for the business with better domain expertise and channels to market. 
We also recently decided to eliminate the INS headquarters function to reduce indirect expenses at the segment level, with Sheldon Fox, President of Government Communications Systems, named as the acting President of INS. This move also better aligns our CapRock business with GCS, where we know we have significant technology sharing opportunities that can help us bring more differentiated solutions to CapRock customers.
Now I'll turn it over to Mick to comment on guidance. Mick?"

We've included our typical segment details and financial highlights in Slides 5 through 8. But instead of reading them, in the interest of time, I'll go directly to Slide 9 for our updated fiscal 2015 outlook. 
We're increasing our fiscal '15 earnings per share guidance to a range of $4.95 to $5.05 per share from the previous range of $4.75 to $5 per share. Revenue guidance remains unchanged and is expected to decline 1% to 3%. Our guidance doesn't consider the acquisition being announced today. 
In RF Communications, we've narrowed the guidance range and expect revenue to be flat to down 2%. Within the segment, we expect Public Safety to be weaker, offset by higher international tactical. U.S. tactical expectations are unchanged. A bit stronger back half revenue compared to the first half due to the passing of a GFY '15 budget and timing of funds flowing down to customers. 
In Government Communications Systems, we now expect revenue to be up 2% to 4% and operating margin in the range of 15% to 15.5%. And that's a little bit better than before. We expect modest sequential revenue growth in the back half. 
In Integrated Network Solutions, first half revenue was generally in line with expectations. Strength in commercial CapRock, more than offset by program wind-downs in IT Services. While IT Services is showing signs of bottoming, we're no longer expecting any pickup in second half revenue, and we're assuming that revenue pressure in the CapRock energy market materializes due to the impact of lower oil prices. As a result, we now expect fiscal '15 revenue to be down about 10% and operating margin of about 7%. 
We're still expecting free cash flow of about 100% of net income and a full year tax rate between 30.5% and 31%, which translates into an average tax rate of about 33.8% in the back half. About half of the decrease in tax rate guidance is due to calendar 2014 R&D tax credit and the remainder from other favorable tax items.
With that, I'll now turn it over back to Bill to comment on the acquisition."

And as Pam mentioned earlier, I'm joined here in the room by Dave Melcher, President and CEO of Exelis, who's offering -- will offer a couple of comments as well. So let me turn now to the separate acquisition deck, and I'll begin on Slide 3. 
This acquisition brings together 2 engineering-driven companies with similar cultures that value technology and innovation to solve some of our customers' toughest, mission-critical challenges. The combined pro forma company has LTM revenue of $8.2 billion and EBITDA of about $1.6 billion. This powerful combination creates an industry innovator with much greater scale, providing a broad spectrum of technology-based advanced communications solutions.
Let me start by providing a high-level overview of Exelis and reviewing the transaction details before diving a bit more into the strategic rationale. 
So now turning to Slide 4. Exelis has a number of leading positions across diverse markets. Electronic Systems, which is about 29% of company revenue, is a leader in electronic warfare technologies for the Air Force and Navy. The principal strengths are in electronic protection and onboard processing on platforms such as the P8, the B-52, the C-130, the Apache helicopter and international F-16. 
Exelis's flagship product is the Integrated Defensive Electronics Countermeasures or IDECM for the F-18, a multibillion-dollar, decades-long program with about 400 systems delivered to date. 
About 21% of the company is Geospatial Systems, a leader in space and airborne sensing. Exelis is well known for their world-class space imaging business acquired about a decade ago from Kodak, the weather sensors, as well as their GPS technology. 
The imaging business has traditionally served the intelligence community but has more recently expanded to include commercial, international and unmanned vehicle payloads. 
Their products range from a 21-foot-wide mirror on the James Webb telescope down to small commercial payloads for the WorldView and GeoEye satellites. They provide the Gorgon Stare wide-area surveillance punch for defense UAVs and have recently launched CorvusEye, a smaller commercial version targeting the public safety international markets, demonstrating Exelis' skill in translating government technology to the commercial world. 
Exelis' weather payloads have been on all NOAA weather satellites launched since 1978. The CrIS or the Cross-track Infrared Sounder is a primary instrument on the Joint Polar Satellite System, and ABI, or the Advanced Baseline Imager, is the main mission sensor on GOES-R. ABI has also been selected as the main mission sensor for Japan's Himawari and South Korea's GEO-KOMPSAT-2A weather satellite. In GPS, Exelis has been on all U.S. GPS navigation systems ever launched and is currently delivering the first payloads for the GPS III program. 
Information Systems is about 34% of the company and provides full-life cycle, mission-critical solutions for customers like NASA, where Exelis manages 2 of NASA's largest communications contracts; and the FAA, where Exelis owns and operates the ADS-B network, a core element of the FAA's NextGen program. 
Night Vision and Tactical Communications represents about 13% of company revenue. Exelis has been the industry leader in night vision for over 50 years and is one of only 2 U.S. manufacturers of image intensification tubes. And the Tactical Communications business has a large installed base of more than 600,000 radios. 
The remaining 3% of Exelis provides composite aerostructures for commercial and military aircraft. 
They have 10,000 employees, including about 3,000 engineers, $3.25 billion in revenue and funded backlog of about $2.8 billion.
So turning to Slide 5 in the transaction details. Total purchase price is $4.75 billion at $23.75 per share, 70% in cash, 30% in Harris shares. Bridge financing is in place, and we anticipate a combination of term loans and new bonds to both finance the acquisition debt and refinance parts of existing Harris and Exelis debt at what are historically low interest rates. 
Pro forma net leverage will be about 2.9x net debt to adjusted EBITDA at closing, with significant prepayable debt and the opportunity to rapidly deleverage. This structure provides balance sheet flexibility and preserves our ability to invest for growth while we reduce net leverage to about 1.5x by year 3. Of course, this is subject to approval by Exelis shareholders as well as customary regulatory approval, and we expect the transaction to close in June of this year.
On Slide 6, as you may know, Exelis has a very large pension liability relating to a legacy ITT business, with an unfunded liability of $1.9 billion at the end of 2014. Current historically low interest rates should provide a strong positive bias to net underfunding over time. We've done significant due diligence work with specialists outside advisers. And with the high level of government cash reimbursements and the smoothing that's allowed in the recent MAP-21 legislation, pension funding requirements are clear and fully factored into our thinking. On a pro forma basis, pension liability as a percentage of market cap is well in line with defense peers.
Turning to Slide 7. This is a highly strategic and compelling combination that generates significant value for our customers. The complementarity between the 2 companies' technology and capabilities strengthens our core franchises and provides optionality for portfolio shaping. It also build a stronger platform for growth and immediately creates significant scale and more balanced earnings for Harris. 
Cost synergies are meaningful, and the timing of the transaction is excellent given the confluence of an improving budget environment, low interest rates and a team with the background and the experience to successfully integrate the 2 companies. So let me say a few words about each in turn.
Now turning to Slide 8. We bring together complementary technologies and capabilities that strengthen our core franchises in space and intelligence, advanced weather systems, air traffic management and Tactical Communications. On a pro forma basis, our classified business is about $1 billion in size, with significant growth potential. 
For example, by combining Exelis' world-class electrooptical technology with our market-leading RF capability, we'll be able to offer responsive multi-mission solutions to the intelligence community. 
In weather, a tighter linkage between Exelis' on-orbit sensors and Harris' ground processing capabilities can help customers increase performance, lower cost and improve time to market for new weather systems. By having increased access to unique datasets, we can accelerate our portion to value-added services and predictive analytics. 
In air traffic management, Exelis is strong in surveillance while Harris is the leader in communications. And the combined company will be the prime contractor on 4 key FAA NextGen programs. 
And finally, our combined Tactical Communications businesses will drive significant scale efficiencies across our supply chain and our manufacturing assets. 
But the combination also provides a stronger platform for growth. And on Slide 9, we highlight a few examples: leveraging our complementary international channels, pairing our world-leading radios with Exelis' night vision offering and putting our avionics onto Exelis' existing platforms and then finally, accelerating growth in value-added services in geospatial, weather and airport operations.
So moving to Slide 10. This acquisition creates scale and improves our competitive position in the government market and also results in a more balanced earnings profile for Harris.
In Slide 11, our diligence work has been thorough, and we are confident we can achieve run rate cost synergies of $100 million to $120 million net of what is returned to customers through cost-plus contracts and fixed-price contracts that periodically reset. 
The breakout in savings is roughly 1/3 from consolidating headquarters and eliminating public company costs; 1/3 from operational improvements like manufacturing, supply chain and program efficiencies; and 1/3 from functional efficiencies and overhead reductions. The cash payback is under 2 years.
Now turning to Slide 12. Transaction value was $4.75 billion, a multiple of 9.3x 2014 EBITDA. We expect GAAP EPS to be slightly accretive in the first year and a significant contributor thereafter, with free cash flow approaching $1 billion in year 4.
And then finally, on Slide 13. The timing for such a transformational acquisition is excellent, both internally and externally. Over the last 3 years since joining the company, we focused on improving fundamentals and shaping our portfolio. And in the face of a constrained government budget and declining revenue environment, we aggressively address our cost structure by taking restructuring actions and establishing a formal, company-wide operational excellence program. 
Our Harris Business Excellence program is now in its third year, and it's embedded in our culture. And the management team stands ready to integrate the 2 companies to achieve our cost synergy targets. A full-time, senior-level integration team is being assembled from the best of both companies and includes my direct oversight. 
The timing is also excellent from an external point of view. The U.S. government spending cycle has bottomed, and recent world events only stressed the importance of defense and national security spending. The president's DoD base budget for fiscal '16 is up about 8% and, even under sequestration, is up modestly, with steady growth in the out-years. Interest rates are at historic lows, and we estimate that our pro forma cost of debt will be about 200 basis points below where Harris is today, with a weighted average time to maturity of an additional 2 years. 
So as we enter an improving macro environment, our combined company becomes a strong platform for top line growth, with our lower cost structure and greater operating leverage driving excellent earnings growth.
Now before opening the line for questions, I'd like to turn to Dave for his perspective on the transaction. Dave?"

At that time, oil price was sitting around $75 a barrel plus or minus, and we had not yet seen really anything running into our financials. We ended up having a very strong second quarter, as I mentioned, with orders very strong and revenue up solidly in energy, double digit. We felt pretty good about that. But with oil sitting today below $50, we're seeing a little more pressure coming in the back half coming in -- more in the form of pricing. We have quite a few long-term contracts in CapRock. But even under long-term contracts, we will see -- we do expect to see some pricing pressure. And that's going to pressure margin. That's going to pressure top line growth as well. So we have accommodated for that in our new earnings guidance for INS. And this is why we sort of decided to bring revenue down about 10%.

We both are in the tactical radio business, have been there for quite some time. And we do see a lot of opportunities to work together in the international market through the channels that we happen to have, as I mentioned, about perhaps providing some products through the pretty strong existing Exelis international sales channels. And I'm very excited about the opportunities in value-added services, taking some of the capabilities and unique datasets that come out of the sensors that we have and packaging them in the -- in a way that we can sell to a very large fragment by growing quickly value-added services market. Frankly, here, Exelis is out ahead of us. They've got a very sizable business in this area, have made a few acquisitions in this space. And we've started -- we've been working on this for 1 year or 2, our team down at GCS.

As we go into fiscal '16, we do see the transaction to be slightly accretive. We do expect that, of course, we'll have the Exelis EBIT coming in, in our fiscal '16. So that's going to be a positive. We see integration costs, which are going to be a little bit more front-end loaded -- in fact, a lot more front-end loaded, hitting fiscal '16 and will be more than the savings we get from integration. We do see, in the first full fiscal year, some benefit from the pickup of unamortized pension losses that we know exist at Exelis. And it's going to be offset by deal amortization, which will be substantial, and that would be in fiscal '16. So all of those pieces come together. And we do see a very slight accretion in our fiscal '16, again, hinging on a close in June. Should that move into July or be thereabouts, our fiscal '16, of course, will be impacted by that.

But frankly, we're very encouraged by the strength and resilience of our international tactical pipeline. It's strong, remained about $2.5 billion. Even when we continue to book orders, it continues to refresh quickly. I've talked at some length about what's in it and the prospects on the horizon. A lot of activities moving in the pipeline, and we feel very good about what's happening in the back half in international tactical radio. So today, we see international tactical up a little bit more than we thought a quarter ago, offsetting a little bit of the softness we see in Public Safety. Our DoD outlook for the year really hasn't changed since we started the year."

So today, we're announcing a transformational acquisition for Harris that will create significant and lasting value for our shareholders, our customers and our employees. With the acquisition of Exelis, we're increasing our scale, broadening our technology base and expanding our customer set in markets where we have decades of successful performance.
So before jumping into the transaction, Mick and I will briefly cover second quarter results and updated Harris guidance, and then, with Dave's help, walk you through the acquisition before opening the call for questions.
So turning to our second quarter earnings presentation, Slides 3 and 4. Harris performed well in the second quarter with earnings per share of $1.32. Operating results were solid, reflecting good execution and lower costs. Earnings per share also benefited from lower-than-expected taxes, including the 2014 R&D tax credit. 
Revenue for the company was down 1%, with growth in Government Communications Systems, international tactical radios and commercial CapRock more than offset by continued weakness in U.S. tactical radios and by the previously reported wind-down of 2 major IT Services programs. 
International revenue was up 5% in the quarter and was 31% of total revenue. And our strategy of expanding already strong franchises within the government market is providing revenue strength for the company.
So touching briefly on the segments. Government Communications Systems posted its fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth and generated excellent operating income, demonstrating yet again the strength of its core franchises in space and intelligence, avionics, air traffic management, geospatial imagery and weather. 
In the area of avionics, the F-35 program was a major revenue driver in the quarter, and we also received a $60 million follow-on contract for the LRIP 9. 
In air traffic management, where we've had a long-standing relationship with the FAA and recently expanded it with more than $900 million in awards over the last 3 years, we were awarded a 10-year, $98 million follow-on contract for OASIS II that supports flight services in Alaska by integrating real-time weather and flight planning information. 
Our strong franchises in space and intelligence have also been rich with expansion opportunities. Classified programs were a revenue driver in the second quarter. And following the close of the quarter, we had 2 strategic classified wins, a 3-year $23 million contract from a new customer for space situation awareness in support of Air Force missions and a 5-year $300 million single-award IDIQ contract to integrate the government's various intelligence systems. 
In our space business, we introduced 2 new space reflector products, a first-to-market, 5-meter, unfurlable Ka-band antenna serving the growing market for high-throughput satellites; and a new lightweight fixed mesh reflector, where we also won our first order.
In RF Communications, the international tactical radio business continued to show strength, with higher revenue, good orders and solid opportunities firming up in our $2.5 billion opportunity pipeline. We signed a $101 million follow-on contract with a country in Africa and expect to begin booking orders against it late in the fiscal year. And we have visibility into several FMS orders in the pipeline that are moving fairly quickly towards award.
Australia's tactical modernization continues. And in the second quarter, we booked a $38 million order for wideband, handheld and manpack radios for the special forces, bringing orders to date to $560 million with an additional opportunity of about $90 million on the horizon. This latest award positions Harris very well as the future provider of wideband radios for a fully networked architecture of the Australian Defense Force.
In Iraq in the second quarter, we shipped a significant portion of the $99 million of orders booked in Q1, and additional requirements and opportunities were added to the pipeline. There was $1.6 billion authorized in GFY '15 for the Iraq Train and Equip Fund and another $1.3 billion in the president's budget request for 2016 that will support significant opportunities for Harris, making Iraq one of the larger components in our near-term tactical pipeline. 
Also in the quarter, we received a $50 million order from a nation in the Middle East for an integrated, countrywide tactical communications system based on Falcon III wideband radios. This nation represents a new special forces customer for us in the Middle East, and the award further strengthens our preferred supplier position in the region.
As expected, the U.S. tactical radio market remains constrained, but I'm encouraged by the recent pickup in procurement activity. The RFP for Rifleman Radio was finally released, and bids are due next week. And the final IDIQ contract is now much bigger than we had previously anticipated. $3.9 billion over 10 years, with $1.4 billion for the Rifleman itself and $2.5 billion for objective requirements like a 2-channel handheld radio, waveforms and vehicle adapters. 
We submitted a bid for the $390 million NextGen handheld portion of the SOCOM tactical communications modernization effort, which we followed over the coming months with RFPs for wideband HF and multichannel manpack radios. We now believe that the total SOCOM modernization opportunity could reach $900 million. 
Also in the quarter, we submitted a bid for an Air Force IDIQ contract to integrate and field battle management capabilities. 
Before leaving tactical, I'll make a few comments on the president's budget request. In tactical lines that support our business, we saw some pickup in GFY '16 across the Marines, Navy, Air Force and SOCOM, so at least beginning to move in the right direction. For Army modernization, MNVR funding is higher over the 5-year period than in the previous year's budget, reflecting the program's good progress towards production. 
For HMS, funding was $65 million for GFY '16, which for us was a positive surprise given they're still sitting on about $300 million in unspent funds and since the procurement has been pushed out to GFY '17. In the out-years for HMS, the budget matches the procurement schedule, with funding picking up in GFY '17 to $291 million and rising to $470 million annually in '18 and out. 
In Public Safety, revenue was weak in the second quarter, and competitive pressures remain intense. Our execution is slowly progressing and will become more evident as the market improves. Process improvements in all the key areas are resulting in better program execution, lower cost, a more effective sales force and positive customer feedback on new product releases. We've made measurable progress, but we still have a lot more to do.
In Integrated Network Solutions, revenue was about as expected, with high-single-digit growth in CapRock more than offset by the wind-down of 2 IT Services programs. Commercial CapRock revenue was up 15%, driven by our previous Carnival Cruise Line win. And we had a particularly good quarter in energy despite the market turmoil, with revenue up 8% and orders up 23%.
In Healthcare Solutions, we continue to receive positive feedback from customers on our FusionFX software solution, and we're making progress in our efforts to find a partner for the business with better domain expertise and channels to market. 
We also recently decided to eliminate the INS headquarters function to reduce indirect expenses at the segment level, with Sheldon Fox, President of Government Communications Systems, named as the acting President of INS. This move also better aligns our CapRock business with GCS, where we know we have significant technology-sharing opportunities that can help us bring more differentiated solutions to CapRock customers.
Now I'll turn it over to Mick to comment on guidance. Mick?"

We've included our typical segment details and financial highlights in Slides 5 through 8. But instead of reading them, in the interest of time, I'll go directly to Slide 9 for our updated fiscal 2015 outlook. 
We're increasing our fiscal '15 earnings per share guidance to a range of $4.95 to $5.05 per share from the previous range of $4.75 to $5 per share. Revenue guidance remains unchanged and is expected to decline 1% to 3%. Our guidance doesn't consider the acquisition being announced today. 
In RF Communications, we've narrowed the guidance range and expect revenue to be flat to down 2%. Within the segment, we expect Public Safety to be weaker, offset by higher international tactical. U.S. tactical expectations are unchanged. A bit stronger back half revenue compared to the first half due to the passing of a GFY '15 budget and timing of funds flowing down to customers. 
In Government Communications Systems, we now expect revenue to be up 2% to 4% and operating margin in the range of 15% to 15.5%. And that's a little bit better than before. We expect modest sequential revenue growth in the back half. 
In Integrated Network Solutions, first half revenue was generally in line with expectations. Strength in commercial CapRock, more than offset by program wind-downs in IT Services. While IT Services is showing signs of bottoming, we're no longer expecting any pickup in second half revenue, and we're assuming that revenue pressure in the CapRock energy market materializes due to the impact of lower oil prices. As a result, we now expect fiscal '15 revenue to be down about 10% and operating margin of about 7%. 
We're still expecting free cash flow of about 100% of net income and a full year tax rate between 30.5% and 31%, which translates into an average tax rate of about 33.8% in the back half. About half of the decrease in tax rate guidance is due to calendar 2014 R&D tax credit and the remainder from other favorable tax items.

And as Pam mentioned earlier, I'm joined here in the room by Dave Melcher, President and CEO of Exelis, who's offering -- will offer a couple of comments as well. So let me turn now to the separate acquisition deck, and I'll begin on Slide 3. 
This acquisition brings together 2 engineering-driven companies with similar cultures that value technology and innovation to solve some of our customers' toughest, mission-critical challenges. The combined pro forma company has LTM revenue of $8.2 billion and EBITDA of about $1.6 billion. This powerful combination creates an industry innovator with much greater scale, providing a broad spectrum of technology-based advanced communications solutions.
Let me start by providing a high-level overview of Exelis and reviewing the transaction details before diving a bit more into the strategic rationale. 
So now turning to Slide 4. Exelis has a number of leading positions across diverse markets. Electronic Systems, which is about 29% of company revenue, is a leader in electronic warfare technologies for the Air Force and Navy. The principal strengths are in electronic protection and onboard processing on platforms such as the P8, the B-52, the C-130, the Apache helicopter and international F-16. 
Exelis's flagship product is the Integrated Defensive Electronics Countermeasures or IDECM for the F-18, a multibillion-dollar, decades-long program with about 400 systems delivered to date. 
About 21% of the company is Geospatial Systems, a leader in space and airborne sensing. Exelis is well known for their world-class space imaging business, acquired about a decade ago from Kodak; their weather sensors; as well as their GPS technology. 
The imaging business has traditionally served the intelligence community but has more recently expanded to include commercial, international and unmanned vehicle payloads. 
Their products range from a 21-foot-wide mirror on the James Webb telescope down to small commercial payloads for the WorldView and GeoEye satellites. They provide the Gorgon Stare wide-area surveillance pods for defense UAVs and have recently launched CorvusEye, a smaller commercial version targeting the public safety international markets, demonstrating Exelis' skill in translating government technology to the commercial world. 
Exelis' weather payloads have been on all NOAA weather satellites launched since 1978. The CrIS or the Cross-track Infrared Sounder is a primary instrument on the Joint Polar Satellite System; and ABI, or the Advanced Baseline Imager, is the main mission sensor on GOES-R. ABI has also been selected as the main mission sensor for Japan's Himawari and South Korea's GEO-KOMPSAT-2A weather satellite. In GPS, Exelis has been on all U.S. GPS navigation systems ever launched and is currently delivering the first payloads for the GPS III program. 
Information Systems is about 34% of the company and provides full life cycle, mission-critical solutions for customers like NASA, where Exelis manages 2 of NASA's largest communications contracts; and the FAA, where Exelis owns and operates the ADS-B network, a core element of the FAA's NextGen program. 
Night Vision and Tactical Communications represents about 13% of company revenue. Exelis has been the industry leader in night vision for over 50 years and is one of only 2 U.S. manufacturers of image intensification tubes. And their Tactical Communications business has a large installed base of more than 600,000 radios. 
The remaining 3% of Exelis provides composite aerostructures for commercial and military aircraft. 
They have 10,000 employees, including about 3,000 engineers, $3.25 billion in revenue and a funded backlog of about $2.8 billion.
So turning to Slide 5 in the transaction details. Total purchase price is $4.75 billion at $23.75 per share, 70% in cash, 30% in Harris shares. Bridge financing is in place, and we anticipate a combination of term loans and new bonds to both finance the acquisition debt and refinance parts of existing Harris and Exelis debt at what are historically low interest rates. 
Pro forma net leverage will be about 2.9x net debt to adjusted EBITDA at closing, with significant prepayable debt and the opportunity to rapidly deleverage. This structure provides balance sheet flexibility and preserves our ability to invest for growth while we reduce net leverage to about 1.5x by year 3. Of course, this is subject to approval by Exelis shareholders as well as customary regulatory approval, and we expect the transaction to close in June of this year.
On Slide 6, as you may know, Exelis has a very large pension liability relating to a legacy ITT business, with an unfunded liability of $1.9 billion at the end of 2014. Current historically low interest rates should provide a strong positive bias to net underfunding over time. We've done significant due diligence work with specialist outside advisers. And with the high level of government cash reimbursements and the smoothing that's allowed in the recent MAP-21 legislation, pension funding requirements are clear and fully factored into our thinking. On a pro forma basis, pension liability as a percentage of market cap is well in line with defense peers.
Turning to Slide 7. This is a highly strategic and compelling combination that generates significant value for our customers. The complementarity between the 2 companies' technology and capabilities strengthens our core franchises and provides optionality for portfolio shaping. It also builds a stronger platform for growth and immediately creates significant scale and more balanced earnings for Harris. 
Cost synergies are meaningful, and the timing of the transaction is excellent given the confluence of an improving budget environment, low interest rates and a team with the background and the experience to successfully integrate the 2 companies. So let me say a few words about each in turn.
Now turning to Slide 8. We bring together complementary technologies and capabilities that strengthen our core franchises in space and intelligence, advanced weather systems, air traffic management and Tactical Communications. On a pro forma basis, our classified business is about $1 billion in size, with significant growth potential. 
For example, by combining Exelis' world-class electrooptical technology with our market-leading RF capability, we'll be able to offer responsive multi-mission solutions to the intelligence community. 
In weather, a tighter linkage between Exelis' on-orbit sensors and Harris' ground processing capabilities can help customers increase performance, lower cost and improve time to market for new weather systems. By having increased access to unique datasets, we can accelerate our push into value-added services and predictive analytics. 
In air traffic management, Exelis is strong in surveillance while Harris is the leader in communications. And the combined company will be the prime contractor on 4 key FAA NextGen programs. 
And finally, our combined Tactical Communications businesses will drive significant scale efficiencies across our supply chain and our manufacturing assets. 
But the combination also provides a stronger platform for growth. And on Slide 9, we highlight a few examples: leveraging our complementary international channels; pairing our world-leading radios with Exelis' night vision offering and putting our avionics onto Exelis' existing platforms; and then finally, accelerating growth in value-added services in geospatial, weather and airport operations.
So moving to Slide 10. This acquisition creates scale and improves our competitive position in the government market and also results in a more balanced earnings profile for Harris.
In Slide 11, our diligence work has been thorough, and we are confident we can achieve run rate cost synergies of $100 million to $120 million net of what is returned to customers through cost-plus contracts and fixed-price contracts that periodically reset. 
The breakdown of savings is roughly 1/3 from consolidating headquarters and eliminating public company costs; 1/3 from operational improvements like manufacturing, supply chain and program efficiencies; and 1/3 from functional efficiencies and overhead reductions. The cash payback is under 2 years.
Now turning to Slide 12. Transaction value was $4.75 billion, a multiple of 9.3x 2014 EBITDA. We expect GAAP EPS to be slightly accretive in the first year and a significant contributor thereafter, with free cash flow approaching $1 billion in year 4.
And then finally, on Slide 13. The timing for such a transformational acquisition is excellent, both internally and externally. Over the last 3 years since joining the company, we focused on improving fundamentals and shaping our portfolio. And in the face of a constrained government budget and declining revenue environment, we aggressively addressed our cost structure by taking restructuring actions and establishing a formal, company-wide operational excellence program. 
Our Harris Business Excellence program is now in its third year, and it's embedded in our culture. And the management team stands ready to integrate the 2 companies to achieve our cost synergy targets. A full-time, senior-level integration team is being assembled from the best of both companies and includes my direct oversight. 
The timing is also excellent from an external point of view. The U.S. government spending cycle has bottomed, and recent world events only stress the importance of defense and national security spending. The president's DoD base budget for fiscal '16 is up about 8% and, even under sequestration, is up modestly, with steady growth in the out-years. Interest rates are at historic lows, and we estimate that our pro forma cost of debt will be about 200 basis points below where Harris is today, with a weighted average time to maturity of an additional 2 years. 
So as we enter an improving macro environment, our combined company becomes a strong platform for top line growth, with our lower cost structure and greater operating leverage driving excellent earnings growth.
Now before opening the line for questions, I'd like to turn to Dave for his perspective on the transaction. Dave?"

We at Exelis are very excited about this unique opportunity to bring these 2 great and complementary companies together.

This transaction provides immediate value to Exelis shareholders as well as long-term upside potential from the equity ownership stake in Harris. We've made a lot of progress since the ITT spin to focus the company, and we've built a strong leadership team with talented and dedicated employees. I'm confident about the long-term prospects of the Exelis businesses and even more optimistic about the future ahead of us in combination with Harris. This is indeed an exciting day for us all. And with that, I'll turn it back to Bill."

On CapRock, we -- in the last call, I commented a bit on the impact of oil prices. At that time, oil price was sitting around $75 a barrel plus or minus, and we had not yet seen really anything running into our financials. We ended up having a very strong second quarter, as I mentioned, with orders very strong and revenue up solidly in energy, double digit. We felt pretty good about that. But with oil sitting today below $50, we're seeing a little more pressure coming in the back half coming in -- more in the form of pricing. We have quite a few long-term contracts in CapRock. But even under long-term contracts, we will see -- we do expect to see some pricing pressure, and that's going to pressure margin. That's going to pressure top line growth as well. So we have accommodated for that in our new earnings guidance for INS. And this is why we sort of decided to bring revenue down about 10%. Mick, did you want to offer any more on CapRock in the back half?"

And I'm very excited about the opportunities in value-added services, taking some of the capabilities and unique datasets that come out of the sensors that we have and packaging them in the -- in a way that we can sell to a very large, fragmented but growing quickly value-added services market.

So there are going to be a number of transaction-based costs that will hit in June and will be impacting our fiscal '15. As we go into fiscal '16, we do see the transaction to be slightly accretive. We do expect that, of course, we'll have the Exelis EBIT coming in, in our fiscal '16. So that's going to be a positive. We see integration costs, which are going to be a little bit more front-end loaded -- in fact, a lot more front-end loaded, hitting fiscal '16 and will be more than the savings we get from integration. We do see, in the first full fiscal year, some benefit from the pickup of unamortized pension losses that we know exist at Exelis. And it's going to be offset by deal amortization, which will be substantial, and that would be in fiscal '16. So all of those pieces come together. And we do see a very slight accretion in our fiscal '16, again, hinging on a close in June. Should that move into July or thereabouts, our fiscal '16, of course, will be impacted by that. You asked a question about the cost of borrowing at about 4%. We do expect it to be lower than that.

Our third quarter results were in line with our preliminary release issued April 21, which opened our debt financing window for the Exelis acquisition. We had a very successful bond offering, and we are making progress towards an expected June closing, and we'll discuss this further later in the call. 
So before turning to Slides 3 and 4 of the presentation, I'll point out that we're now reporting on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis to call out acquisition-related costs separately. And my comments today will be around non-GAAP performance, which excludes acquisition costs.
Third quarter earnings per share was $1.32, and benefited from a lower-than-expected tax rate that added $0.07 per share. Earnings per share also reflected good operating performance, benefiting from lower costs, excellent execution and a favorable product mix in RF communications and Government Communications Systems. 
Operating margin was 100 basis points higher than in the prior year, even with higher R&D investment, which was up 8% in the quarter, with some of the increase due to timing between the third and fourth quarters. 
Year-to-date, R&D revenue -- R&D investment is 5.6% of total revenue, with a significant portion being spent in the tactical radio business where we are aggressively developing product offerings for upcoming Army and SOCOM modernization procurements. 
Revenue for the company was $1.19 billion, down 6%, with tactical revenue growth more than offset by further weakness in Public Safety and the significant decline in Integrated Network Solutions, primarily from the wind down of 2 major programs in IT Services. As anticipated, revenue also declined in Government Communications Systems, largely due to a tough prior-year compare related to revenue from commercially hosted satellite payloads.
Orders in the quarter were $1.2 billion, up 
up 9% over the prior year and up 9% sequentially. Both RF Communications and Government Communications orders were up sequentially. 
Tactical Communications revenue was up 6% on continued international strength and some improvement in the U.S. market. Procurement activity picked up in March and April as GFY '15 procurement dollars were allocated to our DoD customers, including SOCOM where we received orders totaling $27 million to continue expanding their wideband networking capability. 
And momentum continues to build for U.S. tactical modernization. Just last week, Harris was awarded a 10-year $3.9 billion IDIQ contract for the Rifleman Radio, with an $800,000 initial order for qualification and test units. The Army expects to begin fielding Rifleman before the end of GFY '17.
The Army also recently kicked off their long-awaited procurement for the manpack. Everything was released in April and was quickly followed up, as well as the first quarterly tactical networking forum, which is intended to provide industry with a greater insight into the Army's upcoming procurement requirements. The final RFP is anticipated before the end of September, with an awarded 2Q GFY '16 and full rate production slated to begin in 4Q GFY '17. Preliminary information from the Army indicates a 10-year multi-award IDIQ contract with a ceiling value between $12 billion and $12.7 billion. 
And at SOCOM, last quarter, we resubmitted our bid on a $390 million handheld portion of SOCOM's modernization program with an award anticipated in September. And just a few days ago, SOCOM issued an RFI for their manpack, which we currently expect will be awarded in the spring of 2016. The total SOCOM modernization procurement, which will eventually include a high-frequency radio, could reach $900 million.
Now winning Rifleman Radio on top of the midtier MNVR radio a few years back, and now having a major procurements underway for both the Army manpack and SOCOM, is the culmination of a multiyear, multipronged effort for Harris. Over the last several years, we've worked hard to ensure Army procurements are open to commercial competition and have more recently pushed for a multivendor versus a single vendor award to ensure a level playing field with the program of record. We invested more in Iraq when the rest of industry was investing less, raising R&D spend by more than 20% through the downturn. And today, we see with one of the best lineups of tactical products and technologies than we've ever had. And with modernization procurements now underway and larger than anticipated, Harris is well-positioned to capture a significant multibillion-dollar opportunity.
We also see continued strength in the international tactical market where our business is now twice the size of our U.S. Tactical business. Recent orders include $25 million and $16 million from 2 NATO countries, highlighting there are broad installed base around the world, allows them to be more competitive than supplying radios to Allied countries where interoperability is a critical element for coalition actions. 
We also received orders of $22 million and $47 million from 2 countries in the Middle East. And from a country in Africa, we received $15 million in the quarter, plus another $74 million following the close of the quarter, to the next phase of modernization, bringing orders to date to $486 million. International market is healthy, and our opportunity pipeline remains solid at $2.5 billion and continues to replenish quickly.
In Government Communications Systems, we continued to build on our strong position with the FAA and received our third major NexGen award, an 8-year $238 million single award IDIQ for the Common Support Services Weather program to design and implement a system to provide real-time weather information across the National Airspace System. 
Also from the FAA, we booked $146 million in follow-on orders under our long-standing FBI program where we provide the ultra-reliable network backbone of the U.S. air traffic control system, connecting 4,500 different sites across the country. 
Our DoD business within GCS continues to ramp with F-35. And our strong intelligence franchise provides a platform for future growth. New classified contract wins in the quarter totaled $133 million, including a 3-year $23 million contract from a new customer for space situational awareness in support of Air Force missions. And also in the intelligence area, Harris was awarded a 5-year $300 million single vendor IDIQ contract to integrate various intelligence systems.
Now I'll turn it over to Mick to comment on segment results and guidance before providing an update on the pending Exelis acquisition. Mick?"

Moving to segment results on Slide 5. 
RF Communications orders were 395 -- $393 million compared to $405 million in the prior year and revenue was $451 million compared to $457 million last year. 
Tactical Communications revenue was $356 million, an increase of 6%, while orders were $286 million and about flat from prior year of $285 million. 
In Public Safety, market softness and intense competitive pressures continued. Orders were $107 million compared to $120 million in the prior year and revenue was $95 million compared to $122 million last year. 
Operating income for RF Communications was $151 million. And operating margin was a strong 33.5%, as the result of favorable mix, primarily in international, and from lower costs.
Turning to Government Communications Systems on Slide 6. 
Third quarter revenue was $455 million, down 5% compared to $477 million in the prior year. Higher revenue from the U.S. Navy's Commercial Broadband Satellite program and the NGA's foundation geo and Content Management program was more than offset by lower revenue from space customers and from an NOAA.s GOES-R weather program that's transitioned to and integration and test space. 
Segment operating income was $75 million. And operating margin was 16.4%, reflecting strong program performance and favorable product mix.
Turning to Integrated Network Solutions on Slide 7. 
Third quarter revenue was $299 million compared to $348 million in the prior year, with the decline primarily due to the rolloff of 2 large programs in IT Services. 
Operating income was $12 million compared to $21 million last year, primarily due to the wind down of the highly profitable NNCI contract. 
During the quarter, IT Services was awarded a 10-year $450 million single award IDIQ from the Defense Information Systems Agency to provide systems engineering and program management services to Crisis Management System or CMS, a secured video and voice communications network for senior U.S. government officials. This award extends our 30-year relationship supplying less critical component of our national security infrastructure. 
Also in IT Services, we were awarded a position on the $960 million multi-award IDIQ contract for network-centric solutions to Application Services. 
In CapRock, we strengthened our relationships with 2 long-standing energy customers. In the quarter, we received a $35 million order from a major offshore oil and gas driller for a 4-year extension of services across their fleet and 2 orders totaling $21 million from a leading energy services company, extending services across the United States and international locations.
Turning to Slide 8. 
The company generated free cash flow of $150 million, up from the prior year's $120 million as a result of lower CapEx with the completion of GCS's new engineering facility. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 29.9% in the quarter, lower than previously expected due to favorable 2014 tax settlements. As announced on April 21, we increased fiscal 2015 guidance for non-GAAP income from continuing operations per diluted share from a range of $4.95 to $5.05 to a range of $5 to $5.10, and updated revenue guidance from a decline in the range of 1% to 3% to an expected decline of about 4%. Fiscal 2015 non-GAAP guidance does not include any impact from pending acquisition of Exelis. GAAP results will include potential post closing revenue and income from Exelis, increased share count from the transaction and acquisition-related costs that are expected to be in the range of $270 million to $290 million, including $125 million in estimated make whole costs associated with the refinancing of Harris debt.
In RF Communications, to reflect further weakness in Public Safety, we now anticipate revenue to be down 3% to 4% and expect to be at the higher end of our previous operating margin guidance of 30% to 31%. 
In Government Communications Systems, revenue guidance is unchanged at up 2% to 4%, with operating margins slightly higher in the range of 15.5% to 16%. 
In Integrated Network Solutions, revenues now expected to be down 14% to 15% to reflect no improvement in the slow procurement environment for IT Services and an incrementally softer outlook at CapRock due to the impact of lower oil prices on the energy market, and to a lesser extent, in healthcare due to a slower revenue ramp. We now expect fiscal '15 operating margin of about 6%.
Expectations for free cash flow are unchanged at about 100% of non-GAAP net income. The tax rate is now expected to be 30%, which adds $0.05 earnings per share for the full year.

When we began fiscal 2015, we anticipated that the constrained budget environment and slow procurement would create some revenue challenges. In Government Communications Systems, where we are on a path to revenue growth for the fiscal year, our strategy of expanding already strong franchises helped overcome government budget constraints. 
In RF Communications, strength in international tactical markets has continued and we have a healthy set of opportunities. And while it's premature to call a bottom for the U.S. tactical market, we are seeing the back half improvement we expected and the momentum building on the large DoD modernization procurements is encouraging. 
And both the Government Communications Systems and RF Communications bottom line performance is excellent. 
So while we see positive indicators in our 2 largest businesses, our revenue challenges in fiscal '15 have been greater than anticipated in Public Safety and in Integrated Network Solutions. 
In Public Safety, the market is soft and competition is aggressive. We are focused on recovery and making measurable improvements in quality and execution. And we continued to build our leadership team and invest in new products. 
This quarter, we introduced our new x G 15 portable radio, which extends our full suite of product offerings and provides public service workers with P25 capability at a competitive price. We'll continue to focus on execution and delivering innovative products to our customers, which we believe will ultimately bear fruit as the market improves. 
In CapRock, while orders were up 24%, with energy orders up 27% in the quarter, we now expect first half revenue growth to turn into a revenue decline in the back half. Our customers are reacting to the persistently below oil prices and taking actions today that even they didn't contemplate just a few months ago. We are responding by not only working to lower costs, but to also provide technology over improve competitiveness and stickiness of our managed communications offering. 
In 3Q, we launched what we call CapRock 1, a multiband antenna and software that transparently switches between C, KU and Ka-bands to provide the most optimal and cost-effective transport medium and is getting great response in the marketplace.
The acquisition of Exelis builds on the stronger parts of Harris. It is an exciting transformative new chapter for the company. We've now secured debt financing for the acquisition and at very favorable terms, which we've outlined on Slide 10. 
A $1.3 billion variable-rate term loan is in place, which provides us a path for quickly deleveraging post acquisition. And we recently issued $2.4 billion in bonds, a portion of which will fund our redemption of $750 million in existing higher coupon Harris notes to take advantage of low interest rates and to extend maturities. The $2.4 billion in new bonds are at a weighted average coupon of about 3.7%. 
As anticipated, we significantly reduced our weighted average cost of debt, including the variable-rate term loans, to about 3.5%, 240 basis points below our previously weighted average cost of 5.9% and with 2 years longer time to maturity. 
We now expect year 1 net interest expense of $180 million to $190 million. And our balance sheet will retain ample liquidity with about $300 million of remaining cash on hand and an existing revolver of $1 billion.
While we received a second request from the Department of Justice, we don't expect any trust clearance to require the divestiture of any business or asset. The request for additional information is related to intellectual property needed to update the encryption in Skin Guards radios to meet an NSA 2024 requirement for secret communication. The Army is considering whether to upgrade the encryption capabilities of these older radios. And much of the information requested is intended to help determine if the Army has all intellectual property it would need to enable other companies to compete for that encryption modification work. We anticipate resolving these concerns promptly. 
The Exelis shareholder vote has been set for May 22, and we continued to expect the transaction to close in June. Integration planning is well underway, with a full time, highly experienced team led by Sheldon Fox, Group President of Government Communications Systems. Sheldon is a 31-year veteran of the government market, with deep experience in key areas where Exelis and Harris have complementary businesses, such as in space and intelligence, advanced weather systems and air traffic management. And of course, I am personally deeply involved and will spend a significant amount of my time over the next several years to ensure we capture the full value of this acquisition.
Since announcing the acquisition, the additional work we've done has only given us more confidence in delivering the previously estimated savings of $100 million to $120 million, which you'll remember is net of what flows back to our government customers. We are working hard to accelerate synergy capture and be at a running start on day 1 following the close. 
And with that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the lines for questions."

Let me sort of describe what's happening at CapRock and then come back to your question about the bandwidth, unsold piece of bandwidth. I mean, I think we had a really good start to the year, frankly, in the CapRock business. Revenue in the first half was up sort of in the 3% to 4% range, double-digit, low double digits on the commercial side, somewhat weak on the government side, but overall, up 3%, 4% in the first half. And we are pretty pleased with what was happening in the maritime space. And frankly, in the energy side, the orders in the last 2 quarters were quite good and surprisingly good, up about 25% in Q2 and again a little bit better then in Q3. We do see revenue deteriorating sequentially and year-over-year in the third quarter and we expect that to continue, Carter, into the fourth quarter as well. It will be down probably double digits in the fourth quarter on the energy side. We do see CapRock as a whole being flat to down for the year and down in the back half. With oil that's now sitting in the $50 to $60 per barrel range, I think customers today continued to react quite aggressively to what's happening in the global oil markets are trying to anticipate where pricing is going to be. They're taking very, very aggressive actions. And like I said in my remarks, somewhat unpredictable as where we were and what they were going to do back in early part of February. They're doing a lot of restructuring. Capital spending is coming down. They're parking maybe scrapping some rigs, delaying the awards and acceptance of new rigs. And that's certainly having a pretty big impact on our business. And when we look at what's happening in this downturn versus last several downturns in this global oil market, we see rig count down about 30% by the end of March. I would say we are maybe a little bit half -- a little beyond halfway through the downturn, so we do expect further erosion. We do expect it's going to carry into '16 and be a tough '16 for us. We think the road here is going to be slow in terms of stabilization and a long recovery. But I would say for CapRock as a whole, recall we've talked about the size of our energy business at about $400 million, that's about 8% of total Harris as we speak today, even smaller when we combine it with Exelis. So it's not a big part of the company, but we do expect further pressure in the fourth quarter and the next year on the energy side and that's going to drag down CapRock. Now in terms of the bandwidth, fortunately, we do see quite aggressive growth in the maritime space, particularly in the cruise industry, and that's offsetting some of the pressure that we are seeing in the energy space in some of the bandwidth that we've procured for the energy side."

We are bidding on commercial terms. It's a competitive procurement. It looks much the same as what happened on the Fisher program a number of years back where it was a IDIQ shootout between us and Telus on task orders. It was completely commercial. Initial awards for Rifleman are going to be LPTA, Low Price Technically Acceptable. And over time, there will be some best value type opportunities for us. What's interesting is that the ceiling value is quite high at about $3.9 billion. And in a Rifleman, the RFP, it was both the single channel Rifleman, but also they started to introduce a 2-channel handheld over time. And how that gets shaped and when that's being brought in is still all to be determined. So I like our position. I like our scale. I like the advantage our technology brings. I like the fact that our commercial model allows us to continue to invest to advance our technology and compete with whatever we happen to have. And our margins today on the handheld look great. And it's even after competing with players around the world on the program. So I kind of like what we have in the outlook for our business, both top line and bottom line."

And it came in a lot higher than we thought. And it's encouraging to see the manpack moving forward. It's encouraging to see the SOCOM modernization moving forward and an RFI out last week for the man part manpack's part of SOCOM, so we're starting to see some movement here. And as I said in my remarks, it's tough to call the bottom. We are seeing both sequentially and year-over-year improvement in the second half, and we expected that would happen in the beginning of the year. If you look at the budgets, there's still a lot going on in DC. The outlook, I think, it looks good for us. It's improving a little bit. What's happening coming out of the house warm services, we see what the markup is that they cannot with last week I guess was early last week, which shows the base at the BCA cap, but a substantial amount of OCO funding in total at $585 billion, in line with where the President happens to be. And if it follows the way we seen the past years in terms of how that budget flows down to tactical radio line items, I think if it follows that, it will follow where the President happens to be. And the President put in a budget for which would showed good funding, good funding growth on the MNVR product, good funding growth on HMS and good funding increases in the other services. And I think that's quite encouraging. For the HMS, which is the Rifleman and the manpack, there is a lot of unspent funds still available. And as you look at the ramp, it ramps relatively quickly over the next 2 to 3 years to close $0.5 billion a year, again, in the President's budget, a couple of years out, which I think is quite encouraging. So you put the fact that the Army's moving forward with the budget, next to the fact that the funding appears to be ramping pretty nicely over the next 3 or 4 years, you put those 2 pieces together and I think the outlook for our business in DoD is pretty positive."

What's interesting is that even though there is the price of oil has come down quite precipitously over the last 6 to 9 months, that piece of our pipeline on a percentage basis and a dollar basis is where it was 6 to 9 months ago even after booking a number of large orders, including one that came out just a couple of weeks ago in Africa at $74 million. So we feel pretty good about that. We do know that we have a large opportunity coming over the next several years in Iraq. We do know that the country doesn't have a lot of foreign currency reserves. Oil is going to be a bigger impact on Iraq, but likely, fortunately, it's sort of underpinned by U.S. funding, both in the fiscal '15 budget, as well as in the fiscal '16 proposed O.C. elders funding for the Iraq train and equip funding. So that does backstop was a little bit for oil-related concerns in Iraq. So overall, not a concern today. It doesn't mean that it won't comment front of us over the next number of quarters. On FX, I think you know we do business around the world in U.S. dollars. And we compete against, in some markets, euro-based competitors. So over time, that could have some marginal effect if we don't adjust price and if the euro doesn't improve. We see that in the last couple of weeks the euro getting a little bit better. But today, no big effect. But again, if the dollar strengthens considerably from where we are today, there could be some effect that we have to react with pricing."

So I think given the current U.S. government environment and some of the pretty healthy shipments we've made internationally I think it's a pretty good result, that 0.87 in order for numbers for the year and our guidance for the year, book-to-bill of the year needs to come in pretty close to 1. So we do know that there is some big opportunities that are coming our way in Q4 and good again to point out that we received a pretty good-sized award on the international side, $74 million is a week or 2 ago and I tink that's a good positive sign. From I'm not sure I'll go into fiscal '16, but certainly, as we look out through the balance the year, which is only a couple of months away to the end of our fiscal year, we are down year-to-date about 1% on tactical revenues. Obviously the be up low single digits, call it a couple of percent. We do need to see some good growth in the fourth quarter, that's going to come with some good orders at we do expect. Later, and the international side has been trending pretty well. It's up high single digits. We expect it to be up high single digits for the year, which means Q4 is going to be about that same level of performance. On the DoD side, it has been softer on a year-to-date basis. We are down sort of in that 20% range. We are guiding to be in our guidance that we expressed a little bit a while ago on where RF as a whole is, embedded in that is DoD down 10% to 12%. And probably on a better set of that, may be down about 10%. That requires Q4 to be quite good. We typically see, Gautam, Q4 being stronger sequentially from Q3. And we saw that last year where Q4 revenues about double where we were in Q3 last year. We did see some positive movement in DoD in Q3 and it was reassuring to be -- to see positive growth after a number of quarters in a row of being down year-over-year on DoD. And I'm also glad to see that the pipeline for DoD is getting a little bit better than we were 3 months ago. Last time we spoke, it was about $900 million or so in size. Today, it's about $970 million. There is more that's weighted towards proposal, closure and finalization. So the nearer-term pipeline is looking a little bit better and it gave us a bit more comfort that Q4 will be better year-over-year and better sequentially than Q3. And we are counting on that to hit the guidance and again come back to a full year of close to a 1 on book-to-bill. I won't speculate at the moment going into fiscal '16. I'll have more to say about that once we closed Exelis and report our earnings in late July."

And frankly, over the last 3 years since I've been here, the nature of competition, the mix of DoD in international even within international by country is shifting around, increasing our systems business, and yet still through all of that, we are sitting here with north of 30% margins in that segment. And even within spending a lot more on R&D and some shifts happening in Public Safety. So overall, we are finding a way to take costs out, preserve pricing and still preserve our position in margins that are north of 30%. So we're doing I think a very good job of managing our cost structure and prudently managing our investment pattern to maintain very strong margin in that segment. I do think that, over time, will it become more price competitive? It is price competitive. The nature of we're compete against may shift a little bit, but the scale advantage we have in our RF facility in Rochester, the ability to drive technology differentiation in our product over time are going to be the deciding factors over time in this business to be able to preserve margins north of 30% for the RF comp segment. So I'm not -- we're not putting our heads in the sand saying that there aren't dynamics happening here, but I am confident in the team's ability to continue to find opportunities to both take costs out, as well as invest in differentiation, to maintain a pricing environment that allows the whole margins pretty strong in that segment."

I do think that we've had internally within Harris some executional challenges, which we're quickly working to solve. They're not going to solve themselves over the course of a number of months or quarters. It's going to take some time, but we're really focused on this. And we are seeing execution slowly improving. We do see quality improving. We do see customer satisfaction coming back up. We're making progress in developing and expanding our product offering. Our team, our leadership team is getting better. So overall, I see us improving. And you'll start to see the benefits of those investments and performance showing through the markets starting to come back. Longer-term, we will see some growth in this marketplace. More than half of the market is analog that will go digital. We do know over the longer period of time, the market will shift to LTE. It's good to see that first net with the spectrum auctions has been well-funded. It's a well more than $7 billion rates in margin. I know it's going to happen overtime. It's not going to be the next 2 to 3 years, but beyond that, there's going to be an impact on Harris Corporation.

They are particularly interested in. There's a number to mention, it's heat, it's range, a lot of things, but weight is a very, very important factor. The objective requirement, if I remember right, was at 14.6 pounds, but clearly, they want it to be a lot less than that[ph]. And this is been something we are laser focused on and have been working on for a couple of years. And we do see opportunities to take weight down pretty substantially over the near-term and go below the objective requirements and actually perhaps even get better than some of the threshold requirements for weight. So no big surprise. One of the, I guess, maybe a surprise was on the size of the ceiling value on the IDIQ at $12 billion to $12.7 billion. It's way above that what we had -- what we were thinking. And of course, it includes services and spares, sustainment costs and a bunch of other things that are well beyond, I think, the opportunities set in front of Harris.

On the Rifleman, it's starting off as a single channel radio, but interestingly, SOCOM is a 2-channel radio. And I would expect that as the Army introduced a potential 2-channel into the Rifleman competition, that whatever is being sold into SOCOM could eventually work its way into regular Army over time.

Another way to look at this is this just looking at what's the President's budget 4, 5 years out, close to $0.5 billion per year for HMS, which is Rifleman and manpack, if you just take that over 10-year basis, $5 billion in terms of opportunity set, that's sort of in line with what we had thought before about the opportunity for Harris in terms of HMS, both manpack and Rifleman.

Now the other 1 that's sort of a the drawing board is saner, which is a Small Airborne Networking Radio which is SRW W and W, C and that, I think the Army still evaluating that. I think I saw on the President's budget, I don't know if it's in the house services markup, but a small amount, like $6 million, to push forward that competition on saner. You will see when the budgets are actually set if that's happening. But if there's a small amount of money, that will be an encouragement that the Army is moving forward putting SRW and WNW into a saner product for the Airborne side. And if that happens, I do think that we are going to be very, very well-positioned to compete there. And also, quite frankly, with Exelis, with the to a 1 project that they have, there is an opportunity to actually put some of our own technology into that box, if you will, and offer greater capability for the airborne tier as we combine ourselves with Exelis.

Our third quarter results were in line with our preliminary release issued April 21, which opened our debt financing window for the Exelis acquisition. We had a very successful bond offering, and we're making progress towards an expected June closing. And we'll discuss this further later in the call.
So before turning to Slides 3 and 4 of the presentation, I'll point out that we're now reporting on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis to call out acquisition-related costs separately, and my comments today will be around non-GAAP performance, which excludes acquisition cost.
Third quarter earnings per share was $1.32 and benefited from a lower-than-expected tax rate that added $0.07 per share. Earnings per share also reflected good operating performance, benefiting from lower cost, excellent execution and a favorable product mix in RF Communications and Government Communications Systems. Operating margin was 100 basis points higher than in the prior year even with higher R&D investment, which was up 8% in the quarter, with some of the increase due to timing between the third and fourth quarters. Year-to-date, R&D revenue -- R&D investment is 5.6% of total revenue, with a significant portion being spent in the tactical radio business, where we're aggressively developing product offerings for upcoming Army and SOCOM modernization procurements.
Revenue for the company was $1.19 billion, down 6%, with tactical revenue growth more than offset by further weakness in Public Safety and a significant decline in Integrated Network Solutions primarily from the wind-down of 2 major programs in IT Services. As anticipated, revenue also declined in Government Communications Systems largely due to a tough prior year compare related to revenue from commercially hosted satellite payloads. Orders in the quarter were $1.2 billion, up 9% over the prior year and up 9% sequentially. Both RF Communications and Government Communications orders were up sequentially. Tactical Communications revenue was up 6% on continued international strength and some improvement in the U.S. market.
Procurement activity picked up in March and April as GFY '15 procurement dollars were allocated to our DoD customers, including SOCOM, where we received orders totaling $27 million to continue expanding their wideband networking capability.
And momentum continues to build for U.S. tactical modernization. Just last week, Harris was awarded a 10-year $3.9 billion IDIQ contract for the Rifleman Radio, with an $800,000 initial order for qualification and test units. The Army expects to begin fielding Rifleman before the end of GFY '17.
The Army also recently kicked off their long-awaited procurement for the manpack. A draft RFP was released in April and was quickly followed up by an industry day as well as the first quarterly tactical networking forum, which is intended to provide the industry with greater insight into the Army's upcoming procurement requirements. The final RFP is anticipated before the end of September, with an awarded 2Q GFY '16 and full rate production slated to begin in 4Q GFY '17. Preliminary information from the Army indicates a 10-year multi-award IDIQ contract with a ceiling value between $12 billion and $12.7 billion.
And at SOCOM, last quarter, we resubmitted our bid on a $390 million handheld portion of SOCOM's modernization program with an award anticipated in September. And just a few days ago, SOCOM issued an RFI for their manpack, which we currently expect will be awarded in the spring of 2016. The total SOCOM modernization procurement, which will eventually include a high-frequency radio, could reach $900 million.
Now winning Rifleman Radio, on top of the mid-tier MNVR radio a few years back and now having major procurements underway for both the Army manpack and SOCOM, is the culmination of a multiyear, multipronged effort for Harris. Over the last several years, we've worked hard to ensure Army procurements are open to commercial competition and then more recently pushed for a multi-vendor versus a single vendor award to ensure a level playing field with the program of record. We invested more in IRAD when the rest of industry was investing less, raising R&D spend by more than 20% through the downturn. And today, we stand with one of the best lineups of tactical products and technologies than we've ever had. And with modernization procurements now underway and larger than anticipated, Harris is well positioned to capture a significant multibillion-dollar opportunity.
We also see continued strength in the international tactical market, where our business is now twice the size of our U.S. tactical business. Recent orders include $25 million and $16 million from 2 NATO countries, highlighting that our broad installed base around the world allows us to be more competitive in supplying radios to allied countries, where interoperability is a critical element for coalition actions.
We also received orders of $22 million and $47 million from 2 countries in the Middle East. And from a country in Africa, we received $15 million in the quarter plus another $74 million following the close of the quarter to the next phase of modernization, bringing orders to date to $486 million. The international market is healthy, and our opportunity pipeline remains solid at $2.5 billion and continues to replenish quickly.
In Government Communications Systems, we continue to build on our strong position with the FAA and received our third major NextGen award, an 8-year $238 million single award IDIQ for the Common Support Services-Weather program to design and implement a system to provide real-time weather information across the National Airspace System. Also from the FAA, we booked $146 million in follow-on orders under our long-standing FTI program, which will [ph] provide the ultra-reliable network backbone of the U.S. air traffic control system, connecting 4,500 different sites across the country.
Our DoD business within GCS continues to ramp with F-35, and our strong intelligence franchise provides a platform for future growth. New classified contract wins in the quarter totaled $133 million, including a 3-year $23 million contract from a new customer for space situational awareness in support of Air Force missions. And also, in the intelligence area, Harris was awarded a 5-year $300 million single-vendor IDIQ contract to integrate various intelligence systems.
Now I'll turn it over to Mick to comment on segment results and guidance before providing an update on the pending Exelis acquisition. Mick?"
177934,291993192,803758,"Harris Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","L3Harris Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone.

Moving to segment results on Slide 5. RF Communications orders were 395 -- $393 million compared to $405 million in the prior year, and revenue was $451 million compared to $457 million last year. Tactical Communications revenue was $356 million, an increase of 6%, while orders were $286 million and about flat from prior year of $285 million. In Public Safety, market softness and intense competitive pressures continued. Orders were $107 million compared to $120 million in the prior year, and revenue was $95 million compared to $122 million last year. Operating income for RF Communications was $151 million, and operating margin was a strong 33.5% as a result of favorable mix, primarily in international, and from lower cost.
Turning to Government Communications Systems on Slide 6. Third quarter revenue was $455 million, down 5% compared to $477 million in the prior year. Higher revenue from the U.S. Navy's Commercial Broadband Satellite program and the NGA's Foundation GEOINT Content Management program was more than offset by lower revenue from space customers and from an NOAA's GOES-R weather program that's transitioned to an integration and test space. Segment operating income was $75 million, and operating margin was 16.4%, reflecting strong program performance and favorable product mix.
Turning to Integrated Network Solutions on Slide 7. Third quarter revenue was $299 million compared to $348 million in the prior year, with the decline primarily due to the roll-off of 2 large programs in IT Services. Operating income was $12 million compared to $21 million last year, primarily due to the wind-down of the highly profitable NMCI contract.
During the quarter, IT Services was awarded a 10-year $450 million single award IDIQ from the Defense Information Systems Agency to provide systems engineering and program management services for Crisis Management System, or CMS, a secure video and voice communications network for senior U.S. government officials. This award extends our 30-year relationship supplying this critical component of our national security infrastructure. Also, in IT Services, we were awarded a position on the $960 million multi-award IDIQ contract for network-centric solutions to application services.
In CapRock, we strengthened our relationships with 2 long-standing energy customers. In the quarter, we received a $35 million order from a major offshore oil and gas driller for a 4-year extension of services across their fleet and 2 orders totaling $21 million from a leading energy services company, extending services across the United States and international locations.
Turning to Slide 8. The company generated free cash flow of $150 million, up from the prior year's $120 million as a result of lower CapEx with the completion of GCS' new engineering facility. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 29.9% in the quarter, lower than previously expected due to favorable 2014 tax settlement.
As announced on April 21, we increased fiscal 2015 guidance for non-GAAP income from continuing operations per diluted share from a range of $4.95 to $5.05 to a range of $5 to $5.10, and updated revenue guidance from a decline in the range of 1% to 3% to an expected decline of about 4%. Fiscal 2015 non-GAAP guidance does not include any impact from pending acquisition of Exelis. GAAP results will include potential post-closing revenue and income from Exelis, increased share count from the transaction and acquisition-related costs that are expected to be in the range of $270 million to $290 million, including $125 million in estimated make-whole costs associated with the refinancing of Harris debt.
In RF Communications, to reflect further weakness in Public Safety, we now anticipate revenue to be down 3% to 4% and expect to be at the higher end of our previous operating margin guidance of 30% to 31%. In Government Communications Systems, revenue guidance is unchanged at up 2% to 4%, with operating margin slightly higher in the range of 15.5% to 16%. In Integrated Network Solutions, revenue is now expected to be down 14% to 15% to reflect no improvement in the slow procurement environment for IT Services and an incrementally softer outlook at CapRock due to the impact of lower oil prices on the energy market and, to a lesser extent, in health care due to a slower revenue ramp. We now expect fiscal '15 operating margin of about 6%.
Expectations for free cash flow are unchanged at about 100% of non-GAAP net income. The tax rate is now expected to be 30%, which adds $0.05 earnings per share for the full year.
Back to you, Bill."

When we began fiscal 2015, we anticipated that the constrained budget environment and slow procurement would create some revenue challenges. In Government Communications Systems, where we're on a path to revenue growth for the fiscal year, our strategy of expanding already strong franchises helped overcome government budget constraints. In RF Communications, strength in international tactical markets has continued, and we have a healthy set of opportunities. And while it's premature to call a bottom for the U.S. tactical market, we're seeing the back half improvement we expected, and the momentum building on the large DoD modernization procurements is encouraging. And both Government Communications Systems and RF Communications bottom line performance is excellent.
So while we see positive indicators in our 2 largest businesses, our revenue challenges in fiscal '15 have been greater than anticipated in Public Safety and in Integrated Network Solutions. In Public Safety, the market is soft, and competition is aggressive. We're focused on recovery and making measurable improvements in quality and execution, and we continue to build our leadership team and invest in new products. This quarter, we introduced our new XG-15 portable radio, which extends our full suite of product offerings and provides public service workers with P25 capability at a competitive price. We'll continue to focus on execution and delivering innovative products to our customers, which we believe will ultimately bear fruit as the market improves.
In CapRock, while orders were up 24%, with energy orders up 27% in the quarter, we now expect first half revenue growth to turn into a revenue decline in the back half. Our customers are reacting to the persistently low oil prices and taking actions today that even they didn't contemplate just a few months ago. We are responding by not only working to lower cost, but to also provide technology that will improve the competitiveness and stickiness of our managed communications offering. In 3Q, we launched what we call CapRock One, a multiband antenna and software that transparently switches between C-, Ku- and Ka-bands to provide the most optimal and cost-effective transport medium and is getting great response in the marketplace.
The acquisition of Exelis builds on the stronger parts of Harris. It is an exciting, transformative new chapter for the company. We've now secured debt financing for the acquisition and at very favorable terms, which we've outlined on Slide 10. A $1.3 billion variable-rate term loan is in place, which provides us a path for quickly deleveraging post acquisition. And we recently issued $2.4 billion in bonds, a portion of which will fund our redemption of $750 million in existing higher coupon Harris notes to take advantage of low interest rates and to extend maturities. The $2.4 billion of new bonds are at a weighted average coupon of about 3.7%. As anticipated, we significantly reduced our weighted average cost of debt, including the variable-rate term loans, to about 3.5%, 240 basis points below our previously weighted average cost of 5.9% and with 2 years longer time to maturity. We now expect year 1 net interest expense of $180 million to $190 million. And our balance sheet will retain ample liquidity with about $300 million of remaining cash on hand and an existing revolver of $1 billion.
While we received a second request from the Department of Justice, we don't expect any trust clearance to require the divestiture of any business or asset. The request for additional information is related to intellectual property needed to update the encryption in SINCGARS radios to meet an NSA 2024 requirement for secret communication. The Army is considering whether to upgrade the encryption capabilities of these older radios, and much of the information requested is intended to help determine if the Army has all intellectual property it would need to enable other companies to compete for that encryption modification work. We anticipate resolving these concerns promptly.
The Exelis shareholder vote has been set for May 22, and we continue to expect the transaction to close in June. Integration planning is well underway with a full-time, highly experienced team led by Sheldon Fox, Group President of Government Communications Systems. Sheldon is a 31-year veteran of the government market, with deep experience in key areas where Exelis and Harris have complementary businesses, such as in space and intelligence, advanced weather systems and air traffic management. And of course, I'm personally deeply involved and will spend a significant amount of my time over the next several years to ensure we capture the full value of this acquisition. Since announcing the acquisition, the additional work we've done has only given us more confidence in delivering the previously estimated savings of $100 million to $120 million, which you'll remember is net of what flows back through to our government customers. We're working hard to accelerate synergy capture and be at a running start on day 1 following the close.
And with that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the lines for question."

What sort of declines are you expecting now at this point? And do you think you'll hit a sort of run rate decline by the end of the year that levels off?

There's -- let me sort of describe what's happening at CapRock and then come back to your question about the bandwidth, unsold piece of bandwidth. I mean, I think we had a really good start to the year, frankly, in the CapRock business. Revenue in the first half was up sort of in the 3% or 4% range, double digit -- low double digits on the commercial side, somewhat weak on the government side, but overall up 3%, 4% in the first half. And we are pretty pleased with what's happening in the maritime space. And frankly, in the energy side, the orders in the last 2 quarters were quite good and surprisingly good, up about 25% in Q2 and again a little bit better than in Q3. We do see revenue deteriorating sequentially and year-over-year in the third quarter, and we expect that to continue, Carter, into the fourth quarter as well. It will be down probably double digits in the fourth quarter on the energy side. We do see CapRock, as a whole, being flat to down for the year and down in the back half. With oil that's now sitting in the $50 to $60 per barrel range, I think customers today continue to react quite aggressively to what's happening in the global oil markets or trying to anticipate where pricing is going to be. They're taking very, very aggressive actions and, like I said in my remarks, somewhat unpredictable as, where we were and what they were going to do back in early part of February, they're doing a lot of restructuring. Capital spending is coming down. They're parking and maybe scrapping some rigs, delaying the awards and acceptance of new rigs. And that's certainly having a pretty big impact on our business. And when we look at what's happening in this downturn versus the last several downturns in this global oil market, we see rig count down about 30% by the end of March. I would say we're maybe a little bit half -- a little beyond halfway through the downturn. So we do expect further erosion. We do expect it's going to carry into '16 and be a tough '16 for us. We think the road here is going to be slow in terms of stabilization and a long recovery, but I would say for CapRock as a whole, recall we've talked about the size of our energy business at about $400 million. That's about 8% of total Harris as we speak today, even smaller when we combine it with Exelis. So it's not a big part of the company, but we do expect further pressure in the fourth quarter in the next year on the energy side, and that's going to drag down CapRock. Now in terms of the bandwidth, fortunately, we do see quite aggressive growth in the maritime space, particularly in the cruise industry, and that's offsetting some of the pressure that we're seeing in the energy space in some of the bandwidth that we've procured for the energy side."

It happened over multiple years in both ensuring competition was -- it was open to competition. We compete for those procurement dollars and that we invest that had a radio that met the requirements, in fact was in some ways more advanced than where the program of record was at the time and -- which is what's caused some change in the competitive landscape for the Rifleman Radio on -- we are bidding on commercial terms. It's a competitive procurement. It looks much the same as what happened on the Fisher [ph] program a number of years back, where it was a IDIQ shootout between us and Telus on task orders. It was completely commercial. Initial awards for Rifleman are going to be LPTA, low price technically acceptable. And over time, there'll be some best-value-type opportunities for us. What's interesting is that the ceiling value is quite high at about $3.9 billion. And in a Rifleman, the RFP, it was both the single-channel Rifleman. But also, they started to introduce a 2-channel handheld over time. And how that gets shaped and when that's being brought in is still all to be determined. So I like our position. I like our scale. I like the advantage our technology brings. I like the fact that our commercial model allows us to continue to invest to advance our technology and compete with whatever we happen to have. And our margins today on the handheld look great, and it's even after competing with players around the world on the Fisher [ph] program. So I kind of like what we have in the outlook for our business, both top line and bottom line."

And just the fact that the Rifleman IDIQ was awarded last week -- and I don't think you've ever heard me say sooner than we expected when I talk about government contracting, and it was sooner than we expected by a number of months. And that's because of the changes that happened in the industrial base for the Rifleman Radio, I believe. And it came in a lot higher than we thought. And it's encouraging to see the manpack moving forward. It's encouraging to see the SOCOM modernization moving forward and an RFI out last week for the man part manpack part of SOCOM. So we're starting to see some movement here. And as I said in my remarks, it's tough to call the bottom. We are seeing both sequentially and year-over-year improvement in the second half, and we expected that would have happened at the beginning of the year. If you look at the budgets, there's still a lot going on in D.C. The outlook, I think, it looks good for us. It's improving a little bit, looking at what's happening, coming out of the House Armed Services. We see what the markup is that they cannot -- with last week, I guess it was early last week, which shows the base at the BCA cap but a substantial amount of OCO funding in total at $585 billion, in line with where the President happens to be. And if it follows the way we've seen the past years in terms of how that budget flows down to tactical radio line items, I think if it follows that, it will follow where the President happens to be. And the President put in a budget for -- which would show good funding, good funding growth on the MNVR product, good funding growth on HMS and good funding increases in the other services. And I think that's quite encouraging. For the HMS, which is the Rifleman and the manpack, there's a lot of unspent funds still available. And as you look at the ramp, it ramps relatively quickly over the next 2 to 3 years to close $0.5 billion a year, again, in the President's budget, a couple of years out, which, I think, is quite encouraging. So you put the fact that the Army is moving forward with the budget next to the fact that the funding appears to be ramping pretty nicely over the next 3 or 4 years, you put those 2 pieces together, and I think the outlook for our business in DoD is pretty positive."

We do know that more than half of our international pipeline is in the Middle East, Northern Africa region. What's interesting is that even though that the price of oil has come down quite precipitously over the last 6 to 9 months, that piece of our pipeline, on a percentage basis and a dollar basis, is where it was 6 to 9 months ago even after booking a number of large orders, including one that came out just a couple of weeks ago in Africa at $74 million. So we feel pretty good about that. We do know that we have a large opportunity coming over the next several years in Iraq. We do know that the country doesn't have a lot of foreign currency reserves. Oil is going to be a bigger impact on Iraq, but likely, fortunately, it's sort of underpinned by U.S. funding both in the fiscal '15 budget as well as in the fiscal '16 proposed O.C. elders [ph] funding for the Iraq train and equip funding. So that does backstop us a little bit for any oil-related concerns in Iraq. So overall, not a concern today. It doesn't mean that, that won't come in front of us over the next number of quarters. On FX, I think you know we do business around the world in U.S. dollars, and we compete against, in some markets, euro-based competitors. So over time, that could have some marginal effect if we don't adjust price and if the euro doesn't improve. We've seen that, at least in the last couple of weeks, the euro getting a little bit better, but today, no big effect. But again, if the dollar strengthens considerably from where we are today, there could be some effect that we have to react with pricing."

So I think given the current U.S. government environment and some of the pretty healthy shipments we've made internationally, I think it's a pretty good result, that 0.87. In order to hit our numbers for the year and our guidance for the year, book-to-bill for the year needs to come in pretty close to 1. So we do know that there is some big opportunities that are coming our way in Q4, and it's good again to point out that we received a pretty good-sized award on the international side, $74 million just 1 week or 2 ago. And that's, I think, a good positive sign. From -- I'm not sure I'll go into fiscal '16, but certainly, as we look out through the balance of the year, which is only a couple of months away, to the end of our fiscal year, we're down year-to-date about 1% on tactical revenues. Obviously, to be up low single digits on the year, call it a couple of percent, we do need to see some good growth in the fourth quarter. That's going to come with some good orders that we do expect. The international side has been trending pretty well. It's up high single digits. We expect it to be up high single digits for the year, which means Q4 is going to be about that same level of performance. On the DoD side, it has been softer on a year-to-date basis. We're down sort of in that 20% range. We're guiding to be in our guidance that we expressed a little bit a while ago on where RF as a whole is. Embedded in that is DoD down 10% to 12% and probably on the better side of that, maybe down about 10%. That requires Q4 to be quite good. We typically see, Gautam, Q4 being stronger sequentially from Q3. And we saw that last year, where Q4 revenue is about double where we were in Q3 last year. We did see some positive movement in DoD in Q3 and it was reassuring to be -- to see positive growth after a number of quarters in a row of being down year-over-year on DoD. And I'm also glad to see that the pipeline for DoD is getting a little bit better than we were 3 months ago. Last time we spoke, it was about $900 million or so in size. Today, it's about $970 million. There is more that's weighted towards proposal, closure and finalization. So the nearer-term pipeline is looking a little bit better, and that gives us a bit of more comfort that Q4 will be better year-over-year and better sequentially than Q3. And we're counting on that to hit the guidance and to again come back to a full year of close to a 1 on book-to-bill. I won't speculate at the moment going into fiscal '16. I'll have more to say about that once we close Exelis and report our earnings in late July."

So overall, we're finding a way to take cost out, preserve pricing and still preserve our position in margins that are north of 30%. So we're doing, I think, a very good job of managing our cost structure and prudently managing our investment pattern to maintain very strong margin in that segment. I do think that over time, will it become more price competitive? It is price competitive. The nature of who we'll compete against may shift a little bit, but the scale advantage we have in our RF facility in Rochester, the ability to drive technology differentiation in our product over time are going to be the deciding factors over time in this business to be able to preserve margins north of 30% for the RF com segment. So I'm not -- we're not putting our head in the sand, saying that there aren't dynamics happening here, but I am confident in the team's ability to continue to find opportunities to both take cost out as well as invest in differentiation to maintain a pricing environment that allows the whole margins pretty strong in that segment."

The objective requirement, if I remember right, was at 14.6 pounds, but clearly, they want it to be a lot less than that. And this has been something we're laser focused on and have been working on for a couple of years. And we do see opportunities to take weight down pretty substantially over the near term and go below the objective requirements and actually perhaps even get better than some of the threshold requirements for weight, so no big surprise. One of the, I guess, maybe a surprise was on the size of the ceiling value on the IDIQ at $12 billion to $12.7 billion. It's way above what we had -- what we were thinking. And of course, it includes services and spares, sustainment cost and a bunch of other things that's well beyond, I think, the opportunities set in front of Harris.

On the Rifleman, it's starting off as a single-channel radio, but interestingly, SOCOM is a 2-channel radio. And I would expect that as the Army introduced a potential 2-channel into the Rifleman competition that whatever is being sold into SOCOM could eventually work its way into regular Army over time. And I see more of that shift happening as opposed to -- from Army out, at least from the way I would see it today."

And we'll know more about that as the Army really starts to rethink the way they want the network to be given a lot of technology changes. I think the same thing is probably going to happen on the manpack. I guess when I step back and I look at the size of where the Rifleman is, they're almost $4 billion. And the size of manpack at north of $12 billion -- so $16 billion to $17 billion were the ceiling value between these 2 contracts, it's far above, I think, the opportunities set over 10 years for Harris. Another way to look at this is just looking at what's in the President's budget 4, 5 years out, close to $0.5 billion per year for HMS, which is Rifleman and manpack, if you just take that over a 10-year basis, $5 billion in terms of opportunity set, that's sort of in line with what we had thought before about the opportunity for Harris in terms of HMS, both manpack and Rifleman. I mean, again, that's sort of speculation on my part, but that's the way I would look at sizing the overall opportunity for the company."

I think they're supposed to decide sometime this summer, which would have Link 16 with SRW in it and that -- we'll have a play in that if the Army goes in that direction, and that's still to be determined. Now the other one that that's sort of on the drawing board is SANR, which is the Small Airborne Networking Radio, which is SRW, WNW being that, I think the Army is still evaluating that. I think I saw on the President's budget -- I don't know if it's in the House Armed Services markup, but a small amount, like $6 million, to push forward that competition on SANR. You will see when the budgets are actually set, that's happening. But if there's a small amount of money, that will be an encouragement that the Army is moving forward, putting SRW and WNW into a SANR product for the airborne side. And if that happens, I do think that we're going to be very, very well positioned to compete there. And also, quite frankly, with Exelis, with the ARC-201 project they have, there is an opportunity to actually put some of our own technology into that box, if you will, and offer greater capability for the airborne tier as we combine ourselves with Exelis. So I think there's a lot of different ways of looking at how we might be able to extend our strong presence on the ground to the airborne tier."

Our third quarter results were in line with our preliminary release issued April 21, which opened our debt financing window for the Exelis acquisition. We had a very successful bond offering, and we're making progress towards an expected June closing. And we'll discuss this further later in the call.
So before turning to Slides 3 and 4 of the presentation, I'll point out that we're now reporting on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis to call out acquisition-related costs separately, and my comments today will be around non-GAAP performance, which excludes acquisition cost.
Third quarter earnings per share was $1.32 and benefited from a lower-than-expected tax rate that added $0.07 per share. Earnings per share also reflected good operating performance, benefiting from lower cost, excellent execution and a favorable product mix in RF Communications and Government Communications Systems. Operating margin was 100 basis points higher than in the prior year even with higher R&D investment, which was up 8% in the quarter, with some of the increase due to timing between the third and fourth quarters. Year-to-date, R&D revenue -- R&D investment is 5.6% of total revenue, with a significant portion being spent in the tactical radio business, where we're aggressively developing product offerings for upcoming Army and SOCOM modernization procurements.
Revenue for the company was $1.19 billion, down 6%, with tactical revenue growth more than offset by further weakness in Public Safety and a significant decline in Integrated Network Solutions primarily from the wind-down of 2 major programs in IT Services. As anticipated, revenue also declined in Government Communications Systems largely due to a tough prior year compare related to revenue from commercially hosted satellite payloads. Orders in the quarter were $1.2 billion, up 9% over the prior year and up 9% sequentially. Both RF Communications and Government Communications orders were up sequentially. Tactical Communications revenue was up 6% on continued international strength and some improvement in the U.S. market.
Procurement activity picked up in March and April as GFY '15 procurement dollars were allocated to our DoD customers, including SOCOM, where we received orders totaling $27 million to continue expanding their wideband networking capability.
And momentum continues to build for U.S. tactical modernization. Just last week, Harris was awarded a 10-year $3.9 billion IDIQ contract for the Rifleman Radio, with an $800,000 initial order for qualification and test units. The Army expects to begin fielding Rifleman before the end of GFY '17.
The Army also recently kicked off their long-awaited procurement for the manpack. A draft RFP was released in April and was quickly followed up by an industry day as well as the first quarterly tactical networking forum, which is intended to provide the industry with greater insight into the Army's upcoming procurement requirements. The final RFP is anticipated before the end of September, with an awarded 2Q GFY '16 and full rate production slated to begin in 4Q GFY '17. Preliminary information from the Army indicates a 10-year multi-award IDIQ contract with a ceiling value between $12 billion and $12.7 billion.
And at SOCOM, last quarter, we resubmitted our bid on a $390 million handheld portion of SOCOM's modernization program with an award anticipated in September. And just a few days ago, SOCOM issued an RFI for their manpack, which we currently expect will be awarded in the spring of 2016. The total SOCOM modernization procurement, which will eventually include a high-frequency radio, could reach $900 million.
Now winning Rifleman Radio, on top of the mid-tier MNVR radio a few years back and now having major procurements underway for both the Army manpack and SOCOM, is the culmination of a multiyear, multipronged effort for Harris. Over the last several years, we've worked hard to ensure Army procurements are open to commercial competition and then more recently pushed for a multi-vendor versus a single vendor award to ensure a level playing field with the program of record. We invested more in IRAD when the rest of industry was investing less, raising R&D spend by more than 20% through the downturn. And today, we stand with one of the best lineups of tactical products and technologies than we've ever had. And with modernization procurements now underway and larger than anticipated, Harris is well positioned to capture a significant multibillion-dollar opportunity.
We also see continued strength in the international tactical market, where our business is now twice the size of our U.S. tactical business. Recent orders include $25 million and $16 million from 2 NATO countries, highlighting that our broad installed base around the world allows us to be more competitive in supplying radios to allied countries, where interoperability is a critical element for coalition actions.
We also received orders of $22 million and $47 million from 2 countries in the Middle East. And from a country in Africa, we received $15 million in the quarter plus another $74 million following the close of the quarter to the next phase of modernization, bringing orders to date to $486 million. The international market is healthy, and our opportunity pipeline remains solid at $2.5 billion and continues to replenish quickly.
In Government Communications Systems, we continue to build on our strong position with the FAA and received our third major NextGen award, an 8-year $238 million single award IDIQ for the Common Support Services-Weather program to design and implement a system to provide real-time weather information across the National Airspace System. Also from the FAA, we booked $146 million in follow-on orders under our long-standing FTI program, where we provide the ultra-reliable network backbone of the U.S. air traffic control system, connecting 4,500 different sites across the country.
Our DoD business within GCS continues to ramp with F-35, and our strong intelligence franchise provides a platform for future growth. New classified contract wins in the quarter totaled $133 million, including a 3-year $23 million contract from a new customer for space situational awareness in support of Air Force missions. And also, in the intelligence area, Harris was awarded a 5-year $300 million single-vendor IDIQ contract to integrate various intelligence systems.
Now I'll turn it over to Mick to comment on segment results and guidance before providing an update on the pending Exelis acquisition. Mick?"

Moving to segment results on Slide 5. RF Communications orders were 395 -- $393 million compared to $405 million in the prior year, and revenue was $451 million compared to $457 million last year. Tactical Communications revenue was $356 million, an increase of 6%, while orders were $286 million and about flat from prior year of $285 million. In Public Safety, market softness and intense competitive pressures continued. Orders were $107 million compared to $120 million in the prior year, and revenue was $95 million compared to $122 million last year. Operating income for RF Communications was $151 million, and operating margin was a strong 33.5% as a result of favorable mix, primarily in international, and from lower cost.
Turning to Government Communications Systems on Slide 6. Third quarter revenue was $455 million, down 5% compared to $477 million in the prior year. Higher revenue from the U.S. Navy's Commercial Broadband Satellite program and the NGA's Foundation GEOINT Content Management program was more than offset by lower revenue from space customers and from an NOAA's GOES-R weather program that's transitioned to an integration and test space. Segment operating income was $75 million, and operating margin was 16.4%, reflecting strong program performance and favorable product mix.
Turning to Integrated Network Solutions on Slide 7. Third quarter revenue was $299 million compared to $348 million in the prior year, with the decline primarily due to the roll-off of 2 large programs in IT Services. Operating income was $12 million compared to $21 million last year, primarily due to the wind-down of the highly profitable NMCI contract.
During the quarter, IT Services was awarded a 10-year $450 million single award IDIQ from the Defense Information Systems Agency to provide systems engineering and program management services for Crisis Management System, or CMS, a secure video and voice communications network for senior U.S. government officials. This award extends our 30-year relationship supplying this critical component of our national security infrastructure. Also, in IT Services, we were awarded a position on the $960 million multi-award IDIQ contract for network-centric solutions to application services.
In CapRock, we strengthened our relationships with 2 long-standing energy customers. In the quarter, we received a $35 million order from a major offshore oil and gas driller for a 4-year extension of services across their fleet and 2 orders totaling $21 million from a leading energy services company, extending services across the United States and international locations.
Turning to Slide 8. The company generated free cash flow of $150 million, up from the prior year's $120 million as a result of lower CapEx with the completion of GCS' new engineering facility. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 29.9% in the quarter, lower than previously expected due to favorable 2014 tax settlement.
As announced on April 21, we increased fiscal 2015 guidance for non-GAAP income from continuing operations per diluted share from a range of $4.95 to $5.05 to a range of $5 to $5.10, and updated revenue guidance from a decline in the range of 1% to 3% to an expected decline of about 4%. Fiscal 2015 non-GAAP guidance does not include any impact from pending acquisition of Exelis. GAAP results will include potential post-closing revenue and income from Exelis, increased share count from the transaction and acquisition-related costs that are expected to be in the range of $270 million to $290 million, including $125 million in estimated make-whole costs associated with the refinancing of Harris debt.
In RF Communications, to reflect further weakness in Public Safety, we now anticipate revenue to be down 3% to 4% and expect to be at the higher end of our previous operating margin guidance of 30% to 31%. In Government Communications Systems, revenue guidance is unchanged at up 2% to 4%, with operating margin slightly higher in the range of 15.5% to 16%. In Integrated Network Solutions, revenue is now expected to be down 14% to 15% to reflect no improvement in the slow procurement environment for IT Services and an incrementally softer outlook at CapRock due to the impact of lower oil prices on the energy market and, to a lesser extent, in health care due to a slower revenue ramp. We now expect fiscal '15 operating margin of about 6%.
Expectations for free cash flow are unchanged at about 100% of non-GAAP net income. The tax rate is now expected to be 30%, which adds $0.05 earnings per share for the full year.
Back to you, Bill."
177934,291993192,804005,"Harris Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, May 05, 2015",2015-05-05,"Earnings Calls","L3Harris Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Mick. When we began fiscal 2015, we anticipated that the constrained budget environment and slow procurement would create some revenue challenges.

When we began fiscal 2015, we anticipated that the constrained budget environment and slow procurement would create some revenue challenges. In Government Communications Systems, where we're on a path to revenue growth for the fiscal year, our strategy of expanding already strong franchises helped overcome government budget constraints. In RF Communications, strength in international tactical markets has continued, and we have a healthy set of opportunities. And while it's premature to call a bottom for the U.S. tactical market, we're seeing the back half improvement we expected, and the momentum building on the large DoD modernization procurements is encouraging. And both Government Communications Systems and RF Communications bottom line performance is excellent.
So while we see positive indicators in our 2 largest businesses, our revenue challenges in fiscal '15 have been greater than anticipated in Public Safety and in Integrated Network Solutions. In Public Safety, the market is soft, and competition is aggressive. We're focused on recovery and making measurable improvements in quality and execution, and we continue to build our leadership team and invest in new products. This quarter, we introduced our new XG-15 portable radio, which extends our full suite of product offerings and provides public service workers with P25 capability at a competitive price. We'll continue to focus on execution and delivering innovative products to our customers, which we believe will ultimately bear fruit as the market improves.
In CapRock, while orders were up 24%, with energy orders up 27% in the quarter, we now expect first half revenue growth to turn into a revenue decline in the back half. Our customers are reacting to the persistently low oil prices and taking actions today that even they didn't contemplate just a few months ago. We are responding by not only working to lower cost, but to also provide technology that will improve the competitiveness and stickiness of our managed communications offering. In 3Q, we launched what we call CapRock One, a multiband antenna and software that transparently switches between C-, Ku- and Ka-bands to provide the most optimal and cost-effective transport medium and is getting great response in the marketplace.
The acquisition of Exelis builds on the stronger parts of Harris. It is an exciting, transformative new chapter for the company. We've now secured debt financing for the acquisition and at very favorable terms, which we've outlined on Slide 10. A $1.3 billion variable-rate term loan is in place, which provides us a path for quickly deleveraging post acquisition. And we recently issued $2.4 billion in bonds, a portion of which will fund our redemption of $750 million in existing higher coupon Harris notes to take advantage of low interest rates and to extend maturities. The $2.4 billion of new bonds are at a weighted average coupon of about 3.7%. As anticipated, we significantly reduced our weighted average cost of debt, including the variable-rate term loans, to about 3.5%, 240 basis points below our previously weighted average cost of 5.9% and with 2 years longer time to maturity. We now expect year 1 net interest expense of $180 million to $190 million. And our balance sheet will retain ample liquidity with about $300 million of remaining cash on hand and an existing revolver of $1 billion.
While we received a second request from the Department of Justice, we don't expect any trust clearance to require the divestiture of any business or asset. The request for additional information is related to intellectual property needed to update the encryption in SINCGARS radios to meet an NSA 2024 requirement for secret communication. The Army is considering whether to upgrade the encryption capabilities of these older radios, and much of the information requested is intended to help determine if the Army has all intellectual property it would need to enable other companies to compete for that encryption modification work. We anticipate resolving these concerns promptly.
The Exelis shareholder vote has been set for May 22, and we continue to expect the transaction to close in June. Integration planning is well underway with a full-time, highly experienced team led by Sheldon Fox, Group President of Government Communications Systems. Sheldon is a 31-year veteran of the government market, with deep experience in key areas where Exelis and Harris have complementary businesses, such as in space and intelligence, advanced weather systems and air traffic management. And of course, I'm personally deeply involved and will spend a significant amount of my time over the next several years to ensure we capture the full value of this acquisition. Since announcing the acquisition, the additional work we've done has only given us more confidence in delivering the previously estimated savings of $100 million to $120 million, which you'll remember is net of what flows back through to our government customers. We're working hard to accelerate synergy capture and be at a running start on day 1 following the close.

There's -- let me sort of describe what's happening at CapRock and then come back to your question about the bandwidth, unsold piece of bandwidth. I mean, I think we had a really good start to the year, frankly, in the CapRock business. Revenue in the first half was up sort of in the 3% or 4% range, double digit -- low double digits on the commercial side, somewhat weak on the government side, but overall up 3%, 4% in the first half. And we are pretty pleased with what's happening in the maritime space. And frankly, in the energy side, the orders in the last 2 quarters were quite good and surprisingly good, up about 25% in Q2 and again a little bit better than in Q3. We do see revenue deteriorating sequentially and year-over-year in the third quarter, and we expect that to continue, Carter, into the fourth quarter as well. It will be down probably double digits in the fourth quarter on the energy side. We do see CapRock, as a whole, being flat to down for the year and down in the back half. With oil that's now sitting in the $50 to $60 per barrel range, I think customers today continue to react quite aggressively to what's happening in the global oil markets or trying to anticipate where pricing is going to be. They're taking very, very aggressive actions and, like I said in my remarks, somewhat unpredictable as, where we were and what they were going to do back in early part of February, they're doing a lot of restructuring. Capital spending is coming down. They're parking and maybe scrapping some rigs, delaying the awards and acceptance of new rigs. And that's certainly having a pretty big impact on our business. And when we look at what's happening in this downturn versus the last several downturns in this global oil market, we see rig count down about 30% by the end of March. I would say we're maybe a little bit half -- a little beyond halfway through the downturn. So we do expect further erosion. We do expect it's going to carry into '16 and be a tough '16 for us. We think the road here is going to be slow in terms of stabilization and a long recovery, but I would say for CapRock as a whole, recall we've talked about the size of our energy business at about $400 million. That's about 8% of total Harris as we speak today, even smaller when we combine it with Exelis. So it's not a big part of the company, but we do expect further pressure in the fourth quarter in the next year on the energy side, and that's going to drag down CapRock. Now in terms of the bandwidth, fortunately, we do see quite aggressive growth in the maritime space, particularly in the cruise industry, and that's offsetting some of the pressure that we're seeing in the energy space in some of the bandwidth that we've procured for the energy side."

It's a competitive procurement. It looks much the same as what happened on the Fisher [ph] program a number of years back, where it was a IDIQ shootout between us and Telus on task orders. It was completely commercial. Initial awards for Rifleman are going to be LPTA, low price technically acceptable. And over time, there'll be some best-value-type opportunities for us. What's interesting is that the ceiling value is quite high at about $3.9 billion. And in a Rifleman, the RFP, it was both the single-channel Rifleman. But also, they started to introduce a 2-channel handheld over time. And how that gets shaped and when that's being brought in is still all to be determined. So I like our position. I like our scale. I like the advantage our technology brings. I like the fact that our commercial model allows us to continue to invest to advance our technology and compete with whatever we happen to have. And our margins today on the handheld look great, and it's even after competing with players around the world on the Fisher [ph] program.

And just the fact that the Rifleman IDIQ was awarded last week -- and I don't think you've ever heard me say sooner than we expected when I talk about government contracting, and it was sooner than we expected by a number of months. And that's because of the changes that happened in the industrial base for the Rifleman Radio, I believe. And it came in a lot higher than we thought. And it's encouraging to see the manpack moving forward. It's encouraging to see the SOCOM modernization moving forward and an RFI out last week for the manpack; part of SOCOM. So we're starting to see some movement here. And as I said in my remarks, it's tough to call the bottom. We are seeing both sequentially and year-over-year improvement in the second half, and we expected that would have happened at the beginning of the year. If you look at the budgets, there's still a lot going on in D.C. The outlook, I think, it looks good for us. It's improving a little bit, looking at what's happening, coming out of the House Armed Services. We see what the markup is that they cannot -- with last week, I guess it was early last week, which shows the base at the BCA cap but a substantial amount of OCO funding in total at $585 billion, in line with where the President happens to be. And if it follows the way we've seen the past years in terms of how that budget flows down to tactical radio line items, I think if it follows that, it will follow where the President happens to be. And the President put in a budget for -- which would show good funding, good funding growth on the MNVR product, good funding growth on HMS and good funding increases in the other services. And I think that's quite encouraging. For the HMS, which is the Rifleman and the manpack, there's a lot of unspent funds still available. And as you look at the ramp, it ramps relatively quickly over the next 2 to 3 years to close $0.5 billion a year, again, in the President's budget, a couple of years out, which, I think, is quite encouraging. So you put the fact that the Army is moving forward with the budget next to the fact that the funding appears to be ramping pretty nicely over the next 3 or 4 years, you put those 2 pieces together, and I think the outlook for our business in DoD is pretty positive."

We do know that more than half of our international pipeline is in the Middle East, Northern Africa region. What's interesting is that even though that the price of oil has come down quite precipitously over the last 6 to 9 months, that piece of our pipeline, on a percentage basis and a dollar basis, is where it was 6 to 9 months ago even after booking a number of large orders, including one that came out just a couple of weeks ago in Africa at $74 million. So we feel pretty good about that. We do know that we have a large opportunity coming over the next several years in Iraq. We do know that the country doesn't have a lot of foreign currency reserves. Oil is going to be a bigger impact on Iraq, but likely, fortunately, it's sort of underpinned by U.S. funding both in the fiscal '15 budget as well as in the fiscal '16 proposed O.C. elders funding for the Iraq train and equip funding. So that does backstop us a little bit for any oil-related concerns in Iraq. So overall, not a concern today. It doesn't mean that, that won't come in front of us over the next number of quarters. On FX, I think you know we do business around the world in U.S. dollars, and we compete against, in some markets, euro-based competitors. So over time, that could have some marginal effect if we don't adjust price and if the euro doesn't improve. We've seen that, at least in the last couple of weeks, the euro getting a little bit better, but today, no big effect. But again, if the dollar strengthens considerably from where we are today, there could be some effect that we have to react with pricing."

In order to hit our numbers for the year and our guidance for the year, book-to-bill for the year, it needs to come in pretty close to 1. So we do know that there is some big opportunities that are coming our way in Q4, and it's good again to point out that we received a pretty good-sized award on the international side, $74 million just 1 week or 2 ago. And that's, I think, a good positive sign. From -- I'm not sure I'll go into fiscal '16, but certainly, as we look out through the balance of the year, which is only a couple of months away, to the end of our fiscal year, we're down year-to-date about 1% on tactical revenues. Obviously, to be up low single digits on the year, call it a couple of percent, we do need to see some good growth in the fourth quarter. That's going to come with some good orders that we do expect. The international side has been trending pretty well. It's up high single digits. We expect it to be up high single digits for the year, which means Q4 is going to be about that same level of performance. On the DoD side, it has been softer on a year-to-date basis. We're down sort of in that 20% range. We're guiding to be in our guidance that we expressed a little bit a while ago on where RF as a whole is. Embedded in that is DoD down 10% to 12% and probably on the better side of that, maybe down about 10%. That requires Q4 to be quite good. We typically see, Gautam, Q4 being stronger sequentially from Q3. And we saw that last year, where Q4 revenue is about double where we were in Q3 last year. We did see some positive movement in DoD in Q3 and it was reassuring to be -- to see positive growth after a number of quarters in a row of being down year-over-year on DoD. And I'm also glad to see that the pipeline for DoD is getting a little bit better than we were 3 months ago. Last time we spoke, it was about $900 million or so in size. Today, it's about $970 million. There is more that's weighted towards proposal, closure and finalization. So the nearer-term pipeline is looking a little bit better, and that gives us a bit of more comfort that Q4 will be better year-over-year and better sequentially than Q3. And we're counting on that to hit the guidance and to, again, come back to a full year of close to a 1 on book-to-bill. I won't speculate at the moment going into fiscal '16. I'll have more to say about that once we close Exelis and report our earnings in late July."

And frankly, over the last 3 years since I've been here, the nature of competition, the mix of DoD in international even with international by country is shifting around, increasing our systems business. And yet still through all of that, we're sitting here with north of 30% margins in that segment. And even within spending a lot more on R&D and some shifts happening in Public Safety. So overall, we're finding a way to take cost out, preserve pricing and still preserve our position in margins that are north of 30%. So we're doing, I think, a very good job of managing our cost structure and prudently managing our investment pattern to maintain very strong margin in that segment. I do think that over time, it will become more price competitive? It is price competitive. The nature of who we'll compete against may shift a little bit, but the scale advantage we have in our RF facility in Rochester, the ability to drive technology differentiation in our product over time are going to be the deciding factors over time in this business to be able to preserve margins north of 30% for the RF com segment. So I'm not -- we're not putting our head in the sand, saying that there aren't dynamics happening here, but I am confident in the team's ability to continue to find opportunities to both take cost out as well as invest in differentiation to maintain a pricing environment that allows us to hold margins pretty strong in that segment."

A big competitor has more of a global perspective in terms of their footprint around the world. The market is soft. It is very competitive. I do think that we've had, internally within Harris, some executional challenges, which we're quickly working to solve. They're not going to solve themselves over the course of a number of months or quarters. It's going to take some time, but we're really focused on this. And we are seeing execution slowly improving. We do see quality improving. We do see customer satisfaction coming back up. We're making progress in developing and expanding our product offering. Our team, our leadership team, is getting better. So overall, I see us improving. And you will start to see the benefits of those investments in performance showing through when the market starts to come back. Longer term, we will see some growth in this marketplace. More than half of the market is analog that will go digital. We do know over the longer period of time, the market will shift to LTE. It's good to see that first net with the spectrum auctions has been well funded. It's well more than $7 billion raised in these spectrum auctions. I know it's going to happen over time. It's not going to be the next 2 to 3 years, but beyond that, there's going to be an impact on Harris Corporation. And I think we'll be prepared and well positioned to compete as that market shifts to LTE. So those are the dynamics that are really happening in the North American space that we are faced with, and we'll start to see some improvements over time."

They are particularly interested in -- there's a number of dimensions. It's heat, it's range, a lot of things. But weight is a very, very important factor. The objective requirement, if I remember right, was at 14.6 pounds, but clearly, they want it to be a lot less than that. And this has been something we're laser focused on and have been working on for a couple of years. And we do see opportunities to take weight down pretty substantially over the near term and go below the objective requirements and actually perhaps even get better than some of the threshold requirements for weight, so no big surprise. One of the, I guess, maybe a surprise was on the size of the ceiling value on the IDIQ at $12 billion to $12.7 billion. It's way above what we had -- what we were thinking. And of course, it includes services and spares, sustainment cost and a bunch of other things that's well beyond, I think, the opportunities set in front of Harris. But still at that north of $12 billion is quite an impressive top line ceiling value number for the manpack, Chris."

And I would expect that as the Army introduced a potential 2-channel into the Rifleman competition that whatever is being sold into SOCOM could eventually work its way into regular Army over time.

And the size of manpack at north of $12 billion -- so $16 billion to $17 billion worth of ceiling value between these 2 contracts, it's far above, I think, the opportunities set over 10 years for Harris. Another way to look at this is just looking at what's in the President's budget 4, 5 years out, close to $0.5 billion per year for HMS, which is Rifleman and manpack, if you just take that over a 10-year basis, $5 billion in terms of opportunity set, that's sort of in line with what we had thought before about the opportunity for Harris in terms of HMS, both manpack and Rifleman.

I think they're supposed to decide sometime this summer, which would have Link 16 with SRW in it and that -- we'll have a play in that if the Army goes in that direction, and that's still to be determined. Now the other one that that's sort of on the drawing board is SANR, which is the Small Airborne Networking Radio, which is SRW, WNW being that, I think the Army is still evaluating that. I think I saw on the President's budget -- I don't know if it's in the House Armed Services markup, but a small amount, like $6 million, to push forward that competition on SANR. You will see when the budgets are actually set, that's happening. But if there's a small amount of money, that will be an encouragement that the Army is moving forward, putting SRW and WNW into a SANR product for the airborne side. And if that happens, I do think that we're going to be very, very well positioned to compete there. And also, quite frankly, with Exelis, with the ARC-201 project they have, there is an opportunity to actually put some of our own technology into that box, if you will, and offer greater capability for the airborne tier as we combine ourselves with Exelis. So I think there's a lot of different ways of looking at how we might be able to extend our strong presence on the ground to the airborne tier."

Our fourth quarter was productive for Harris, and we ended the year with solid results. Harris' stand-alone revenue and earnings per share met expectation, and free cash flow was stronger than expected at 119% of non-GAAP",1100,"Thank you, Pam, and good morning. Our fourth quarter was productive for Harris, and we ended the year with solid results. Harris' stand-alone revenue and earnings per share met expectation, and free cash flow was stronger than expected at 119% of non-GAAP net income, exceeding our goal of 100%.
A significant accomplishment in the quarter was closing the Exelis acquisition on May 29, a bit sooner than expected, and allowing us to accelerate a few key actions and speed up the pace of integration. On the day of closing, we consolidated headquarters activities with Harris and Exelis. On July 1, we announced our new organizational model, creating 4 market--focused segments and combining the top talent of both companies. And then 2 weeks later on July 15, we announced our intent to close Exelis' Fort Wayne tactical radio facility and consolidate production in our world-class Rochester manufacturing operation. So we're off to our a good start, and we'll provide a little more color on our integration efforts during the call.
At the end of the quarter, we closed on the sale of our commercial Healthcare business [indiscernible] providing the business the domain expertise and leverage to allow it to reach maximum potential. As we've expressed before, the Exelis acquisition provides us the unique opportunity for portfolio-shaping actions and in the context of our now larger combined company, we'll continue to take this -- in evaluating what businesses are strategic and which are better served under a different owner.
Turning now to our financial results on Slide 4 of the presentation. Harris earlier today reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.32 in the fourth quarter and $5.14 for the full year, both of which include a $0.09 benefit from 1 month of ownership of Exelis. Excluding the impact of Exelis' operating results for the month of June, non-GAAP Harris stand-alone earnings were $1.23 [ph] in the fourth quarter and $5.05 for the full year with full year revenues down 4%, in line with prior guidance and reflecting good operating performance.
In the fourth quarter, higher revenue and continued margin strength for both RF Communications and Government Communications was more than offset by the anticipated weakness in Integrated Network Solutions.
Orders for Harry stand-alone were $1.28 billion, up 17% over the prior year, and significantly higher in RF Communications and Government Communications. Book-to-bill for the quarter was just above 1 and for the full fiscal year was 0.98.
Strategically, we continue to increase our international footprint and invest aggressively in company-funded R&D to position the company for future growth.
International revenue was up 2% in the quarter and 4% for the year, increasing as percentage of total revenue from 30% last year to 32% this fiscal year. And we increased our investment as a percentage of total revenue to 5.7% per share compared to 5.3% in fiscal '14 and 4% just 3 years ago.
I was particularly pleased with our free cash flow results, coming in about $100 million above what we were guiding on Harris stand-alone due to continued tightening of capital spending and improved working capital performance, including higher accounts payable.
Before turning Mick to go to the details of the financials, let me offer a few high-level comments on the segment. Revenue at RF Communications was up 2%, [ph] driven by a 5% increase in tactical and 4% decline in Public Safety. Within tactical, continued strength in international more than offset the declines in the U.S., which was a little lower than expected as a result of orders from 2 customers totaling $28 million, taking a little longer to finalize [indiscernible] this quarter. The majority is now booked and shipped.
Regardless of the slip, back half [indiscernible] solid 6% growth, with Q4 book-to-bill of 1.1 and 0.9 for the year.
In the international tactical market, highlight was a 5-year $55 million order from Australia for tactical and logistics superport to ensure combat-readiness of our JP2072 [ph] product that we previously shipped, bringing orders to date in Australia to more than $700 million. [ph] This further strengthens our partnership with the Australian Defence Force and helps position Harris for Phase III of the country's multiyear battlefield communication modernization program that represent a $750 million [ph] opportunity, which is outside of our 12- to 18-month pipeline.
In the U.S. tactical market, we saw continued momentum for Army modernization. As you know, early in the fourth quarter, we were awarded 10-year $3.9 billion IDIQ contract for the [indiscernible] and in late July, we completed qualification with the customer. On a much larger manpack program, the final RFP was released on August 3, earlier than the September time frame we previously expected. We did do on 60 days [ph in what would be a very [indiscernible] 10-year $12.7 billion multivendor IDIQ contract. The Army now intends to award up to 3 IDIQ contracts in December, followed by qualification testing in March and customer testing in mid-summer 2016, with full-rate production delivery and start date in the first quarter of our fiscal '18, pretty much as we expected. The published acquisition objective is for 65,000 radios, and I continue to believe that we're well positioned to capture a significant portion of this multiyear, multibillion-dollar opportunity.
And finally, our midtier MNVR radio for the Army completed limited user testing [indiscernible] 15.2 to significant milestone towards full-rate production. [indiscernible] expected to follow with operational test and evaluation at NIE 16.2 [ph] and a full-rate production [indiscernible] September of 2016. MNVR should begin to ramp in fiscal '16, and together with Rifleman Radio, should become a more significant revenue contributor and driving good growth for U.S. tactical in '17 and beyond.
Revenue in Government Communications was up 1% in the quarter and 3% for the year, which is an excellent results given the environment. Major growth drivers for the year include our large classified win in geospatial imagery called Foundation content management continued, ramping of F-35, wireless products, DataComm terminals and highband networking radios for the army and mission radios for the airborne market.
I'd also quickly highlight a new strategic partnership with exactEarth that we announced in Q4. exactEarth is the market leader in satellite-based remote tracking. And in the fourth quarter, we received a $55 million order to place 58 commercially hosted payloads on the [indiscernible] to refresh the exactEarth network. This is the same satellite platform that host Aireon and other payloads in which Harris has a prime role, and it's a good strategic point for our team.
Let me now turn over to Mick to provide some greater detail on our fiscal guidance. Nick?"

Slide 5 provides a detailed reconciliation of GAAP, non-GAAP and to Harris' standalone non-GAAP earnings, highlighting $281 million in onetime deal and integration costs in FY '15, which is in line with the $270 million to $290 million in our prior guidance. We also incurred additional charges in Q4 of a net $32 million for restructuring, other items impacting Harris stand-alone business, with the largest part being an intangible impairment in Integrated Network Solutions for the NMCI contract. Excluding $0.09 per share contribution from Exelis in Q4, Harris' full year EPS was $5.05.
On Slide 6, we provide further detail on our ending cash balance and capital expenditure, which at $148 million for fiscal year '15 include $4 million [indiscernible]
Our tax rate for the quarter and the year was as expected, ending the year with a non-GAAP tax rate of 30.2%. The favorable fiscal '15 rate, which we don't expect to repeat in fiscal '16, resulted from foreign tax credits, tax credit and other fiscal '14 tax settlement.
Moving to the segment results [indiscernible] RF Communications orders in the fourth quarter were $530 million compared to $361 million in the prior year, and revenue was $505 million compared to $493 million last year. Tactical Communications revenue was $366 million, [ph] an increase of 5%, while orders were $402 million.
Public Safety. Orders were $128 million and essentially flat compared to prior year of $129 million. Revenue was $139 million compared to $145 million last year.
Non-GAAP operating income was $159 million, which excludes restructuring charges related to Public Safety. non-GAAP operating margin was 31.6% in the quarter and a strong 31.1%  for the [indiscernible]
Turning to Government Communications on Slide 8. Fourth quarter revenue was $485 million, up 1% compared to $480 million in the prior year. Higher revenue from the Foundation content management program, the F-35 program, Highband Networking Radio for the Army win program, which was partially offset by lower revenue from 2 classified programs and the Navy commercial broadband satellite program. Segment operating income was $66 million, [ph] and operating margin was 13.7% in the quarter and a strong 15.8% for the full year.
Turning to Integrated Network Solutions on Slide 9. Fourth quarter revenue was $289 million compared with $373 million in the prior year, a decline of 23%, primarily due to the wind-down of 2 IT Services programs and continued end market weakness for both IT services and cap.
Non-GAAP operating income was $16 million, [ph] including charges related to restructuring and other items, compared to $33 million in the prior year, primarily due to the wind-down of highly profitable NMCI contract and weakness in commercial health.
Moving to fiscal '16 guidance on Slide 6. Today, we're providing high-level guidance for revenue and EPS with some color around fiscal '16 [ph] based on the legacy businesses [Audio Gap] 
once we have pro forma historical information for fiscal '15 [indiscernible] 4 new segments, we'll provide an outlook for segments as we typically do. We're initiating guidance for GAAP EPS in the range of $5.25, $5.45. And for non-GAAP, in the range of $5.60, [ph] $5.80.
Fiscal '16 non-GAAP EPS excludes [ph] about $60 million to $65 million of integration costs and an $8 million charge related to inventory step-up. It includes about $133 million or about $0.70 per share of Exelis acquisition and tangible amortization.
Fiscal '16 non-GAAP EBIT margin is expected to be in the range of 16.2 to 16.7. Putting aside for a minute cost synergies and the impacts related to the acquisition, guidance reflects segment-level operating margin for legacy Exelis slightly lower than the prior year fiscal performance of about 12.5%. Harris segment-level operating margin is expected to be about flat with the prior year based on legacy RF continued strength similar to the prior year and a more normalized operating margin [indiscernible] of about 15%. And for IT Services and CapRock together, an operating margin of around 9%.
Other P&L guidance details are outlined on Slide 10. I'll start with an update on expected synergies and integration costs. Our integration team has moved aggressively to capture costs synergies is ahead of schedule. As a result, both integration costs and savings are occurring sooner than what we previously expected. We're now on track with the fiscal '16 savings of $70 million, $75 million and expect to be at an annual run rate savings of $120 million as we exit fiscal '17, a year sooner than our original estimate and the top end of the prior range. The $120 million of savings is net of savings that will flow [indiscernible] integration spending was $112 million in fiscal '15, and we expect another $60 million to $65 million in fiscal '16. Total integration costs is now expected to be $150 million. the higher end of our prior range and net of about $25 million of expected reimbursement of the U.S. government, which is not anticipated to begin until fiscal '17. As we move to our greater standardization in process, policies and operations for opportunities [indiscernible] we'll continue to look for opportunities for further integrations.
Revenue is expected to be in a range of $7.67 billion to $7.83 billion, down 3% to 5% on a pro forma basis compared with a fiscal '15 of $8.07 billion. Legacy Harris is expected to be down 2% to 4%. This reflects our initial expectations for Tactical Communications of flat to down slightly with DoD flat to up low single digits and international flat to down low single digits and continuing weakness in Public Safety with a 2 percentage point decline.
In legacy Government Communications, we expect another growth year of up 2% to 3%. For IT Services and CapRock together, we expect revenue to be down 13% [ph] to 15% [ph] as a result of continued end market weakness.
Legacy Exelis pro forma stand-alone revenue is expected to be down 5% to 6% with lower revenue from night vision products, lower revenue from information systems, primarily from 85 million [ph] roll-off of the space [indiscernible] that was lost last October.
Slide 11 provides some additional information including an anticipated [indiscernible] income of about $25 million and [indiscernible] contributions of $173 million this fiscal year. With cash funding remaining roughly flat at $170 million in '17 as a result of pension [indiscernible] provided for under and [indiscernible] 21 legislation. Our unfunded pension liability has declined by about $200 million to $1.9 billion at the end of fiscal '15, principally due to the mandatory funding of the legacy Exelis SERP. The effect of modestly higher discount rate, lower expected return on assets largely offset each other.
So let me turn it back to Bill for a few wrap-up comments before we open the call for questions."

The revenue outlook that Mick just described anticipate budget constraints and the continuing resolution through the end of this calendar year. While the base budget even under sequestered cap is bottoming, it is expected to slowly improve. The recovery will be gradual with headwinds persisting until budget improve and drive new program funding. In the meantime, we continue to have a robust growing pipeline of opportunities, which is a positive sign for the business.
We also put in place an outstanding team leading the new organization we recently announced. As you see on Slide 12, we've organized into 4 market-focused segments, and each segments' president is a well-seasoned executive in the government market: Chris Young with 33 years; Carl D’Alessandro with 31 years; and Bill Gattle [indiscernible] each with 28 years. We've taken our 2 most senior leaders, Sheldon Fox and Dana Mehnert, to focus on driving greater cost and operational efficiencies and reigniting revenue growth across our company. I also believe we've delivered on our promise to put the best of the best from both the Harris and Exelis organization. This is a tough job in the combined company, with nearly half of the top 50 positions now filled by a former Exelis employee. I think the energy and enthusiasm across the entire company is very high with a lot of excitement about our future.
As we entered the fiscal year at a running start on integration and focused on exceeding our synergy goals and driving good earnings growth in '16 with even higher accretion in fiscal '17 and fiscal '18.
Ton conclude, on Slide 13, we're executing very well on all critical integration success [indiscernible] from my deep personal ownership of the integration program to the full-time dedicated team led by Sheldon Fox, that's driving a disciplined process with speed and precision. Through the close oversight of the board and constant communication with employees. The result is that we're now at the high end of our prior range of run rate savings, achieved about 1 year sooner than previously expected, with 90% of the action underpinning the savings completed or in process in just 70 days since we closed.
I'm really proud of what Harris has accomplished this past year, and I'm optimistic and confident about what our new team of over 23,000 dedicated employees can deliver in the future. Together, we're committed to solving our customers' most complex challenges and driving value for our shareholders.

We do know that Iraq sales for us are backed up by U.S. government spending, but there are some new commanders in Iraq, and that's taking a bit slower for some of those sales into Iraq to take place. So Iraq is slipping a little bit. And in Saudi, oil is causing a little bit of a problem there. There's a new leadership team in Saudi Arabia. And certainly, the strike in Yemen is causing some shifting around priorities. Those are the 2 things that have shifted a little bit further to the right.

And we do see the business up mid-teens. That's growing pretty nicely with content with Boeing, with Airbus, with the F-35 ramp, on the 53k, which, of course, they got some good programs there. So when I look at all the pieces of it how they're moving around what's growing, the business does have lower margin. So when that grows faster than others, it does depress the overall margin a little bit. But I do see that there is profit in the margins for the night vision comps. And I do see some softening in that systems business as they transition from what we're production programs to more development programs, and that's sort of a natural transition. So they were down, I think, right about 12.5% pro forma last year, if I remember right, and we're guiding to be slightly less than that in fiscal '16."

Our fourth quarter was productive for Harris, and we ended the year with solid results. Harris' stand-alone revenue and earnings per share met expectations, and free cash flow was stronger than expected at 119% of non-GAAP net income, exceeding our goal of 100%.
A significant accomplishment in the quarter was closing the Exelis acquisition on May 29, a bit sooner than expected, and allowing us to accelerate a few key actions and speed up the pace of integration. On the day of closing, we consolidated headquarter's activities between Harris and Exelis. On July 1, we announced our new organizational model, creating 4 market-focused segments and combining the top talent of both companies. And then 2 weeks later, on July 15, we announced our intent to close Exelis's Ft. Wayne tactical radio facility and consolidated production in our world-class Rochester manufacturing operations. So we're off to a good start, and we'll provide a little more color on our integration efforts during the call.
At the end of the quarter, we closed on the sale of our commercial healthcare business to NantHealth, providing the business the domain expertise and channel leverage to allow it to reach its maximum potential. As we've expressed before, the Exelis acquisition provides us the unique opportunity for portfolio-shaping actions, and in the context of our now larger combined company, we'll continue to take dispassionate view in evaluating what businesses are strategic and which are better served under a different owner.
Turning now to our financial results on Slide 4 of the presentation. Harris, earlier today, reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.32 in the fourth quarter and $5.14 for the full year, both of which include a $0.09 benefit from 1 month of ownership of Exelis. Excluding the impact of Exelis's operating results for the month of June, non-GAAP Harris stand-alone earnings per share was $1.23 in the fourth quarter and $5.05 for the full year, with full year revenue down 4%, all in line with prior guidance and reflecting good operating performance.
In the fourth quarter, higher revenue and continued margin strength for both RF Communications and Government Communications was more than offset by the anticipated weakness in Integrated Network Solutions.
Orders for Harris, standalone, were $1.28 billion, up 17% over the prior year and significantly higher in RF Communications and Government Communications. Book-to-bill for the quarter was just above 1 and for the full fiscal year was 0.98.
Strategically, we continue to increase our international footprint and invest aggressively in company-funded R&D to position the company for future growth.
International revenue was up 2% in the quarter and 4% for the year, increasing as percentage of total revenue from 30% last year to 32% this fiscal year. And we increased our investment in IRAD as a percentage of total revenue to 5.7% per share, compared to 5.3% in fiscal '14 and 4% just 3 years ago.
I was particularly pleased with our free cash flow results, coming in about $100 million above what we were guiding on a Harris stand-alone basis due to continued tightening of capital spending and improved working capital performance, including higher accounts payable.
Before turning it to Mick to go to the details of the financials, let me offer a few high-level comments on the segments. Revenue at RF Communications was up 2%, driven by a 5% increase in Tactical and a 4% decline in Public Safety. Within Tactical, continued strength in international more than offset the decline in the U.S., which was a little lower than expected as a result of orders from 2 customers totaling $28 million, taking a little longer to finalize and missing the quarter cut. The majority is now booked and shipped. Regardless of the slip, back half for Tactical came in at a solid 6% growth, with Q4 book-to-bill of 1.1 and 0.94 for the year.
In the international tactical market, a highlight was a 5-year $55 million order from Australia for technical and logistics support to ensure combat-readiness of our JP 2072 phase 2 products that we previously shipped, bringing orders to date in Australia to more than $700 million. This latest win further strengthens our partnership with the Australian Defence Force and helps position Harris for Phase 3 of the country's multiyear battlefield communication modernization program that represent a $750 million opportunity, that sits outside of our 12- to 18-month pipeline.
In the U.S. tactical market, we saw continued momentum for Army modernization. As you know, early in the fourth quarter, we were awarded a 10-year $3.9 billion IDIQ contract for the Rifleman Radio, and on late July, we completed qualification testing with the customer. On the much larger Manpack program, the final RFP was released on August 3, a bit earlier than the September time frame we previously expected, with bids due in 60 days for what will be a very sizable 10-year $12.7 billion multivendor IDIQ contract.
The Army now intends to award up to 3 IDIQ contracts in December, followed by qualification testing in March and customer testing in mid-summer 2016, with full-rate production delivery start dates in the first quarter of our fiscal '18, pretty much as we expected. The published acquisition objective is for 65,000 radios, and I continue to believe that we're well positioned to capture a significant portion of this multiyear, multibillion-dollar opportunity.
And then finally, our mid-tier MNVR radio for the Army completed limited-user testing at NIE 15.2, a significant milestone towards full-rate production. LRIPs are expected to follow with operational test and evaluation at NIE 16.2, and a full-rate production award in September of 2016. MNVR should begin to ramp in fiscal '16, and together with Rifleman Radio, should become a more significant revenue contributor and drive good growth for U.S. Tactical in '17 and beyond.
Revenue in Government Communications was up 1% in the quarter and 3% for the year, which is an excellent result given the environment. Major growth drivers for the year include our large classified win in geospatial imagery called Foundation GEOINT Content Management, continued ramping of F-35, wireless products, SATCOM terminals and highband networking radios for the Army and mission radios for the airborne market.
I'll also quickly highlight a new strategic partnership with exactEarth that we announced in Q4. exactEarth is the market leader in satellite-based remote ship tracking, and in the fourth quarter, we received a $55 million order to place 58 commercially hosted payloads on the Iridium NEXT constellation to refresh the exactEarth network. This is the same satellite platform that host Aireon and other payloads in which Harris has the prime role, and it's a good strategic win for our team.
Let me now turn it over to Mick to provide some greater detail on the results and our fiscal '16 guidance. Mick?"

Slide 5 provides a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP and to Harris' stand-alone non-GAAP earnings, highlighting $281 million in onetime deal and integration costs in FY '15, which is in line with the $270 million to $290 million in our prior guidance. We also incurred additional charges in Q4 of a net $32 million for restructuring and other items impacting Harris stand-alone business, with the largest part being an intangible impairment in Integrated Network Solutions for the NMCI contract. Excluding $0.09 per share contribution from Exelis in Q4, Harris' full year EPS was $5.05.
On Slide 6, we provide further detail on our ending cash balance and capital expenditures, which at $148 million for fiscal year '15 include $4 million from the Exelis.
Our tax rate for the quarter and the year was as expected, ending the year with a non-GAAP tax rate of 30.2%. The favorable fiscal '15 rate, which we don't expect to repeat in fiscal '16, resulted from foreign tax credits, the R&D tax credit and other fiscal '14 tax settlements.
Moving to segment results on Slide 7. RF Communications orders in the fourth quarter were $530 million, compared to $361 million in the prior year, and revenue was $505 million, compared to $493 million last year. Tactical Communications revenue was $366 million, an increase of 5%, while orders were $402 million.
In Public Safety, orders were $128 million and essentially flat compared to prior year of $129 million. Revenue was $139 million, compared to $145 million last year.
Non-GAAP operating income was $159 million, excluding restructuring charges related to Public Safety. non-GAAP operating margin was 31.6% for the quarter and a strong 31.1%  for the full year.
Turning to Government Communications Systems on Slide 8. Fourth quarter revenue was $485 million, up 1% compared to $480 million in the prior year. Higher revenue from the Foundation GEOINT Content Management program, the F-35 program and Highband Networking Radios for the army's WIN-T program was partially offset by lower revenue from 2 classified programs and the Navy's commercial broadband satellite program. Segment operating income was $66 million, and operating margin was 13.7% in the quarter and a strong 15.8% for the full year.
Turning to Integrated Network Solutions on Slide 9. Fourth quarter revenue was $289 million, compared with $373 million in the prior year, a decline of 23%, primarily due to the wind-down of 2 IT Services programs and continued end market weakness for both IT Services and CapRock.
Non-GAAP operating income was $16 million, excluding charges related to restructuring and other items, compared to $33 million in the prior year, primarily due to the wind-down of highly profitable NMCI contract and continued weakness in commercial healthcare.
Moving to fiscal '16 guidance in Slide 10. Today, we're providing high-level guidance on revenue and EPS with some color around fiscal '16 expectations based on the legacy businesses of Harris and Exelis.
Once we have pro forma historical information for fiscal '15 recast into our 4 new segments, we'll provide an outlook by segment as we typically do. We're initiating guidance for GAAP EPS in the range of $5.25 to $5.45, and for non-GAAP, in the range of $5.60 to $5.80.
Fiscal '16 non-GAAP EPS excludes about $60 million to $65 million of integration costs and an $8 million charge related to inventory step-up. It includes about $133 million or about $0.70 per share of Exelis acquisition and tangible amortization.
Fiscal '16 non-GAAP EBIT margin is expected to be in the range of 16.2% to 16.7%. Putting aside for a minute the cost synergies and other impacts related to the acquisition, guidance reflects segment-level operating margin for legacy Exelis slightly lower than the prior year fiscal pro forma of about 12.5%. Harris segment-level operating margin is expected to be about flat with the prior year, based on legacy RF continued strength similar to the prior year, a more normalized operating margin in legacy Government Communications of about 15%, and for IT Services and CapRock together, an operating margin of around 9%.
Other P&L guidance details are outlined on Slide 10. I'll start with an update on expected synergies and integration costs. Our integration team has moved aggressively to capture costs synergies, and is ahead of schedule. As a result, both integration costs and savings are occurring sooner than what we previously expected. We're now on track to achieve fiscal '16 savings of $70 million to $75 million and expect to be at an annual run rate savings of $120 million as we exit fiscal '17, a year sooner than our original estimate and at the top end of our prior range. The $120 million of savings is net of savings that will flow immediately back to the government.
Integration spending was $112 million in fiscal '15, and we expect another $60 million to $65 million in fiscal '16. Total integration costs is now expected to be $150 million, the higher end of our prior range and net of about $25 million of expected reimbursements from the U.S. government, which are not anticipated to begin until fiscal '17. As we move to our greater standardization in processes, policies and operations we'll continue to look for opportunities for further integration savings.
Revenue is expected to be in the range of $7.67 billion to $7.83 billion, down 3% to 5% on a pro forma basis, compared with a fiscal '15 of $8.07 billion. Legacy Harris is expected to be down 2% to 4%. This reflects our initial expectations for Tactical Communications of flat to down slightly, with DoD flat to up low single digits and international flat to down low single digits and continuing weakness in Public Safety with a 2 percentage point decline.
In legacy Government Communications, we expect another growth year of up 2% to 3%. For IT Services and CapRock together, we expect revenue to be down 13% to 15% as a result of continued end market weakness.
Legacy Exelis pro forma stand-alone revenue is expected to be down 5% to 6%, with lower revenue from night vision products and communication products and lower revenue from information systems, primarily from the $85 million roll-off of the Spacelift Range Systems contract that was lost last October.
Slide 11 provides some additional pension information, including an anticipated FAS pension income of about $25 million and ERISA cash contributions of $173 million this fiscal year. With cash funding remaining roughly flat at $170 million in '17 as a result of pension smoothing provided for under the HAFA and MAP-21 legislation. Our unfunded pension liability has declined by about $200 million to $1.9 billion at the end of fiscal '15, principally due to the mandatory funding of the legacy Exelis SERP. The effect of modestly higher discount rates and lower expected return on assets largely offset each other.
So let me please turn it back to Bill for a few wrap-up comments before we open the call for questions."

The revenue outlook that Mick just described anticipates continued budget constraints and the continuing resolution through the end of this calendar year. While the base budget, even under sequestered caps, is bottoming and it's expected to slowly improve, the recovery will be gradual with headwinds persisting until budgets improve and drive new program funding. In the meantime, we continue to have a robust growing pipeline of opportunities, which is a positive sign for the future.
We also put in place an outstanding team leading the new organization we recently announced. As you see on Slide 12, we're organized into 4 market-focused segments, and each segment's president is a well-seasoned executive in the government market: Chris Young with 33 years; Carl D’Alessandro with 31 years; and Bill Gattle and Ed Zoiss each with 28 years. We've taken our 2 most senior leaders, Sheldon Fox and Dana Mehnert, and focused them on driving greater cost and operational efficiencies and reigniting revenue growth across our company. I also believe we delivered on our promise to put the best of the best from both the Harris and Exelis organizations. This is a tough job in the combined company, with nearly half of the top 50 positions now filled by a former Exelis employee. I think the energy and enthusiasm across the entire company is very high with a lot of excitement about our future.
So as we enter the fiscal year at a running start on integration and focused on exceeding our synergy goals and driving good earnings growth in '16 with even higher accretion in fiscal '17 and fiscal '18.
To conclude, on Slide 13, we're executing very well on all critical integration success factors, from my deep personal ownership of the integration program to the full-time dedicated team led by Sheldon Fox, that's driving a disciplined process with speed and precision, to the close oversight of the board and the constant communication with employees. The result is that we're now at the high end of our prior range of run rate savings achieved about 1 year sooner than previously expected, with 90% of the action underpinning the savings completed or in process in just 70 days since we closed.
I'm really proud of what Harris has accomplished this past year, and I'm optimistic and confident about what our new team of over 23,000 dedicated employees can deliver in the future. Together, we're committed to solving our customers' most complex challenges and driving value for our shareholders.

And we ended the year and Q4 very strong. The orders were extraordinary. I'm very glad to see the revenue was up for the full year. It was at the high end of what we were guiding to, nearly 10%, so we feel very good about where we ended the year. The pipeline is still pretty robust at about $2.4 billion, last quarter it's $2.5 billion. I wouldn't read a light into that, it moves around a little bit time to time, but it's still very solid at $2.4 billion. The shape of the pipeline looks pretty much like it has over the last couple of quarters. More than half of it is into the Middle East, Northern Africa, Central Asia. And that does seem, still, to be pretty robust, but we do see in the Middle East, in 2 specific countries, some stretching out of some opportunities, which we believe, over time, are very big for the company. One is in Iraq, and the other is in Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Certainly, the price of oil that's with WTI should be just a little bit below $45 a barrel, that's causing some impact on direct commercial sales. We do know that Iraq sales for us are boxed up by the U.S. government foreign military funding. But there are some new commanders in Iraq, and that's taking a bit slower for some of those sales into Iraq to take place. So Iraq is slipping a little bit. And in Saudi, oil is causing a little bit of a problem there. There's a new leadership team in Saudi Arabia. And certainly, the strife in Yemen is causing some shifting around the priorities. Those are the 2 things that have shifted a little bit further to the right. We do see multiyear opportunities in the hundreds of millions of dollars in both Iraq and Saudi Arabia, so we feel good about those. Australia is very strong for us. I mentioned in my remarks a $750 million Phase 3 opportunity, that's outside of our pipeline, but it's real. We're participating in that, and that's going to end up happening. So longer term, we do see good opportunities in international. You'll recall, at the beginning of fiscal '15, we started international tactical with relatively modest guidance of up low single digits, and we ended up at about 10%. And I hope, going into fiscal '16, we're being similarly conservative."

But we had a really, really good Tactical that summarized it brilliantly to 4 or 5 pages. And I think -- look, nothing -- not much has changed from the very good dialogue interaction we had with the Army during the draft RFP process. It was a couple of industry days. I mean, as you know, that's been percolating for quite some time. There's been a lot of active dialogue, a lot conversation on range, power, weight. Was it radio weight, mission weight? Is MUOS in? Is it out? There's been a lot of puts and takes. At the end of the day, the final RFP is in line with what we had expected. What I think is very interesting is that what they're going to do is look for, at the time of award, you have to meet certain threshold requirements, and one of which is a 16-pound mission weight. They're going to give you some additional, if you will, leverage for MUOS and some antennas and other things. Then they have a deferred threshold set of requirements that have to be met by June of 2017. And then a series of objective requirements that will fold in, over time, based on how industry evolves to capture some of these opportunities. Again like around power, weight, et cetera. So that's the way we see it shaking out. This whole light Manpack opportunity is going to be kind of interesting, and I don't know where it's ultimately going to go. They're looking for a lower-weight Manpack, maybe feature some of the Manpack. It could potentially, Chris, be something like a 2-channel handheld that would go to a SOCOM and maybe, over time, go into the regular Army. So it's -- we're unclear as to how that's going to evolve over time. But that's essentially the way we see 689 pages in a nutshell."

The IS business, Information Systems, would be down about 10%, with the largest piece of that, 7 or 8 points roughly, that's from the loss of a contract, this range support contract, that was lost in October of last year. And we do see the Arrow business up mid-teens, that's growing pretty nicely with content with Boeing with Airbus, with the F-35 ramp, the 53k with Sikorsky. They got some good programs there. So when I look at all the pieces and how they're moving around and what's growing, the Arrow business does have lower margin, so when that grows faster than the others, it does depress the overall margin rate a little bit. But I do see that there is some softening in the margins for Night Vision Comms. And I do see some softening in the Electronic Systems business as they transition from what were production programs to some more development programs, and that's sort of a natural transition. So they were down I think right about 12.5% pro forma last year, if I remember right, and we're guiding to be slightly less than that in fiscal '16."

Our fourth quarter was productive for Harris, and we ended the year with solid results. Harris' stand-alone revenue and earnings per share met expectations, and free cash flow was stronger than expected at 119% of non-GAAP net income, exceeding our goal of 100%.
A significant accomplishment in the quarter was closing the Exelis acquisition on May 29, a bit sooner than expected, and allowing us to accelerate a few key actions and speed up the pace of integration. On the day of closing, we consolidated headquarter's activities between Harris and Exelis. On July 1, we announced our new organizational model, creating 4 market-focused segments and combining the top talent of both companies. And then 2 weeks later, on July 15, we announced our intent to close Exelis's Ft. Wayne tactical radio facility and consolidated production in our world-class Rochester manufacturing operations. So we're off to a good start, and we'll provide a little more color on our integration efforts during the call.
At the end of the quarter, we closed on the sale of our commercial healthcare business to NantHealth, providing the business the domain expertise and channel leverage to allow it to reach its maximum potential. As we've expressed before, the Exelis acquisition provides us the unique opportunity for portfolio-shaping actions, and in the context of our now larger combined company, we'll continue to take dispassionate view in evaluating what businesses are strategic and which are better served under a different owner.
Turning now to our financial results on Slide 4 of the presentation. Harris, earlier today, reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.32 in the fourth quarter and $5.14 for the full year, both of which include a $0.09 benefit from 1 month of ownership of Exelis. Excluding the impact of Exelis's operating results for the month of June, non-GAAP Harris stand-alone earnings per share was $1.23 in the fourth quarter and $5.05 for the full year, with full year revenue down 4%, all in line with prior guidance and reflecting good operating performance.
In the fourth quarter, higher revenue and continued margin strength for both RF Communications and Government Communications was more than offset by the anticipated weakness in Integrated Network Solutions.
Orders for Harris, standalone, were $1.28 billion, up 17% over the prior year and significantly higher in RF Communications and Government Communications. Book-to-bill for the quarter was just above 1 and for the full fiscal year was 0.98.
Strategically, we continue to increase our international footprint and invest aggressively in company-funded R&D to position the company for future growth.
International revenue was up 2% in the quarter and 4% for the year, increasing as a percentage of total revenue from 30% last year to 32% this fiscal year. And we increased our investment in IRAD as a percentage of total revenue to 5.7% per share, compared to 5.3% in fiscal '14 and 4% just 3 years ago.
I was particularly pleased with our free cash flow results, coming in about $100 million above what we were guiding on a Harris stand-alone basis due to continued tightening of capital spending and improved working capital performance, including higher accounts payable.
Before turning it to Mick to go to the details of the financials, let me offer a few high-level comments on the segments. Revenue at RF Communications was up 2%, driven by a 5% increase in Tactical and a 4% decline in Public Safety. Within Tactical, continued strength in international more than offset the decline in the U.S., which was a little lower than expected as a result of orders from 2 customers totaling $28 million, taking a little longer to finalize and missing the quarter cut. The majority is now booked and shipped. Regardless of the slip, back half for Tactical came in at a solid 6% growth, with Q4 book-to-bill of 1.1 and 0.94 for the year.
In the international tactical market, a highlight was a 5-year $55 million order from Australia for technical and logistics support to ensure combat-readiness of our JP 2072 phase 2 products that we previously shipped, bringing orders to date in Australia to more than $700 million. This latest win further strengthens our partnership with the Australian Defence Force and helps position Harris for Phase 3 of the country's multiyear battlefield communication modernization program that represent a $750 million opportunity, that sits outside of our 12- to 18-month pipeline.
In the U.S. tactical market, we saw continued momentum for Army modernization. As you know, early in the fourth quarter, we were awarded a 10-year $3.9 billion IDIQ contract for the Rifleman Radio, and on late July, we completed qualification testing with the customer. On the much larger Manpack program, the final RFP was released on August 3, a bit earlier than the September time frame we previously expected, with bids due in 60 days for what will be a very sizable 10-year $12.7 billion multivendor IDIQ contract.
The Army now intends to award up to 3 IDIQ contracts in December, followed by qualification testing in March and customer testing in mid-summer 2016, with full-rate production delivery start dates in the first quarter of our fiscal '18, pretty much as we expected. The published acquisition objective is for 65,000 radios, and I continue to believe that we're well positioned to capture a significant portion of this multiyear, multibillion-dollar opportunity.
And then finally, our mid-tier MNVR radio for the Army completed limited-user testing at NIE 15.2, a significant milestone towards full-rate production. LRIPs are expected to follow with operational test and evaluation at NIE 16.2, and a full-rate production award in September of 2016. MNVR should begin to ramp in fiscal '16, and together with Rifleman Radio, should become a more significant revenue contributor and drive good growth for U.S. Tactical in '17 and beyond.
Revenue in Government Communications was up 1% in the quarter and 3% for the year, which is an excellent result given the environment. Major growth drivers for the year include our large classified win in geospatial imagery called Foundation GEOINT Content Management, continued ramping of F-35, wireless products, SATCOM terminals and highband networking radios for the Army and mission radios for the airborne market.
I'll also quickly highlight a new strategic partnership with exactEarth that we announced in Q4. exactEarth is the market leader in satellite-based remote ship tracking, and in the fourth quarter, we received a $55 million order to place 58 commercially hosted payloads on the Iridium NEXT constellation to refresh the exactEarth network. This is the same satellite platform that host Aireon and other payloads in which Harris has the prime role, and it's a good strategic win for our team.
Let me now turn it over to Mick to provide some greater detail on the results and our fiscal '16 guidance. Mick?"

Slide 5 provides a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP and to Harris' stand-alone non-GAAP earnings, highlighting $281 million in onetime deal and integration costs in FY '15, which is in line with the $270 million to $290 million in our prior guidance. We also incurred additional charges in Q4 of a net $32 million for restructuring and other items impacting Harris stand-alone business, with the largest part being an intangible impairment in Integrated Network Solutions for the NMCI contract. Excluding $0.09 per share contribution from Exelis in Q4, Harris' full year EPS was $5.05.
On Slide 6, we provide further detail on our ending cash balance and capital expenditures, which at $148 million for fiscal year '15 includes $4 million for legacy Exelis.
Our tax rate for the quarter and the year was as expected, ending the year with a non-GAAP tax rate of 30.2%. The favorable fiscal '15 rate, which we don't expect to repeat in fiscal '16, resulted from foreign tax credits, the R&D tax credit and other fiscal '14 tax settlements.
Moving to segment results on Slide 7. RF Communications orders in the fourth quarter were $530 million, compared to $361 million in the prior year, and revenue was $505 million, compared to $493 million last year. Tactical Communications revenue was $366 million, an increase of 5%, while orders were $402 million. 
In Public Safety, orders were $128 million and essentially flat compared to prior year of $129 million. Revenue was $139 million, compared to $145 million last year.
Non-GAAP operating income was $159 million, excluding restructuring charges related to Public Safety. Non-GAAP operating margin was 31.6% for the quarter and a strong 31.1%  for the full year.
Turning to Government Communications Systems on Slide 8. Fourth quarter revenue was $485 million, up 1% compared to $480 million in the prior year. Higher revenue from the Foundation GEOINT Content Management program, the F-35 program and Highband Networking Radios for the army's WIN-T program was partially offset by lower revenue from 2 classified programs and the Navy's commercial broadband satellite program. Segment operating income was $66 million, and operating margin was 13.7% in the quarter and a strong 15.8% for the full year.
Turning to Integrated Network Solutions on Slide 9. Fourth quarter revenue was $289 million, compared with $373 million in the prior year, a decline of 23%, primarily due to the wind-down of 2 IT Services programs and continued end market weakness for both IT Services and CapRock.
Non-GAAP operating income was $16 million, excluding charges related to restructuring and other items, compared to $33 million in the prior year, primarily due to the wind-down of highly profitable NMCI contract and continued weakness in commercial healthcare.
Moving to fiscal '16 guidance in Slide 10. Today, we're providing high-level guidance on revenue and EPS with some color around fiscal '16 expectations based on the legacy businesses of Harris and Exelis.
Once we have pro forma historical information for fiscal '15 recast into our 4 new segments, we'll provide an outlook by segment as we typically do. We're initiating guidance for GAAP EPS in the range of $5.25 to $5.45, and for non-GAAP, in the range of $5.60 to $5.80.
Fiscal '16 non-GAAP EPS excludes about $60 million to $65 million of integration costs and an $8 million charge related to inventory step-up. It includes about $133 million or about $0.70 per share of Exelis acquisition and tangible amortization.
Fiscal '16 non-GAAP EBIT margin is expected to be in the range of 16.2% to 16.7%. Putting aside for a minute the cost synergies and other impacts related to the acquisition, guidance reflects segment-level operating margin for legacy Exelis slightly lower than the prior year fiscal pro forma of about 12.5%. Harris segment-level operating margin is expected to be about flat with the prior year, based on legacy RF continued strength similar to the prior year, a more normalized operating margin in legacy Government Communications of about 15%, and for IT Services and CapRock together, an operating margin of around 9%.
Other P&L guidance details are outlined on Slide 10. I'll start with an update on expected synergies and integration costs. Our integration team has moved aggressively to capture costs synergies, and is ahead of schedule. As a result, both integration costs and savings are occurring sooner than what we previously expected. We're now on track to achieve fiscal '16 savings of $70 million to $75 million and expect to be at an annual run rate savings of $120 million as we exit fiscal '17, a year sooner than our original estimate and at the top end of our prior range. The $120 million of savings is net of savings that will flow immediately back to the government.
Integration spending was $112 million in fiscal '15, and we expect another $60 million to $65 million in fiscal '16. Total integration costs is now expected to be $150 million, the higher end of our prior range and net of about $25 million of expected reimbursements from the U.S. government, which are not anticipated to begin until fiscal '17. As we move toward greater standardization in processes, policies and operations we'll continue to look for opportunities for further integration savings.
Revenue is expected to be in the range of $7.67 billion to $7.83 billion, down 3% to 5% on a pro forma basis, compared with our fiscal '15 of $8.07 billion. Legacy Harris is expected to be down 2% to 4%. This reflects our initial expectations for Tactical Communications of flat to down slightly, with DoD flat to up low single digits and international flat to down low single digits and continuing weakness in Public Safety with a 2 percentage point decline.
In legacy Government Communications, we expect another growth year of up 2% to 3%. For IT Services and CapRock together, we expect revenue to be down 13% to 15% as a result of continued end market weakness.
Legacy Exelis pro forma stand-alone revenue is expected to be down 5% to 6%, with lower revenue from night vision products and communication products and lower revenue from information systems, primarily from the $85 million roll-off of the Spacelift Range Systems contract that was lost last October.
Slide 11 provides some additional pension information, including an anticipated FAS pension income of about $25 million and ERISA cash contributions of $173 million this fiscal year. With cash funding remaining roughly flat at $170 million in '17 as a result of pension smoothing provided for under the HAFA and MAP-21 legislation. Our unfunded pension liability has declined by about $200 million to $1.9 billion at the end of fiscal '15, principally due to the mandatory funding of the legacy Exelis SERP. The effect of modestly higher discount rates and lower expected return on assets largely offset each other.
So let me please turn it back to Bill for a few wrap-up comments before we open the call for questions."

The revenue outlook that Mick just described anticipates continued budget constraints and the continuing resolution through the end of this calendar year. While the base budget, even under sequestered caps, is bottoming and it's expected to slowly improve, the recovery will be gradual with headwinds persisting until budgets improve and drive new program funding. In the meantime, we continue to have a robust growing pipeline of opportunities, which is a positive sign for the future.
We also put in place an outstanding team leading the new organization we recently announced. As you see on Slide 12, we're organized into 4 market-focused segments, and each segment's president is a well-seasoned executive in the government market: Chris Young with 33 years; Carl D’Alessandro with 31 years; and Bill Gattle and Ed Zoiss each with 28 years. We've taken our 2 most senior leaders, Sheldon Fox and Dana Mehnert, and focused them on driving greater cost and operational efficiencies and reigniting revenue growth across our company. I also believe we delivered on our promise to put the best of the best from both the Harris and Exelis organizations into the top jobs in the combined company, with nearly half of the top 50 positions now filled by a former Exelis employee. I think the energy and enthusiasm across the entire company is very high with a lot of excitement about our future.
So as we enter the fiscal year at a running start on integration and focused on exceeding our synergy goals and driving good earnings growth in '16 with even higher accretion in fiscal '17 and fiscal '18.
To conclude, on Slide 13, we're executing very well on all critical integration success factors, from my deep personal ownership of the integration program to the full-time dedicated team led by Sheldon Fox, that's driving a disciplined process with speed and precision, to the close oversight of the board and the constant communication with employees. The result is that we're now at the high end of our prior range of run rate savings achieved about 1 year sooner than previously expected, with 90% of the action underpinning the savings completed or in process in just 70 days since we closed.
I'm really proud of what Harris has accomplished this past year, and I'm optimistic and confident about what our new team of over 23,000 dedicated employees can deliver in the future. Together, we're committed to solving our customers' most complex challenges and driving value for our shareholders.
With that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the lines for questions."

And we're looking at, certainly, derisking the asset portfolio, which is a concern in order to have more traditional investment matching to the liabilities. 
But looking at the obligations, we have to stratify the pensioneers and future pensioneers and be able to offer lump sums, so we're looking at some of that for the term vested and the traditional approaches. So right now, we have a comprehensive study going on. We're using consultants and actuaries to determine what is the best course of action going forward. But we will take an approach towards the pension, both on the asset side and on the liability side, to derisk it and to lower the obligations."

And we ended the year and Q4 very strong. The orders were extraordinary. I'm very glad to see the revenue was up for the full year. It was at the high end of what we were guiding to, nearly 10%, so we feel very good about where we ended the year. The pipeline is still pretty robust at about $2.4 billion, last quarter it's $2.5 billion. I wouldn't read a lot into that, it moves around a little bit time to time, but it's still very solid at $2.4 billion. The shape of the pipeline looks pretty much like it has over the last couple of quarters. More than half of it is in the Middle East, Northern Africa, Central Asia. And that does seem, still, to be pretty robust, but we do see in the Middle East, in 2 specific countries, some stretching out of some opportunities, which we believe, over time, are very big for the company. One is in Iraq, and the other is in Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Certainly, the price of oil that's with WTI should be just a little bit below $45 a barrel, that's causing some impact on direct commercial sales. We do know that Iraq sales for us are backed up by the U.S. government foreign military funding. But there are some new commanders in Iraq, and that's taking a bit slower for some of those sales into Iraq to take place. So Iraq is slipping a little bit. And in Saudi, oil is causing a little bit of a problem there. There's a new leadership team in Saudi Arabia. And certainly, the strife in Yemen is causing some shifting around the priorities. Those are the 2 things that have shifted a little bit further to the right. We do see multiyear opportunities in the hundreds of millions of dollars in both Iraq and Saudi Arabia, so we feel good about those. Australia is very strong for us. I mentioned in my remarks a $750 million Phase 3 opportunity, that's outside of our pipeline, but it's real. We're participating in that, and that's going to end up happening. So longer term, we do see good opportunities in international. You'll recall, at the beginning of fiscal '15, we started international tactical with relatively modest guidance of up low single digits, and we ended up at about 10%. And I hope, going into fiscal '16, we're being similarly conservative."

It's both the international and the DoD business running in the same facility. It's a 0.5 million square feet of world-class manufacturing. Huge supply chain leverage.

But we had a really, really good Tactical [ph] that summarized it brilliantly in 4 or 5 pages. And I think -- look, nothing -- not much has changed from the very good dialogue interaction we had with the Army during the draft RFP process. It was a couple of industry days. I mean, as you know, that's been percolating for quite some time. There's been a lot of active dialogue, a lot conversation on range, power, weight. Was it radio weight, mission weight? Is MUOS in? Is it out? There's been a lot of puts and takes. At the end of the day, the final RFP is in line with what we had expected. What I think is very interesting is that what they're going to do is look for, at the time of award, you have to meet certain threshold requirements, and one of which is a 16-pound mission weight. They're going to give you some additional, if you will, leverage for MUOS and some antennas and other things. Then they have a deferred threshold set of requirements that have to be met by June of 2017. And then a series of objective requirements that will fold in, over time, based on how industry evolves to capture some of these opportunities. Again like around power, weight, et cetera. So that's the way we see it shaking out. This whole light Manpack opportunity is going to be kind of interesting, and I don't know where it's ultimately going to go. They're looking for a lower-weight Manpack, maybe feature some of the Manpack. It could potentially, Chris, be something like a 2-channel handheld that would go to a SOCOM and maybe, over time, go into the regular Army. So it's -- we're unclear as to how that's going to evolve over time. But that's essentially the way we see 689 pages in a nutshell."

So when I look at all the pieces and how they're moving around and what's growing, the Arrow business does have lower margin, so when that grows faster than the others, it does depress the overall margin rate a little bit.

Our fourth quarter was productive for Harris, and we ended the year with solid results.

Our fourth quarter was productive for Harris, and we ended the year with solid results. Harris' stand-alone revenue and earnings per share met expectations, and free cash flow was stronger than expected at 119% of non-GAAP net income, exceeding our goal of 100%.
A significant accomplishment in the quarter was closing the Exelis acquisition on May 29, a bit sooner than expected, and allowing us to accelerate a few key actions and speed up the pace of integration. On the day of closing, we consolidated headquarter's activities between Harris and Exelis. On July 1, we announced our new organizational model, creating 4 market-focused segments and combining the top talent of both companies. And then 2 weeks later, on July 15, we announced our intent to close Exelis' Ft. Wayne tactical radio facility and consolidate production in our world-class Rochester manufacturing operations. So we're off to a good start, and we'll provide a little more color on our integration efforts during the call.
At the end of the quarter, we closed on the sale of our commercial healthcare business to NantHealth, providing the business the domain expertise and channel leverage to allow it to reach its maximum potential. As we've expressed before, the Exelis acquisition provides us the unique opportunity for portfolio-shaping actions, and in the context of our now larger combined company, we'll continue to take dispassionate view in evaluating what businesses are strategic and which are better served under a different owner.
Turning now to our financial results on Slide 4 of the presentation. Harris, earlier today, reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.32 in the fourth quarter and $5.14 for the full year, both of which include a $0.09 benefit from 1 month of ownership of Exelis. Excluding the impact of Exelis' operating results for the month of June, non-GAAP Harris stand-alone earnings per share was $1.23 in the fourth quarter and $5.05 for the full year, with full year revenue down 4%, all in line with prior guidance and reflecting good operating performance.
In the fourth quarter, higher revenue and continued margin strength for both RF Communications and Government Communications was more than offset by the anticipated weakness in Integrated Network Solutions.
Orders for Harris, standalone, were $1.28 billion, up 17% over the prior year and significantly higher in RF Communications and Government Communications. Book-to-bill for the quarter was just above 1 and for the full fiscal year was 0.98.
Strategically, we continue to increase our international footprint and invest aggressively in company-funded R&D to position the company for future growth.
International revenue was up 2% in the quarter and 4% for the year, increasing as a percentage of total revenue from 30% last year to 32% this fiscal year. And we increased our investment in IRAD as a percentage of total revenue to 5.7% this year compared to 5.3% in fiscal '14 and 4% just 3 years ago.
I was particularly pleased with our free cash flow results, coming in about $100 million above what we were guiding on a Harris stand-alone basis due to continued tightening of capital spending and improved working capital performance, including higher accounts payable.
Before turning it to Mick to go through the details of the financials, let me offer a few high-level comments on the segments. Revenue at RF Communications was up 2%, driven by a 5% increase in Tactical and a 4% decline in Public Safety. Within Tactical, continued strength in international more than offset the decline in the U.S., which was a little lower than expected as a result of orders from 2 customers totaling $28 million, taking a little longer to finalize and missing the quarter cut. The majority is now booked and shipped. Regardless of the slip, back half for Tactical came in at a solid 6% growth, with Q4 book-to-bill of 1.1 and 0.94 for the year.
In the international tactical market, a highlight was a 5-year $55 million order from Australia for technical and logistics support to ensure combat-readiness of our JP 2072 phase 2 products that we previously shipped, bringing orders to date in Australia to more than $700 million. This latest win further strengthens our partnership with the Australian Defence Force and helps position Harris for Phase 3 of the country's multiyear battlefield communication modernization program that represent a $750 million opportunity, that sits outside of our 12- to 18-month pipeline.
In the U.S. tactical market, we saw continued momentum for Army modernization. As you know, early in the fourth quarter, we were awarded a 10-year $3.9 billion IDIQ contract for the Rifleman Radio, and on late July, we completed qualification testing with the customer. On the much larger Manpack program, the final RFP was released on August 3, a bit earlier than the September time frame we previously expected, with bids due in 60 days for what will be a very sizable 10-year $12.7 billion multivendor IDIQ contract.
The Army now intends to award up to 3 IDIQ contracts in December, followed by qualification testing in March and customer testing in mid-summer 2016, with full-rate production delivery start dates in the first quarter of our fiscal '18, pretty much as we expected. The published acquisition objective is for 65,000 radios, and I continue to believe that we're well positioned to capture a significant portion of this multiyear, multibillion-dollar opportunity.
And then finally, our mid-tier MNVR radio for the Army completed limited-user testing at NIE 15.2, a significant milestone towards full-rate production. LRIPs are expected to follow with operational test and evaluation at NIE 16.2, and a full-rate production award in September of 2016. MNVR should begin to ramp in fiscal '16, and together with Rifleman Radio, should become a more significant revenue contributor and drive good growth for U.S. Tactical in '17 and beyond.
Revenue in Government Communications was up 1% in the quarter and 3% for the year, which is an excellent result given the environment. Major growth drivers for the year include our large classified win in geospatial imagery called Foundation GEOINT Content Management, continued ramping of F-35, wireless products, SATCOM terminals and highband networking radios for the Army and mission radios for the airborne market.
I'll also quickly highlight a new strategic partnership with exactEarth that we announced in Q4. exactEarth is the market leader in satellite-based remote ship tracking, and in the fourth quarter, we received a $55 million order to place 58 commercially hosted payloads on the Iridium NEXT constellation to refresh the exactEarth network. This is the same satellite platform that host Aireon and other payloads in which Harris has the prime role, and it's a good strategic win for our team.
Let me now turn it over to Mick to provide some greater detail on the results and our fiscal '16 guidance. Mick?"

Slide 5 provides a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP and to Harris' stand-alone non-GAAP earnings, highlighting $281 million in onetime deal and integration costs in FY '15, which is in line with th",1165,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning to everyone. Slide 5 provides a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP and to Harris' stand-alone non-GAAP earnings, highlighting $281 million in onetime deal and integration costs in FY '15, which is in line with the $270 million to $290 million in our prior guidance. We also incurred additional charges in Q4 of a net $32 million for restructuring and other items impacting Harris stand-alone business, with the largest part being an intangible impairment in Integrated Network Solutions for the NMCI contract. Excluding $0.09 per share contribution from Exelis in Q4, Harris' full year EPS was $5.05.
On Slide 6, we provide further detail on our ending cash balance and capital expenditures, which at $148 million for fiscal year '15 includes $4 million for legacy Exelis.
Our tax rate for the quarter and the year was as expected, ending the year with a non-GAAP tax rate of 30.2%. The favorable fiscal '15 rate, which we don't expect to repeat in fiscal '16, resulted from foreign tax credits, the R&D tax credit and other fiscal '14 tax settlements.
Moving to segment results on Slide 7. RF Communications orders in the fourth quarter were $530 million, compared to $361 million in the prior year, and revenue was $505 million, compared to $493 million last year. Tactical Communications revenue was $366 million, an increase of 5%, while orders were $402 million. 
In Public Safety, orders were $128 million and essentially flat compared to prior year of $129 million. Revenue was $139 million, compared to $145 million last year.
Non-GAAP operating income was $159 million, excluding restructuring charges related to Public Safety. Non-GAAP operating margin was 31.6% for the quarter and a strong 31.1%  for the full year.
Turning to Government Communications Systems on Slide 8. Fourth quarter revenue was $485 million, up 1% compared to $480 million in the prior year. Higher revenue from the Foundation GEOINT Content Management program, the F-35 program and Highband Networking Radios for the army's WIN-T program was partially offset by lower revenue from 2 classified programs and the Navy's commercial broadband satellite program. Segment operating income was $66 million, and operating margin was 13.7% in the quarter and a strong 15.8% for the full year.
Turning to Integrated Network Solutions on Slide 9. Fourth quarter revenue was $289 million, compared with $373 million in the prior year, a decline of 23%, primarily due to the wind-down of 2 IT Services programs and continued end market weakness for both IT Services and CapRock.
Non-GAAP operating income was $16 million, excluding charges related to restructuring and other items, compared to $33 million in the prior year, primarily due to the wind-down of highly profitable NMCI contract and continued weakness in commercial healthcare.
Moving to fiscal '16 guidance in Slide 10. Today, we're providing high-level guidance on revenue and EPS with some color around fiscal '16 expectations based on the legacy businesses of Harris and Exelis.
Once we have pro forma historical information for fiscal '15 recast into our 4 new segments, we'll provide an outlook by segment as we typically do. We're initiating guidance for GAAP EPS in the range of $5.25 to $5.45, and for non-GAAP, in the range of $5.60 to $5.80.
Fiscal '16 non-GAAP EPS excludes about $60 million to $65 million of integration costs and a $10 million charge related to inventory step-up. It includes about $133 million or about $0.70 per share of Exelis acquisition and tangible amortization.
Fiscal '16 non-GAAP EBIT margin is expected to be in the range of 16.2% to 16.7%. Putting aside for a minute the cost synergies and other impacts related to the acquisition, guidance reflects segment-level operating margin for legacy Exelis slightly lower than the prior year fiscal pro forma of about 12.5%. Harris segment-level operating margin is expected to be about flat with the prior year, based on legacy RF continued strength similar to the prior year, a more normalized operating margin in legacy Government Communications of about 15%, and for IT Services and CapRock together, an operating margin of around 9%.
Other P&L guidance details are outlined on Slide 10. I'll start with an update on expected synergy savings and integration costs. Our integration team has moved aggressively to capture costs synergies, and is ahead of schedule. As a result, both integration costs and savings are occurring sooner than what we previously expected. We're now on track to achieve fiscal '16 savings of $70 million to $75 million and expect to be at an annual run rate savings of $120 million as we exit fiscal '17, a year sooner than our original estimate and at the top end of our prior range. The $120 million of savings is net of savings that will flow immediately back to the government.
Integration spending was $112 million in fiscal '15, and we expect another $60 million to $65 million in fiscal '16. Total integration costs is now expected to be $150 million, the higher end of our prior range and net of about $25 million of expected reimbursements from the U.S. government, which are not anticipated to begin until fiscal '17. As we move toward greater standardization in processes, policies and operations we'll continue to look for opportunities for further integration savings.
Revenue is expected to be in the range of $7.67 billion to $7.83 billion, down 3% to 5% on a pro forma basis, compared with our fiscal '15 of $8.07 billion. Legacy Harris is expected to be down 2% to 4%. This reflects our initial expectations for Tactical Communications of flat to down slightly, with DoD flat to up low single digits and international flat to down low single digits and continuing weakness in Public Safety with a 2 percentage point decline.
In legacy Government Communications, we expect another growth year of up 2% to 3%. For IT Services and CapRock together, we expect revenue to be down 13% to 15% as a result of continued end market weakness.
Legacy Exelis pro forma stand-alone revenue is expected to be down 5% to 6%, with lower revenue from night vision products and communication products and lower revenue from information systems, primarily from the $85 million roll-off of the Spacelift Range Systems contract that was lost last October.
Slide 11 provides some additional pension information, including an anticipated FAS pension income of about $25 million and ERISA cash contributions of $173 million this fiscal year. With cash funding remaining roughly flat at $170 million in '17 as a result of pension smoothing provided for under the HAFA and MAP-21 legislation. Our unfunded pension liability has declined by about $200 million to $1.9 billion at the end of fiscal '15, principally due to the mandatory funding of the legacy Exelis SERP. The effect of modestly higher discount rates and lower expected return on assets largely offset each other.
So let me please turn it back to Bill for a few wrap-up comments before we open the call for questions."

The revenue outlook that Mick just described anticipates continued budget constraints and the continuing resolution through the end of this calendar year. While the base budget, even under sequestered caps, is bottoming and it's expected to slowly improve, the recovery will be gradual with headwinds persisting until budgets improve and drive new program funding. In the meantime, we continue to have a robust growing pipeline of opportunities, which is a positive sign for the future.
We also put in place an outstanding team leading the new organization we recently announced. As you see on Slide 12, we're organized into 4 market-focused segments, and each segment's president is a well-seasoned executive in the government market: Chris Young with 33 years; Carl D’Alessandro with 31 years; and Bill Gattle and Ed Zoiss each with 28 years. We've taken our 2 most senior leaders, Sheldon Fox and Dana Mehnert, and focused them on driving greater cost and operational efficiencies and reigniting revenue growth across our company. I also believe we delivered on our promise to put the best of the best from both the Harris and Exelis organizations into the top jobs in the combined company, with nearly half of the top 50 positions now filled by a former Exelis employee. I think the energy and enthusiasm across the entire company is very high with a lot of excitement about our future.
So as we enter the fiscal year at a running start on integration and focused on exceeding our synergy goals and driving good earnings growth in '16 with even higher accretion in fiscal '17 and fiscal '18.
To conclude, on Slide 13, we're executing very well on all critical integration success factors, from my deep personal ownership of the integration program to the full-time dedicated team led by Sheldon Fox, that's driving a disciplined process with speed and precision, to the close oversight of the board and the constant communication with employees. The result is that we're now at the high end of our prior range of run rate savings achieved about 1 year sooner than previously expected, with 90% of the action underpinning the savings completed or in process in just 70 days since we closed.
I'm really proud of what Harris has accomplished this past year, and I'm optimistic and confident about what our new team of over 23,000 dedicated employees can deliver in the future. Together, we're committed to solving our customers' most complex challenges and driving value for our shareholders.
With that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the lines for questions."

But we do see, even under sequestered budgets, budgets improving in fiscal '17, fiscal '18. I'm very, very encouraged, Seth, that we are seeing some of the modernization spending on tactical radios start to move. And I feel good about where we're at on Rifleman. I'm really glad to see the Manpack RFP come out a couple of days ago. I'm glad to see that they're moving quickly with a 60-day proposal time period and expecting to make awards in December if all things go smoothly in negotiations. So these, I think, are good signs that there's money moving or will move over time, and I do feel pretty optimistic that will allow our company to grow, maybe not next year, but certainly in years beyond that, Seth."

And we ended the year and Q4 very strong. The orders were extraordinary. I'm very glad to see the revenue was up for the full year. It was at the high end of what we were guiding to, nearly 10%, so we feel very good about where we ended the year. The pipeline is still pretty robust at about $2.4 billion, last quarter it's $2.5 billion. I wouldn't read a lot into that, it moves around a little bit time to time, but it's still very solid at $2.4 billion. The shape of the pipeline looks pretty much like it has over the last couple of quarters. More than half of it is in the Middle East, Northern Africa, Central Asia. And that does seem, still, to be pretty robust, though we do see in the Middle East, in 2 specific countries, some stretch out of some opportunities, which we believe, over time, are very big for the company. One is in Iraq, and the other is in Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Certainly, the price of oil that's with WTI shifting just a little bit below $45 a barrel, that's causing some impact on direct commercial sales. We do know that Iraq sales for us are backed up by the U.S. government foreign military funding. But there are some new commanders in Iraq, and that's taking a bit slower for some of those sales into Iraq to take place. So Iraq is slipping a little bit. And in Saudi, oil is causing a little bit of a problem there. There's a new leadership team in Saudi Arabia. And certainly, the strife in Yemen is causing some shifting around of priorities. Those are the 2 things that have shifted a little bit further to the right. We do see multiyear opportunities in the hundreds of millions of dollars in both Iraq and Saudi Arabia, so we feel good about those. Australia is very strong for us. I mentioned in my remarks a $750 million Phase 3 opportunity, that's outside of our pipeline, but it's real. We're participating in that, and that's going to end up happening. So longer term, we do see good opportunities in international. You'll recall, at the beginning of fiscal '15, we started international tactical with relatively modest guidance of up low single digits, and we ended up at about 10%. And I hope, going into fiscal '16, we're being similarly conservative."

They're going to give you some additional, if you will, leverage for MUOS and some antennas and other things. Then they have a deferred threshold set of requirements that have to be met by June of 2017. And then a series of objective requirements that will fold in, over time, based on how industry evolves to capture some of these opportunities. Again like around power, weight, et cetera. So that's the way we see it shaking out. This whole light Manpack opportunity is going to be kind of interesting, and I don't know where it's ultimately going to go. They're looking for a lower-weight Manpack, maybe feature some of the Manpack. It could potentially, Chris, be something like a 2-channel handheld that would go to a SOCOM and maybe, over time, go into the regular Army. So it's -- we're unclear as to how that's going to evolve over time. But that's essentially the way we see 689 pages in a nutshell."

We've calibrated going forward, for CapRock Energy, into fiscal '16 down about 20%. We did see in the last quarter a lot of the oil majors, oil service companies have done more restructuring.

We're guiding it down 5% to 6%. When we go back to old segments of Exelis, we do see the Electronic Systems and the Night Vision Comms business both being down in fiscal '15 about mid-single-digits. The IS business, Information Systems, would be down about 10%, with the largest piece of that, 7 or 8 points roughly, that's from the loss of a contract, this range support contract, that was lost in October of last year. And we do see the Arrow business up mid-teens, that's growing pretty nicely with content with Boeing with Airbus, with the F-35 ramp, the 53k with Sikorsky. They got some good programs there. So when I look at all the pieces and how they're moving around and what's growing, the Arrow business does have lower margin, so when that grows faster than the others, it does depress the overall margin rate a little bit. But I do see that there is some softening in the margins for Night Vision Comms. And I do see some softening in the Electronic Systems business as they transition from what were production programs to some more development programs, and that's sort of a natural transition. So they were down I think right about 12.5% pro forma last year, if I remember right, and we're guiding to be slightly less than that in fiscal '16."

Our first quarter was a solid start to the fiscal year and was our first full quarter including Exelis' operations. Integration of Exelis is progressing well, with cost savings dropping through the results in Q1 and expected to ramp quickly through the balance of the year. 
Coming out of the gates, I was very pleased with first quarter orders strength, particularly for tactical radios, electronic warfare and intelligent systems, which resulted in a book-to-bill of 1.24 for the company and 6% sequential growth in funded backlog. And we're delivering on our commitment to delever, paying down term debt by $150 million in the quarter while continuing to pay an attractive dividend, which was increased in August for the 14th consecutive year. 
Harris is now operating in 4 new business segments: Communication Systems, Space and Intelligent Systems, Electronic Systems and Critical Networks. In a separate filing yesterday, we provided historical pro forma information for fiscal '14 and '15, combining Harris' and Exelis' historical results as if the companies had previously operated together under the new segment structure, information we believe is helpful for understanding year-over-year trends. We'll refer to these comparisons as organic in today's call and presentation materials. I'll also remind you that all of our comments address non-GAAP results excluding acquisition-related costs. 
So turning to Slide 3, 4 and 5 in the presentation. Revenue in Q1 was $1.81 billion compared to $1.16 billion in the prior year and was higher because of the acquisition. On an organic basis, revenue was down 6%, driven in large part by continuing weakness in the government and energy services markets. Earnings per share was $1.31 and included $0.17 of intangible amortization from the Exelis acquisition. Acquisition-related savings are reading through an improving operating income with EBIT before amortization of intangibles up 7% to $319 million and margin increasing more than 200 basis points to 17.6%. Cost synergies were $11 million in the quarter and were on track to reach our fiscal year targets of $70 million to $75 million. 
Also captured in improving operating performance is our ongoing focus on what we call Harris Business Excellence, our operational excellence program which targets 2% to 3% annual net cost reduction. In addition to supporting margins, our strategy is to reinvest some of these savings into R&D and new product development to drive future growth. And in Q1, we continued to spend at a healthy rate of 4.3% of revenue. Q1 orders were $2.24 billion with book-to-bill of 1.24 and with all 4 segments greater than 1. In Harris' legacy tactical radio business, orders increased 30% and book-to-bill was 1.3  with strength in both U.S. DoD and international markets.  Our international tactical radio business continues to be supported by a pipeline of near- and longer-term opportunities across a broad set of geographies and driven by ongoing global security concerns from NATO responding to Russian aggression to conflict across the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. In Northern Africa, the U.S. is gearing up to combat rising terrorism. And the tilt to the Pacific is providing significant multiyear opportunities in Australia. And U.S. funding support for foreign military sales remain strong, both in the base budget as well as in the OCO accounts. OCO funding in FY '15 and proposed in FY '16 is supporting several special initiatives like the European reassurance initiative to counterterrorism partnership fund that supports regional -- regions of instability in the Middle East and Africa and to train and equip fund for Iraq. 
First quarter tactical orders were underpinned by the strong U.S. funding support and included $38 million and $26 million from a country in Central Asia, $39 million from 2 Baltic countries and $27 million from several countries in the Middle East and Africa. Also progressing through procurement are opportunities supported by the Iraq train and equip fund with the first of these opportunities in the low 10s of millions and expected to book in Q2. 
In the U.S. market, our base business continue to be supported by recent opportunities in sustainment, which was reflected in 1Q's broad-based orders strength across the services and included a $100 million single-sourced IDIQ ceiling increase to $500 million for tactical radio spare part purchases by the Army and other agencies. 
A very big strategic win in the quarter, which is currently under protest, is the $390 million SOCOM 2-channel handheld tactical radio. This radio combines communication and ISR capabilities and can receive full-motion video as well as signals-based threat information. SOCOM is typically an early adopter of technology, so we're encouraged that continuing to invest our own company-funded R&D is a winning strategy supporting our already strong competitive position. 
Similar to other products first developed for the U.S. market, we fully expect this new 2-channel handheld will generate strong international demand. This win is part of a larger monetization program that SOCOM has estimated could reach $900 million and include a multichannel Manpack radio expected to be awarded in the fall of 2016 and high-frequency radio expected to be awarded in the summer of 2017. In 
addition to the SOCOM award, we're seeing other signs of momentum building for broad-based U.S. tactical modernization. In early October, we submitted our bid for the Army's 2-channel Manpack radio with award anticipated early next calendar year, and our MNVR mid-tier radio for the Army is slated for a milestone C-decision in the coming months. In the airborne market, we've been selling Link 16 radios codeveloped with Viasat to upgrade a Apache aircraft. And with the program now canceled, we'll continue to be the sole provider for that mission. 
The more significant airborne opportunity in the horizon is the Small Airborne Networking Radio, or SANR, program valued at $700 million, which has been pushed out -- which had been pushed out by budgetary pressures. Funding for SANR has begun, and the first draft RFP is out with the second expected in December. First production buys are currently expected to begin in GFY 19. 
We also had excellent wins from classified customers receiving orders of $184 million, up significantly over the prior year and primarily in support of advance center systems and space superiority. With a pivot to Asia, space superiority and protection has become a U.S. defense priority, and recent reports suggest spending in this area could reach $8 billion over the next 5 years. We also saw nice recovery in electronic warfare orders, including slips from the prior quarter with the wins coming from across the air, ground and maritime domains of our EW franchise. In the air domain, we received orders of $111 million from the Air Force primarily for the B-52 and $97 million from the Navy for the F-18. And we won a 5-year, $78 million single award IDIQ from a DoD customer for rotary aircraft. In the ground domain, EW orders included $27 million for the U.S. Department of State for EGON counter IED systems. And supporting the maritime domain, we awarded 3 contracts, a $113 million contract with an initial $39 million order from the U.S. Naval Sea Systems Command for radar modification kits, a 2-year $49  million production contract for launchers used to conduct underwater acoustic surveillance on 25 U.S. and 8 Australian P8 Poseidon aircraft and a 3-year $54 million single-award IDIQ from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory for the Advanced Decoy Architecture Payloads program ADAP. the ADAP award is a strategic win. It allows us to enter a new market with the potential to grow longer term. Our solutions provide capabilities to address advanced maritime threats beyond what current decoys provide. And because our solutions allow us the customer to retrofit existing decoy shelves with our payload, it's cost-effective and it's quick. 
As you know, Sheldon Fox is leading our integration efforts. And as we promised investors in the board, Sheldon and his team are dedicated full time to successfully integrating de 2 companies. So before Mick provides detailed results and guidance on the new segment basis, I've asked Sheldon to join us today to provide a status update and highlight one of our larger integration projects.

Our integration begin with a running start at closing, and within the first 70 days, we had 90% of the actions underpinning the savings completed or in process. And we'll continue along aggressive path to quickly execute against our plan and expect to generate between $70 million and $75 million in savings in fiscal '16, well on our way to achieving the $120 million run rate savings as we exit fiscal '17. We're executing fast and executing with a great deal of focus. Each cost synergy project has a dedicated team and a detailed plan which is tracked weekly. 
Bill asked me to provide a little color on the key project with highlights the value we're creating through integration. In July, we announced the closure of Exelis' Ft. Wayne tactical radio facility and consolidation into our world-class Rochester manufacturing facility. In the first quarter, the last radio rolled off a line in Ft. Wayne, and all manufacturing operations will wrap up by fiscal year-end. Currently, we're taking steps to ensure that engineering and manufacturing know-how is fully transferred to Rochester, including moving key employees. 
Slide 6 shows the fourth base in Rochester designated and prepped for the transition. The reduction in manufacturing square footage for production is significant, reducing the footprint from 90,000 square feet to 20,000 square feet and reducing 6 SMT lines down to 2. The entire facility in Fort Wayne is about 300,000 square feet. Once SINCGARS is transitioned, we'll shrink the remaining space being utilized to about 30,000 square feet until the lease expires in December of 2017. Our actions will begin to produce savings in the fourth quarter of fiscal '16 with additional savings to fall to optimizing our supply base and leveraging the scale and efficiency of the Rochester facility. But why is all this important? Because SINCGARS remains an important communications capability around the world. The SINCGARS radio line has an install base of 600,000 radios worldwide, with about 550,000 of those in the U.S. In the domestic market, there's a very long tail of replacement and sustainment. So executing a seamless manufacturing transition will be important in supporting and eventually transitioning SINCGARSs' users to new JTRS radios. And in international market, demand for SINCGARS radios is still fairly strong. While one of the larger initial projects, Ft. Wayne is just one of the many projects in progress. Integration process will be a multiyear effort, and we're still in the early innings. We're off to a terrific start. 
I'll turn it over to Mick."

Glad to have you on the call. Good morning to everyone. Slide 7, we provide descriptions within the segments. The following segment slides show prior year pro forma results as Exelis and Harris were combined for all of 2015. We believe",857,"Thank you, Sheldon. Glad to have you on the call. Good morning to everyone. Slide 7, we provide descriptions within the segments. The following segment slides show prior year pro forma results as Exelis and Harris were combined for all of 2015. We believe this results into more meaningful year-over-year organic comparisons. 
Moving to segment results starting on Slide 8. Communication system segment revenue was $454 million compared to prior year pro forma revenue of $469 million, and increase in Tactical Communications was more than offset by weakness in Public Safety where competitive pressures remain challenging. Within de segment, Tactical Communications has been redefined as a combination of both companies ground and airborne tactical radios with Exelis night vision products. We provided that detail on Slide 8. On this new basis, Tactical Communications revenue is up 1%, primarily driven by a 7% increase in Harris' legacy tactical, partially offset by lower expected revenue in Exelis' legacy tactical and night vision product lines. 
In Public Safety, revenue was $92 million compared to $111 million in the prior year. Communication system segment operating performance improved compared to prior year pro forma. Operating income in the first quarter was $138 million, and operating margin was 30.4% compared to last year's operating income of $125 million and 26.7% margin. 
Turning to space and intelligent systems on Slide 9. First quarter revenue was $435 million compared to prior year pro forma revenue of $455 million. Higher revenue from 2 programs, including the Foundation GEOINT Content Management program, was more than offset by the completion of 2 other classified programs and a commercial space payable program. Segment operating performance improved compared to prior year pro forma. Operating income in the first quarter was $68 million, and operating margin was 15.6% compared to last year's operating income of $57 million and 12.5% margin. 
Turning to Electronic Systems on Slide 10. First quarter revenue was $374 million compared to $378 million in the prior year. Higher revenue from the F-35 production ramp was offset by lower electronic warfare revenue. This was primarily due to a higher mix of programs in the development phase versus production phases. Segment operating performance improved compared to prior year pro forma. Operating income in the first quarter was $69 million, and operating margin was 18.4% compared to last year's operating income of $56 million and 14.8% margin. 
Turning to Critical Networks on Slide 11. First quarter revenue was $566 million compared to prior year pro forma revenue of $644 million. As anticipated, revenue declined due to continuing services weakness in government and energy markets. Segment operating income was $63 million compared to prior year pro forma of $72 million, and operating margin held relatively in line with the prior year on lower revenue. 
Moving to Slide 12 and 13. Fiscal '16 guidance remains unchanged for GAAP EPS in a range of $5.25 to $5.45 and non-GAAP in a range of $5.60 to $5.80. Fiscal '16 non-GAAP EPS excludes expected integration cost in a range of $60 million to $65 million and $10 million charge related to inventory step-up. Non-GAAP EPS includes the intangible amortization from the Exelis acquisition of $133 million or about $0.70 per share. Revenue guidance is unchanged in a range of $7.67 billion to $7.83 billion, down 3% to 5% on an organic basis compared to fiscal '15 pro forma of $8.09 billion kept. And whilst segments have changed, our expectations for revenue drivers within the segments are consistent with the previous color we provide. In communication systems, we expect organic revenue to be down 2% to 3%. Public Safety is expected to be down low to mid-single digits. Tactical Communications on the new basis, including the ground and airborne radio for both companies as well as night vision products, is expected to be down low single digits. This aligns with our previous expectations for Harris legacy tactical; DoD flat to up low single digits; and international, flat to down low single digits. Operating margin for the segment is expected to be in the range of 29.5% to 30.5%, which assumes legacy Harris tactical margin in line with fiscal '15 and consistent with previous expectations. 
In space and intelligent systems, revenue is expected to be flat to up 2% with growth in intelligence areas, partially offset by lower revenue from space payload programs. Segment operating margin is expected to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%. Electronic Systems revenue is expected to be down 1% to up 1%, driven by the F-35 production ramp. Segment operating margin is expected to be in a range of 18% to 19%. 
In Critical Networks, revenue is expected to be down 10% to 12% due to continuing services weaknesses, with an operating margin in a range of 11% to 12% as we keep the focus on lowering costs. We continue to expect free cash flow for the year greater than 100% of GAAP net income adjusted to add back the $88 million after-tax impact of the amortization of acquisition intangibles. 
So let me turn it over to Bill for a few wrap-up comments before we open the call to questions."

So I won't repeat the budget detail that all of you already know, but suffice it to say the 2-year deal will be a positive for Harris as well as the industry, signaling a long-awaited budget bottom and the rise in government spending. Overall, we had a good start to the fiscal year. We're capturing integration savings, which will continue to ramp through the year and benefit earnings. And while we continue to expect a soft top line environment to persist in the second quarter, partially due to Exelis' relatively strong prior year and December results, we're encouraged by the orders rebound in the first quarter. Momentum for U.S. tactical modernization is building, and the recent SOCOM award on top of the early awards that the radio and the midtier radio are a testament to the strength of Harris' commercial model and the positive return on our sustained investments on R&D through the market downturn.

We know that bringing the Exelis into our business, we showed our numbers on a pro forma basis. They had a fiscal year last year, which ended in December, so their fourth quarter was now our second quarter. They had a pretty strong run at that quarter as a lot of companies do in the last quarter of their fiscal year, so that does give us some year-over-year headwind. And keep in mind, we're still under a continuing the resolution. There's no appropriations budgets yet, and that still does drive some stickiness in the planning outlays for what is now our second quarter.

Q1 was down 12%. Very pleased that we're protecting the margins. I think we're doing a good job in taking cost out in spite of the pretty weak revenue environment. But you hit the nail on the head. It's 2 soft markets. One is government IT that we see down in the mid-teens for the year, not different than what we talked about last time as if both IR, IT Services business as well as the Exelis IT business. Q1 was a bit down worse than that in Government IT Services, but we do expect that the revenue will be roughly flat sequentially over the balance of the year. The book-to-bill in Q1 was about -- was over 1. We expect it to be about 1 for the year, so that feels pretty good. Keep in mind, in IT Services, we had a couple of unique dimensions happening here. one, Exelis lost the space launch range system contract prior to the acquisition, happened just over a year ago, and that's rolling through the numbers. That's about $85 million. there's a couple of other programs that we are transitioning out of Harris, specifically the NMCI contract and a pretty large VA program that ended last year. So there's a couple of different things, dynamics that are happening that are relatively unique in the Government IT market for us. We are refocusing on the intelligence community. We think that there's an opportunity to differentiate ourselves in that space. Some of those awards are moving a little bit to the right, but I think that's going to start to see some stability with a balance of the year as at least in terms of sequential growth. The other one that has an impact in the quarter is that you suggested is that in the CapRock energy business. We expected that to be weak in the year. It's going to be down on a full year basis, sort of no mid-teens in Q1, it was a little bit worse than that. We know that oil is still relatively weak. We saw the results from a lot of the oil service companies and majors over the last quarter. Rig count remains pretty weak. It's down about 40% year-over-year. And some of the oil majors and service companies are announcing more restructurings and CapEx cuts, so we do see continued pressure on that business. We're watching it very, very carefully. We think we calibrated our year, but again, the market is pretty volatile at this point. We keep watching it. The piece in that Critical Networks, it is relatively stable. We feel good about that on the FAA side. We've got a good portfolio businesses with the FAA. It's pretty broad based, and we feel very good about our position and the funding pattern for the FA program within cargo networks. so soft, when you put all the pieces together long-winded way of saying that's what the network is down about 10% to 12% in the year."

Sheldon talked about $70 million to $75 million in full year, so of course, that is going to happen. The bulk of that, that's yet to come in not in our numbers, so you will see some strength coming in the numbers simply because of integration savings, which are booked within the segments. The other side is we are pushing very, very hard in our legacy operational excellence, Harris business excellence program, and we do see opportunities to continue to protect margins in each of the segments because of that.

So I feel very good about where we happen to be on the Manpack and not much more to say at this point given the status of that opportunity.

Our first quarter was a solid start to the fiscal year and was our first full quarter including Exelis' operations. Integration of Exelis is progressing well, with cost savings dropping through the results in Q1 and expected to ramp quickly through the balance of the year.
Coming out of the gates, I was very pleased with the first quarter order strength, particularly for tactical radios, electronic warfare and intelligent systems, which resulted in a book-to-bill of 1.24 for the company and 6% sequential growth in funded backlog. And we're delivering on our commitment to delever, paying down term debt by $150 million in the quarter while continuing to pay an attractive dividend, which was increased in August for the 14th consecutive year.
Harris is now operating in 4 new business segments: Communication Systems, Space and Intelligence Systems, Electronic Systems and Critical Networks. In a separate filing yesterday, we provided historical pro forma information for fiscal '14 and '15, combining Harris' and Exelis' historical results as if the companies had previously operated together under the new segment structure, information we believe is helpful for understanding year-over-year trends. We'll refer to these comparisons as organic in today's call and presentation materials. I'll also remind you that all of our comments address non-GAAP results, excluding acquisition-related costs.
So turning to Slide 3, 4 and 5 in the presentation. Revenue in Q1 was $1.81 billion compared to $1.16 billion in the prior year and was higher because of the acquisition. On an organic basis, revenue was down 6%, driven in large part by continuing weakness in the government and energy services markets.
Earnings per share was $1.31 and included $0.17 of intangible amortization from the Exelis acquisition. Acquisition-related savings are reading through an improving operating income with EBIT before amortization of intangibles up 7% to $319 million and margin increasing more than 200 basis points to 17.6%. Cost synergies were $11 million in the quarter and were on track to reach our fiscal year target of $70 million to $75 million.
Also captured in improving operating performance is our ongoing focus on what we call Harris Business Excellence, our operational excellence program which targets 2% to 3% in annual net cost reduction.
In addition to supporting margins, our strategy is to reinvest some of these savings into R&D and new product development to drive future growth. And in Q1, we continued to spend at a healthy rate of 4.3% of revenue.
Q1 orders were $2.24 billion with book-to-bill of 1.24 and with all 4 segments greater than 1. In Harris' legacy tactical radio business, orders increased 30% and book-to-bill was 1.3, with strength in both U.S. DoD and international markets.  Our international tactical radio business continues to be supported by a pipeline of near- and longer-term opportunities across a broad set of geographies and driven by ongoing global security concerns, from NATO responding to Russian aggression, to conflict across the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. In Northern Africa, the U.S. is gearing up to combat rising terrorism. And the tilt to the Pacific is providing significant multiyear opportunities in Australia. And U.S. funding support for foreign military sales remain strong, both in the base budget as well as in the OCO accounts. OCO funding in GFY '15 and proposed in GFY '16 is supporting several special initiatives like the European Reassurance Initiative, the Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund that supports regional -- regions of instability in the Middle East and Africa and the Train and Equip Fund for Iraq.
First quarter tactical orders were underpinned by the strong U.S. funding support and included $38 million and $26 million from a country in Central Asia, $39 million from 2 Baltic countries and $27 million from several countries in the Middle East and Africa. Also progressing through procurement are opportunities supported by the Iraq Train and Equip Fund, with the first of these opportunities in the low tens of millions and expected to book in Q2.
In the U.S. market, our base business continue to be supported by recent opportunities in sustainment, which was reflected in 1Q's broad-based order strength across the services and included in a -- and also included a $100 million single-sourced IDIQ ceiling increase to $500 million for tactical radio spare part purchases by the Army and other agencies.
A very big strategic win in the quarter, which is currently under protest, is the $390 million SOCOM 2-channel handheld tactical radio. This radio combines communication and ISR capabilities and can receive full-motion video as well as signals-based threat information. SOCOM is typically an early adopter of technology, so we're encouraged that continuing to invest our own company-funded R&D is a winning strategy supporting our already strong competitive position.
Similar to other products first developed for the U.S. market, we fully expect this new 2-channel handheld will generate strong international demand. This win is part of a larger monetization program that SOCOM has estimated could reach $900 million and include a multichannel Manpack radio expected to be awarded in the fall of 2016 and a high-frequency radio expected to be awarded in the summer of 2017. 
In addition to the SOCOM award, we're seeing other signs of momentum building for broad-based U.S. tactical modernization. In early October, we submitted our bid for the Army's 2-channel Manpack radio with award anticipated early next calendar year, and our MNVR mid-tier radio for the Army is slated for a milestone C-decision in the coming months. In the airborne market, we've been selling Link 16 radios codeveloped with ViaSat to upgrade Apache aircraft. And with the program now canceled, we'll continue to be the sole provider for that mission.
The more significant airborne opportunity in the horizon is the Small Airborne Networking Radio, or SANR, program valued at $700 million, which has been pushed out -- which had been pushed out by budgetary pressures. Funding for SANR has begun, and the first draft RFP is out, with the second expected in December. First production buys are currently expected to begin in GFY '19.
We also had excellent wins from classified customers receiving orders of $184 million, up significantly over the prior year and primarily in support of advanced center systems and space superiority. With a pivot to Asia, space superiority and protection has become a U.S. defense priority, and recent reports suggest spending in this area could reach $8 billion over the next 5 years.
We also saw nice recovery in electronic warfare orders, including slips from the prior quarter, with the wins coming from across the air, ground and maritime domains of our EW franchise. In the air domain, we received orders of $111 million from the Air Force, primarily for the B-52, and $97 million from the Navy for the F-18. And we won this 5-year, $78 million single-award IDIQ from a DoD customer for rotary aircraft. In the ground domain, EW orders included $27 million from the U.S. Department of State for EGON counter IED systems. In supporting the maritime domain, we awarded 3 contracts: a $113 million contract with an initial $39 million order from the U.S. Naval Sea Systems Command for radar modification kits; a 2-year, $49 million production contract for sonobuoy launchers used to conduct underwater acoustic surveillance on 25 U.S. and 8 Australian P-8 Poseidon aircraft; and a 3-year, $54 million single-award IDIQ from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory for the Advanced Decoy Architecture Payloads program, or ADAP. The ADAP award is a strategic win. It allows us to enter a new market with the potential to grow longer term. Our solution provides capabilities to address advanced maritime threats beyond what current decoys provide. And because our solution allows the customer to retrofit existing decoy shelves with our payload, it's cost-effective and it's quick.
As you know, Sheldon Fox is leading our integration effort. And as we promised investors and the board, Sheldon and his team are dedicated full time to successfully integrating the 2 companies.
So before Mick provides detailed results and guidance on a new segment basis, I've asked Sheldon to join us today to provide a status update and highlight one of our larger integration projects. Sheldon?"

Our integration began with a running start at closing, and within the first 70 days, we had 90% of the actions underpinning the savings completed or in process. And we'll continue along that aggressive path to quickly execute against our plan and expect to generate between $70 million and $75 million in savings in fiscal '16, well on our way to achieving the $120 million run rate savings as we exit fiscal '17. We're executing fast and executing with a great deal of focus. Each cost synergy project has a dedicated team and a detailed plan which is tracked weekly.
Bill asked me to provide a little color on a key project which highlights the value we're creating through integration. In July, we announced the closure of Exelis' Ft. Wayne tactical radio facility and consolidation into our world-class Rochester manufacturing facility. In the first quarter, the last SINCGARS radio rolled off the line in Ft. Wayne, and all manufacturing operations will wrap up by fiscal year-end. Currently, we're taking steps to ensure that engineering and manufacturing know-how is fully transferred to Rochester, including moving key employees.
Slide 6 shows the floor space in Rochester designated and prepped for the transition. The reduction in manufacturing square footage for SINCGARS production is significant, reducing the footprint from 90,000 square feet to 20,000 square feet and reducing 6 SMT lines down to 2. The entire facility in Fort Wayne is about 300,000 square feet. Once SINCGARS is transitioned, we'll shrink the remaining space being utilized to about 30,000 square feet until the lease expires in December of 2017. Our actions will begin to produce savings in the fourth quarter of fiscal '16, with additional savings to follow through optimizing our supplier base and leveraging the scale and efficiency of the Rochester facility.
But why is all this important? Because SINCGARS remains an important communications capability around the world. The SINCGARS radio line has an install base of 600,000 radios worldwide, with about 550,000 of those in the U.S. In the domestic market, there's a very long tail of replacement and sustainment. So executing a seamless manufacturing transition will be important in supporting and eventually transitioning SINCGARS users to new JTRS radios. And in the international market, demand for SINCGARS radios is still fairly strong. While one of the larger initial projects, Ft. Wayne is just one of the many projects in progress. Integration process will be a multiyear effort, and we're still in the early innings. But we're off to a terrific start.
I'll turn it over to Mick."

Good morning to everyone.
Slide 7, we provide descriptions of the new segments. The following segment slides show prior year pro forma results as Exelis and Harris were combined for all of 2015. We believe this results in to more meaningful year-over-year organic comparisons.
Moving to segment results, starting on Slide 8. Communication Systems segment revenue was $454 million compared to prior year pro forma revenue of $469 million, and increase in Tactical Communications was more than offset by weakness in Public Safety, where competitive pressures remain challenging. Within the segment, Tactical Communications has been redefined as the combination of both companies' ground and airborne tactical radios with Exelis night vision products. We've provided that detail in Slide 8. On this new basis, Tactical Communications revenue is up 1%, primarily driven by a 7% increase in Harris legacy tactical, partially offset by lower expected revenue in Exelis legacy tactical and night vision product lines. In Public Safety, revenue was $92 million compared to $111 million in the prior year. Communication Systems segment operating performance improved compared to prior year pro forma. Operating income in the first quarter was $138 million, and operating margin was 30.4% compared to last year's operating income of $125 million and 26.7% margin.
Turning to Space and Intelligence Systems on Slide 9. First quarter revenue was $435 million compared to prior year pro forma revenue of $455 million. Higher revenue from 2 classified programs, including the Foundation GEOINT Content Management program, was more than offset by the completion of 2 other classified programs and a commercial space payable program. Segment operating performance improved compared to prior year pro forma. Operating income in the first quarter was $68 million, and operating margin was 15.6% compared to last year's operating income of $57 million and 12.5% margin.
Turning to Electronic Systems on Slide 10. First quarter revenue was $374 million compared to $378 million in the prior year. Higher revenue from the F-35 production ramp was offset by lower electronic warfare revenue. This was primarily due to a higher mix of programs in the development phase versus production phases. Segment operating performance improved compared to prior year pro forma. Operating income in the first quarter was $69 million, and operating margin was 18.4% compared to last year's operating income of $56 million and 14.8% margin.
Turning to Critical Networks on Slide 11. First quarter revenue was $566 million compared to prior year pro forma revenue of $644 million. As anticipated, revenue declined due to continuing services weakness in government and energy markets. Segment operating income was $63 million compared to prior year pro forma of $72 million, but operating margin held relatively in line with the prior year on lower revenue.
Moving to Slides 12 and 13. Fiscal '16 guidance remains unchanged for GAAP EPS in a range of $5.25 to $5.45 and non-GAAP in a range of $5.60 to $5.80. Fiscal '16 non-GAAP EPS excludes expected integration costs in a range of $60 million to $65 million and a $10 million charge related to inventory step-up. Non-GAAP EPS includes the intangible amortization from the Exelis acquisition of $133 million or about $0.70 per share.
Revenue guidance is unchanged in a range of $7.67 billion to $7.83 billion, down 3% to 5% on an organic basis compared to fiscal '15 pro forma of $8.09 billion. And while segments have changed, our expectations for revenue drivers within the segments are consistent with the previous color we provided.
In Communication Systems, we expect organic revenue to be down 2% to 3%. Public Safety is expected to be down low to mid-single-digits. Tactical Communications on the new basis, including the ground and airborne radios of both companies as well as night vision products, is expected to be down low single digits. This aligns with our previous expectations for Harris legacy tactical: DoD, flat to up low single digits; and international, flat to down low single digits. Operating margin for the segment is expected to be in a range of 29.5% to 30.5%, which assumes legacy Harris tactical margin in line with fiscal '15 and consistent with previous expectations.
In Space and Intelligence Systems, revenue is expected to be flat to up 2%, with growth in intelligence areas, partially offset by lower revenue from space payload programs. Segment operating margin is expected to be in a range of 15.5% to 16.5%.
Electronic Systems revenue is expected to be down 1% to up 1%, driven by the F-35 production ramp. Segment operating margin is expected to be in a range of 18% to 19%.
In Critical Networks, revenue is expected to be down 10% to 12% due to continuing services weaknesses, with an operating margin in a range of 11% to 12% as we keep the focus on lowering costs. We continue to expect free cash flow for the year greater than 100% of GAAP net income, adjusted to add back the $88 million after-tax impact of the amortization of acquisition intangibles.
So let me turn it back to Bill for a few wrap-up comments before we open the call for questions."

So I won't repeat the budget detail that all of you already know, but suffice it to say that the 2-year deal will be a positive for Harris as well as the industry, signaling a long-awaited budget bottom and the rise in government spending. Overall, we had a good start to the fiscal year. We're capturing integration savings, which will continue to ramp through the year and benefit earnings. And while we continue to expect a soft top line environment to persist in the second quarter, partially due to Exelis' relatively strong prior year and December quarter results, we're encouraged by the orders rebound in the first quarter. Momentum for U.S. tactical modernization is building, and the recent SOCOM award on top of the early awards of the Rifleman radio and the mid-tier radio are a testament to the strength of Harris' commercial model and a positive return on our sustained investments in R&D through the market downturn.

They had a fiscal year last year, which ended in December, so their fourth quarter was now our second quarter. They had a pretty strong run at that quarter as a lot of companies do in the last quarter of their fiscal year, so that does give us some year-over-year headwind.

Q1 was down 12%. Very pleased that we're protecting the margins. I think we're doing a good job in taking cost out in spite of the pretty weak revenue environment. But, Seth, you hit the nail on the head. It's 2 soft markets. One is government IT that we see down in the mid-teens for the year, not different than what we talked about last time as both our IT Services business as well as the Exelis IT business. Q1 was a bit down worse than that in Government IT Services, but we do expect that the revenue will be roughly flat sequentially over the balance of the year. The book-to-bill in Q1 was about -- was over 1, and we expect it to be about 1 for the year, so that feels pretty good. Keep in mind, in IT Services, we have a couple of unique dimensions happening here. One, Exelis lost the space launch range system contract prior to the acquisition, happened just over a year ago, and that's rolling through the numbers. That's about $85 million. And there's a couple of other programs that we are transitioning out of Harris, specifically the NMCI contract and a pretty large VA program that ended last year. So there's a couple of different things, dynamics that are happening that are relatively unique in that Government IT market for us. We are refocusing on the intelligence community. We think that there's an opportunity to differentiate ourselves in that space. Some of those awards are moving a little bit to the right, but I think that's going to start to see some stability through the balance of the year, at least in terms of sequential growth. The other one that has an impact in the quarter is -- as you suggested, is in the CapRock energy business. We expected that to be weak in the year. It's going to be down on a full year basis, sort of mid-teens in Q1. It was a little bit worse than that. We know that oil is still relatively weak. We saw the results from a lot of the oil service companies and majors over the last quarter. Rig count remains pretty weak. It's down about 40% year-over-year. And some of the oil majors and service companies are announcing more restructurings and CapEx cuts. So we do see continued pressure in that business. We're watching it very, very carefully. We think we've calibrated our year, but again, the market is pretty volatile at this point, and we keep watching it. The piece in that -- in Critical Networks, it is relatively stable. We feel good about that, and that's on the FAA side. We've got a good portfolio of businesses with the FAA. It's pretty broad based, and we feel very good about our position and the funding pattern for the FAA programs within Critical Networks. So Seth, when you put all these pieces together, long-winded way of saying it, that's why the Critical Networks is down about 10% to 12% in the year."

Sheldon talked about $70 million to $75 million in the full year, so of course, that is going to happen. The bulk of that, that's yet to come and not in our numbers. So you will see some strength coming in the numbers simply because of integration savings, which are booked within the segments. The other side is we are pushing very, very hard on our legacy operational excellence, Harris Business Excellence program, and we do see opportunities to continue to protect margins in each of the segments because of that. So 3 of the segments, very strong margin expansion, one that we feel pretty good about holding margins in spite of a pretty significant revenue downturn. So I think, from Harris, I think good control in our cost structure so far."

What Sheldon mentioned in his remarks on the Exelis side is a very large installed base is SINCGARS radios in the U.S. and outside the U.S., and in fact, there's lots of countries that have standardized on SINCGARS will continue to buy that. So we do expect to see growth opportunities in SINCGARS, and hopefully, we can leverage more of the existing Harris channels to open up some new opportunities that hadn't been there before. So I wouldn't give any more color than that. There has been some downturns in that night vision comp systems business, but we feel pretty good about the prospects going forward."

Our first quarter was a solid start to the fiscal year and was our first full quarter including Exelis' operations. Integration of Exelis is progressing well, with cost savings dropping through the results in Q1 and expected to ramp quickly through the balance of the year.
Coming out of the gates, I was very pleased with first quarter order strength, particularly for tactical radios, electronic warfare and intelligent systems, which resulted in a book-to-bill of 1.24 for the company and 6% sequential growth in funded backlog. And we're delivering on our commitment to delever, paying down term debt by $150 million in the quarter while continuing to pay an attractive dividend, which was increased in August for the 14th consecutive year.
Harris is now operating in 4 new business segments: Communication Systems, Space and Intelligence Systems, Electronic Systems and Critical Networks. In a separate filing yesterday, we provided historical pro forma information for fiscal '14 and '15, combining Harris' and Exelis' historical results as if the companies had previously operated together under the new segment structure, information we believe is helpful for understanding year-over-year trends. We'll refer to these comparisons as organic in today's call and presentation materials. I'll also remind you that all of our comments address non-GAAP results, excluding acquisition-related costs.
So turning to Slides 3, 4 and 5 in the presentation. Revenue in Q1 was $1.81 billion compared to $1.16 billion in the prior year and was higher because of the acquisition. On an organic basis, revenue was down 6%, driven in large part by continuing weakness in the government and energy services markets.
Earnings per share was $1.31 and included $0.17 of intangible amortization from the Exelis acquisition. Acquisition-related savings are reading through an improving operating income with EBIT before amortization of intangibles up 7% to $319 million and margin increasing more than 200 basis points to 17.6%. Cost synergies were $11 million in the quarter and were on track to reach our fiscal year target of $70 million to $75 million.
Also captured in improving operating performance is our ongoing focus on what we call Harris Business Excellence, our operational excellence program which targets 2% to 3% in annual net cost reduction.
In addition to supporting margins, our strategy is to reinvest some of these savings into R&D and new product development to drive future growth. And in Q1, we continued to spend at a healthy rate of 4.3% of revenue.
Q1 orders were $2.24 billion with book-to-bill of 1.24 and with all 4 segments greater than 1. In Harris' legacy tactical radio business, orders increased 30% and book-to-bill was 1.3, with strength in both U.S. DoD and international markets.  Our international tactical radio business continues to be supported by a pipeline of near- and longer-term opportunities across a broad set of geographies and driven by ongoing global security concerns, from NATO responding to Russian aggression, to conflict across the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. In Northern Africa, the U.S. is gearing up to combat rising terrorism. And the tilt to the Pacific is providing significant multiyear opportunities in Australia. And U.S. funding support for foreign military sales remain strong, both in the base budget as well as in the OCO accounts. OCO funding in GFY '15 and proposed in GFY '16 is supporting several special initiatives like the European Reassurance Initiative, the Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund that supports regional -- regions of instability in the Middle East and Africa and the Train and Equip Fund for Iraq.
First quarter tactical orders were underpinned by this strong U.S. funding support and included $38 million and $26 million from a country in Central Asia, $39 million from 2 Baltic countries and $27 million from several countries in the Middle East and Africa. Also progressing through procurement are opportunities supported by the Iraq Train and Equip Fund, with the first of these opportunities in the low tens of millions and expected to book in Q2.
In the U.S. market, our base business continue to be supported by recent opportunities in sustainment, which was reflected in 1Q's broad-based order strength across the services and included in a -- and also included a $100 million single-sourced IDIQ ceiling increase to $500 million for tactical radio spare part purchases by the Army and other agencies.
A very big strategic win in the quarter, which is currently under protest, is the $390 million SOCOM 2-channel handheld tactical radio. This radio combines communication and ISR capabilities and can receive full-motion video as well as signals-based threat information. SOCOM is typically an early adopter of technology, so we're encouraged that continuing to invest our own company-funded R&D is a winning strategy supporting our already strong competitive position.
Similar to other products first developed for the U.S. market, we fully expect this new 2-channel handheld will generate strong international demand. This win is part of a larger monetization program that SOCOM has estimated could reach $900 million and includes a multichannel Manpack radio expected to be awarded in the fall of 2016 and a high-frequency radio expected to be awarded in the summer of 2017. 
In addition to the SOCOM award, we're seeing other signs of momentum building for broad-based U.S. tactical modernization. In early October, we submitted our bid for the Army's 2-channel Manpack radio with award anticipated early next calendar year, and our MNVR mid-tier radio for the Army is slated for a Milestone C-decision in the coming months. In the airborne market, we've been selling Link 16 radios codeveloped with ViaSat to upgrade Apache aircraft. And with the SALT program now canceled, we'll continue to be the sole provider for that mission.
The more significant airborne opportunity in the horizon is the Small Airborne Networking Radio, or SANR, program valued at $700 million, which has been pushed out -- which had been pushed out by budgetary pressures. Funding for SANR has begun, and the first draft RFP is out, with the second expected in December. First production buys are currently expected to begin in GFY '19.
We also had excellent wins from classified customers receiving orders of $184 million, up significantly over the prior year and primarily in support of advanced sensor systems and space superiority. With a pivot to Asia, space superiority and protection has become a U.S. defense priority, and recent reports suggest spending in this area could reach $8 billion over the next 5 years.
We also saw nice recovery in electronic warfare orders, including slips from the prior quarter, with the wins coming from across the air, ground and maritime domains of our EW franchise. In the air domain, we received orders of $111 million from the Air Force, primarily for the B-52, and $97 million from the Navy for the F-18. And we won a 5-year, $78 million single-award IDIQ from a DoD customer for rotary aircraft. In the ground domain, EW orders included $27 million from the U.S. Department of State for EGON counter IED systems. In supporting the maritime domain, we were awarded 3 contracts: a $113 million contract with an initial $39 million order from the U.S. Naval Sea Systems Command for radar modification kits; a 2-year, $49 million production contract for sonobuoy launchers used to conduct underwater acoustic surveillance on 25 U.S. and 8 Australian P-8 Poseidon aircraft; and a 3-year, $54 million single-award IDIQ from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory for the Advanced Decoy Architecture Payloads program, or ADAP. The ADAP award is a strategic win. It allows us to enter a new market with the potential to grow longer term. Our solution provides capabilities to address advanced maritime threats beyond what current decoys provide. And because our solution allows the customer to retrofit existing decoy shelves with our payload, it's cost-effective and it's quick.
As you know, Sheldon Fox is leading our integration effort. And as we promised investors and the board, Sheldon and his team are dedicated full time to successfully integrating the 2 companies.
So before Mick provides detailed results and guidance on a new segment basis, I've asked Sheldon to join us today to provide a status update and highlight one of our larger integration projects. Sheldon?"

Our integration began with a running start at closing, and within the first 70 days, we had 90% of the actions underpinning the savings completed or in process. And we'll continue along that aggressive path to quickly execute against our plan and expect to generate between $70 million and $75 million in savings in fiscal '16, well on our way to achieving the $120 million run rate savings as we exit fiscal '17. We're executing fast and executing with a great deal of focus. Each cost synergy project has a dedicated team and a detailed plan which is tracked weekly.
Bill asked me to provide a little color on a key project which highlights the value we're creating through integration. In July, we announced the closure of Exelis' Ft. Wayne tactical radio facility and consolidation into our world-class Rochester manufacturing facility. In the first quarter, the last SINCGARS radio rolled off the line in Ft. Wayne, and all manufacturing operations will wrap up by fiscal year-end. Currently, we're taking steps to ensure that engineering and manufacturing know-how is fully transferred to Rochester, including moving key employees.
Slide 6 shows the floor space in Rochester that's been designated and prepped for the transition. The reduction in manufacturing square footage for SINCGARS production is significant, reducing the footprint from 90,000 square feet to 20,000 square feet and reducing 6 SMT lines down to 2. The entire facility in Fort Wayne is about 300,000 square feet. Once SINCGARS is transitioned, we'll shrink the remaining space being utilized to about 30,000 square feet until the lease expires in December of 2017. Our actions will begin to produce savings in the fourth quarter of fiscal '16, with additional savings to follow through optimizing our supplier base and leveraging the scale and efficiency of the Rochester facility.
But why is all this important? Because SINCGARS remains an important communications capability around the world. The SINCGARS radio line has an installed base of 600,000 radios worldwide, with about 550,000 of those in the U.S. In the domestic market, there's a very long tail of replacement and sustainment. So executing a seamless manufacturing transition will be important in supporting and eventually transitioning SINCGARS users to new JTRS radios. And in the international market, demand for SINCGARS radios is still fairly strong. While one of the larger initial projects, Ft. Wayne is just one of the many projects in progress. Integration process will be a multiyear effort, and we're still in the early innings. But we're off to a terrific start.
I'll turn it over to Mick."

Good morning to everyone.
Slide 7, we provide descriptions of the new segments. The following segment slides show prior year pro forma results as if Exelis and Harris were combined for all of 2015. We believe this results in a more meaningful year-over-year organic comparisons.
Moving to segment results, starting on Slide 8. Communication Systems segment revenue was $454 million compared to prior year pro forma revenue of $469 million. An increase in Tactical Communications was more than offset by weakness in Public Safety, where competitive pressures remain challenging. Within the segment, Tactical Communications has been redefined as the combination of both companies' ground and airborne tactical radios with Exelis night vision products. We've provided that detail in Slide 8. On this new basis, Tactical Communications revenue is up 1%, primarily driven by a 7% increase in Harris legacy tactical, partially offset by lower expected revenue in Exelis legacy tactical and night vision product lines. In Public Safety, revenue was $92 million compared to $111 million in the prior year. Communication Systems segment operating performance improved compared to prior year pro forma. Operating income in the first quarter was $138 million, and operating margin was 30.4% compared to last year's operating income of $125 million and 26.7% margin.
Turning to Space and Intelligence Systems on Slide 9. First quarter revenue was $435 million compared to prior year pro forma revenue of $455 million. Higher revenue from 2 classified programs, including the Foundation GEOINT Content Management program, was more than offset by the completion of 2 other classified programs and a commercial space payable program. Segment operating performance improved compared to prior year pro forma. Operating income in the first quarter was $68 million, and operating margin was 15.6% compared to last year's operating income of $57 million and 12.5% margin.
Turning to Electronic Systems on Slide 10. First quarter revenue was $374 million compared to $378 million in the prior year. Higher revenue from the F-35 production ramp was offset by lower electronic warfare revenue. This was primarily due to a higher mix of programs in the development phase versus production phases. Segment operating performance improved compared to prior year pro forma. Operating income in the first quarter was $69 million, and operating margin was 18.4% compared to last year's operating income of $56 million and 14.8% margin.
Turning to Critical Networks on Slide 11. First quarter revenue was $566 million compared to prior year pro forma revenue of $644 million. As anticipated, revenue declined due to continuing services weakness in government and energy markets. Segment operating income was $63 million compared to prior year pro forma of $72 million, but operating margin held relatively in line with the prior year on lower revenue.
Moving to Slides 12 and 13. Fiscal '16 guidance remains unchanged for GAAP EPS in a range of $5.25 to $5.45 and non-GAAP in a range of $5.60 to $5.80. Fiscal '16 non-GAAP EPS excludes expected integration costs in a range of $60 million to $65 million and a $10 million charge related to inventory step-up. Non-GAAP EPS includes the intangible amortization from the Exelis acquisition of $133 million or about $0.70 per share.
Revenue guidance is unchanged in a range of $7.67 billion to $7.83 billion, down 3% to 5% on an organic basis compared to fiscal '15 pro forma of $8.09 billion. And while segments have changed, our expectations for revenue drivers within the segments are consistent with the previous color we provided.
In Communication Systems, we expect organic revenue to be down 2% to 3%. Public Safety is expected to be down low to mid-single-digits. Tactical Communications on the new basis, including the ground and airborne radios of both companies as well as night vision products, is expected to be down low single digits. This aligns with our previous expectations for Harris legacy tactical: DoD, flat to up low single digits; and international, flat to down low single digits. Operating margin for the segment is expected to be in a range of 29.5% to 30.5%, which assumes legacy Harris tactical margin in line with fiscal '15 and consistent with previous expectations.
In Space and Intelligence Systems, revenue is expected to be flat to up 2%, with growth in intelligence areas, partially offset by lower revenue from space payload programs. Segment operating margin is expected to be in a range of 15.5% to 16.5%.
Electronic Systems revenue is expected to be down 1% to up 1%, driven by the F-35 production ramp. Segment operating margin is expected to be in a range of 18% to 19%.
In Critical Networks, revenue is expected to be down 10% to 12% due to continuing services weaknesses, with an operating margin in a range of 11% to 12% as we keep the focus on lowering costs. We continue to expect free cash flow for the year greater than 100% of GAAP net income, adjusted to add back the $88 million after-tax impact of the amortization of acquisition intangibles.
So let me turn it back to Bill for a few wrap-up comments before we open the call for questions."

So I won't repeat the budget detail that all of you already know, but suffice it to say that a 2-year deal will be a positive for Harris as well as the industry, signaling a long-awaited budget bottom and the rise in government spending. Overall, we had a good start to the fiscal year. We're capturing integration savings, which will continue to ramp through the year and benefit earnings. And while we continue to expect a soft top line environment to persist in the second quarter, partially due to Exelis' relatively strong prior year and December quarter results, we're encouraged by the orders rebound in the first quarter. Momentum for U.S. tactical modernization is building, and the recent SOCOM award on top of the early awards of the Rifleman Radio and the mid-tier radio are a testament to the strength of Harris' commercial model and a positive return on our sustained investments in R&D through the market downturn.
And with that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the lines for questions."

They had a fiscal year last year, which ended in December, so their fourth quarter was now our second quarter. They had a pretty strong run at that quarter as a lot of companies do in the last quarter of their fiscal year, so that does give us some year-over-year headwind. And keep in mind that we're still under a continuing resolution.

Q1 was down 12%. Very pleased that we're protecting the margins. I think we're doing a good job in taking cost out in spite of the pretty weak revenue environment. But, Seth, you hit the nail on the head. It's 2 soft markets. One is government IT that we see down in the mid-teens for the year, not different than what we talked about last time as both our IT Services business as well as the Exelis IT business. Q1 was a bit down worse than that in Government IT Services, but we do expect that the revenue will be roughly flat sequentially over the balance of the year. The book-to-bill in Q1 was about -- was over 1, and we expected to be about 1 for the year. So I think that feels pretty good. Keep in mind, in IT Services, we have a couple of unique dimensions happening here. One, Exelis lost the space launch range system contract prior to the acquisition, happened just over a year ago, and that's rolling through the numbers. That's about $85 million. And there's a couple of other programs that we are transitioning out of Harris, specifically the NMCI contract and a pretty large VA program that ended last year. So there's a couple of different things -- dynamics that are happening that are relatively unique in that government IT market for us. We are refocusing on the intelligence community. We think that there's an opportunity to differentiate ourselves in that space. Some of those awards are moving a little bit to the right, but I think that's going to start to see some stability through the balance of the year, at least in terms of sequential growth. The other one that has an impact in the quarter is -- as you suggested, is in the CapRock energy business. We expected that to be weak in the year. It's going to be down on a full year basis, sort of mid-teens in Q1. It was a little bit worse than that. We know that oil is still relatively weak. We saw the results from a lot of the oil service companies and majors over the last quarter. Rig count remains pretty weak. It's down about 40% year-over-year. And some of the oil majors and service companies are announcing more restructurings and CapEx cuts. So we do see continued pressure in that business. We're watching it very, very carefully. We think we've calibrated our year, but again, the market is pretty volatile at this point, and we keep watching it. The piece in that -- in Critical Networks that is relatively stable and we feel good about that, and that's on the FAA side. We've got a good portfolio of businesses with the FAA. It's pretty broad based, and we feel very good about our position in the funding pattern for the FAA programs within Critical Networks. So Seth, when you put all these pieces together, long-winded way of saying it, that's why the Critical Networks is down about 10% to 12% in the year."

Sheldon talked about $70 million to $75 million in the full year, so of course, that is going to happen. The bulk of that, that's yet to come and not in our numbers. So you will see some strength coming in the numbers simply because of integration savings, which are booked within the segments. The other side is we are pushing very, very hard on our legacy operational excellence, Harris Business Excellence program, and we do see opportunities to continue to protect margins in each of the segments because of that. So 3 of the segments, very strong margin expansion, one that we feel pretty good about holding margins in spite of a pretty significant revenue downturn.

There's the procurement on the horizon that goes out beyond 18 months that is quite substantial, and we're in a mix of that, but it's not in the 12- to 18-month pipeline. It really is pretty broad based. It's across a lot of different markets, through the Middle East, through North Africa, into Central Asia. It was very, very good to see FMS funding through OCO accounts, continuing to bolster what's happening in Iraq through the Train and Equip Funds, through ERI, which flowed through into some opportunities in the Baltics. We saw some good opportunities surface in Latin America this past quarter, and they're still in our pipeline. So Gautam, it is pretty broad based. There's not any big substantial orders that are in our 12- to 18-month horizon that I'd want to single out. Beyond that, there are some big opportunities in markets like in Saudi as well as in Australia, but nothing that's gigantic in the next 18 months."

But look, it's a deal. There's no appropriations bills yet. That needs to flow itself out. That will happen between now and, hopefully, December 11. But judging by what was in the NDAA that was, unfortunately, vetoed by the President, but it's going to flow back through, I think a lot of the Harris program seem to be well supported both in the tactical, normal tactical lines as well as in other things that affect Harris Corporation.
