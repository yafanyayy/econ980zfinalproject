I have a bit of a cold, so hopefully you can hear me all right.
The first quarter was a very strong finish for Red Hat and strong as we begin our new fiscal year. We exceeded guidance in virtually all of our financial metrics for the fourth quarter and drove a record total backlog for future revenue for FY '16 and beyond.
The fourth quarter was highlighted by subscription and total revenue that both grew more than 20% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Q4 was our highest quarterly growth rate in 3 years, over the consistent mid to high-teens growth level that we've delivered over that period. Demand for our open hybrid cloud technologies remained strong in the quarter as evidenced by a record cross-selling in our top 30 deals, all of which were over $2 million, a first for us.
What's the primary drivers of our growth has been IT demand for technologies that bring consistency and flexibility to create applications across various deployment models from bare metal to virtualization, to private and public clouds. We're able to help modernize our customers' existing applications while bringing transformative technologies like OpenShift and OpenStack to build stateless, highly scalable, native cloud applications. We bring consistency across these deployment models, which Red Hat Enterprise and Linux and our certified ecosystem.
Our strategic position with customers combines our focus on continuous innovation and world-class customer support allows us to increase our market share and wallet share. We see this in our renewals of our top 25 deals once again. Our customers not only renewed but increased their use of Red Hat technologies in their data centers. We renewed all 25 of those top 25 deals for the quarter and 100 out of the top 100 renewals reported for the fiscal year.
In addition, the fourth quarter deals renewed at approximately 115% of their previous annualized value as customers continue to expand their relationship with us.
Looking at the top 30 largest deals for the quarter. We saw continued strength in the size and breadth of technology as we have seen from the past several quarters. Here are just a few of the highlights: First, as I mentioned, all of the top 30 deals not only were greater than $1 million, they all exceeded $2 million for the first time. 1 deal was over $10 million and 12 were over $5 million. We're not getting the full fiscal year deals. We doubled the numbers of deals in both the $10 million and $5 million categories year-over-year.
Looking at the industry breakout for the quarter by dollar representation. Financial services in tech and media had the largest representation in the top 30. Cross-selling was strong with a record 80% of the deals including 1 or more components from our application development and emerging technologies offering, which include middleware, OpenStack, OpenShift, CloudForms and storage. In fact, the number of times the top 30 deal OpenStack or OpenShift this quarter tripled from Q4 a year ago. Interestingly, one technology customer expanded their existing OpenShift deal this quarter, and we now have our first $10 million plus OpenShift customer.
OpenShift has been performing well with customers and momentum is growing. This early traction with customers and the recent recognition of OpenShift as the InfoWorld 2015 technology of the year further validates technology.
Now let me hand the call over to Paul Cormier to update you on some of the progress we've made on our growth initiatives to offer hybrid cloud solutions for our customers in new markets."

First, we launched RHEL atomic host, which provides a streamlined host platform that is optimized to run application containers. The software components included in RHEL atomic have been designed to enhance the performance, scalability and security of containers while keeping the consistency of RHEL, creating a superior platform on which to deploy and run application containers. RHEL atomic enables applications to be comprised of microservices in a container-based architecture to more fully realize the benefits of this more nimble and opposable approach. Atomic provides numerous benefits to the container-based architecture, including container images in Docker format, and default security through Linux.
Based on RHEL, the Atomic Host enables enterprises to embrace containers while reaping the benefits of deployment flexibility without sacrificing their performance, stability, security or the value of Red Hat's vast certified RHEL ecosystem.
Second and in conjunction with the launch of RHEL Atomic, we announced the industry's first certified container ecosystem program to drive adoption of more secure, reliable containerized applications based on RHEL and the Docker format. This partner program will offer Red Hat Container Certification the certified that a container's content is from a trusted source and that both the application and the container itself are free of identified vulnerabilities and will perform on Red Hat infrastructure, enabling a robust end-to-end solution that is supported by Red Hat and its partners.
As customers consume Linux containers, we are leading the way in enabling them to enjoy the benefits of this key innovation without sacrificing the basic enterprise needs of application security and as we did in bringing RHEL Linux to the commercial world.
Third, we continue to enhance our RHEL OpenStack platform technology with the launch of version 6, our second major commercial release in FY '15. RHEL OpenStack 6 platform adds over 700 enhancements and updates, all focused on improving the production-ready cloud platform for enterprise businesses, telecommunication companies and public cloud hosting providers. Building a co-engineered design with RHEL 7, RHEL OpenStack 6 platforms delivers new features aimed at easing enterprise deployment and administration within existing data centers as well as capabilities specific to telecommunication providers to enable network functions virtualization or as it's called NFV.
Fourth, in February, we also deepened our strategic relationship with network and communications solution vendors to bring carrier-grade OpenStack solutions for NFV. Specifically, we expanded our partnership with NEC, a leading provider of communications solutions and a top 10 OpenStack contributor. We will be jointly developing NFV features and innovation of the RHEL OpenStack platform. This partnership expands our portfolio of top global NFV vendors looking to achieve carrier-grade OpenStack solutions for NFV as this technology moves from proof of concepts to pilots to production.
In summary, our focused engineering and support efforts in FY '15 have broadened our portfolio of commercial technologies. When combined with strong sales execution, Red Hat delivered high revenue growth and record total backlog. This company-wide execution has increased our strategic position with customers as we look to further expand our market share.
With that, let me turn the call over to Charlie."
33679,286433699,786069,"Red Hat, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Mar 25, 2015",2015-03-25,"Earnings Calls","Red Hat, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Paul. I'm also pleased to report a great fourth quarter.

I'm also pleased to report a great fourth quarter. It seems an finish to a very strong fiscal year. Demand for our growing portfolio of open hybrid cloud offerings was very good. but sa Paul said, it was the excellent execution on the part of our Red Hat associates and partners which resulted in compelling combination of revenue growth, profitability and cash flow for the quarter and the fiscal year. We exceeded guidance and outperformed on virtually all financial metrics in U.S. dollars despite very significant foreign exchange headwinds during the quarter.
However, foreign exchange rates are important, and I want to update you on the foreign exchange impact to our business before I jump into the quarterly details. Virtually every company that has reported since December has commented on the impact of foreign currencies, including Oracle just last week. The rapid devaluation of nearly every foreign currency versus the U.S. dollar is not news, yet surprisingly only about 30% of the sell-side analysts who follow Red Hat have updated their models at current rates. Nearly every currency in which we do business weakened against the U.S. dollar when compared to Q4 last year, last quarter, against guidance or versus the full year fiscal '14. So if you want additional currency rate detail, please see the rates which are posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. These rate changes negatively impacted both the results for the quarter and for the full year across the income statement, the balance sheet and the off-balance sheet backlog.
So for instance, total revenue for the fourth quarter, which was very good, would have been $24 million higher using Q4 rates from last year, $13 million higher using rates from last quarter and $7 million higher using rates that I used in December for guidance. For the full fiscal year 2015, total revenue would have been $36 million higher using rates from last year and $20 million higher using the rates given in March of 2014 when we first set fiscal year 2015 guidance.
As a result of this foreign exchange volatility, I will provide both U.S. dollar and constant currency results using the rates from Q4 last year and from the fiscal year '14. Here are just a few of the financial highlights on a year-over-year basis: full year revenue was up 19% in constant currency and a 17% in U.S. dollars; full year non-GAAP operating income grew 11%, reflecting our continued investment in emerging technologies, including investments made in 3 acquired companies; we hit new record highs for both quarterly and annual operating cash flow. For the quarter, we exceeded the $200 million mark, coming in at $217 million, up 18%. For the full year, we exceeded the $600 million mark with full year operating cash flow of $623 million, up 15%, while at the same time, our total backlog grew by more than 19% year-over-year in U.S. dollars.
As I have done on other year-end calls, I'll add a few additional statistics about bookings, but also consistent with prior years, we will not be updating these booking statistics on a quarterly basis. First, as I indicated, total backlog was up over 19% year-over-year at February 28 to over $1.86 billion. We define total backlog as total deferred revenue, which is billed, plus the value of customer contracts to be billed in the future not reflected in our financial statements. Total deferred revenue was $1.5 billion at the end of fiscal 2015. It's up 15% year-over-year. A portion of total backlog to be billed in the future or sometimes it's referred to as off balance sheet backlog, was in excess of $380 million compared to in excess of $270 million last fiscal year, up over 40% year-over-year. It is worth noting that the portion of the off balance sheet backlog to be billed the next 12 months was in excess of $230 million, up approximately $40 million or 21% from fiscal 2014.
These results reflect a strong mix of business across technologies and geographies. The combination of deferred revenue and off balance sheet backlog to be billed in the next 12 months gives us good forward visibility into a significant portion of fiscal '16 revenue and some for the following years. The increase in longer-term visibility was driven by strong sales execution and a number of large renewals that extended their size and terms. This led to bookings duration of 22 months for fiscal '15, slightly above our normal 21-month average.
Moving onto bookings by geography. Our Q4 bookings mix was 68% from the channel and 32% from direct sales. This is similar to our annual mix of channel versus direct sales, and this mix split for the channel is up 500 basis points from last fiscal year and moving closer to our multi-year goal of 70%, 30% split of channel and direct sales.
Our quarterly geographic split of bookings was 63% from the Americas, 25% from EMEA and 12% from APAC compared to a split in Q4 last year of 61%, 26% and 13%, respectively. All regions performed well and delivered double-digit growth year-over-year despite the foreign exchange headwinds.
Now let's talk about our financial performance for the quarter starting with the revenue. Fourth quarter revenue was $464 million. It's up 22% in constant currency from the prior year and 16% in U.S. dollars. This result was above the top end of our U.S. dollar guidance despite a $7 million foreign exchange headwind from guidance rates.
Subscription revenue, which is a renewable revenue stream, constituted approximately 87% of total revenue in the fourth quarter. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $405 million. It's up 21% in constant currency from the prior year and 15% in U.S. dollars.
Here's a breakdown of revenue by technology in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings was $341 million, accelerating the 17% growth in constant currency, and 12% in U.S. dollars year-over-year. Subscription revenue for application development and emerging technologies offerings was $^4 million, up year-over-year 45% in constant currency and 38% in U.S. dollars. As a reminder, our infrastructure-related offerings include mainly Red Hat Enterprise Linux, RHEL and RHEL-related offerings and our while our application development and emerging technology offerings include middleware, OpenStack, OpenShift, CloudForms and Storage.
The fourth quarter represented the first time that our application development and emerging technologies offerings surpassed the subscription revenue level of a quarter of a billion dollars, that's billion with a B. Another validation of the [ph] success of our product strategy.
Training and services revenue was $59 million. It's up 28% in constant currency and 20% in U.S. dollars from the year-ago period, turning in a very strong performance.
Now I'll discuss the rest of our results on a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation, amortization expense, business acquisition-related costs and noncash interest expense related to the convertible debt. Overall gross margin was 86% for Q4, up 3 basis points [ph] sequentially and in line with the prior year. Subscription gross margin was consistent with last quarter and last year at 94%. Training and services gross margin was 33%. That's 130 basis points better than Q4 last year as a result of better-than-expected utilization in the fourth quarter holiday period this year.
For Q4, non-GAAP operating expense was $289 million. It's up 2% sequentially and up 17% in the U.S. dollars from prior year. We added over 150 new employees in the quarter, mainly investing on sales, support and engineering skills needed to drive our emerging technologies. For the fiscal year, we increased our headcount by about 950 people with approximately 1/4 of the new associates coming from our 3 acquisitions that is Inktank, eNovance and FeedHenry, which brought additional skills in software-defined storage, OpenStack and mobility.
Q4 non-GAAP operating income of $111 million increased 14% from last year, resulting in a Q4 non-GAAP operating margin of 23.8%, 80 basis points better than guidance. Net interest income and other income was $5.8 million. This result included a onetime investment gain of nearly $5 million or $0.02 per share.
The annual effective tax rate was approximately 29.5% for both GAAP and non-GAAP results, which was slightly higher than the 29% which we estimated in December. As a result, the Q4 tax rate was 30.7% in order to adjust this to the annual rate, which had a negative impact of $0.01 per share on the Q4 earnings per share.
Our non-GAAP diluted quarterly earnings per share is $0.43 compared to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.39 in Q4 of last year. The Q4 result is $0.02 per share better than the top of our guidance. $0.01 per share is primarily due to the revenue and 1% per share is better below the line as I just mentioned.
Now let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We ended the year with just over $1.8 billion in cash and investments. As part of our capital allocation plans, we completed the $375 million accelerated stock repurchase program in Q4. Combining this ASR with $160 million we repurchased earlier in the year, we have repurchased a total of $535 million [ph] or 9.1 million shares of Red Hat stock this year. Over the last 4 years, we have repurchased over $1 billion in Red Hat shares.
Along with today's Q4 announcement, I'm pleased to announce that Red Hat's Board of Directors has authorized a new $500 million repurchase program to replace the remainder of the previous $300 million [ph] authorization that expires later this month. Given our long-term growth prospects, our management team and the board believe that returning capital to investors through stock repurchases will create additional value for our shareholders.
Our days sales outstanding was 63 days at year end compared to 58 days last year. Very strong Q4 volume drove the DSO change, which we would expect to move back to its 60 days next quarter. And as a reminder, the day sales outstanding is traditionally a measure of receivables versus buildings, our DSO calculation is based on our billings proxy, which includes revenue plus the change in deferred revenue from the cash flow statement.
Total deferred revenue at quarter end was $1.48 billion. And that's in U.S. dollars, an increase of $193 million or 15% over the prior year end. Sequentially, deferred revenue increased approximately $182 million or 14% from last quarter. As one would expect, foreign exchange had a large impact. So I'm going to break down the components of deferred revenue to highlight the impact of the currency exchanges. Short-term deferred revenue, which ended Q3 at $941 million, had real growth in Q4 of $181 million, but decreased $27 million as a result of changes in the FX spot rates, ending Q4 over $1.09 billion.
Long-term deferred revenue, which ended Q3 at $359 million, had a real increase in Q4 of approximately $44 million but decreased $16 million due to changes in FX spot rates, ending Q4 at $387 million. The total increase in deferred revenue without the impact of currency changes was $225 million and can be found on our statement of cash flows.
Moving to the statement of cash flows. We produced record quarterly operating cash flow of $217 million, up 18% year-over-year. Full year operating cash flow was $623 million. That's up 15% and it's well above the top of our guidance. This overachievement was driven by strong billings and strong collections.
Now to briefly recap, just a few highlights for the full fiscal year. Revenue grew to $1.79 billion, up 19% year-over-year in constant currency or up 17% in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue grew to $1.56 billion, an increase of 19% in constant currency or a 17% in U.S. dollars. And subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings was $1.32 billion, it's up 15% in constant currency and 13% in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue for application development and emerging technologies was $237 million, up 45% in constant currency and 43% in U.S. dollars.
For fiscal 2015, application development and emerging technology subscriptions now constitutes 13% of total revenue, up from 11% last fiscal year.
Non-GAAP operating income grew by 11%, which includes the dilutive impact from the 3 strategic acquisitions which we closed during the year. Non-GAAP EPS for the full year was $1.60, up 7% over the prior year. And the differences in the tax rate played a part in that.
Overall, it was another great year with strong execution across all areas of the business. Now I want to shift to fiscal year 2016 guidance.
For this guidance, I have assumed average foreign exchange rates of $1.08 for the euro and 1 dollar -- and a JPY 121 to the dollar. Compared to the year just finished, this represents a 20% beginning of the euro and an 11% weakening of the yen, with the largest impact coming in the first 3 quarters. Most other global currencies have also devalued in this range, some even greater. As in the past, I'm not attempting to forecast exchange rates. I'm simply pegging guidance at recent rates for a point of reference. The coming year is on e in which virtually everyone with foreign expectations will be measuring performance in constant currency terms until rate stabilize and cycle through a full year.
We are forecasting annual revenue growth in constant currency terms up to 19%. The FX rates, which I am using, create a headwind to revenue in U.S. dollars of approximately $110 million or 600 basis points. The headwind is $110 million or 600 hundred basis points. Therefore, we are forecasting total revenue in the range of $1.99 billion to $2.02 billion. So maybe 19 90 [ph] to 20 20, [ph] easy way to remember it for fiscal 2016, representing approximately 13% growth in U.S. dollars at the top of the range.
For modeling purposes, our growth rate assumes that subscription revenues grow 20% in constant currency and services revenue will flow to 13% in constant currency as the initial training surge associated with the release of RHEL 7 hits the 1 year anniversary. We're also assuming that OpenStack services will continue to expand in fiscal 2016 through the high interest in our offering.
Our operating margin forecast reflects our plan to continue investing in emerging technologies as well as the full year impact of the 3 acquisitions we completed this last fiscal year. We are planning to keep operating margins consistent with last year or around 23.3% and continue to invest for growth, particularly around OpenStack, OpenShift, cloud management and software-defined storage. I'm estimating full year other income, principally net interest income, of approximately $8 million or $2 million per quarter, which includes the cash interest expense from the convertible debt.
The estimated annual effective tax rate for this fiscal year 2016 remains at 29% for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes. Assuming a 29% tax rate and approximately 186 million diluted shares, one would estimate diluted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.79 to $1.22 per share.
On a GAAP basis, we estimate annual stock compensation expense of approximately $160 million and annual amortization expense of approximately $26 million. From a cash flow perspective, we anticipate operating cash flow for the full year between $670 million to $690 million. Further, we are forecasting CapEx of approximately $50 million, in line with fiscal '15.
Finally, as we have seen over the last several years with a recurring revenue model, there's a natural ebb and flow business from quarter-to-quarter. Bookings and billings historically are lowest in the first quarter and have grown each quarter to the fourth quarter. And to them, repeat the pattern again the following year. We would expect the same this year.
For those of you who look to model deferred revenue, we would suggest you focus on the larger short-term deferred revenue portion as we would expect bookings duration to return to something closer to 21 months and bring the long-term deferred revenue more in line with revenue than short-term deferred growth.
For Q1, keep in mind that the average euro rate a year ago, that's Q1 a year ago, was $1.38. And there were JPY 102 to a dollar, both weakening considerably. With that reminder, we offer the following guidance: revenue is estimated to grow approximately 20% in constant currencies to a range of $469 million to $474 million or 12% in U.S. dollars at the top of the range; non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 22% as a result of the timing this year of major sales and marketing events globally. with other income of $2 million and a 29% tax rate, our non-GAAP EPS is estimated to be around $0.41 a share, assuming approximately 186 million diluted shares. Consistent with my past practice, I do not guide quarterly cash flow because it can be quite variable depending upon individual large payments or receipts. However, I'd say it seems likely that the multi-year pattern of higher cash flow in Q1 than Q2 will repeat given our strong year-end balance sheet.
In summary, we had a great fiscal year. We believe that we're well positioned for further growth and profitability in 2016 and beyond by leveraging the emerging technologies that continue to gain traction with customers and are growing rapidly. The larger deals driven largely by strong renewals and upsell strengthen our position with customers and a record total backlog that provides even better visibility and one of the fast-growing core platform and middleware technologies in the industry. Our growth drivers look good.
I also want to reaffirm what I said on the third quarter call for those who missed it. it was this, and it applies today: the company has never been better positioned for the future than it is right now. Our portfolio of open source infrastructure software and services has never been broader or more current. All major product lines have been refreshed this year, meaning in the last 12 months. The company is well staffed and well managed, and the world is open souce software like never before. With Red Hat as the undisputed leader of open source, the future has never been brighter.
So on a final note, I hope that many of you will be able to join us on June 24 at Analyst Day at the Red Hat Summit in Boston. It's going to be great opportunity to learn more about our strategy, innovation and customer focus. And if you're not able to attend in person, we hope you'll be able to join our live webcast where you can access all the information that we present.

But you still reported an acceleration in billings growth to 22%. And so in terms of what is driving that, I was wondering if you could comment on one of the potential new tailwinds in particular, which is security, and the view that Linux is more secure than Windows. I was wondering if perhaps you could touch on the demand environment for your SE Linux product, maybe why open source is the more secure development model and perhaps where their bleed and the viruses might be driving strength or demand in your core business."

Is it going to 270 to 380. looking at the income statement, looks like anything non-infrastructure related was up roughly 60 -- $70 million or so, but the backlog of itself grew a lot more than not. But my question is the delta changed. Where is the growth in balance sheet backlog disproportionality coming relative to the growth you're seeing in the income statement and even in the reported deferred revenue?

Backlog, this comment on backlog was a strong selling opportunity and expansion with existing customers and the many new customers and big deals. And a number of the big deals are multi-year deals that added to that backlog, whether it's billed going to the deferred revenue or not yet billed in off balance sheet, these large deals have absolutely expanded the backlog. The only way to break it down by product, I would say, in the opening remarks, 80% of the largest deals had emerging technology as part of those deals. So it's hard to say whether it's just emerging technology driving it, but I can tell you it's a whole portfolio. we have a much broader portfolio and customers are coming to us, expanding the size of the deals and the duration. That's what's adding to the backlog. The second part of your question about the change, what's going on with the new version of Windows. And our philosophy I guess, is anytime there's change, it creates opportunity. And the biggest potential market for us to go after now is Linux replacing Windows or maybe new greenfield about the long side Windows. So we see this as an opportunity for us."

So on the go-to-market, what we have found with the application development in emerging technologies and with each new technology it's been starting out mostly direct, making sure our direct guys have a good understanding of the technology and know how to sell it. And then from that point, beginning to channel partners in the various technology. In some cases, it may be large SIs, in some cases it may be existing OEM that we're helping with another technology. For example, I mean, Dell might be a good example where they have partnered with us on OpenStack, for example, and they're also a large OEM on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. But I would say that as products mature then we're more likely to go to a channel model, and that's exactly where we're pursuing it. In terms of your question on the operating margin. What I said is for the full year, we're targeting operating margin to be about the same as this year, so I think I said around 23.2%. Basically our view is there's no lack of demand. We need to continue to invest, and it's a reach question. And we are investing heavily in engineering, support and sales to go after not only the emerging technologies but even Linux. I mean, you saw the expansion -- the acceleration of the infrastructure side of our business this quarter. And so we -- this is not a time to be timid. We believe that a flat operating margin -- somewhere in that neighborhood is the appropriate approach to this year, and we will reinvest the rest of the money back into the business. Next question?"

Foreign currencies actually have an impact on the operating cash flow as well. You think about -- we're gaining market share and wallet share in euros and in yen and in all of the currencies we do business. When you translate even the cash flow back on a dollar-denominated statement, it has some change in the amount on the dollar side of it.

So getting applications that are compatible across those different vendors and cloud foundry will be challenging for one thing. Second thing is that with OpenShift, we use the power of RHEL in SE Linux to really power that. That's something that's got a huge installed base out there with our customers. But also, just as important to that, the services that we have built on JBoss are now very much in demand on the past platform of OpenShift. So things like messaging for example, that's just -- that's a key component of building applications. And as a platform to build applications, we'll now move all those services which we call x PaaS over to the PaaS, over to the OpenShift PaaS platform.

With the newer products, they're much younger with a hypergrowth type of activity, 45% growth, you could expect the P&L to look more like something with a hypergrowth company, and therefore, the profitability is clearly lower.

And I apologize for my voice. I have a bit of a cold, so hopefully, you can hear me all right.
The fourth quarter was a very strong finish for Red Hat, and our momentum is strong as we begin our new fiscal year. We exceeded guidance in virtually all of our financial metrics for the fourth quarter and drove a record total backlog for future revenue for FY '16 and beyond.
The fourth quarter was highlighted by subscription and total revenue that both grew more than 20% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Q4 was our highest quarterly growth rate in 3 years, crossing over the consistent mid- to high-teens growth level that we've delivered over that period. Demand for our open hybrid cloud technologies remained strong in the quarter, as evidenced by a record cross-selling in our top 30 deals, all of which were over $2 million, a first for us.
What [ph] the primary drivers of our growth has been IT demand for technologies that bring consistency and flexibility to create applications across various deployment models, from bare metal to virtualization, to private and public clouds. We're able to help modernize our customers' existing applications while bringing transformative technologies like OpenShift and OpenStack to build stateless, highly scalable, native cloud applications. We bring consistency across these deployment models with Red Hat Enterprise Linux and our certified ecosystem.
Our strategic position with customers combined with our focus on continuous innovation and world-class customer support allows us to increase our market share and wallet share. We see this in our renewals of our top 25 deals once again. Our customers not only renewed but increased their use of Red Hat technologies in their data centers. We renewed all 25 of those top 25 deals for the quarter and 100 out of the top 100 renewals reported for the fiscal year. In addition, the fourth quarter deals renewed at approximately 115% of their previous annualized value as customers continue to expand their relationship with us.
Looking at the top 30 largest deals for the quarter. We saw continued strength in the size and breadth of technology, as we have seen from the past several quarters. Here are just a few of the highlights. First, as I mentioned, all of the top 30 deals not only were greater than $1 million, they all exceeded $2 million for the first time. One deal was over $10 million and 12 were over $5 million. We're not getting the full fiscal year deals. We doubled the numbers of deals in both the $10 million and $5 million categories year-over-year.
Looking at the industry breakout for the quarter by dollar representation. Financial services and tech and media had the largest representation in the top 30. Cross-selling was strong with a record 80% of the deals including one or more components from our application development and emerging technologies offerings, which include Middleware, OpenStack, OpenShift, CloudForms and Storage. In fact, the number of times the top 30 deal included OpenStack or OpenShift this quarter tripled from Q4 a year ago. Interestingly, one technology customer expanded their existing OpenShift deal this quarter, and we now have our first $10 million plus OpenShift customer.
OpenShift has been performing well with customers and momentum is growing. This early traction with customers and the recent recognition of OpenShift as the InfoWorld 2015 Technology of the Year further validates the technology.
Now let me hand the call over to Paul Cormier to update you on some of the progress we've made on our growth initiatives to offer a cohesive hybrid cloud solutions for our customers in new markets."

First, we launched RHEL Atomic Host, which provides a streamlined host platform that is optimized to run application containers. The software components included in RHEL Atomic have been designed to enhance the performance, scalability and security of containers while keeping the consistency of RHEL, creating a superior platform on which to deploy and run application containers. RHEL Atomic enables applications to be comprised of microservices in a container-based architecture to more fully realize the benefits of this more nimble, composable approach. Atomic provides numerous benefits to the container-based architecture, including container images in Docker format, Kubernetes orchestration and default security through SE Linux. Based on RHEL, the Atomic Host enables enterprises to embrace containers while reaping the benefits of deployment flexibility without sacrificing their performance, stability and security or the value of Red Hat's vast certified RHEL ecosystem.
Second, and in conjunction with the launch of RHEL Atomic, we announced the industry's first certified container ecosystem program to drive adoption of more secure, reliable, containerized applications based on RHEL and the Docker format. This partner program will offer Red Hat Container Certification to certify that a container's content is from a trusted source and that both the application and the container itself are free of identified vulnerabilities and will perform on Red Hat infrastructure, enabling a robust end-to-end solution that is supported by Red Hat and its partners. As customers consume Linux containers, we are leading the way in enabling them to enjoy the benefits of this key innovation without sacrificing the basic enterprise needs of application security and provenance, as we did in bringing RHEL Linux to the commercial world.
Third, we continue to enhance our RHEL OpenStack platform technology with the launch of version 6, our second major commercial release in FY '15. RHEL OpenStack 6 platform adds over 700 enhancements and updates, all focused on improving the production-ready cloud platform for enterprise businesses, telecommunication companies and public cloud hosting providers. Building a co-engineered design with RHEL 7, RHEL OpenStack 6 platforms delivers new features aimed at easing enterprise deployments and administration within existing data centers as well as capabilities specific to telecommunication providers to enable network functions virtualization or, as it's called, NFV.
Fourth, in February, we also deepened our strategic relationship with network and communications solution vendors to bring carrier-grade OpenStack solutions for NFV. Specifically, we expanded our partnership with NEC, a leading provider of communications solutions and a top 10 OpenStack contributor. We will be jointly developing NFV features in the integration of the RHEL OpenStack platform. This partnership expands our portfolio of top global NFV vendors looking to achieve carrier-grade OpenStack solutions for NFV as this technology moves from proof of concepts to pilots to production.
In summary, our focused engineering and support efforts in FY '15 have broadened our portfolio of commercial technologies. When combined with strong sales execution, Red Hat delivered high revenue growth and record total backlog. This company-wide execution has increased our strategic position with customers as we look to further expand our market share.
With that, let me turn the call over to Charlie."
33679,286433699,786091,"Red Hat, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Mar 25, 2015",2015-03-25,"Earnings Calls","Red Hat, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Paul. I'm also pleased to report a great fourth quarter.

Demand for our growing portfolio of open hybrid cloud offerings was very good. But as Paul said, it was the excellent execution on the part of our Red Hat associates and partners which resulted in a compelling combination of revenue growth, profitability and cash flow for the quarter and the fiscal year. We exceeded guidance and outperformed on virtually all financial metrics in U.S. dollars despite very significant foreign exchange headwinds during the quarter.
However, foreign exchange rates are important, and I want to update you on the foreign exchange impact to our business before I jump into the quarterly details. Virtually every company that has reported since December has commented on the impact of foreign currencies, including Oracle just last week. The rapid devaluation of nearly every foreign currency versus the U.S. dollar is not news. Yet surprisingly, only about 30% of the sell-side analysts who follow Red Hat have updated their models at current rates. Nearly every currency in which we do business weakened against the U.S. dollar when compared to Q4 last year, last quarter, against guidance or versus the full year fiscal '14. So if you want additional currency rate detail, please see the rates which are posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. These rate changes negatively impacted both the results for the quarter and for the full year across the income statement, the balance sheet and the off-balance sheet backlog.
So for instance, total revenue for the fourth quarter, which was very good, would have been $24 million higher using Q4 rates from last year, $13 million higher using rates from last quarter and $7 million higher using rates that I used in December for guidance. For the full fiscal year 2015, total revenue would have been $36 million higher using rates from last year and $20 million higher using the rates given in March of 2014 when we first set fiscal year 2015 guidance.
As a result of this foreign exchange volatility, I will provide both U.S. dollar and constant currency results using the rates from Q4 last year and from the fiscal year '14. Here are just a few of the financial highlights on a year-over-year basis. Full year revenue was up 19% in constant currency and 17% in U.S. dollars. Full year non-GAAP operating income grew 11%, reflecting our continued investment in emerging technologies, including investments made in 3 acquired companies. We hit new record highs for both quarterly and annual operating cash flow. For the quarter, we exceeded the $200 million mark, coming in at $217 million, up 18%. For the full year, we exceeded the $600 million mark with full year operating cash flow of $623 million, up 15%, while at the same time, our total backlog grew by more than 19% year-over-year in U.S. dollars.
As I have done on other year-end calls, I will add a few additional statistics about bookings. But also consistent with prior years, we will not be updating these booking statistics on a quarterly basis. First, as I indicated, total backlog was up over 19% year-over-year at February 28 to over $1.86 billion. We define total backlog as total deferred revenue, which is billed, plus the value of customer contracts to be billed in the future not reflected in our financial statements. Total deferred revenue was $1.5 billion at the end of fiscal 2015. It's up 15% year-over-year. A portion of total backlog to be billed in the future, or sometimes it's referred to as off-balance sheet backlog, was in excess of $380 million compared to in excess of $270 million last fiscal year, up over 40% year-over-year. It is worth noting that the portion of the off-balance sheet backlog to be billed the next 12 months was in excess of $230 million, up approximately $40 million or 21% from fiscal 2014.
These results reflect a strong mix of business across technologies and geographies. The combination of deferred revenue and off-balance sheet backlog to be billed in the next 12 months gives us good forward visibility into a significant portion of fiscal '16 revenue and some for the following years. The increase in longer-term visibility was driven by strong sales execution and a number of large renewals that extended their size and terms. This led to bookings duration of 22 months for fiscal '15, slightly above our normal 21-month average.
Moving on to bookings by geography. Our Q4 bookings mix was 68% from the channel and 32% from direct sales. This is similar to our annual mix of channel versus direct sales, and this mix split for the channel is up 500 basis points from last fiscal year and moving closer to our multi-year goal of 70%, 30% split of channel and direct sales.
Our quarterly geographic split of bookings was 63% from the Americas, 25% from EMEA and 12% from APAC compared to a split in Q4 last year of 61%, 26% and 13%, respectively. All regions performed well and delivered double-digit growth year-over-year despite the foreign exchange headwinds.
Now let's talk about our financial performance for the quarter starting with the revenue. Fourth quarter revenue was $464 million. It's up 22% in constant currency from the prior year and 16% in U.S. dollars. This result was above the top end of our U.S. dollar guidance despite a $7 million foreign exchange headwind from guidance rates.
Subscription revenue, which is a renewable revenue stream, constituted approximately 87% of total revenue in the fourth quarter. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $405 million. It's up 21% in constant currency from the prior year and 15% in U.S. dollars.
Here's a breakdown of revenue by technology in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings was $341 million, accelerating the 17% growth in constant currency and 12% in U.S. dollars year-over-year. Subscription revenue for application development and emerging technologies offerings was $64 million, up year-over-year 45% in constant currency and 38% in U.S. dollars. As a reminder, our infrastructure-related offerings include mainly Red Hat Enterprise Linux, RHEL and RHEL-related offerings and RHEV, while our application development and emerging technology offerings include Middleware, OpenStack, OpenShift, CloudForms and Storage.
The fourth quarter represented the first time that our application development and emerging technologies offerings surpassed the annualized subscription revenue level of $0.25 billion, that's billion with a B, another validation of the success of our product strategy.
Training and services revenue was $59 million. It's up 28% in constant currency and 20% in U.S. dollars from the year-ago period, turning in a very strong performance.
Now I'll discuss the rest of our results on a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation, amortization expense, business acquisition-related costs and noncash interest expense related to the convertible debt. Overall gross margin was 86% for Q4, up 30 basis points sequentially and in line with the prior year. Subscription gross margin was consistent with last quarter and last year at 94%. Training and services gross margin was 33%. That's 130 basis points better than Q4 last year as a result of better-than-expected utilization in the fourth quarter holiday period this year.
For Q4, non-GAAP operating expense was $289 million. It's up 2% sequentially and up 17% in the U.S. dollars from the prior year. We added over 150 new employees in the quarter, mainly investing on sales, support and engineering skills needed to drive our emerging technologies. For the fiscal year, we increased our headcount by about 950 people with approximately 1/4 of the new associates coming from our 3 acquisitions that is Inktank, eNovance and FeedHenry, which brought additional capabilities and skills in software-defined storage, OpenStack and mobility.
Q4 non-GAAP operating income of $111 million increased 14% from last year, resulting in a Q4 non-GAAP operating margin of 23.8%, 80 basis points better than guidance. Net interest income and other income was $5.8 million. This result included a onetime investment gain of nearly $5 million or $0.02 per share.
The annual effective tax rate was approximately 29.5% for both GAAP and non-GAAP results, which was slightly higher than the 29% which we estimated in December. As a result, the Q4 tax rate was 30.7% in order to adjust this to the annual rate, which had a negative impact of $0.01 per share on the Q4 earnings per share.
Our non-GAAP diluted quarterly earnings per share is $0.43 compared to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.39 in Q4 of last year. The Q4 result is $0.02 per share better than the top of our guidance. The $0.01 per share is primarily due to the revenue beat, and $0.01 per share is better 8 below the line, as I just mentioned.
Now let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We ended the year with just over $1.8 billion in cash and investments. As part of our capital allocation plans, we completed the $375 million accelerated stock repurchase program in Q4. Combining this ASR with $160 million we repurchased earlier in the year, we have repurchased a total of $535 million or 9.1 million shares of Red Hat stock this year. Over the last 4 years, we have repurchased over $1 billion in Red Hat shares.
Along with today's Q4 announcement, I'm pleased to announce that Red Hat's Board of Directors has authorized a new $500 million repurchase program to replace the remainder of the previous $300 million authorization that expires later this month. Given our long-term growth prospects, our management team and the board believe that returning capital to investors through stock repurchases will create additional value for our shareholders.
Our days sales outstanding was 63 days at year-end compared to 58 days last year. Very strong Q4 volume drove the DSO change, which we would expect to move back to its 60 days next quarter. And as a reminder, since day sales outstanding is traditionally a measure of receivables versus billings, our DSO calculation is based on our billings proxy, which includes revenue plus the change in deferred revenue from the cash flow statement.
Total deferred revenue at quarter-end was $1.48 billion, in -- that's U.S. dollars, an increase of $193 million or 15% over the prior year-end. Sequentially, deferred revenue increased approximately $182 million or 14% from last quarter. 
As one would expect, foreign exchange had a large impact. So I'm going to break down the components of deferred revenue to highlight the impact of the currency exchanges. Short-term deferred revenue, which ended Q3 at $941 million, had real growth in Q4 of $181 million but decreased $27 million as a result of changes in the FX spot rates, ending Q4 over $1.09 billion. Long-term deferred revenue, which ended Q3 at $359 million, had a real increase in Q4 of approximately $44 million but decreased $16 million due to changes in FX spot rates, ending Q4 at $387 million. The total increase in deferred revenue without the impact of currency changes was $225 million and can be found on our statement of cash flows.
Moving to the statement of cash flows. We produced record quarterly operating cash flow of $217 million, up 18% year-over-year. Full year operating cash flow was $623 million. That's up 15% and it's well above the top of our guidance. This overachievement was driven by strong billings and strong collections.
Now to briefly recap and summarize just a few highlights for the full fiscal year. Revenue grew to $1.79 billion, up 19% year-over-year in constant currency or up 17% in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue grew to $1.56 billion, an increase of 19% in constant currency or 17% in U.S. dollars. And subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings was $1.32 billion. It's up 15% in constant currency and 13% in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue for application development and emerging technologies was $237 million, up 45% in constant currency and 43% in U.S. dollars. For fiscal '15, application development and emerging technology subscriptions now constitutes 13% of total revenue, up from 11% last fiscal year. 
Non-GAAP operating income grew by 11%, which includes the dilutive impact from the 3 strategic acquisitions which we closed during the year. Non-GAAP EPS for the full year was $1.60, up 7% over the prior year. And the differences in the tax rate played a part in that.
Overall, it was another great year with strong execution across all areas of the business. Now I want to shift to fiscal year 2016 guidance.
For this guidance, I have assumed average foreign exchange rates of $1.08 for the euro and 1 dollar -- excuse me, and JPY 121 to the dollar. Compared to the year just finished, this represents a 20% weakening of the euro and an 11% weakening of the yen, with the largest impact coming in the first 3 quarters. Most other global currencies have also devalued in this range, some even greater. As in the past, I'm not attempting to forecast exchange rates. I'm simply pegging guidance at recent rates for a point of reference. The coming year is one in which virtually everyone with foreign expectations will be measuring performance in constant currency terms until rates stabilize and cycle through a full year.
We are forecasting annual revenue growth in constant currency terms up to 19%. The FX rates, which I am using, create a headwind to revenue in U.S. dollars of approximately $110 million or 600 basis points. The headwind is $110 million or 600 hundred basis points. Therefore, we are forecasting total revenue in the range of $1.99 billion to $2.02 billion. So maybe 1990 [ph] to 2020 [ph], easy way to remember it, for fiscal 2016, representing approximately 13% growth in U.S. dollars at the top of the range.
For modeling purposes, our growth rate assumes that subscription revenues grow 20% in constant currency and services revenue will flow [ph] to 13% in constant currency as the initial training surge associated with the release of RHEL 7 hits the 1-year anniversary. We're also assuming that OpenStack services will continue to expand in fiscal '16 due to high interest in our offering.
Our operating margin forecast reflects our plan to continue investing in emerging technologies as well as the full year impact of the 3 acquisitions we completed this last fiscal year. We are planning to keep operating margins consistent with last year or around 23.3% and continue to invest for growth, particularly around OpenStack, OpenShift, cloud management and software-defined storage. I'm estimating full year other income, principally net interest income, of approximately $8 million or $2 million per quarter, which includes the cash interest expense from the convertible debt.
The estimated annual effective tax rate for this fiscal year 2016 remains at 29% for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes. Assuming 29% tax rate and approximately 186 million diluted shares, one would estimate diluted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.79 to $1.82 per share. 
On a GAAP basis, we estimate annual stock compensation expense of approximately $160 million and annual amortization expense of approximately $26 million. From a cash flow perspective, we anticipate operating cash flow for the full year between $670 million to $690 million. Further, we are forecasting CapEx of approximately $50 million, in line with fiscal '15.
Finally, as we have seen over the last several years with the recurring revenue model, there's a natural ebb and flow to the business from quarter-to-quarter. Bookings and billings historically are lowest in the first quarter and have grown each quarter to the fourth quarter and to then repeat the pattern again the following year. We would expect the same this year.
For those of you who look to model deferred revenue, we would suggest you focus on the larger short-term deferred revenue portion as we would expect bookings duration to return to something closer to 21 months and bring the long-term deferred revenue more in line with revenue than short-term deferred growth.
For Q1, keep in mind that the average euro rate a year ago, that's Q1 a year ago, was $1.38, and there were JPY 102 to a dollar, both weakening considerably. With that reminder, we offer the following guidance. Revenue is estimated to grow approximately 20% in constant currencies to a range of $469 million to $474 million or 12% in U.S. dollars at the top of the range. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 22% as a result of the timing this year of major sales and marketing events globally. With other income of $2 million and a 29% tax rate, our non-GAAP EPS is estimated to be around $0.41 a share, assuming approximately 186 million diluted shares. Consistent with my past practice, I do not guide quarterly cash flow because it can be quite variable depending upon individual large payments or receipts. However, I'd say it seems likely that the multi-year pattern of higher cash flow in Q1 than Q2 will repeat given our strong year-end balance sheet.
In summary, we had a great fiscal year. We believe that we're well positioned for further growth and profitability in 2016 and beyond by leveraging the emerging technologies that continue to gain traction with customers and are growing rapidly. The larger deals driven by strong renewals and upsell have strengthened our strategic position with customers and a record total backlog that provides even better forward visibility and one of the fast-growing set of core platform and middleware technologies in the industry. Our growth drivers look good.
I also want to reaffirm what I said on the third quarter call for those who missed it. It was this, and it applies today, the company has never been better positioned for the future than it is right now. Our portfolio of open source infrastructure software and services has never been broader or more current. All major product lines have been refreshed this year, meaning in the last 12 months. The company is well staffed and well managed, and the world is embracing open souce software like never before. With Red Hat as the undisputed leader of open source, the future has never been brighter.
So on a final note, I hope that many of you will be able to join us on June 24 at Analyst Day at the Red Hat Summit in Boston. It's going to be a great opportunity to learn more about our strategy, innovation and customer focus. And if you're not able to attend in person, we hope you'll be able to join our live webcast where you can access all the information that we present.

Looking at the income statement, it looks like anything non-infrastructure related was up roughly 60 -- 70 million or so, but the backlog itself grew a lot more than not. So my question is the delta changed. Where is the growth in the off-balance sheet backlog disproportionately coming relative to the growth you're seeing in the income statement and even in the reported deferred revenue?

Thanks, Kash. I would be disappointed if it wasn't a multipart question. Backlog, this comment on backlog was very strong selling activity and expansion with existing customers and the many new customers and big deals. And a number of the big deals are multi-year deals that add to that backlog, whether it's billed going into deferred revenue or not yet billed and off balance sheet. These large deals have absolutely expanded the backlog. The only way to break it down by product, I would say, in the opening remarks, 80% of the largest deals had emerging technology as part of those deals. So it's hard to say whether it's just emerging technologies driving it, but I can tell you it's a whole portfolio. We have a much broader portfolio and customers are coming to us, expanding the size of the deals and the duration. That's what's adding to the backlog. The second part of your question about the change what's -- that's going on with the new version of Windows, and our philosophy, I guess, is anytime there's change, it creates opportunity. And the biggest potential market for us to go after now is Linux replacing Windows or maybe new greenfield set up alongside Windows. So we see this as an opportunity for us."

I got it. So on the go-to-market, what we have found with the application development and emerging technologies and with each new technology, it's been starting out mostly direct, making sure our direct guys have a good understanding of the technology and know how to sell it, and then from that point, beginning to channel partners in the various technology. In some cases, it may be larger SIs. In some cases, it may be existing OEMs who we're helping with another technology. For example, I mean, Dell might be a good example where they have partnered with us on OpenStack, for example, and they're also a large OEM on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. But I would say that as products mature, then we're more likely to go to a channel model, and that's exactly where we're pursuing it. In terms of the question on your operating margin, what I said is for the full year, we're targeting operating margin to be about the same as this year, so I think I said around 23.3%. Basically, our view is there's no lack of demand. We need to continue to invest, and it's so a reach question. And yes, we are investing heavily in engineering, support and sales to go after not only the emerging technologies but even Linux. I mean, you saw the expansion -- the acceleration of the infrastructure side of our business this quarter. And so we -- this is not a time to be timid.

And so that business is looking good. From a cash flow guidance perspective, what I would say is one thing to keep in mind. Foreign currencies actually have an impact on the operating cash flow as well. You think about -- we're gaining market share and wallet share in euros and in yen and in all the other currencies in which we do business. When you translate even the cash flow back on a dollar-denominated statement, it has some change in the amount of -- on the dollar side of it.

So it's kind of working both ways. And that plus someone earlier had asked about the security question, RHEL is just a more secure system. I think there's a whole lot of reasons why RHEL continues to do well.

Second thing is that with OpenShift, we use the power of RHEL in SE Linux to really power that. That's something that's got a huge installed base out there with our customers. But also, just as important to that, the services that we have built on JBoss are now very much in demand on the past platform of OpenShift. So things like messaging, for example, that's just -- that's a key component of building applications. And as a platform to build applications, we'll now move all those services which we call xPaaS over to the PaaS, over to the OpenShift PaaS platform. So I think that's one of the big set of differences, is the platform built on standards, leveraging the open source technologies of RHEL and JBoss, and the years of development that's gone into that on our PaaS platform is a key differentiator in my mind."

We've been in the Linux business for a long time, a very established position. It's now a very large part of our business. And we sell it very efficiently. I think we do a great job in support. And with the newer products, they're much younger. With a hypergrowth type of activity, 45% growth, you could expect the P&L to look more like something with a hypergrowth company, and therefore, the profitability is clearly lower. And over time, we would expect that profitability to continue to improve. So I think it's a legitimate question, but we don't have that sort of breakdown."

And I apologize for my voice. I have a bit of a cold, so hopefully, you can hear me all right.
The fourth quarter was a very strong finish for Red Hat, and our momentum is strong as we begin our new fiscal year. We exceeded guidance in virtually all of our financial metrics for the fourth quarter and drove a record total backlog for future revenue for FY '16 and beyond.
The fourth quarter was highlighted by subscription and total revenue that both grew more than 20% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Q4 was our highest quarterly growth rate in 3 years, cresting over the consistent mid- to high-teens growth level that we've delivered over that period. Demand for our open hybrid cloud technologies remained strong in the quarter, as evidenced by a record cross-selling in our top 30 deals, all of which were over $2 million, a first for us.
One of the primary drivers of our growth has been IT demand for technologies that bring consistency and flexibility to create applications across various deployment models, from bare metal to virtualization, to private and public clouds. We're able to help modernize our customers' existing applications while bringing transformative technologies like OpenShift and OpenStack to build stateless, highly scalable, native cloud applications. We bring consistency across these deployment models with Red Hat Enterprise Linux and our certified ecosystem.
Our strategic position with customers, combined with our focus on continuous innovation and world-class customer support, allows us to increase our market share and wallet share. We see this in our renewals of our top 25 deals once again. Our customers not only renewed but increased their use of Red Hat technologies in their data centers. We renewed all 25 of those top 25 deals for the quarter and 100 out of the top 100 renewals reported for the fiscal year. In addition, the fourth quarter deals renewed at approximately 115% of their previous annualized value as customers continue to expand their relationship with us.
Looking at the top 30 largest deals for the quarter. We saw continued strength in the size and breadth of technology, as we have seen for the past several quarters. Here are just a few of the highlights. First, as I mentioned, all of the top 30 deals not only were greater than $1 million, they all exceeded $2 million for the first time. One deal was over $10 million and 12 were over $5 million. Without getting the full fiscal year deals, we doubled the numbers of deals in both the $10 million and $5 million categories year-over-year.
Looking at the industry breakout for the quarter by dollar representation. Financial services and tech and media had the largest representation in the top 30. Cross-selling was strong with a record 80% of the deals including one or more components from our application development and emerging technologies offerings, which include Middleware, OpenStack, OpenShift, CloudForms and Storage. In fact, the number of times the top 30 deals included OpenStack or OpenShift this quarter tripled from Q4 a year ago. Interestingly, one technology customer expanded their existing OpenShift deal this quarter, and we now have our first $10 million plus OpenShift customer.
OpenShift has been performing well with customers and momentum is growing. This early traction with customers and the recent recognition of OpenShift as the InfoWorld 2015 Technology of the Year further validates the technology.
Now let me hand the call over to Paul Cormier to update you on some of the progress we've made on our growth initiatives to offer a cohesive hybrid cloud solution for our customers in new markets."

First, we launched RHEL Atomic Host, which provides a streamlined host platform that is optimized to run application containers. The software components included in RHEL Atomic have been designed to enhance the performance, scalability and security of containers while keeping the consistency of RHEL, creating a superior platform on which to deploy and run application containers. RHEL Atomic enables applications to be comprised of microservices in a container-based architecture to more fully realize the benefits of this more nimble, composable approach. Atomic provides numerous benefits to the container-based architecture, including container images in Docker format, Kubernetes orchestration and default security through SE Linux. Based on RHEL, the Atomic Host enables enterprises to embrace containers while reaping the benefits of deployment flexibility without sacrificing their performance, stability and security or the value of Red Hat's vast certified RHEL ecosystem.
Second, and in conjunction with the launch of RHEL Atomic, we announced the industry's first certified container ecosystem program to drive adoption of more secure, reliable, containerized applications based on RHEL and the Docker format. This partner program will offer Red Hat Container Certification to certify that a container's content is from a trusted source and that both the application and the container itself are free of identified vulnerabilities and will perform on Red Hat infrastructure, enabling a robust end-to-end solution that is supported by Red Hat and its partners. As customers consume Linux containers, we are leading the way in enabling them to enjoy the benefits of this key innovation without sacrificing the basic enterprise needs of application security and provenance, as we did in bringing RHEL Linux to the commercial world.
Third, we continue to enhance our RHEL OpenStack platform technology with the launch of version 6, our second major commercial release in FY '15. RHEL OpenStack 6 platform adds over 700 enhancements and updates, all focused on improving the production-ready cloud platform for enterprise businesses, telecommunication companies and public cloud hosting providers. Building a co-engineered design with RHEL 7, RHEL OpenStack 6 platforms delivers new features aimed at easing enterprise deployments and administration within existing data centers, as well as capabilities specific to telecommunication providers to enable network functions virtualization or, as it's called, NFV.
Fourth, in February, we also deepened our strategic relationship with network and communications solution vendors to bring carrier-grade OpenStack solutions for NFV. Specifically, we expanded our partnership with NEC, a leading provider of communications solutions and a top 10 OpenStack contributor. We will be jointly developing NFV features in the integration of the RHEL OpenStack platform. This partnership expands our portfolio of top global NFV vendors looking to achieve carrier-grade OpenStack solutions for NFV as this technology moves from proof of concepts to pilots to production.
In summary, our focused engineering and support efforts in FY '15 have broadened our portfolio of commercial technologies. When combined with strong sales execution, Red Hat delivered high revenue growth and record total backlog. This company-wide execution has increased our strategic position with customers as we look to further expand our market share.
With that, let me turn the call over to Charlie."
33679,286433699,786105,"Red Hat, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Mar 25, 2015",2015-03-25,"Earnings Calls","Red Hat, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Paul. I'm also pleased to report a great fourth quarter.

Demand for our growing portfolio of open hybrid cloud offerings was very good. But as Paul said, it was the excellent execution on the part of our Red Hat associates and partners which resulted in a compelling combination of revenue growth, profitability and cash flow for the quarter and the fiscal year. We exceeded guidance and outperformed on virtually all financial metrics in U.S. dollars despite very significant foreign exchange headwinds during the quarter.
However, foreign exchange rates are important, and I want to update you on the foreign exchange impact to our business before I jump into the quarterly details. Virtually every company that has reported since December has commented on the impact of foreign currencies, including Oracle just last week. The rapid devaluation of nearly every foreign currency versus the U.S. dollar is not news. Yet surprisingly, only about 30% of the sell-side analysts who follow Red Hat have updated their models at current rates. Nearly every currency in which we do business weakened against the U.S. dollar when compared to Q4 last year, last quarter, against guidance or versus the full year fiscal '14. So if you want additional currency rate detail, please see the rates which are posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. These rate changes negatively impacted both the results for the quarter and for the full year across the income statement, the balance sheet and the off-balance sheet backlog.
So for instance, total revenue for the fourth quarter, which was very good, would have been $24 million higher using Q4 rates from last year, $13 million higher using rates from last quarter and $7 million higher using rates that I used in December for guidance. For the full fiscal year 2015, total revenue would have been $36 million higher using rates from last year and $20 million higher using the rates given in March of 2014, when we first set fiscal year 2015 guidance.
As a result of this foreign exchange volatility, I will provide both U.S. dollar and constant currency results using the rates from Q4 last year and from the fiscal year '14. Here are just a few of the financial highlights on a year-over-year basis. Full year revenue was up 19% in constant currency and 17% in U.S. dollars. Full year non-GAAP operating income grew 11%, reflecting our continued investment in emerging technologies, including investments made in 3 acquired companies. We hit new record highs for both quarterly and annual operating cash flow. For the quarter, we exceeded the $200 million mark, coming in at $217 million, up 18%. For the full year, we exceeded the $600 million mark with full year operating cash flow of $623 million, up 15%, while at the same time, our total backlog grew by more than 19% year-over-year in U.S. dollars.
As I have done on other year-end calls, I will add a few additional statistics about bookings. But also consistent with prior years, we will not be updating these booking statistics on a quarterly basis. First, as I indicated, total backlog was up over 19% year-over-year at February 28 to over $1.86 billion. We define total backlog as total deferred revenue which is billed, plus the value of customer contracts to be billed in the future not reflected in our financial statements. Total deferred revenue was $1.5 billion at the end of fiscal 2015. It's up 15% year-over-year. A portion of total backlog to be billed in the future, or sometimes it's referred to as off-balance sheet backlog, was in excess of $380 million compared to in excess of $270 million last fiscal year, up over 40% year-over-year. It is worth noting that the portion of the off-balance sheet backlog to be billed the next 12 months was in excess of $230 million, up approximately $40 million or 21% from fiscal 2014.
These results reflect a strong mix of business across technologies and geographies. The combination of deferred revenue and off-balance sheet backlog to be billed in the next 12 months gives us good forward visibility into a significant portion of fiscal '16 revenue and some for the following years. The increase in longer-term visibility was driven by strong sales execution and a number of large renewals that extended their size and terms. This led to bookings duration of 22 months for fiscal '15, slightly above our normal 21-month average.
Moving on to bookings by channel and geography. Our Q4 bookings mix was 68% from the channel and 32% from direct sales. This is similar to our annual mix of channel versus direct sales, and this mix split for the channel is up 500 basis points from last fiscal year and moving closer to our multi-year goal of 70%, 30% split of channel and direct sales.
Our quarterly geographic split of bookings was 63% from the Americas, 25% from EMEA and 12% from APAC compared to a split in Q4 last year of 61%, 26% and 13%, respectively. All regions performed well and delivered double-digit growth year-over-year despite the foreign exchange headwinds.
Now let's talk about our financial performance for the quarter, starting with the revenue. Fourth quarter revenue was $464 million. It's up 22% in constant currency from the prior year and 16% in U.S. dollars. This result was above the top end of our U.S. dollar guidance despite a $7 million foreign exchange headwind from guidance rates.
Subscription revenue, which is a renewable revenue stream, constituted approximately 87% of total revenue in the fourth quarter. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $405 million. It's up 21% in constant currency from the prior year and 15% in U.S. dollars.
Here's a breakdown of revenue by technology in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings was $341 million, accelerating the 17% growth in constant currency and 12% in U.S. dollars year-over-year. Subscription revenue for application development and emerging technologies offerings was $64 million, up year-over-year 45% in constant currency and 38% in U.S. dollars. As a reminder, our infrastructure-related offerings include mainly Red Hat Enterprise Linux, RHEL and RHEL-related offerings and RHEV, while our application development and emerging technology offerings include Middleware, OpenStack, OpenShift, CloudForms and Storage.
The fourth quarter represented the first time that our application development and emerging technologies offerings surpassed the annualized subscription revenue level of $0.25 billion, that's billion with a B, another validation of the success of our product strategy.
Training and services revenue was $59 million. It's up 28% in constant currency and 20% in U.S. dollars from the year-ago period, turning in a very strong performance.
Now I'll discuss the rest of our results on a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation, amortization expense, business acquisition-related costs and noncash interest expense related to the convertible debt. Overall gross margin was 86% for Q4, up 30 basis points sequentially and in line with the prior year. Subscription gross margin was consistent with last quarter and last year at 94%. Training and services gross margin was 33%. That's 130 basis points better than Q4 last year as a result of better-than-expected utilization in the fourth quarter holiday period this year.
For Q4, non-GAAP operating expense was $289 million. It's up 2% sequentially and up 17% in U.S. dollars from the prior year. We added over 150 new employees in the quarter, mainly investing in sales, support and engineering skills needed to drive our emerging technologies. For the fiscal year, we increased our headcount by about 950 people with approximately 1/4 of the new associates coming from our 3 acquisitions, that is Inktank, eNovance and FeedHenry, which brought additional capabilities and skills in software-defined storage, OpenStack and mobility.
Q4 non-GAAP operating income of $111 million increased 14% from last year, resulting in a Q4 non-GAAP operating margin of 23.8%, 80 basis points better than guidance. Net interest income and other income was $5.8 million. This result included a onetime investment gain of nearly $5 million or $0.02 per share.
The annual effective tax rate was approximately 29.5% for both GAAP and non-GAAP results, which was slightly higher than the 29% which we estimated in December. As a result, the Q4 tax rate was 30.7% in order to adjust this to the annual rate, which had a negative impact of $0.01 per share on the Q4 earnings per share.
Our non-GAAP diluted quarterly earnings per share is $0.43 compared to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.39 in Q4 of last year. The Q4 result is $0.02 per share better than the top of our guidance. The $0.01 per share is primarily due to the revenue beat, and $0.01 per share is better below the line, as I just mentioned.
Now let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We ended the year with just over $1.8 billion in cash and investments. As part of our capital allocation plans, we completed the $375 million accelerated stock repurchase program in Q4. Combining this ASR with the $160 million we repurchased earlier in the year, we have repurchased a total of $535 million or 9.1 million shares of Red Hat stock this year. Over the last 4 years, we have repurchased over $1 billion in Red Hat shares.
Along with today's Q4 announcement, I'm pleased to announce that Red Hat's Board of Directors has authorized a new $500 million repurchase program to replace the remainder of the previous $300 million authorization that expires later this month. Given our long-term growth prospects, our management team and the board believe that returning capital to investors through stock repurchases will create additional value for our shareholders.
Our days sales outstanding was 63 days at year-end compared to 58 days last year. Very strong Q4 volume drove the DSO change, which we would expect to move back to its 60 days next quarter. And as a reminder, since day sales outstanding is traditionally a measure of receivables versus billings, our DSO calculation is based on our billings proxy, which includes revenue plus the change in deferred revenue from the cash flow statement.
Total deferred revenue at quarter-end was $1.48 billion, in -- that's U.S. dollars, an increase of $193 million or 15% over the prior year-end. Sequentially, deferred revenue increased approximately $182 million or 14% from last quarter. 
As one would expect, foreign exchange had a large impact. So I'm going to break down the components of deferred revenue to highlight the impact of the currency changes. Short-term deferred revenue, which ended Q3 at $941 million, had real growth in Q4 of $181 million but decreased $27 million as a result of changes in the FX spot rates, ending Q4 over $1.09 billion. Long-term deferred revenue, which ended Q3 at $359 million, had a real increase in Q4 of approximately $44 million but decreased $16 million due to changes in FX spot rates, ending Q4 at $387 million. The total increase in deferred revenue without the impact of currency changes was $225 million and can be found on our statement of cash flows.
Moving to the statement of cash flows. We produced record quarterly operating cash flow of $217 million, up 18% year-over-year. Full year operating cash flow was $623 million. That's up 15% and it's well above the top of our guidance. This overachievement was driven by strong billings and strong collections.
Now to briefly recap and summarize just a few highlights for the full fiscal year. Revenue grew to $1.79 billion, up 19% year-over-year in constant currency or up 17% in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue grew to $1.56 billion, an increase of 19% in constant currency or 17% in U.S. dollars. And subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings was $1.32 billion. It's up 15% in constant currency and 13% in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue for application development and emerging technologies was $237 million, up 45% in constant currency and 43% in U.S. dollars. For fiscal '15, application development and emerging technology subscriptions now constitutes 13% of total revenue, up from 11% last fiscal year. 
Non-GAAP operating income grew by 11%, which includes the dilutive impact from the 3 strategic acquisitions which we closed during the year. Non-GAAP EPS for the full year was $1.60, up 7% over the prior year. And the differences in the tax rate played a part in that.
Overall, it was another great year with strong execution across all areas of the business. Now I want to shift to fiscal year 2016 guidance.
For this guidance, I have assumed average foreign exchange rates of $1.08 for the euro and $1 -- excuse me, and JPY 121 to the dollar. Compared to the year just finished, this represents a 20% weakening of the euro and an 11% weakening of the yen, with the largest impact coming in the first 3 quarters. Most other global currencies have also devalued in this range, some even greater. As in the past, I'm not attempting to forecast exchange rates. I'm simply pegging guidance at recent rates for a point of reference. The coming year is one in which virtually everyone with foreign operations will be measuring performance in constant currency terms until rates stabilize and cycle through a full year.
We are forecasting annual revenue growth in constant currency terms up to 19%. The FX rates which I am using create a headwind to revenue in U.S. dollars of approximately $110 million or 600 basis points. The headwind is $110 million or 600 hundred basis points. Therefore, we are forecasting total revenue in the range of $1.99 billion to $2.02 billion -- so maybe 1990 to 2020, easy way to remember it -- for fiscal 2016, representing approximately 13% growth in U.S. dollars at the top of the range.
For modeling purposes, our growth rate assumes that subscription revenues grow 20% in constant currency and services revenue will flow to 13% in constant currency as the initial training surge associated with the release of RHEL 7 hits the 1-year anniversary. We're also assuming that OpenStack services will continue to expand in fiscal '16 due to high interest in our offering.
Our operating margin forecast reflects our plan to continue investing in emerging technologies as well as the full year impact of the 3 acquisitions we completed this last fiscal year. We are planning to keep operating margins consistent with last year, or around 23.3%, and continue to invest for growth, particularly around OpenStack, OpenShift, cloud management and software-defined storage. I'm estimating full year other income, principally net interest income, of approximately $8 million or $2 million per quarter, which includes the cash interest expense from the convertible debt.
The estimated annual effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2016 remains at 29% for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes. Assuming a 29% tax rate and approximately 186 million diluted shares, one would estimate diluted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.79 to $1.82 per share. 
On a GAAP basis, we estimate annual stock compensation expense of approximately $160 million and annual amortization expense of approximately $26 million. From a cash flow perspective, we anticipate operating cash flow for the full year between $670 million to $690 million. Further, we are forecasting CapEx of approximately $50 million, in line with fiscal '15.
Finally, as we have seen over the last several years with the recurring revenue model, there's a natural ebb and flow to the business from quarter-to-quarter. Bookings and billings historically are lowest in the first quarter and have grown each quarter to the fourth quarter, and to then repeat the pattern again the following year. We would expect the same this year.
For those of you who look to model deferred revenue, we would suggest you focus on the larger short-term deferred revenue portion, as we would expect bookings duration to return to something closer to 21 months and bring the long-term deferred revenue more in line with revenue than short-term deferred growth.
For Q1, keep in mind that the average euro rate a year ago, that's Q1 a year ago, was $1.38, and there were JPY 102 to the dollar, both weakening considerably. With that reminder, we offer the following guidance. Revenue is estimated to grow approximately 20% in constant currencies to a range of $469 million to $474 million or 12% in U.S. dollars at the top of the range. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 22% as a result of the timing this year of major sales and marketing events globally. With other income of $2 million and a 29% tax rate, our non-GAAP EPS is estimated to be around $0.41 a share, assuming approximately 186 million diluted shares. Consistent with my past practice, I do not guide quarterly cash flow because it can be quite variable depending upon individual large payments or receipts. However, I'd say it seems likely that the multi-year pattern of higher cash flow in Q1 than Q2 will repeat given our strong year-end balance sheet.
In summary, we had a great fiscal year. We believe that we're well positioned for further growth and profitability in 2016 and beyond by leveraging the emerging technologies that continue to gain traction with customers and are growing rapidly. The larger deals driven by strong renewals and upsell have strengthened our strategic position with customers and a record total backlog that provides even better forward visibility and one of the fast-growing set of core platform and middleware technologies in the industry. Our growth drivers look good.
I also want to reaffirm what I said on the third quarter call for those who missed it. It was this, and it applies today, the company has never been better positioned for the future than it is right now. Our portfolio of open source infrastructure software and services has never been broader or more current. All major product lines have been refreshed this year, meaning in the last 12 months. The company is well staffed and well managed, and the world is embracing open source software like never before. With Red Hat as the undisputed leader of open source, the future has never been brighter.
So on a final note, I hope that many of you will be able to join us on June 24 at Analyst Day at the Red Hat Summit in Boston. It's going to be a great opportunity to learn more about our strategy, innovation and customer focus. And if you're not able to attend in person, we hope you'll be able to join our live webcast, where you can access all the information that we present.

Could you maybe give us some rank ordering of where you're seeing the biggest growth in your off-balance sheet backlog? It's going from $270 million to $380 million. Looking at the income statement, it looks like anything non-infrastructure related was up roughly $60 million, $70 million or so, but the backlog itself grew a lot more than that. So my question is the delta changed. Where is the growth in the off-balance sheet backlog disproportionately coming relative to the growth you're seeing in the income statement and even in the reported deferred revenue? And if you can, finally, touch upon the Windows 2003 Server refresh and any opportunities for Red Hat, that will be great. And I apologize for the length of the question."

Thanks, Kash. I would be disappointed if it wasn't a multipart question.

And a number of the big deals are multi-year deals that add to that backlog. Whether it's billed going into deferred revenue or not yet billed and off-balance sheet, these large deals have absolutely expanded the backlog. The only way to break it down by product, I would say, in the opening remarks, 80% of the largest deals had emerging technology as part of those deals. So it's hard to say whether it's just emerging technologies driving it, but I can tell you it's a whole portfolio. We have a much broader portfolio and customers are coming to us, expanding the size of the deals and the duration. That's what's adding to the backlog. The second part of your question about the change, what's going on with the new version of Windows, and our philosophy, I guess, is anytime there's change, it creates opportunity. And the biggest potential market for us to go after now is Linux replacing Windows or maybe new greenfield set up alongside Windows. So we see this as an opportunity for us."

In some cases, it may be larger SIs. In some cases, it may be existing OEMs who we're helping with another technology. For example, I mean, Dell might be a good example, where they have partnered with us on OpenStack, for example, and they're also a large OEM on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. But I would say that as products mature, then we're more likely to go to a channel model, and that's exactly the way we're pursuing it. In terms of the question on your operating margin, what I said is for the full year, we're targeting operating margin to be about the same as this year, so I think I said around 23.3%. Basically, our view is there's no lack of demand. We need to continue to invest, and so it's a reach question. And yes, we are investing heavily in engineering, support and sales to go after not only the emerging technologies but even Linux. I mean, you saw the expansion -- the acceleration of the infrastructure side of our business this quarter. And so we -- this is not a time to be timid. We believe that a flat operating margin, somewhere in that neighborhood, is the appropriate approach for this year, and we will reinvest the rest of the money back into the business."

It's been growing very rapidly. It still is the fastest-growing part of the business. We believe we are winning share in the public market as more production workloads go to the public cloud. And so that business is looking good. From a cash flow guidance perspective, what I would say is, one thing to keep in mind. Foreign currencies actually have an impact on the operating cash flow as well. You think about -- we're gaining market share and wallet share in euros and in yen and in all the other currencies in which we do business. When you translate even the cash flow back on a dollar-denominated statement, it has some change in the amount of -- on the dollar side of it.

But also, just as important to that, the services that we have built on JBoss are now very much in demand on the PaaS platform of OpenShift. So things like messaging, for example, that's just -- that's a key component of building applications. And as a platform to build applications, we'll now move all those services which we call xPaaS over to the PaaS -- over to the OpenShift PaaS platform.

The first quarter was a strong start to our fiscal 2016 with results that exceeded our guidance. Given the continued momentum of our business in Q1, we believe we are well",741,"Thank you, Tom and let me add my welcome to all of you joining us on today's call. The first quarter was a strong start to our fiscal 2016 with results that exceeded our guidance. Given the continued momentum of our business in Q1, we believe we are well positioned to achieve another year of strong revenue, profitability and cash flow. Some of the highlights in the quarter include Q1 total revenue and subscription revenue both grew greater than 20% in constant currency year-over-year basis. That makes 13 straight quarters of consistent mid-teens to 20-plus-percent U.S. dollar growth in total, revenues and subscription revenue, and we had record operating cash flow for Q1. 
Let me provide some additional details on the largest deals and renewals that closed in the quarter. Within our top 30 largest deal metric, all 30 deals were approximately $1 million or more. We also had 2 deals that were in excess of $10 million, a record for Q1. Cross-selling was strong with 70% of the deals, including 1 or more components from our group of application development and emerging technologies offerings, 7 of these deals were standalone application development and emerging technology offerings. 
You will see from the details that Charlie will provide in a moment, the growing adoption of these technologies continue to result in significant revenue growth. The top vertical for the quarter was financial services, followed closely by government. On the renewal front, I'm pleased to share that once again, we renewed all of the top 25 deals that were up for renewal. The total subscription value for these top 25 deals was approximately 115% of their prior year value. One should note that these results are in U.S. dollars and reflect strong sales execution. 
With that overview, let me discuss some of our recent technology highlights. First, we released the commissioned survey of 310 IT decision-makers and professionals on their cloud initiatives. We were pleased to find that 75% of the respondents plan to use OpenStack. These respondents are looking to OpenStack to reduce time to deploy applications, lower costs and increase the agility of their IT infrastructure. 
In addition, the types of applications the IT professionals intend to deploy on OpenStack are closely split between new workloads that are optimized for cloud and existing virtualized workloads. The study also found that most of the respondents are still early in the process to deploying OpenStack, and they noted that for broader deployment, many enterprise users are looking at offerings and support from commercial OpenStack providers like Red Hat. 
We intend to be the vendor of choice for production deployments of OpenStack, and we will provide the global support, a broad ecosystem and technology expertise that we provide with our current RHEL infrastructure development today. At the OpenStack Summit in Vancouver where Red Hat was a headline sponsor, we announced the industry's first integrated, and PaaS solution based fully on open source technology. 
This solution known as Red Hat cloud suite for application integrates our OpenShift PaaS technology, our OpenStack and our CloudForms management technology. As organizations move to cloud, many are evolving their deployment efforts towards micro-services that run on containers to increase scalability, portability and efficiency. Red Hat's integrated cloud suite solution addresses this shift and gives users a faster way to deploy, develop and manage applications. 
Next week, we're excited to kick off Red Hat Summit in Boston, our premier event in one of the largest annual source event in the world. Based on our record preregistrations, we are expecting a large increase to the number of CIOs, IT executives and developers to attend the event. I hope many of you will be able to join us at Summit, to hear more about innovations and momentum across our portfolio, including containers, OpenStack, mobile, security, application development integration, storage and more. 
In summary, we are excited about the trends we're seeing in open source development and usage as well as our increasing strategic position as an innovator that cloud customers and partners depend on the. We remain optimistic about our outlook for the remainder of the year as Charlie will detail in a moment. 
On a final note, I would like to thank all Red Hat associates around the globe for their continued commitment to our customers and partners that has translated into the strong financial results for our shareholders this quarter. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Charlie."
33679,302758170,830218,"Red Hat, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 18, 2015",2015-06-18,"Earnings Calls","Red Hat, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim. Q1 was indeed a strong start to the new fiscal year. The results included higher-than-expected growth in virtually all of our key metrics even without the positive impact of the $5 million earned revenue adjustments, which I will describe in",1884,"Thanks, Jim. Q1 was indeed a strong start to the new fiscal year. The results included higher-than-expected growth in virtually all of our key metrics even without the positive impact of the $5 million earned revenue adjustments, which I will describe in detail in a moment. 
First, let me update you on the impact of foreign currency on the Q1 results. As I previewed in Q4, nearly every currency in which we do business, weakened significantly against the U.S. dollar when compared against both Q1 last year and last quarter. This significant change in exchange rates impacted not only our financial statements, but also the statistics we provide on a quarterly basis. For instance, the year-over-year foreign exchange impact on total revenue was 850 basis points or a $36 million headwind. If you want additional currency rate detail, please see the rates, which are posted on the IR section of our website. 
As a result of the FX volatility, I'll provide both U.S. dollar and constant currency results for the quarter using the rates from Q1 last year. Some of the Q1 highlights include: year-over-year Q1 total revenue grew 22% in constant currency or 14% in U.S. dollars. In U.S. dollars, we exceeded the high end of our revenue guidance by $7 million, which includes the $5 million earned revenue adjustment. Non-GAAP operating margin was 23.6% compared to my guidance, which was around 22%, this result include 70 basis points from improved operations and a 90 basis point positive impact from the earned revenue adjustment. Our operating cash flow of $209 million was up 27% year-over-year. 
Now let's turn to some of the details of our financial performance and outlook. On a geographic basis this quarter, 55% of bookings came from the Americas, 25% from EMEA and 20% from Asia Pacific versus a 56%, 25%, 19% split in Q1 last year. Our international sales teams performed well despite the foreign exchange headwind just discussed and APAC experienced their normal Q1 seasonal strength. 
The Q1 sales route mix was 75% from the channel and 25% from our direct sales force versus a 67%, 33% split in Q1 last year. The higher channel percentage was due to a number of large channel deals as well as a Q1 seasonal fluctuation toward the channel. We continue to target a long-term annual goal of a 70%, 30% split. 
As I discussed on the fourth quarter call, our expectation is that the average contract duration this year will be around 21 months. For Q1, the duration was just under 20 months, which compares to 21 months in Q1 last year and 22 months in Q4. Our government business, which generally involves only 12-month contracts was quite strong this quarter, which influenced the shorter average duration. 
Now let's shift to the income statement. As I discussed a few moments ago, the first quarter revenue was $481 million, an increase of 22% in constant currency and an increase of 14% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. The main driver of our total revenue growth was subscription revenue, a $425 million, an increase of 23% in constant currency and an increase of 14% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. In U.S. dollars, this renewable revenue stream now constitutes 88% of total revenue. 
Revenue exceeded our March guidance due to the strong performance of the business in addition to the $5 million earned revenue adjustment from our Red Hat Certified Public Cloud Providers or CCP. In prior periods, CCP subscription revenue was reported in arrears in a 1-month lagged. Our ability to reasonably estimate the monthly revenue associated with these cloud providers has improved to the point where we no longer require a lag and reporting the final month of the quarter. Therefore, we are updating our treatment as of Q1 and on an ongoing basis of the earned revenue associated with these relationships. 
Since its earned revenue and only -- it represents roughly 1% of revenue for the quarter, I'll describe the rest of the results, including the small adjustment. Looking at the subscription revenue breakout by technology, the subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings was $354 million, an increase of 19% in constant currency and an increase of 11% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue for application development related and emerging technologies offerings was $71 million, an increase of 44% in constant currency and an increase of 34% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. 
Emerging technologies revenue is now approximately 15% of total revenue in U.S. dollars. As a reminder, our infrastructure related offerings include mainly RHEL and RHEL-related offerings, including RHEL consumed in the Certified Cloud Providers program, while our application development and emerging technology offerings include Middleware plus all of our newer cloud offerings. 
The training of services component of revenue was $56 million and it was up 18% year-over-year in constant currency and 9% in U.S. dollars. Now I'll discuss the rest of our results on a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation, amortization expense, transaction costs related to business combinations and noncash interest expense related to convertible debt, starting with gross margin. 
Subscription gross margin was 94%, up 30 basis points year-over-year. Training and services gross margin was 30%, down approximately 230 basis points year-over-year. This result was driven by a surge in demand for Red Hat consulting services in Europe, which had to be temporarily augmented by higher cost subcontractors and to scale out of our emerging technologies consulting practice. Despite the higher cost in consulting services, overall gross margin was approximately 87%, modestly higher than Q4 and Q1 last year. 
Now moving on to non-GAAP operating expenses. Q1 non-GAAP operating expense came in at $303 million, up 9% year-over-year. Sales and marketing grew 10%. We had several successful sales and marketing events in Q1 that increased expenses, including the OpenStack Summit in Vancouver, as Jim referenced, partner meetings and global sales kickoff events. Further, we have continued to invest in sales headcount to drive future bookings, billings and revenue. 
R&D grew 8% as we continue to hire engineers mainly for our emerging cloud technologies. We also continued to show leverage in the G&A line, which declined a 7.2% of revenue compared to 7.5% in Q1 last year. Q1 non-GAAP operating income was $113 million, producing an operating margin of 23.6%, including the 90-basis-point positive impact from the onetime earned revenue adjustment from CCP. 
Net interest and other income was moderately lower than Q1 last year at approximately $1 million due to the cash interest expense from the convertible debt. Our estimated annual effective tax rate was 29% for both GAAP and non-GAAP results and a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.44. Adjusting for the impact of the onetime CCP revenue, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share would have been $0.42, which is $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range. 
One should note that non-GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding, excludes any dilution, resulting from the convertible notes because any potential dilution is offset by our convertible note hedged transactions. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $1.97 billion, quarterly operating cash flow of $209 million was up 27% from Q1 last year due in part the strong seasonal collections. FX adjusted DSO was within our target range of 59 days and down 1 day from Q1 last year. As a reminder, since days sales outstanding is traditionally a measure of receivables compared to billings, our DSO is calculated using our billings proxy which one would calculate by adding revenue to the change in deferred revenue from the cash flow statement. 
Total deferred revenue at quarter-end was $1.44 billion, an increase of $164 million or 13% over the same quarter a year ago. Current deferred revenue grew 13% and long-term deferred revenue grew 14% from 1 year ago in U.S. dollars. Sequentially, and as expected from a seasonality perspective, deferred revenue decreased approximately $46 million from last quarter. 
To isolate the foreign currency impact, let me break down the components of deferred revenue for you. Short-term deferred revenue, which ended Q4 at $1.095 billion had a real decrease in Q1 of $19 million and further decreased by $10 million as a result of changes in quarter-over-quarter foreign exchange spot rates, ending Q1 at $1.066 billion. Long-term deferred revenue, which ended Q4 at $387 million had a real decrease in Q1 of approximately of $13 million and further decreased by $4 million as a result of changes in FX spot rates, ending Q1 at $370 million. The total decrease in deferred revenue without the impact of currency changes, was $32 million and can be found on our statement of cash flows. 
Our rolling 4 quarters billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statements for the last 4 quarters. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, the billings proxy was $529 million, up 18% in U.S. dollars, a modest increase from a year ago quarter and continues to demonstrate the momentum in the business. On a constant currency basis, this metric would be up 22%. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance factoring in the solid performance in Q1. For purposes of this guidance, I have assumed that average FX rates for Q2 and the balance of the year are as they were recently. For example, the euro was $1.13 and JPY 123 equaled $1. Compared to FX rates used in March, this year, our rate is slightly stronger while the yen rate is weaker. And the overall blended rates of more than 20 currencies we used is little changed. 
With these assumptions in mind, we are reaffirming our full year revenue operating margin and cash flow guidance. As a reminder, the full year revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.990 billion to $2.020 billion or -- again, it's $1.990 billion to $2.020 billion, but I would say that I have high confidence in the high end of the revenues range. We are continuing to target full year non-GAAP operating margin around 23.3% as we invest for growth, particularly around our emerging products portfolio. 
Full year cash flow guidance remains at $670 million to $690 million. We are increasing our full year EPS guidance range $0.02 to $1.81 to $1.84 per share, still assuming a 29% annual effective tax rate. For Q2 specifically, I offer the following outlook: Q2 revenue is estimated to be approximately $492 million to $496 million; operating margin is estimated to be in the 23% area, including the added cost of the Red Hat Summit, which starts next week; interest and other income should be around $2 million; and non-GAAP EPS is estimated to be approximately $0.44, assuming the same 29% tax rate.
Consistent with my past practice, I do not forecast quarterly cash flow. However, I would suggest that while estimating cash flow, you review the historical quarterly variations as a possible indicator of future seasonality. 
In summary, we're off to a solid start to the fiscal year and reaching the $2 billion revenue milestone. We look forward to seeing many of you next Wednesday, June 24, Analyst Day at the Red Hat Summit in Boston. 
And operator, I'd like to now turn it back over to you for the first question."

So it had some impact on the duration this quarter. As I said, it was less than 20 months. And so it had -- that has an impact on the billings metric. However, let me say this and sort of preempt the question, we are very proud of the billing statistics this quarter. If you look at simply the short-term billings, which means look at the change in the short-term deferred revenue, we had 24% growth on a constant currency basis, 15% growth in U.S. dollars.

And it's clear that probably 1/3 of the sell-side guys didn't get the currency part right because they were very big numbers in some of those expectations that led to the consensus. I would say, so let me just put that aside for a minute and I think that as this currency play works out -- works along this year toward the end of the year, currencies will not be that much of a factor, if they stay at the current levels because we would be heavy on the full cycle. But for this quarter, Q1, Q2 there are big factors, everyone needs to be thinking about it, to build into your numbers. But go back and just talk about something, billings are a function of the strength of the business and the duration of the contract. So this quarter, we had just under 20-month average duration. As I said, it's short-term billings statistic, which would look at the change in the short-term deferred revenue is made up, perhaps a better indicator, 15% U.S. dollar growth, 24% constant currency growth. It's hard to imagine people would've expected much more than that. But I do agree, the consensus number did have some kind of very wide variation of estimates in it."

Frankly, I'm going to go through at Analyst Day, the drivers. I don't want to ruin all of my stuff for Analyst Day. But one thing we know for certain is new workloads, newer workloads are going to Linux. IDC statistics that I shared last year are slightly different. But overall, basically the same. I was showing a 14% shift from legacy operating systems to Linux and over a 5-year period of time, and we think we are going to be the primary beneficiary of that. So to me, that's one of the largest drivers. Its newer workloads. It's people wanting to be in an open hybrid cloud environment, so they can easily move workloads back and forth from their own data center from multiple different public clouds or in a virtual environment, on bare metal, on many different formats. But I would say all the same drivers we've been talking about over the years still exist and maybe a new driver is the broadened portfolio of products that we have, I believe, is now an additional driver to our RHEL business.

And secondly, when you look at OpenStack, just as a conceptual idea back during the days when Red Hat was a small company, Linux was displacing Unix, as a replacement cycle targeted very expensive legacy systems, so you had the bad guys to target and you are the good guys, and you were the savior of corporate IT department. When you look at OpenStack, it feels like that same argument does not apply in, and bigger company. You got more enemies, you have a lot of friends back in those days and that's actually a good thing. But it's not a replacement market, it's a market where there's a lot of new innovation. So conceptually, how does Red Hat exploit -- well, how much of your background is becoming to open source, Linux operating system dominant, does actually apply in this new OpenStack core?"

So please join us then and I hope to have an update for you at that time. In terms of OpenStack, I do think that you point out some differences in kind of market. I actually look at all of those as quite a positive thing for Red Hat because we've already established ourselves as a significant vendor to most large enterprise IT where a core part of their production ecosystem. So we're strategic for that reason and we are now offering more innovative product. So we have a seat at the table, and we can talk about innovation and those 2 things together really do make us very strategic. It also kind of opens up the size of market opportunity. So when you're going in there, commoditizing a market, the size of the market is the market that currently exists and you -- then you price underneath that umbrella, but it's a logical market size. With our newer, more innovative products, whether it's OpenStack or OpenShift or some of our mobile technologies, the size of the market's limited by the business opportunity that's created by those technologies. So it gives us a much greater ability to kind of come in and talk about the value of those things rather than just the cost savings, which admittedly, is a more complex sell. So one of the reasons you've heard us talk over the last really, 2 years about investments in sales and marketing, is that they are longer sales cycle. But the ultimate results are deeper relationships that are higher level in the organization and larger contracts, which I think you've seen us continue to deliver. I think that it hadn't been for Linux, and we were coming in brand-new to this, it would be really hard to have that same level of mine share with the CIO. But the COGS were there, we have it and secondly, especially this is particularly to OpenStack, which you asked about. The certified ecosystem of hardware providers and management tool vendors that we have, kind of carryover from RHEL into OpenStack, right? And so, which gives us just an incremental benefit as well."

And let me add my welcome to all of you joining us on today's call. The first quarter was a strong start to our fiscal 2016 with results that exceeded our guidance.

The first quarter was a strong start to our fiscal 2016 with results that exceeded our guidance. Given the continued momentum of our business in Q1, we believe we are well-positioned to achieve another year of strong revenue, profitability and cash flow. Some of the highlights for the quarter include Q1 total revenue and subscription revenue both grew greater than 20% in constant currency year-over-year basis. That makes 13 straight quarters of consistent mid-teens to 20-plus percent U.S. dollar growth in total revenues and subscription revenue, and we had record operating cash flow for Q1. 
Let me provide some additional details on the largest deals and renewals that closed in the quarter. Within our top 30 largest deal metric, all 30 deals were approximately $1 million or more. We also had 2 deals that were in excess of $10 million, a record for Q1. Cross-selling was strong, with 70% of the deals including 1 or more components from our group of application development and emerging technologies offerings. 7 of these deals were standalone application development and emerging technology offerings. You will see from the detail that Charlie will provide in a moment, the growing adoption of these technologies continue to result in significant revenue growth. The top vertical for the quarter was financial services, followed closely by government. On the renewal front, I'm pleased to share that once again, we renewed all of the top 25 deals that were up for renewal. The total subscription value for these top 25 deals was approximately 115% of their prior year value. One should note that these results are in U.S. dollars and reflect strong sales execution. 
With that overview, let me discuss some of our recent technology highlights. First, we released a commissioned survey of 310 IT decision-makers and professionals on their cloud initiatives. We were pleased to find that 75% of the respondents plan to use OpenStack. These respondents are looking to OpenStack to reduce time to deploy applications, lower costs and increase the agility of their IT infrastructure. 
In addition, the types of applications the IT professionals intend to deploy on OpenStack are closely split between new workloads that are optimized for cloud and existing virtualized workloads. The study also found that most of the respondents are still early in the process to deploying OpenStack, and they noted that for broader deployment, many enterprise users are looking at offerings and support from commercial OpenStack providers like Red Hat. 
We intend to be the vendor of choice for production deployments of OpenStack, and we will provide the global support, a broad ecosystem and technology expertise that we provide with our current RHEL infrastructure technology today. At the OpenStack Summit in Vancouver where Red Hat was a headline sponsor, we announced the industry's first integrated IaaS and PaaS solution based fully on open source technology. This solution known as Red Hat Cloud Suite for Applications integrates our OpenShift PaaS technology, our OpenStack technology and our CloudForms management technology. As organizations move to cloud, many are evolving their deployment efforts towards micro-services that run on containers to increase scalability, portability and efficiency. Red Hat's integrated Cloud Suite solution addresses this shift and gives users a faster way to deploy, develop and manage applications. 
Next week, we are excited to kick off Red Hat Summit in Boston, our premier event in one of the largest annual open source events in the world. Based on our record preregistrations, we are expecting a large increase to the number of CIOs, IT executives and developers to attend the event. I hope many of you will be able to join us at Summit to hear more about innovations and momentum across our portfolio, including containers, OpenStack, mobile, security, application development integration, storage and more. 
In summary, we are excited about the trends we're seeing in open source development and usage as well as our increasing strategic position as an innovator that cloud customers and partners depend on. We remain optimistic about our outlook for the remainder of the year as Charlie will detail in a moment. 
On a final note, I would like to thank all Red Hat associates around the globe for their continued commitment to our customers and partners that has translated into the strong financial results for our shareholders this quarter. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Charlie."

Q1 was indeed a strong start to the new fiscal year. The results included higher-than-expected growth in virtually all of our key metrics even without the positive impact of the $5 million earned revenue adjustment, which I will describe in detail in a moment. 
First, let me update you on the impact of foreign currency on the Q1 results. As I previewed in Q4, nearly every currency in which we do business weakened significantly against the U.S. dollar when compared against both Q1 last year and last quarter. This significant change in exchange rates impacted not only our financial statements but also the statistics we provide on a quarterly basis. For instance, the year-over-year foreign exchange impact on total revenue was 850 basis points or a $36 million headwind. If you want additional currency rate detail, please see the rates, which are posted on the IR section of our website. 
As a result of the FX volatility, I'll provide both U.S. dollar and constant currency results for the quarter using the rates from Q1 last year. Some of the Q1 highlights include: year-over-year Q1 total revenue grew 22% in constant currency or 14% in U.S. dollars. In U.S. dollars, we exceeded the high end of our revenue guidance by $7 million, which includes the $5 million earned revenue adjustment. Non-GAAP operating margin was 23.6% compared to my guidance, which was around 22%. This result includes 70 basis points from improved operations and a 90 basis point positive impact from the earned revenue adjustment. Our operating cash flow of $209 million was up 27% year-over-year. 
Now let's turn to some of the details of our financial performance and outlook. On a geographic basis this quarter, 55% of bookings came from the Americas, 25% from EMEA and 20% from Asia Pacific versus a 56%, 25%, 19% split in Q1 last year. Our international sales teams performed well despite the foreign exchange headwind just discussed, and APAC experienced their normal Q1 seasonal strength. 
The Q1 sales route mix was 75% from the channel and 25% from our direct sales force versus a 67%, 33% split in Q1 last year. The higher channel percentage was due to a number of large channel deals as well as a Q1 seasonal fluctuation toward the channel. We continue to target a long-term annual goal of a 70%, 30% split. 
As I discussed on the fourth quarter call, our expectation is that the average contract duration this year will be around 21 months. For Q1, the duration was just under 20 months, which compares to 21 months in Q1 last year and 22 months in Q4. Our government business, which generally involves only 12-month contracts, was quite strong this quarter, which influenced the shorter average duration. 
Now let's shift to the income statement. As I discussed a few moments ago, the first quarter revenue was $481 million, an increase of 22% in constant currency and an increase of 14% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. The main driver of our total revenue growth was subscription revenue of $425 million, an increase of 23% in constant currency and an increase of 14% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. In U.S. dollars, this renewable revenue stream now constitutes 88% of total revenue. 
Revenue exceeded our March guidance due to the strong performance of the business, in addition to the $5 million earned revenue adjustment from our Red Hat Certified Public Cloud Providers or CCP. In prior periods, CCP subscription revenue was reported in arrears on a 1-month lag. Our ability to reasonably estimate the monthly revenue associated with these cloud providers has improved to the point where we no longer require a lag in reporting the final month of the quarter. Therefore, we are updating our treatment as of Q1 and on an ongoing basis of the earned revenue associated with these relationships. 
Since it's earned revenue and only -- it represents roughly 1% of revenue for the quarter, I'll describe the rest of the results, including the small adjustment. Looking at the subscription revenue breakout by technology, the subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings was $354 million, an increase of 19% in constant currency and an increase of 11% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue for application development related and emerging technologies offerings was $71 million, an increase of 44% in constant currency and an increase of 34% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Emerging technologies revenue is now approximately 15% of total revenue in U.S. dollars. As a reminder, our infrastructure-related offerings include mainly RHEL and RHEL-related offerings, including RHEL consumed in the Certified Cloud Providers program, while our application development and emerging technology offerings include middleware plus all of our newer cloud offerings. The training and services component of revenue was $56 million, and it was up 18% year-over-year in constant currency and 9% in U.S. dollars. 
Now I'll discuss the rest of our results on a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation, amortization expense, transaction costs related to business combinations and noncash interest expense related to convertible debt, starting with gross margin. 
Subscription gross margin was 94%, up 30 basis points year-over-year. Training and services gross margin was 30%, down approximately 230 basis points year-over-year. This result was driven by a surge in demand for Red Hat consulting services in Europe, which had to be temporarily augmented by higher cost subcontractors and the scale-out of our emerging technologies consulting practice. Despite the higher cost in consulting services, overall gross margin was approximately 87%, modestly higher than Q4 and Q1 last year. 
Now moving on to non-GAAP operating expenses. Q1 non-GAAP operating expense came in at $303 million, up 9% year-over-year. Sales and marketing grew 10%. We had several successful sales and marketing events in Q1 that increased expenses, including the OpenStack Summit in Vancouver, as Jim referenced, partner meetings and global sales kickoff events. Further, we have continued to invest in sales headcount to drive future bookings, billings and revenue. 
R&D grew 8% as we continue to hire engineers mainly for our emerging cloud technologies. We also continued to show leverage in the G&A line, which declined to 7.2% of revenue compared to 7.5% in Q1 last year. 
Q1 non-GAAP operating income was $113 million, producing an operating margin of 23.6%, including a 90 basis point positive impact from the onetime earned revenue adjustment from CCP. 
Net interest and other income was modestly lower than Q1 last year at approximately $1 million due to the cash interest expense from the convertible debt. 
Our estimated annual effective tax rate was 29% for both GAAP and non-GAAP results, and a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.44. Adjusting for the impact of the onetime CCP revenue, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share would have been $0.42, which is $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range. One should note that non-GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding excludes any dilution resulting from the convertible notes because any potential dilution is offset by our convertible note hedged transactions. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $1.97 billion. Quarterly operating cash flow of $209 million was up 27% from Q1 last year due in part to strong seasonal collections. 
FX adjusted DSO was within our target range of 59 days and down 1 day from Q1 last year. As a reminder, since day sales outstanding is traditionally a measure of receivables compared to billings, our DSO is calculated using our billings proxy, which one would calculate by adding revenue to the change in deferred revenue from the cash flow statement. 
Total deferred revenue at quarter-end was $1.44 billion, an increase of $164 million or 13% over the same quarter a year ago. Current deferred revenue grew 13%, and long-term deferred revenue grew 14% from 1 year ago in U.S. dollars. Sequentially, and as expected from a seasonality perspective, deferred revenue decreased approximately $46 million from last quarter. 
To isolate the foreign currency impact, let me break down the components of deferred revenue for you. Short-term deferred revenue, which ended Q4 at $1.095 billion, had a real decrease in Q1 of $19 million and further decreased by $10 million as a result of changes in quarter-over-quarter foreign exchange spot rates, ending Q1 at $1.066 billion. Long-term deferred revenue, which ended Q4 at $387 million, had a real decrease in Q1 of approximately $13 million and further decreased by $4 million as a result of changes in FX spot rates, ending Q1 at $370 million. The total decrease in deferred revenue without the impact of currency changes was $32 million and can be found on our statement of cash flows. 
Our rolling 4 quarters billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statements for the last 4 quarters. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, the billings proxy was $529 million, up 18% in U.S. dollars, a modest increase from a year ago quarter and continues to demonstrate the momentum in the business. On a constant currency basis, this metric would be up 22%. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance factoring in the solid performance in Q1. For purposes of this guidance, I have assumed that average FX rates for Q2 and the balance of the year are as they were recently. For example, the euro was $1.13 and JPY 123 equaled $1. Compared to FX rates used in March, this year, our rate is slightly stronger while the yen rate is weaker. And the overall blended rates of more than 20 currencies we used is little changed. 
With these assumptions in mind, we are reaffirming our full year revenue operating margin and cash flow guidance. As a reminder, the full year revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.990 billion to $2.020 billion or -- again, it's $1.990 billion to $2.020 billion, but I would say that I have high confidence in the high end of the revenue range. We are continuing to target full year non-GAAP operating margin around 23.3% as we invest for growth, particularly around our emerging products portfolio. 
Full year cash flow guidance remains at $670 million to $690 million. We are increasing our full year EPS guidance range $0.02 to $1.81 to $1.84 per share, still assuming a 29% annual effective tax rate. For Q2 specifically, I offer the following outlook: Q2 revenue is estimated to be approximately $492 million to $496 million; operating margin is estimated to be in the 23% area, including the added cost of the Red Hat Summit, which starts next week; interest and other income should be around $2 million; and non-GAAP EPS is estimated to be approximately $0.44, assuming the same 29% tax rate.
Consistent with my past practice, I do not forecast quarterly cash flow. However, I would suggest that while estimating cash flow, you review the historical quarterly variations as a possible indicator of future seasonality. 
In summary, we're off to a solid start to the fiscal year and reaching the $2 billion revenue milestone. We look forward to seeing many of you next Wednesday, June 24, at Analyst Day at the Red Hat Summit in Boston. 
And operator, I'd like to now turn it back over to you for the first question."

And so it had -- that has an impact on the billings metric. However, let me say this and sort of preempt the question, we are very proud of the billing statistics this quarter. If you look at simply the short-term billings, which means look at the change in the short-term deferred revenue, we had 24% growth on a constant currency basis, 15% growth in U.S. dollars.

It's people wanting to be in an open hybrid cloud environment so they can easily move workloads back and forth from their own data center to multiple different public clouds or in a virtual environment, on bare metal, many different formats. But I would say, all the same drivers we've been talking about over the years still exist, that maybe a new driver is the broadened portfolio of products that we have, I believe, is now an additional driver to our RHEL business. People want to be on our operating system so they can use our other technologies."

So please join us then and I hope to have an update for you at that time. In terms of OpenStack, I do think you point out some differences in kind of market. I actually look at all of those as quite a positive thing for Red Hat because we've already established ourselves as a significant vendor to most large enterprise IT. We're a core part of their production ecosystem. So we're strategic for that reason, and we are now offering more innovative products. So we have a seat at the table, and we can talk about innovation. And those 2 things together really do make us very strategic. It also kind of opens up the size of market opportunity. So when you're going in there commoditizing a market, the size of the market is the market that currently exists and you -- then price underneath that umbrella. But it's a logical market size. With our newer, more innovative products, whether it's OpenStack or OpenShift or some of our mobile technologies, the size of the market is limited by the business opportunity created by those technologies. So it gives us a much greater ability to kind of come in and talk about the value of those things rather than just the cost savings, which admittedly is a more complex sell. And so one of the reasons you've heard us talk over the last, really, 2 years about investments in sales and marketing is that they are longer sales cycle. But the ultimate results are deeper relationships that are higher level in the organization and larger contracts, which I think you've seen us continue to deliver. I think if it hadn't been for Linux and we were coming in brand-new to this, it would be really hard to have that same level of mind share with the CIO. But the costs were there, we have it. And secondly, especially, and this is particularly to OpenStack, which you asked about, the certified ecosystem of hardware providers and management tool vendors that we have kind of carry over from RHEL into OpenStack, right? So -- and which gives us just an incremental benefit as well."

Can you talk about what are those sort of a more natural growth rate? And then the second part is, given that the growth is doing quite well, why are we seeing a bit more leverage, particularly in the operating margin?"

          Thank you, Tom. And let me add my welcome to all of you joining us on today's call. The first quarter was a strong start to our fiscal 2016 with results that exceeded our guidance. Given the continued momentum of our business in Q1, we believe we are well-positioned to achieve another year of strong revenue, profitability and cash flow. Some of the highlights for the quarter include Q1 total revenue and subscription revenue both grew greater than 20% in constant currency year-over-year basis. That makes 13 straight quarters of consistent mid-teens to 20-plus percent U.S. dollar growth in total revenues and subscription revenue, and we had record operating cash flow for Q1. 
Let me provide some additional details on the largest deals and renewals that closed in the quarter. Within our top 30 largest deal metric, all 30 deals were approximately $1 million or more. We also had 2 deals that were in excess of $10 million, a record for Q1. Cross-selling was strong, with 70% of the deals including 1 or more components from our group of application development and emerging technologies offerings. 7 of these deals were standalone application development and emerging technology offerings. You will see from the details that Charlie will provide in a moment, the growing adoption of these technologies continue to result in significant revenue growth. The top vertical for the quarter was financial services, followed closely by government. On the renewal front, I'm pleased to share that once again, we renewed all of the top 25 deals that were up for renewal. The total subscription value for these top 25 deals was approximately 115% of their prior year value. One should note that these results are in U.S. dollars and reflect strong sales execution. 
With that overview, let me discuss some of our recent technology highlights. First, we released a commissioned survey of 310 IT decision-makers and professionals on their cloud initiatives. We were pleased to find that 75% of the respondents plan to use OpenStack. These respondents are looking to OpenStack to reduce time to deploy applications, lower costs and increase the agility of their IT infrastructure. 
In addition, the types of applications the IT professionals intend to deploy on OpenStack are closely split between new workloads that are optimized for cloud and existing virtualized workloads. The study also found that most of the respondents are still early in the process of deploying OpenStack, and they noted that for broader deployment, many enterprise users are looking at offerings and support from commercial OpenStack providers like Red Hat. 
We intend to be the vendor of choice for production deployments of OpenStack, and we will provide the global support, a broad ecosystem and technology expertise that we provide with our current RHEL infrastructure technology today. At the OpenStack Summit in Vancouver where Red Hat was a headline sponsor, we announced the industry's first integrated IaaS and PaaS solution based fully on open source technology. This solution known as Red Hat Cloud Suite for Applications integrates our OpenShift PaaS technology, our OpenStack technology and our CloudForms management technology. As organizations move to cloud, many are evolving their deployment efforts towards micro-services that run on containers to increase scalability, portability and efficiency. Red Hat's integrated Cloud Suite solution addresses this shift and gives users a faster way to deploy, develop and manage applications. 
Next week, we are excited to kick off Red Hat Summit in Boston, our premier event and one of the largest annual open source events in the world. Based on our record preregistrations, we are expecting a large increase to the number of CIOs, IT executives and developers to attend the event. I hope many of you will be able to join us at Summit to hear more about innovations and momentum across our portfolio, including containers, OpenStack, mobile, security, application development integration, storage and more. 
In summary, we are excited about the trends we're seeing in open source development and usage as well as our increasing strategic position as an innovator that cloud customers and partners depend on. We remain optimistic about our outlook for the remainder of the year as Charlie will detail in a moment. 
On a final note, I would like to thank all Red Hat associates around the globe for their continued commitment to our customers and partners that has translated into the strong financial results for our shareholders this quarter. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Charlie."

          Thanks, Jim. Q1 was indeed a strong start to the new fiscal year. The results included higher-than-expected growth in virtually all of our key metrics even without the positive impact of the $5 million earned revenue adjustment, which I will describe in detail in a moment. 
First, let me update you on the impact of foreign currency on the Q1 results. As I previewed in Q4, nearly every currency in which we do business weakened significantly against the U.S. dollar when compared against both Q1 last year and last quarter. The significant change in exchange rates impacted not only our financial statements but also the statistics we provide on a quarterly basis. For instance, the year-over-year foreign exchange impact on total revenue was 850 basis points or a $36 million headwind. If you want additional currency rate detail, please see the rates which are posted on the IR section of our website. 
As a result of the FX volatility, I'll provide both U.S. dollar and constant currency results for the quarter using the rates from Q1 last year. Some of the Q1 highlights include: year-over-year Q1 total revenue grew 22% in constant currency or 14% in U.S. dollars. In U.S. dollars, we exceeded the high end of our revenue guidance by $7 million, which includes the $5 million earned revenue adjustment. Non-GAAP operating margin was 23.6% compared to my guidance, which was around 22%. This result includes 70 basis points from improved operations and a 90 basis point positive impact from the earned revenue adjustment. Our operating cash flow of $209 million was up 27% year-over-year. 
Now let's turn to some of the details of our financial performance and outlook. On a geographic basis this quarter, 55% of bookings came from the Americas, 25% from EMEA and 20% from Asia Pacific versus a 56%, 25%, 19% split in Q1 last year. Our international sales teams performed well despite the foreign exchange headwind just discussed, and APAC experienced their normal Q1 seasonal strength. 
The Q1 sales route mix was 75% from the channel and 25% from our direct sales force versus a 67%, 33% split in Q1 last year. The higher channel percentage was due to a number of large channel deals as well as a Q1 seasonal fluctuation toward the channel. We continue to target a long-term annual goal of a 70%, 30% split. 
As I discussed on the fourth quarter call, our expectation is that the average contract duration this year will be around 21 months. For Q1, the duration was just under 20 months, which compares to 21 months in Q1 last year and 22 months in Q4. Our government business, which generally involves only 12-month contracts, was quite strong this quarter, which influenced the shorter average duration. 
Now let's shift to the income statement. As I discussed a few moments ago, the first quarter revenue was $481 million, an increase of 22% in constant currency and an increase of 14% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. The main driver of our total revenue growth was subscription revenue of $425 million, an increase of 23% in constant currency and an increase of 14% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. In U.S. dollars, this renewable revenue stream now constitutes 88% of total revenue. 
Revenue exceeded our March guidance due to the strong performance of the business, in addition to the $5 million earned revenue adjustment from our Red Hat Certified Public Cloud Providers or CCP. In prior periods, CCP subscription revenue was reported in arrears on a 1-month lag. Our ability to reasonably estimate the monthly revenue associated with these cloud providers has improved to the point where we no longer require a lag in reporting the final month of the quarter. Therefore, we are updating our treatment as of Q1 and on an ongoing basis of the earned revenue associated with these relationships. 
Since it's earned revenue and only -- it represents roughly 1% of revenue for the quarter, I'll describe the rest of the results, including this small adjustment. Looking at the subscription revenue breakout by technology, the subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings was $354 million, an increase of 19% in constant currency and an increase of 11% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue for application development related and emerging technologies offerings was $71 million, an increase of 44% in constant currency and an increase of 34% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Emerging technologies revenue is now approximately 15% of total revenue in U.S. dollars. As a reminder, our infrastructure-related offerings include mainly RHEL and RHEL-related offerings, including RHEL consumed in the Certified Cloud Providers program, while our application development and emerging technology offerings include middleware plus all of our newer cloud offerings. The training and services component of revenue was $56 million, and it was up 18% year-over-year in constant currency and 9% in U.S. dollars. 
Now I'll discuss the rest of our results on a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation, amortization expense, transaction costs related to business combinations and noncash interest expense related to convertible debt, starting with gross margin. 
Subscription gross margin was 94%, up 30 basis points year-over-year. Training and services gross margin was 30%, down approximately 230 basis points year-over-year. This result was driven by a surge in demand for Red Hat consulting services in Europe, which had to be temporarily augmented by higher cost subcontractors and the scale-out of our emerging technologies consulting practice. Despite the higher cost in consulting services, overall gross margin was approximately 87%, modestly higher than Q4 and Q1 last year. 
Now moving on to non-GAAP operating expenses. Q1 non-GAAP operating expense came in at $303 million, up 9% year-over-year. Sales and marketing grew 10%. We had several successful sales and marketing events in Q1 that increased expenses, including the OpenStack Summit in Vancouver, as Jim referenced, partner meetings and global sales kickoff events. Further, we have continued to invest in sales headcount to drive future bookings, billings and revenue. 
R&D grew 8% as we continue to hire engineers mainly for our emerging cloud technologies. We also continued to show leverage in the G&A line, which declined to 7.2% of revenue compared to 7.5% in Q1 last year. 
Q1 non-GAAP operating income was $113 million, producing an operating margin of 23.6%, including the 90 basis point positive impact from the onetime earned revenue adjustment from CCP. 
Net interest and other income was modestly lower than Q1 last year at approximately $1 million due to the cash interest expense from the convertible debt. 
Our estimated annual effective tax rate was 29% for both GAAP and non-GAAP results, and the non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.44. Adjusting for the impact of the onetime CCP revenue, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share would have been $0.42, which is $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range. One should note that non-GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding excludes any dilution resulting from the convertible notes because any potential dilution is offset by our convertible note hedge transactions. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $1.97 billion. Quarterly operating cash flow of $209 million was up 27% from Q1 last year due in part to strong seasonal collections. 
FX adjusted DSO was within our target range at 59 days and down 1 day from Q1 last year. As a reminder, since day sales outstanding is traditionally a measure of receivables compared to billings, our DSO is calculated using our billings proxy, which one would calculate by adding revenue to the change in deferred revenue from the cash flow statement. 
Total deferred revenue at quarter-end was $1.44 billion, an increase of $164 million or 13% over the same quarter a year ago. Current deferred revenue grew 13%, and long-term deferred revenue grew 14% from 1 year ago in U.S. dollars. Sequentially, and as expected from a seasonality perspective, deferred revenue decreased approximately $46 million from last quarter. 
To isolate the foreign currency impact, let me break down the components of deferred revenue for you. Short-term deferred revenue, which ended Q4 at $1.095 billion, had a real decrease in Q1 of $19 million and further decreased by $10 million as a result of changes in quarter-over-quarter foreign exchange spot rates, ending Q1 at $1.066 billion. Long-term deferred revenue, which ended Q4 at $387 million, had a real decrease in Q1 of approximately $13 million and further decreased by $4 million as a result of changes in FX spot rates, ending Q1 at $370 million. The total decrease in deferred revenue without the impact of currency changes was $32 million and can be found on our statement of cash flows. 
Our rolling 4 quarters billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statements for the last 4 quarters. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, the billings proxy was $529 million, up 18% in U.S. dollars, a modest increase from a year ago quarter and continues to demonstrate the momentum in the business. On a constant currency basis, this metric would be up 22%. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance factoring in the solid performance in Q1. For purposes of this guidance, I have assumed that average FX rates for Q2 and the balance of the year are as they were recently. For example, the euro was $1.13 and JPY 123 equaled $1. Compared to FX rates used in March this euro rate is slightly stronger while the yen rate is weaker. And the overall blended rates of more than 20 currencies we used is little changed. 
With these assumptions in mind, we are reaffirming our full year revenue operating margin and cash flow guidance. As a reminder, the full year revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.990 billion to $2.020 billion or -- again, it's $1.990 billion to $2.020 billion, but I would say that I have high confidence in the high end of the revenue range. We are continuing to target full year non-GAAP operating margin around 23.3% as we invest for growth, particularly around our emerging products portfolio. 
Full year cash flow guidance remains at $670 million to $690 million. We are increasing our full year EPS guidance range $0.02 to $1.81 to $1.84 per share, still assuming a 29% annual effective tax rate. For Q2 specifically, I offer the following outlook: Q2 revenue is estimated to be approximately $492 million to $496 million; operating margin is estimated to be in the 23% area, including the added cost of the Red Hat Summit, which starts next week; interest and other income should be around $2 million; and non-GAAP EPS is estimated to be approximately $0.44, assuming the same 29% tax rate.
Consistent with my past practice, I do not forecast quarterly cash flow. However, I would suggest that while estimating cash flow, you review the historical quarterly variations as a possible indicator of future seasonality. 
In summary, we're off to a solid start to the fiscal year and reaching the $2 billion revenue milestone. We look forward to seeing many of you next Wednesday, June 24, at Analyst Day at the Red Hat Summit in Boston. 
And operator, I'd like to now turn it back over to you for the first question."

Hopefully, you'll get a chance to stop by at Summit and see some of the presentations we have with Cox Auto, FICO, Intuit and Santander, all presenting around OpenStack at the Summit.

You'll see it really kind of start to ramp up as we go through this year. So again, we continue to be very, very pleased with the amount of interest we're seeing and the amount of trial and experimentation we're seeing, but in terms of really affecting bookings, we certainly had some good deals this quarter.

          Mark, I'll take the question because on the OpenStack training specifically, we invested heavily in a complete curriculum more than a year ago and rolled it out globally. As you say, the idea is to make it very pervasive like we did with the Red Hat Certified Engineer in the Linux side. The more people we have trained, the more people at our customers that are prepared to implement -- buy and implement. We've also rolled out extensive training internally, including trying to offer training to some of our own -- on the consulting side, people who have extensive RHEL experience, train them on OpenStack. So we're pushing it very hard. In terms of the specific numbers, we're now in the thousands in terms of certified Red Hat OpenStack engineers, and we hope that grows very rapidly. In terms of targets, I don't have a specific number to give you for the year other than we do believe it's very important to get more customers trained as quickly as possible. I think at the Red Hat Summit, you're actually going to -- there's various curriculums around training. There'll be more that you can learn at the Summit."

We earn it when the service is provided, and it's not the same as a subscription that's paid a full year in advance. So clearly, there is some change in the billing metric. More importantly, this quarter, we had very heavy government business. As Jim said it was the second largest vertical this quarter. And we do government business that's almost always just a 12-month contract and a 12-month billing. So it had some impact on the duration this quarter. As I said, it was less than 20 months. And so it had -- that had an impact on the billings metric. However, let me say this and sort of preempt the question, we are very proud of the billing statistics this quarter. If you look at simply the short-term billings, which means look at the change in the short-term deferred revenue, we had 24% growth on a constant currency basis, 15% growth in U.S. dollars. And that is a function of the shorter duration and the heavy contribution coming from government and probably also to your point, Keith, some coming from the public cloud."

And it's clear that probably 1/3 of the sell-side guys didn't get the currency part right, because there were very big numbers in some of those expectations that led to the consensus. I would say -- so let me just put that aside for a minute. I think as this currency play works out -- works along this year toward the end of the year, currencies will not be that much of a factor, if they stay at the current levels, because we have gone the full cycle. But for this quarter, Q1, Q2, there are a big factor, all the -- everyone needs to be thinking about to build it into your numbers. But to go back and just to talk about it. So billings are a function of the strength of the business and the duration of the contract. So this quarter, we had just under 20-month average duration. As I said, the short-term billings statistic, which would look at the change in the short-term deferred revenue, is -- perhaps a better indicator, 15% U.S. dollar growth, 24% constant currency growth. It's hard to imagine people would have expected much more than that. So -- but I do agree, the consensus number did have some kind of very wide variation of estimates in it."

That was showing a 14% shift from legacy operating systems to Linux and -- over a 5-year period of time. And we think we are going to be the primary beneficiary of that. So to me, that's one of the largest drivers. It's newer workloads. It's people wanting to be in an open hybrid cloud environment so they can easily move workloads back and forth from their own data center to multiple different public clouds or in a virtual environment, on bare metal, many different formats. But I would say, all the same drivers we've been talking about over the years still exist, that maybe a new driver is the broadened portfolio of products that we have, I believe, is now an additional driver to our RHEL business.

So solid across the board in that whole set of products that continue to grow double, up to some triple digit kind of growth numbers on some of those."

So a lot of that has to do with just how much churn they have in their own application portfolio. In terms of does that drive cross-sell, I think a lot of the strength that we're seeing in the other product category is those products are maturing. So things like our -- on the Middleware side, integration or business rules in those things. We've kind of gone from having good products to having truly great products that are still dramatically cheaper than competitors.

          A quick update on the CFO search. And secondly, when you look at OpenStack, just as a conceptual idea, back during the days when Red Hat was a small company, Linux was displacing Unix and there was a replacement cycle targeted very expensive legacy systems. So you had the bad guys to target, and you are the good guys. And you were the savior of corporate IT department. When you look at OpenStack, it feels like that same argument does not apply. And Red Hat is now a bigger company. You've got more enemies. You had a lot of friends back those days, that's actually a good thing. And it's not a replacement market, it's a market where there's a lot of new innovation.

          Yes. Sure. Well, so first off, on your first question, we do hope to have an update for you on the search at Analyst Day next week. So please join us then and I hope to have an update for you at that time. In terms of OpenStack, I do think you point out some differences in kind of market. I actually look at all of those as quite a positive thing for Red Hat because we've already established ourselves as a significant vendor to most large enterprise IT. We're a core part of their production ecosystem. So we're strategic for that reason, and we are now offering more innovative product. So we have a seat at the table, and we can talk about innovation. And those 2 things together really do make us very strategic. It also kind of opens up the size of market opportunity. So when you're going in there commoditizing a market, the size of the market is the market that currently exists and you then price underneath that umbrella. But it's a logical market size. With our newer, more innovative products, whether it's OpenStack or OpenShift or some of our mobile technologies, the size of the market is limited by the business opportunities created by those technologies. So it gives us a much greater ability to kind of come in and talk about the value of those things rather than just the cost savings, which admittedly is a more complex sell. And so one of the reasons you've heard us talk over the last, really, 2 years about investments in sales and marketing is that they are longer sales cycles. But the ultimate results are deeper relationships at a higher level in the organization and larger contracts, which I think you've seen us continue to deliver. I think if it hadn't been for Linux and we were coming in brand-new to this, it would be really hard to have that same level of mind share with the CIO. But because we're there, we have it. And secondly, especially, and this is particularly to OpenStack, which you asked about, the certified ecosystem of hardware providers and management tool vendors that we have kind of carry over from RHEL into OpenStack, right? So -- and which gives us just an incremental benefit as well."

But we are going to talk about some things in more depth next week at the Analyst Day, including some of the drivers, and so that's probably a point where maybe you can get some more detail on that."

And let me add my welcome to all of you joining us on today's call. The first quarter was a strong start to our fiscal 2016 with results that exceeded our guidance. Given the continued momentum of our business in Q1, we believe we are well",744,"Thank you, Tom. And let me add my welcome to all of you joining us on today's call. The first quarter was a strong start to our fiscal 2016 with results that exceeded our guidance. Given the continued momentum of our business in Q1, we believe we are well-positioned to achieve another year of strong revenue, profitability and cash flow. Some of the highlights for the quarter include Q1 total revenue and subscription revenue both grew greater than 20% in constant currency year-over-year basis. That makes 13 straight quarters of consistent mid-teens to 20-plus percent U.S. dollar growth in total revenues and subscription revenue, and we had record operating cash flow for Q1.
Let me provide some additional details on the largest deals and renewals that closed in the quarter. Within our top 30 largest deal metric, all 30 deals were approximately $1 million or more. We also had 2 deals that were in excess of $10 million, a record for Q1. Cross-selling was strong, with 70% of the deals including 1 or more components from our group of application development and emerging technologies offerings. 7 of these deals were standalone application development and emerging technology offerings. You will see from the details that Charlie will provide in a moment, the growing adoption of these technologies continue to result in significant revenue growth. The top vertical for the quarter was financial services, followed closely by government. On the renewal front, I'm pleased to share that once again, we renewed all of the top 25 deals that were up for renewal. The total subscription value for these top 25 deals was approximately 115% of their prior year value. One should note that these results are in U.S. dollars and reflect strong sales execution.
With that overview, let me discuss some of our recent technology highlights. First, we released a commissioned survey of 310 IT decision-makers and professionals on their cloud initiatives. We were pleased to find that 75% of the respondents plan to use OpenStack. These respondents are looking to OpenStack to reduce time to deploy applications, lower costs and increase the agility of their IT infrastructure.
In addition, the types of applications the IT professionals intend to deploy on OpenStack are closely split between new workloads that are optimized for cloud and existing virtualized workloads. The study also found that most of the respondents are still early in the process of deploying OpenStack, and they noted that for broader deployment, many enterprise users are looking at offerings and support from commercial OpenStack providers like Red Hat.
We intend to be the vendor of choice for production deployments of OpenStack, and we will provide the global support, a broad ecosystem and technology expertise that we provide with our current RHEL infrastructure technology today. At the OpenStack Summit in Vancouver where Red Hat was a headline sponsor, we announced the industry's first integrated IaaS and PaaS solution based fully on open source technology. This solution known as Red Hat Cloud Suite for Applications integrates our OpenShift PaaS technology, our OpenStack technology and our CloudForms management technology. As organizations move to cloud, many are evolving their deployment efforts towards micro-services that run on containers to increase scalability, portability and efficiency. Red Hat's integrated Cloud Suite solution addresses this shift and gives users a faster way to deploy, develop and manage applications.
Next week, we are excited to kick off Red Hat Summit in Boston, our premier event and one of the largest annual open source events in the world. Based on our record preregistrations, we are expecting a large increase to the number of CIOs, IT executives and developers to attend the event. I hope many of you will be able to join us at Summit to hear more about innovations and momentum across our portfolio, including containers, OpenStack, mobile, security, application development integration, storage and more.
In summary, we are excited about the trends we're seeing in open source development and usage as well as our increasing strategic position as an innovator that cloud customers and partners depend on. We remain optimistic about our outlook for the remainder of the year as Charlie will detail in a moment.
On a final note, I would like to thank all Red Hat associates around the globe for their continued commitment to our customers and partners that has translated into the strong financial results for our shareholders this quarter.
With that, let me turn the call over to Charlie."
33679,302758170,830359,"Red Hat, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 18, 2015",2015-06-18,"Earnings Calls","Red Hat, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim. Q1 was indeed a strong start to the new fiscal year. The results included higher-than-expected growth in virtually all of our key metrics even without the positive impact of the $5 million earned revenue adjustment, which I will describe in d",1883,"Thanks, Jim. Q1 was indeed a strong start to the new fiscal year. The results included higher-than-expected growth in virtually all of our key metrics even without the positive impact of the $5 million earned revenue adjustment, which I will describe in detail in a moment.
First, let me update you on the impact of foreign currency on the Q1 results. As I previewed in Q4, nearly every currency in which we do business weakened significantly against the U.S. dollar when compared against both Q1 last year and last quarter. The significant change in exchange rates impacted not only our financial statements but also the statistics we provide on a quarterly basis. For instance, the year-over-year foreign exchange impact on total revenue was 850 basis points or a $36 million headwind. If you want additional currency rate detail, please see the rates which are posted on the IR section of our website.
As a result of the FX volatility, I'll provide both U.S. dollar and constant currency results for the quarter using the rates from Q1 last year. Some of the Q1 highlights include: year-over-year Q1 total revenue grew 22% in constant currency or 14% in U.S. dollars. In U.S. dollars, we exceeded the high end of our revenue guidance by $7 million, which includes the $5 million earned revenue adjustment. Non-GAAP operating margin was 23.6% compared to my guidance, which was around 22%. This result includes 70 basis points from improved operations and a 90 basis point positive impact from the earned revenue adjustment. Our operating cash flow of $209 million was up 27% year-over-year.
Now let's turn to some of the details of our financial performance and outlook. On a geographic basis this quarter, 55% of bookings came from the Americas, 25% from EMEA and 20% from Asia Pacific versus a 56%, 25%, 19% split in Q1 last year. Our international sales teams performed well despite the foreign exchange headwind just discussed, and APAC experienced their normal Q1 seasonal strength.
The Q1 sales route mix was 75% from the channel and 25% from our direct sales force versus a 67%, 33% split in Q1 last year. The higher channel percentage was due to a number of large channel deals as well as a Q1 seasonal fluctuation toward the channel. We continue to target a long-term annual goal of a 70%, 30% split.
As I discussed on the fourth quarter call, our expectation is that the average contract duration this year will be around 21 months. For Q1, the duration was just under 20 months, which compares to 21 months in Q1 last year and 22 months in Q4. Our government business, which generally involves only 12-month contracts, was quite strong this quarter, which influenced the shorter average duration.
Now let's shift to the income statement. As I discussed a few moments ago, the first quarter revenue was $481 million, an increase of 22% in constant currency and an increase of 14% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. The main driver of our total revenue growth was subscription revenue of $425 million, an increase of 23% in constant currency and an increase of 14% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. In U.S. dollars, this renewable revenue stream now constitutes 88% of total revenue.
Revenue exceeded our March guidance due to the strong performance of the business, in addition to the $5 million earned revenue adjustment from our Red Hat Certified Public Cloud Providers or CCP. In prior periods, CCP subscription revenue was reported in arrears on a 1-month lag. Our ability to reasonably estimate the monthly revenue associated with these cloud providers has improved to the point where we no longer require a lag in reporting the final month of the quarter. Therefore, we are updating our treatment as of Q1 and on an ongoing basis of the earned revenue associated with these relationships.
Since it's earned revenue and only -- it represents roughly 1% of revenue for the quarter, I'll describe the rest of the results, including this small adjustment. Looking at the subscription revenue breakout by technology, the subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings was $354 million, an increase of 19% in constant currency and an increase of 11% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue for application development related and emerging technologies offerings was $71 million, an increase of 44% in constant currency and an increase of 34% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Emerging technologies revenue is now approximately 15% of total revenue in U.S. dollars. As a reminder, our infrastructure-related offerings include mainly RHEL and RHEL-related offerings, including RHEL consumed in the Certified Cloud Providers program, while our application development and emerging technology offerings include middleware plus all of our newer cloud offerings. The training and services component of revenue was $56 million, and it was up 18% year-over-year in constant currency and 9% in U.S. dollars.
Now I'll discuss the rest of our results on a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation, amortization expense, transaction costs related to business combinations and noncash interest expense related to convertible debt, starting with gross margin.
Subscription gross margin was 94%, up 30 basis points year-over-year. Training and services gross margin was 30%, down approximately 230 basis points year-over-year. This result was driven by a surge in demand for Red Hat consulting services in Europe, which had to be temporarily augmented by higher cost subcontractors and the scale-out of our emerging technologies consulting practice. Despite the higher cost in consulting services, overall gross margin was approximately 87%, modestly higher than Q4 and Q1 last year.
Now moving on to non-GAAP operating expenses. Q1 non-GAAP operating expense came in at $303 million, up 9% year-over-year. Sales and marketing grew 10%. We had several successful sales and marketing events in Q1 that increased expenses, including the OpenStack Summit in Vancouver, as Jim referenced, partner meetings and global sales kickoff events. Further, we have continued to invest in sales headcount to drive future bookings, billings and revenue.
R&D grew 8% as we continue to hire engineers mainly for our emerging cloud technologies. We also continued to show leverage in the G&A line, which declined to 7.2% of revenue compared to 7.5% in Q1 last year.
Q1 non-GAAP operating income was $113 million, producing an operating margin of 23.6%, including the 90 basis point positive impact from the onetime earned revenue adjustment from CCP.
Net interest and other income was modestly lower than Q1 last year at approximately $1 million due to the cash interest expense from the convertible debt.
Our estimated annual effective tax rate was 29% for both GAAP and non-GAAP results, and the non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.44. Adjusting for the impact of the onetime CCP revenue, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share would have been $0.42, which is $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range. One should note that non-GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding excludes any dilution resulting from the convertible notes because any potential dilution is offset by our convertible note hedge transactions.
Now let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $1.97 billion. Quarterly operating cash flow of $209 million was up 27% from Q1 last year due in part to strong seasonal collections.
FX adjusted DSO was within our target range at 59 days and down 1 day from Q1 last year. As a reminder, since day sales outstanding is traditionally a measure of receivables compared to billings, our DSO is calculated using our billings proxy, which one would calculate by adding revenue to the change in deferred revenue from the cash flow statement.
Total deferred revenue at quarter-end was $1.44 billion, an increase of $164 million or 13% over the same quarter a year ago. Current deferred revenue grew 13%, and long-term deferred revenue grew 14% from 1 year ago in U.S. dollars. Sequentially, and as expected from a seasonality perspective, deferred revenue decreased approximately $46 million from last quarter.
To isolate the foreign currency impact, let me break down the components of deferred revenue for you. Short-term deferred revenue, which ended Q4 at $1.095 billion, had a real decrease in Q1 of $19 million and further decreased by $10 million as a result of changes in quarter-over-quarter foreign exchange spot rates, ending Q1 at $1.066 billion. Long-term deferred revenue, which ended Q4 at $387 million, had a real decrease in Q1 of approximately $13 million and further decreased by $4 million as a result of changes in FX spot rates, ending Q1 at $370 million. The total decrease in deferred revenue without the impact of currency changes was $32 million and can be found on our statement of cash flows.
Our rolling 4 quarters billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statements for the last 4 quarters. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, the billings proxy was $529 million, up 18% in U.S. dollars, a modest increase from a year ago quarter and continues to demonstrate the momentum in the business. On a constant currency basis, this metric would be up 22%.
Now I'd like to turn to guidance factoring in the solid performance in Q1. For purposes of this guidance, I have assumed that average FX rates for Q2 and the balance of the year are as they were recently. For example, the euro was $1.13 and JPY 123 equaled $1. Compared to FX rates used in March this euro rate is slightly stronger while the yen rate is weaker. And the overall blended rates of more than 20 currencies we used is little changed.
With these assumptions in mind, we are reaffirming our full year revenue operating margin and cash flow guidance. As a reminder, the full year revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.990 billion to $2.020 billion or -- again, it's $1.990 billion to $2.020 billion, but I would say that I have high confidence in the high end of the revenue range. We are continuing to target full year non-GAAP operating margin around 23.3% as we invest for growth, particularly around our emerging products portfolio.
Full year cash flow guidance remains at $670 million to $690 million. We are increasing our full year EPS guidance range $0.02 to $1.81 to $1.84 per share, still assuming a 29% annual effective tax rate. For Q2 specifically, I offer the following outlook: Q2 revenue is estimated to be approximately $492 million to $496 million; operating margin is estimated to be in the 23% area, including the added cost of the Red Hat Summit, which starts next week; interest and other income should be around $2 million; and non-GAAP EPS is estimated to be approximately $0.44, assuming the same 29% tax rate.
Consistent with my past practice, I do not forecast quarterly cash flow. However, I would suggest that while estimating cash flow, you review the historical quarterly variations as a possible indicator of future seasonality.
In summary, we're off to a solid start to the fiscal year and reaching the $2 billion revenue milestone. We look forward to seeing many of you next Wednesday, June 24, at Analyst Day at the Red Hat Summit in Boston.
And operator, I'd like to now turn it back over to you for the first question."

And we do government business that's almost always just a 12-month contract and a 12-month billing. So it had some impact on the duration this quarter. As I said, it was less than 20 months. And so it had -- that had an impact on the billings metric. However, let me say this and sort of preempt the question, we are very proud of the billing statistics this quarter. If you look at simply the short-term billings, which means look at the change in the short-term deferred revenue, we had 24% growth on a constant currency basis, 15% growth in U.S. dollars. And that is a function of the shorter duration and the heavy contribution coming from government and probably also to your point, Keith, some coming from the public cloud."

I would say -- so let me just put that aside for a minute. I think as this currency play works out -- works along this year toward the end of the year, currencies will not be that much of a factor, if they stay at the current levels, because we have gone the full cycle. But for this quarter, Q1, Q2, there are a big factor, all the -- everyone needs to be thinking about to build it into your numbers. But to go back and just to talk about it. So billings are a function of the strength of the business and the duration of the contract. So this quarter, we had just under 20-month average duration. As I said, the short-term billings statistic, which would look at the change in the short-term deferred revenue, is -- perhaps a better indicator, 15% U.S. dollar growth, 24% constant currency growth. It's hard to imagine people would have expected much more than that. So -- but I do agree, the consensus number did have some kind of very wide variation of estimates in it."

So to me, that's one of the largest drivers. It's newer workloads.

We are a significant contributor, and we're all in around OpenStack. It's not an afterthought or a defense move to try to protect the core. And so, I think for a lot of companies that are looking to move away from expensive proprietary lock-in, doubling down with an expensive proprietary company, probably doesn't make the most sense there. And so we have not -- and it's early days, admittedly, but we have not seen a whole lot of interest at least from the customers I've talked to around the VMware OpenStack solution. Again, it's -- it does not behoove them to get people to use that relative to their core. And again, we actually look at offering ability to support open source projects, ecosystem, et cetera.

So please join us then and I hope to have an update for you at that time. In terms of OpenStack, I do think you point out some differences in kind of market. I actually look at all of those as quite a positive thing for Red Hat because we've already established ourselves as a significant vendor to most large enterprise IT. We're a core part of their production ecosystem. So we're strategic for that reason, and we are now offering more innovative product. So we have a seat at the table, and we can talk about innovation. And those 2 things together really do make us very strategic. It also kind of opens up the size of market opportunity. So when you're going in there commoditizing a market, the size of the market is the market that currently exists and you then price underneath that umbrella. But it's a logical market size. With our newer, more innovative products, whether it's OpenStack or OpenShift or some of our mobile technologies, the size of the market is limited by the business opportunities created by those technologies. So it gives us a much greater ability to kind of come in and talk about the value of those things rather than just the cost savings, which admittedly is a more complex sell. And so one of the reasons you've heard us talk over the last, really, 2 years about investments in sales and marketing is that they are longer sales cycles. But the ultimate results are deeper relationships at a higher level in the organization and larger contracts, which I think you've seen us continue to deliver. I think if it hadn't been for Linux and we were coming in brand-new to this, it would be really hard to have that same level of mind share with the CIO. But because we're there, we have it. And secondly, especially, and this is particularly to OpenStack, which you asked about, the certified ecosystem of hardware providers and management tool vendors that we have kind of carry over from RHEL into OpenStack, right? So -- and which gives us just an incremental benefit as well."

I also want to personally welcome Frank Calderoni to his first earnings call with Red Hat. I'm very pleased to have Frank join the Red Hat leadership team, where his capabilities and experience will add value and strength as we look to scale our business to the next level in the years ahead.
In Q2, we continued to drive and benefit from the adoption of open hybrid cloud technologies, as companies look to modernize the data center and on ramp to the cloud. We also continued to build momentum for our technologies that enable a new mode of application development, where agility, continuous deployment and enhanced customer experience are key deliverables for CIOs. With these trends and strong execution by all Red Hat Associates, I'm pleased to announce that our second quarter results exceeded our guidance, and we are increasing our outlook for the year, as Frank will detail in a few minutes.
In addition, we passed 2 milestones of note during the quarter. First, we exceeded the $0.5 billion mark in quarterly revenues for a run rate of over $2 billion annually. Second, we achieved an annual run rate of $100 million from our Certified Cloud and Service Provider program. We reached this milestone due in part to the addition of new customers and the expanded utilization of RHEL in production workloads in public clouds.
With that overview, let me discuss a few of our recent technology highlights. First, we kicked off Q2 with our premier user event, the Red Hat Summit in Boston, with record attendance, energy and excitement were high as our customers led sessions on how they use Red Hat technologies to improve their businesses agility, scale and flexibility. Customers such as Intuit, Volvo, Target, Limburg and FICO spoke about their experience implementing our cloud infrastructure technologies, such as OpenStack and Cloud Forms.
For our OpenShift PaaS solution, we had customers such as Amadeus, Cisco, Barclays, DreamWorks and Telus speak about the benefits of Red Hat technology and when it's containers for application development and easier production deployment. We believe the strength of our offerings, combined with great endorsements from innovative companies, will help us to further drive adoption of Red Hat's cloud solutions across both public, private and cloud deployments.
In conjunction with this Summit, we launched the latest version of our PaaS solution, OpenShift Enterprise 3, a container-based application platform. Our enhanced platform, which uses the doctor container format is powered by RHEL to offer a more secure, efficient and affordable way to develop, deploy and run application services. OpenShift 3 also includes Kubernetes, a container orchestration and management engine developed with Google. Docker, Kubernetes, Linux and OpenShift Origin, which are each part of OpenShift 3 are all open source projects, where Red Hat is leading -- where Red Hat is a leading contributor. Our leadership in the upstream community enables us to bring these technologies together to make it easier for enterprises to consume open-source innovation.
Also, at the Summit, we continued to expand our Linux container offerings with Red Hat Atomic enterprise platform, utilizing the same core enabling technology is OpenShift 3, including Docker and Kubernetes, Atomic enterprise provides a platform for executing multi-container applications. It is designed to help organizations orchestrate across traditional and cloud-native applications while scaling to meet changing business demands.
At Summit, we also announced an exciting new alliance with Samsung Electronics that aims to deliver the next generation of mobile solutions for the enterprise. The alliance draws on the breadth of Samsung's mobile device portfolio used with the depth of Red Hat's open-source middleware, mobile and cloud technologies to deliver mobile solutions that facilitate rapid development and integration of enterprise applications for organizations moving towards a mobile-first strategy. We are making great progress in mobile and have been recently named by Forrester Research in The Forrester Wave mobile infrastructure services report. In the report, Red Hat received the highest cumulative score for vendor strategy based on strength of vision, customer satisfaction, speed to market and partner alliances.
More recently, in August, we launched RHEL OpenStack platform 7 based on the kilo [ph] release. Version 7 includes several new features aimed at accelerating the adoption of OpenStack, including simplified operational management and resource provisioning, high availability, greater security control and network flexibility. We have deployed this new version of OpenStack internally and at several large global customers with enthusiastic reviews.
In summary, we executed well in the first half of 2016, and I want to thank all Red Hat's associates around the globe for their focus on achieving these results. As we look ahead, I believe we are well positioned for the second half of the year as we continue to execute on behalf of our customers to deliver innovation and solutions to solve their challenges.
With that, let me turn the call over to Frank."

It's a great time to be at Red Hat, and I'm truly very excited to be part of the team. One of the top priorities that remain is our continued focus on creating value for shareholders, our customers, employees as well as our partners. Our company's growth initiatives, along with our expanding portfolio of solution, positions us very well within the marketplace. I look forward to working with the investors and the analysts who follow us.
I'm pleased to share that Q2 was another strong quarter with results that exceeded our guidance. Based on the strength of our Q2 and a positive view on the remainder of the year, we are raising our full year outlook as I will detail in a moment. First, I will focus my remarks on the financial highlights of our Q2 performance, which is a practice I will do my best to follow so that we can maximize the amount of time in our call dedicated to answering your questions. For a more detailed view of our results and metrics, please refer to our press release, the presentation materials and the transcript of our prepared remarks that are available in the Investor Relations section at redhat.com.
Here are some of the Q2 financial highlights. Total revenue for the quarter was $504 million, which grew 21% on a year-over-year basis in constant currency, where 13% in U.S. dollars. Taking into account the fluctuation of foreign exchange rates, total revenue would have been $37 million or 820 basis points higher using the rates from Q2 of last year. As a result of the FX volatility, I will provide both U.S. dollar and constant currency results for the quarter using the rates from Q2 last year where it's appropriate. In U.S. dollars, we exceeded the high end of our revenue guidance by $8 million. Our improved revenue performance this quarter resulted from better-than-expected execution, improved linearity and upsides in our public cloud business and our customer education and compliance program. The main driver of our total revenue growth was subscription revenue of $442 million, an increase of 21% in constant currency and 13% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. In USD, this renewable revenue stream now constitutes 88% of total revenue, which provides us with a high level of future revenue visibility and predictability.
Breaking out the subscription revenue by technology. The subscription revenue for our infrastructure-related offerings was $363 million, an increase of 17% in constant currency and 9% [ph] year-over-year in USD. Subscription revenue for application development-related and emerging technologies offerings was $79 million, an increase of 48% in constant currency and 37% year-over-year in USD. Application development-related and emerging technologies revenue grew to approximately 16% of total revenue in USD, and that's up from 13% from a year ago.
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income grew 13% and non-GAAP operating margin was 24.4%. This non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 140 basis points above our guidance due to the strong revenue growth. We had record hiring of approximately 400 associates this quarter, which puts us on track to add approximately 1,200 associates this year, which has been our investment goal. We added approximately 600 associates year-to-date.
Using our estimated annual effective tax rate of 29%, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.47, and that's $0.03 above our guidance. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2 billion, and this balance was after returning $70 million to shareholders after repurchasing approximately 895,000 shares of Red Hat stock. We had approximately $430 million remaining on the current share repurchase authorization at the end of the quarter.
Total deferred revenue at quarter-end was $1.4 billion, an increase of $162 million or 13% over the same quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, the total deferred revenue would have been up 20%. The total change in deferred revenue from a cash flow statement that neutralizes most of the impact of the currency changes was a decline of $25 million. Operating cash flow of $120 million for the quarter was up 12% year-over-year, and year-to-date operating cash flow was up 21%.
Our rolling 4 quarter's billing proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, the billings proxy was $539 million, up 16% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, this metric would have been up 22%, a modest increase from a year-ago quarter and continues to demonstrate the momentum that we have in our business. This metric also reflects the higher bookings duration that we had last year and the 20-month average duration that we've experienced through the first half of this year. As we look ahead, we would expect the bookings duration for the second half of fiscal 2016 to be closer to the historic 21-month level.
Now let's look at some of the metrics of the business momentum and some of the large deals in the quarter. On a geographic basis, this quarter's 60% of bookings came from the Americas, 22% from EMEA and 18% from Asia Pacific, versus a 59%, 24%, 17% split in Q2 of last year. We continue to deliver globally despite the FX headwind.
The Q2 sales route-to-market mix was 75% from the channel and 25% from the direct sales force, and this is 69-31 split in Q2 of last year. Consistent with Q2 of last year, we closed a large number of channel deals, and we're making progress toward our annual goal of a 70-30s split.
Now let me give you some additional details on the largest deals and our renewals that closed in the quarter. Within our top largest -- 30 largest deals metric, all 30 were approximately $1 million and more. We had 4 deals that were in excess of $5 million, and we had 1 deal that was well over $10 million. Cross-selling was strong with 65% of the deals including one or more components from our group of application development and emerging technologies offering. We expect the growing adoption of these technologies like middleware, the RHEL OpenStack platform, OpenShift cloud management and storage, to continue to drive revenue growth.  The top vertical for the quarter was financial, followed closely by mainstream customers in health care, transportation and retail verticals.
On our renewal business, I'm pleased to share that once again, we renewed all of the top 25 deals that were up for renewal. The total subscription value of these top 25 renewal was approximately 115% of the prior value.
Now I would like to turn to guidance, which will factor in the solid performance we had in the first half of the fiscal year, and our outlook assumes similar business conditions and foreign exchange rates as of September 18, 2015, which included a dollar to euro of $1.13[ph] and a yen to dollar of $1.21[ph]. With these assumptions, we are raising our full year revenue guidance to $2.034 billion to $2.044 billion, up approximately 14% in USD or approximately 20% in constant currency. We are modestly increasing the operating margin to a target of 23.6%, and we're raising the cash flow to $690 million to $705 million. We're also increasing our target for full year non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.85 to $1.87 per share, assuming a 29% annual effective tax rate and a $1 million per quarter forecast for other income.
Our guidance also reflects our focused investment in our application development and emerging technologies that we believe will further drive future growth.
For Q3, specifically, I offer the following outlook. We expect revenue to be in the range of $519 million to $523 million, which is up 15% in USD or at the high end of the range of approximately 20% in constant currency; non-GAAP operating income of approximately 23%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.47.
Consistent with prior practices at Red Hat, I will not forecast quarterly cash flow. However, I would suggest that when estimating cash flow, you use the AR balance as your starting point.
In summary, we are pleased with the very solid performance in the first half of the fiscal year. And with our broad portfolio of solutions and strong execution, we believe we will become the first open-source company to exceed $2 billion in annual revenue.

We -- it does a really good job of kind of identifying hardware and lighting it up. Of course, that means there's a lot of work to do around certifying that hardware, making sure it lights up appropriately, et cetera, et cetera. So our customers who have been using it have generally been thrilled. We've had some specific hardware platforms a little bit challenged also. We've been kind of working through those components. And obviously, that eats up some professional services resources. But in general, it's allowed us to have a couple of big wins. One of the very large global telcos chose RHEL OSP, a very, very large financial services institution again chose RHEL OSP both this quarter. I think a lot of it was due to the progress that we've made. Mark, there are really 2 pieces around, I think, getting it truly in mainstream, running production applications. One is continuing to make it simpler. I think we made a big step forward and we'll continue to do that. The other is some more high-availability features, right? So one of the issues or features with OpenStack is its scalability. But it's basically kind of assuming applications that are stateless. And so continue to build more high-availability features and to allow it to run traditional application is something we've been talking a lot to customers about. So I think there's a general belief that OpenStack is going to be a kind of low-cost platform of choice with customers going forward. But there's a sense that ""Hey, Red Hat, you need to help us take some of our existing applications and migrate them onto OpenStack."" So we're actively working with some customers on that. So hard to say exactly when these technologies go, but we're starting to see a lot more production applications start to move. Again, these are early adopters doing this. So this is quite mainstream, but really pleased with the progress we're seeing there."

And the government business tends to be a 12-month business. So those 2 elements have a higher percentage of mix that's going to kind of put a little bit of pressure on the contract -- on the average contract length. So not necessarily anything to be concerned about, it's just a matter of the mix of the business. But as Jim mentioned, what we expect is in the back half of the year, to see it more towards the historic average of 21 months."

So those are generally net new workloads and net new customers. One of the very, very large public cloud providers collect that data would they ask you though, ""Are you a Red Hat customer?"" and the vast majority are -- is new to us. We see some customers taking advantage, albeit run RHEL on public clouds. But recognize this is more and more since we settling out as I talked to our large customers, for test or for applications that are bearing a lot workloads important. Public cloud has a lot of benefit. But once workload has been up and running, it is kind of -- reach kind of a stable, predictable amounts. A lot of our large customers prefer to run those in their data centers. So we're not seeing a lot of people saying, ""Hey, I'm taking an existing application and moving it into the cloud."" It's more new workloads are being built to run either permanently or often temporarily in the cloud. And so they settle down the performance characteristics intention is moving it back in. So it's hard to because people are thinking applications essentially running across the target directly answer that question. So that's one of the piece of benefits that we provide, right?

One is I guess typically OpenStack and then we have to explain why OpenStack so that decision's made first. But I want to be clear, it's rarely a single decision. Virtually, anyone is going to have a Microsoft environment in their infrastructure. And so they're obviously thinking about whether that's going to be on a Microsoft infrastructure or on VMware and -- or et cetera, et cetera. Most companies want to then have a separate infrastructure -- so 2 different infrastructures, right? So you want to proprietary and an open say can get into how big those things are going to be. But there's always going to be a Microsoft footprint there. I think that generally benefit us because frankly, a lot of customers will say, you Microsoft footprint so I want to have my second one be VMware because there's -- that gives me 2 propietary ones necessarily help in the long run. So I do think we're benefiting from the fact that the alternative to Microsoft I think more and more people are thinking open if they're think about their next-generation. And so we obviously do well there. And then it comes down to really with, especially the early adopters, we do get a lot of buy Red Hat OpenStack now or later. The kind of CIOs will be the Red Hat of OpenStack. And the question is do they want to consume something closer to the word are they ready to stabilize now? So as the big telco I mentioned started off what we call it the snowflakes. So they started off working with a primarily professional services firm, doing work on OpenStack where they've added in some of their own features. After a couple of RHEVs realized that, that was going to be hard to maintain long term and came to us. So I think we have a good value story once it's OpenStack. And there's a natural sense that OpenStack is going to be at least 1 of the 2 platforms that most enterprises are looking at deploying."

So I know a lot of it has to do with and I just kind of looking at the last couple of quarters about some of let's say, the expectation is. So upfront, I just want to mention as everyone knows, we do not provide any forecast on billings because it's difficult to kind of forecast. And one of the things I looked at over the last week or so, if you look at some of the range of what the estimates were, it's about a $30-plus million range between the high and the low. But if we've done a lot of analysis on the billing, at least I have, in the last few weeks. And looking at them, I'm really proud of the stats that we have this quarter. One of the things from a billings perspective, just to kind of go through it so billings proxy as we look at it will be the revenue and the change in deferred. So for the quarter, we had about $479 million. So that's up 9% in dollars and 17% in constant currency. And that's fairly consistent when you look at the performance we had in the last Q2, right, from a standpoint of a modest increase year-on-year. I mentioned earlier about the contract duration for the first half. So it was about 20 months. So slightly below the historic level of the 21 months that we talked about that and the strength of that was caused that was more related to the public cloud and the government business. And we're expecting it to kind of move back into the 21 months. But if you look underneath the billings, the short-term billings, which we think is probably a better gauge when you take into consideration the points I mentioned about the contract duration, which looked at over 12-month period. In Q2, the billings were about $484 million, and that was up about 13% in dollars and 21% in constant currency. And then another view, and I know it's bring a lot of numbers out there, but this is part of the analysis I looked at. So looking at short-term billings, but also looking at what we think is probably a better trend view of the business when you're looking at billings is to look at a rolling average 4-quarter billings proxy, which is revenue is the change in deferred on a cash flow statement over the 4 quarters. And the importance of this is that it deals with the seasonality of our business, especially when you kind of look at the back half of the year. It also takes in consideration some of the variations that we have in currency. And if you look at it as of the end of Q2, that number was 5 39. That was up 16% year-on-year in dollars and it was up 22% year-on-year in constant currency. So -- and if I look at what that rolling average was for the last 4, 5 quarters, it was about 20% or higher with the current number being at 22% at the highest number. So again, I think it's a good indication of how it's trending along with what we're seeing from a revenue standpoint. So again, as I said, we're pretty proud of how that's working out."

We build a certification kind of infrastructure. Everything will work with a defined light, which as OpenStack continues to mature becomes even more valuable. And so I think has done some good work for customers, but often, that is starting off with a code base but then tailoring it modifying it to a customer's needs. And that feels good in the short run. But again, RHEV, OpenStack and you have a whole patch set. You're trying to RHEV because it's not pushed upstream customer strength you get frustrated. And so we have seen migrations customers have said, ""Oh no, I'm stuck on an old one or I got to migrate this patch set. Maybe it is time to standardize in a company that draws everything upstream first, which is obviously what we've been talking about for a long time. And so I do think that's starting to -- even customers who were initially skeptical of that, were not kind of going through that are starting to come back to us. So I feel good about the competition and the way that's going. I think you mentioned that only 3 companies we see nothing Canonical we rarely I get to see a case where we competed with them. I think it is and HP and again, HP must be in more of their kind of own, kind of heavily dominant HP hardware customers because we certainly don't see them playing in places where there are other hardware platforms, which is the majority of what I think large customers out there. So again, as any technology matures more, our value proposition only gets stronger. So again, I think we're starting to see some things that, frankly, we had lost a year or 2 ago, starting to come back our way."

One is we still have a significant amount of share take from established vendors. So if you look, especially across the JBoss portfolio, we like to talk about the mobile and some of the newer technologies and they're certainly drivers. But to WebLogic I love into the JBoss portfolio. A lot of these kind of older, very expensive middleware technologies to JBoss, which is why I think of it is a pure commoditization. Our integration technologies are BPM technologies, all of those are growing quite nicely. I think a lot of that's been driven, not necessarily by kind of new cloud type workloads. Those are just vendor management. We can come in with equivalent solutions that dramatically lower cost. And so that's driving so there's that still in the same way Linux to Linux and Windows to Linux continues to happen. There's a lot happening, especially in the middleware portfolio as customers are still starting to see Red Hat as long-term enterprise partner, they're starting to move the middleware stacks that way. Now that obviously the second pillar is as enterprises are building new infrastructure and building applications for that next-generation scale infrastructure, we win a chunk there. So those are the 2 main themes. We don't break up the numbers around it. But I know we talk a lot on the cloud theme, but I don't want to forget the theme of we're continuing to take significant share in the traditional data center, which is still the vast majority of the dollars that are spent on IT broadly. And it also well in down markets, we talk about value, value, value. In that markets, we talk about innovation. And we're credible at both in those stories."

Let me start off saying we just had our strategic advisory board the also going to see a lot of customers' containers and thinking about how to consume and manage containers is the single biggest topic. It comes up among what I think of as leading -- technology leading. So financial services, technology and telco customers, without a doubt. More than frankly, I even hear about OpenStack. And it so certainly far beyond web companies. One kind of public example is Amadeus is building their kind of new platform for their new workloads around OpenShift 3. And their desire is for all their new workloads to be running Doc raising containers on OpenShift V3. So it is something -- and what you actually hear even the infrastructure people at financial services institutions. I was talking to one week ago, 1.5 weeks ago and he was basically saying I don't have a choice because my developers are delivering containers. And I'm going to have to be able to manage them and so Red Hat run as fast as you can because it's not just about taking the container as you said it's about security, it's about management all the telemetry you need to understand performance bottlenecks and all of that kind of work that's still is being done. And so the Atomic platform that we talked about is something a lot of customers are interested in. Literally, every industry all walks again not because the infrastructure people necessarily want it but because the developers are picking it up because it's so much more productive for developers. So the interesting thing about containers, I want to emphasize this over and over is you can build a story around efficiency of running your infrastructure. That is not what's driving this. Developer efficiency is what is driving this. And literally, I had a CIO tell me I've lost control really. Developers are going to do this. We have to make sure that we can consume these. On your security point, there are several issues around security. The point you made about what's in the container is critically important. And virtualization does nothing to help you with that, right? You got to recognize that what's in the container is basically the user space side of the operating system. We did an analysis where we are right up Hello World app in 4 different languages and looked back what packages would need to be subsumed into each of those would be like Java, node so JavaScript. We did PHP. And we've looked back over the last year, how many security updates had been made that would affect those containers. And depending on the language, it varies from 30 to 50 in the last year. So understanding what's in the container and understanding how you can push updates into that is critical. Obviously, it's an operating system vendor. Our ability to do that, we believe, is far superior to anyone else because we obviously track these packages and no kind of what, when and how security updates need to be pushed. So we actually think that's -- as a commercial vendor, that is a very, very good thing for us because that allows us to kind of tell a security story. Now you are right. There's a separate set of security, which does come around bare metal versus virtualize, which is around certain name spaces, ability to get to certain I/O, filesystems and making sure those are separate. We -- there's 2 parallels paths there. One is to run it virtualize because we've a lot of that virtualization and certainly, many of our customers are running OpenShift on OpenStack as a way to resolve that or you can run it on VMware as well. At the same time, obviously, the Linux community driving towards bare metal solutions to that same set of problems as we continue to push that forward. If you look at RHEL 7 2[ph], there are several kind of steps forward in the technology around security around containers. So yes, security's an issue. To some extent, that's a good thing for Red Hat in that allows us to shine with what we do, both in terms of manageability and security updating, et cetera, et cetera. Sorry, that's a long answer, but it's a subtle but important point."

I don't think we're skewed, otherwise, relative to their share but there is one cloud provider that's kind of well ahead of the others that I think you all know. Beyond that, there are a few, what I'll say a collection of 7 or 8 cloud providers, I would say, are more enterprise-focused. You can kind of imagine kind of who a couple of those are, who target these are enterprise names that target enterprise. Those we have much larger than, I would say, kind of our normal share.

I also want to personally welcome Frank Calderoni to his first earnings call with Red Hat. I'm very pleased to have Frank join the Red Hat leadership team, where his capabilities and experience will add value and strength as we look to scale our business to the next level in the years ahead.
In Q2, we continued to drive and benefit from the adoption of open hybrid cloud technologies, as companies look to modernize the data center and on ramp to the cloud. We also continued to build momentum for our technologies that enable a new mode of application development, where agility, continuous deployment and enhanced customer experience are key deliverables for CIOs. With these trends and strong execution by all Red Hat associates, I'm pleased to announce that our second quarter results exceeded our guidance, and we are increasing our outlook for the year, as Frank will detail in a few minutes.
In addition, we passed 2 milestones of note during the quarter. First, we exceeded the $0.5 billion mark in quarterly revenues for a run rate of over $2 billion annually. Second, we achieved an annual run rate of $100 million from our Certified Cloud and Service Provider program. We reached this milestone due in part to the addition of new customers and the expanded utilization of RHEL in production workloads in public clouds.
With that overview, let me discuss a few of our recent technology highlights. First, we kicked off Q2 with our premier user event, the Red Hat Summit in Boston, with record attendance, energy and excitement were high as our customers led sessions on how they use Red Hat technologies to improve their businesses' agility, scale and flexibility. Customers such as Intuit, Volvo, Target, Bloomberg and FICO spoke about their experience implementing our cloud infrastructure technologies, such as OpenStack and CloudForms.
For our OpenShift PaaS solution, we had customers such as Amadeus, Cisco, Barclays, DreamWorks and Telus speak about the benefits of Red Hat technology and Linux containers for application development and easier production deployment. We believe the strength of our offerings, combined with great endorsements from innovative companies, will help us to further drive adoption of Red Hat's cloud solutions across both public, private and cloud deployments.
In conjunction with the Summit, we launched the latest version of our PaaS solution, OpenShift Enterprise 3, a container-based application platform. Our enhanced platform, which uses the Docker container format is powered by RHEL to offer a more secure, efficient and portable way to develop, deploy and run application services. OpenShift 3 also includes Kubernetes, a container orchestration and management engine developed with Google. Docker, Kubernetes, Linux and OpenShift Origin, which are each part of OpenShift 3 are all open source projects, where Red Hat is leading -- where Red Hat is a leading contributor. Our leadership in the upstream community enables us to bring these technologies together to make it easier for enterprises to consume open source innovation.
Also, at the Summit, we continued to expand our Linux container offerings with Red Hat Atomic enterprise platform, utilizing the same core-enabling technologies as OpenShift 3, including Docker and Kubernetes, Atomic Enterprise provides a platform for executing multi-container applications. It is designed to help organizations orchestrate across traditional and cloud-native applications while scaling to meet changing business demands.
At Summit, we also announced an exciting new alliance with Samsung Electronics that aims to deliver the next generation of mobile solutions for the enterprise. The alliance draws on the breadth of Samsung's mobile device portfolio used with the depth of Red Hat's open source middleware, mobile and cloud technologies to deliver mobile solutions that facilitate rapid development and integration of enterprise applications for organizations moving towards a mobile-first strategy. We are making great progress in mobile and have been recently named by Forrester Research in ""The Forrester Wave Mobile Infrastructure Services"" report. In the report, Red Hat received the highest cumulative score for vendor strategy based on strength of vision, customer satisfaction, speed to market and partner alliances.
More recently, in August, we launched RHEL OpenStack platform 7 based on the Kilo release. Version 7 includes several new features aimed at accelerating the adoption of OpenStack, including simplified operational management and resource provisioning, high availability, greater security control and network flexibility. We have deployed this new version of OpenStack internally and at several large global customers with enthusiastic reviews.
In summary, we executed well in the first half of 2016, and I want to thank all Red Hat's associates around the globe for their focus on achieving these results. As we look ahead, I believe we are well positioned for the second half of the year as we continue to execute on behalf of our customers to deliver innovation and solutions to solve their challenges.
With that, let me turn the call over to Frank."

Our company's growth initiatives, along with our expanding portfolio of solution, positions us very well within the marketplace. I look forward to working with the investors and the analysts who follow us.
I'm pleased to share that Q2 was another strong quarter with results that exceeded our guidance. Based on the strength of our Q2 and a positive view on the remainder of the year, we are raising our full year outlook as I will detail in a moment. 
First, I will focus my remarks on the financial highlights of our Q2 performance, which is a practice I will do my best to follow so that we can maximize the amount of time in our call dedicated to answering your questions. For a more detailed view of our results and metrics, please refer to our press release, the presentation materials and the transcript of our prepared remarks that are available in the Investor Relations section of redhat.com.
Here are some of the Q2 financial highlights. Total revenue for the quarter was $504 million, which grew 21% on a year-over-year basis in constant currency, or 13% in U.S. dollars. Taking into account the fluctuation of foreign exchange rates, total revenue would have been $37 million or 820 basis points higher using the rates from Q2 of last year. As a result of the FX volatility, I will provide both U.S. dollar and constant currency results for the quarter using the rates from Q2 last year where it's appropriate. In U.S. dollars, we exceeded the high end of our revenue guidance by $8 million. Our improved revenue performance this quarter resulted from better-than-expected execution, improved linearity and upsides in our public cloud business and our customer education and compliance program. 
The main driver of our total revenue growth was subscription revenue of $442 million, an increase of 21% in constant currency and 13% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. In USD, this renewable revenue stream now constitutes 88% of total revenue, which provides us with a high level of future revenue visibility and predictability.
Breaking out the subscription revenue by technology. The subscription revenue for our infrastructure-related offerings was $363 million, an increase of 17% in constant currency and 9% year-over-year in USD. Subscription revenue for application development-related and emerging technologies offerings was $79 million, an increase of 48% in constant currency and 37% year-over-year in USD. Application development-related and emerging technologies revenue grew to approximately 16% of total revenue in USD, and that's up from 13% from a year ago.
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income grew 13% and non-GAAP operating margin was 24.4%. This non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 140 basis points above our guidance due to the strong revenue growth. We had record hiring of approximately 400 associates this quarter, which puts us on track to add approximately 1,200 associates this year, which has been our investment goal. We added approximately 600 associates year-to-date.
Using our estimated annual effective tax rate of 29%, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.47, and that's $0.03 above our guidance. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2 billion, and this balance was after returning $70 million to shareholders after repurchasing approximately 895,000 shares of Red Hat stock. We had approximately $430 million remaining on the current share repurchase authorization at the end of the quarter.
Total deferred revenue at quarter end was $1.4 billion, an increase of $162 million or 13% over the same quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, the total deferred revenue would have been up 20%. The total change in deferred revenue from a cash flow statement that neutralizes most of the impact of the currency changes was a decline of $25 million. Operating cash flow of $120 million for the quarter was up 12% year-over-year, and year-to-date operating cash flow was up 21%.
Our rolling 4 quarter's billing proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, the billings proxy was $539 million, up 16% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, this metric would have been up 22%, a modest increase from a year-ago quarter and continues to demonstrate the momentum that we have in our business. This metric also reflects the higher bookings duration that we had last year and the 20-month average duration that we've experienced through the first half of this year. As we look ahead, we would expect the bookings duration for the second half of fiscal 2016 to be closer to the historic 21-month level.
Now let's look at some of the metrics of the business momentum and some of the large deals in the quarter. On a geographic basis, this quarter's 60% of bookings came from the Americas, 22% from EMEA and 18% from Asia Pacific, versus a 59%, 24%, 17% split in Q2 of last year. We continue to deliver globally despite the FX headwind.
The Q2 sales route-to-market mix was 75% from the channel and 25% from the direct sales force, and this is versus 69%, 31% split in Q2 of last year. Consistent with Q2 of last year, we closed a large number of channel deals, and we're making progress toward our annual goal of a 70%, 30% split.
Now let me give you some additional details on the largest deals and our renewals that closed in the quarter. Within our top largest -- 30 largest deals metric, all 30 were approximately $1 million or more. We had 4 deals that were in excess of $5 million, and we had 1 deal that was well over $10 million. 
Cross-selling was strong with 65% of the deals including one or more components from our group of application development and emerging technologies offering. We expect the growing adoption of these technologies like Middleware, the RHEL OpenStack platform, OpenShift, cloud management and storage, to continue to drive revenue growth. The top vertical for the quarter was financial, followed closely by mainstream customers in health care, transportation and retail verticals.
On our renewal business, I'm pleased to share that once again, we renewed all of the top 25 deals that were up for renewal. The total subscription value of these top 25 renewal was approximately 115% of the prior value.
Now I would like to turn to guidance, which will factor in the solid performance we had in the first half of the fiscal year, and our outlook assumes similar business conditions and foreign exchange rates as of September 18, 2015, which included a dollar to euro of 1.13 and a yen to dollar of 121. 
With these assumptions, we are raising our full year revenue guidance to $2.034 billion to $2.044 billion, up approximately 14% in USD or approximately 20% in constant currency. We are modestly increasing the operating margin to a target of 23.6%, and we're raising the cash flow to $690 million to $705 million. We're also increasing our target for full year non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.85 to $1.87 per share, assuming a 29% annual effective tax rate and a $1 million per quarter forecast for other income.
Our guidance also reflects our focused investment in our application development and emerging technologies that we believe will further drive future growth.
For Q3, specifically, I offer the following outlook. We expect revenue to be in the range of $519 million to $523 million, which is up 15% in USD or at the high end of the range of approximately 20% in constant currency; non-GAAP operating income of approximately 23%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.47.
Consistent with prior practices at Red Hat, I will not forecast quarterly cash flow. However, I would suggest that while estimating cash flow, you use the AR balance as your starting point.
In summary, we are pleased with the very solid performance in the first half of the fiscal year. And with our broad portfolio of solutions and strong execution, we believe we will become the first open source company to exceed $2 billion in annual revenue.

We -- it does a really good job of kind of identifying hardware and lighting it up. Of course, that means there's a lot of work to do around certifying that hardware, making sure it lights up appropriately, et cetera, et cetera. So our customers who have been using it have generally been thrilled. We've had some specific-hardware platforms we've been a little challenged on, so we've been kind of working through those components. And obviously, that eats up some professional services resources. But in general, it's allowed us to have a couple of big wins. One of the very large global telcos chose RHEL OSP, a very, very large financial services institution again chose RHEL OSP both this quarter. I think a lot of it was due to the progress that we've made. Mark, there are really 2 pieces around, I think, getting it truly in mainstream, running production applications. One is continuing to make it simpler. And I think we made a big step forward and we'll continue to do that. The other is some more high-availability features, right? So one of the issues or features with OpenStack is its scalability. But it's basically kind of assuming applications that are stateless. And so continue to build more high-availability features and to allow it to run traditional application is something we've been talking a lot to customers about. So I think there's a general belief that OpenStack is going to be a kind of low-cost platform of choice with customers going forward. But there's a sense that ""Hey, Red Hat, you need to help us take some of our existing applications and migrate them onto OpenStack."" So we're actively working with some customers on that. So hard to say exactly when these SCS [ph] technologies go, but we're starting to see a lot more production applications start to move. Again, these are early adopters doing this. So this is a quite mainstream, but really pleased with the progress we're seeing there."

We see some customers taking advantage, albeit run RHEL on public clouds. But recognize this is more and more seems to be settling out, as I talked to our large customers, for dev and test or for applications that are bearing a lot workloads where elasticity is important. Public cloud has a lot of benefit. But once workload has been up and running, and it is kind of -- it reach kind of a stable, predictable amount. A lot of our large customers or data centers prefer to run those in their data centers. So we're not seeing a lot of people saying, ""Hey, I'm taking an existing application and moving it into the cloud."" It's more new workloads are being built to run either permanently or often temporarily in the cloud. And so they settle down the performance characteristics and the intention is moving it back in. So it's hard to -- because people are thinking applications essentially running across, it's hard to directly answer that question. So that's one of the piece of benefits that we provide, right?

One is, I think, it's typically OpenStack and then we have to explain why OpenStack, so that decision is made first. But I want to be clear, it's rarely a single decision. Virtually, anyone is going to have a Microsoft environment in their infrastructure. And so they're obviously thinking about whether that's going to be on a Microsoft infrastructure or on VMware and -- or [indiscernible], et cetera, et cetera. Most companies want to then have a separate infrastructure -- so 2 different infrastructures, right? So you want to have proprietary and an open, so you can get into how big those things are going to be. But there's always going to be a Microsoft footprint there. I think that generally benefit us because, frankly, a lot of fed-up [ph] customers will say, I'm going to have a Microsoft footprint, so I want to have my second one be VMware because there's -- that gives me 2 different proprietary ones and does that necessarily help me in the long run. So I do think we're benefiting from the fact that the alternative to Microsoft, I think, more and more people are thinking open if they're think about their next generation. And so we -- and we obviously do well there. And then it comes down to really with, especially the early adopters, we do get a lot of am I going to buy Red Hat OpenStack now or later? I think most is kind of CSCs will be the Red Hat of OpenStack. And the question is do they want to consume something closer to the trunk or are they ready to stabilize now? So the big telco I mentioned started off what we call it a snowflakes. So they started off working with a primarily professional services firm, doing work on OpenStack where they've added in some of their own features. After a couple of RHEVs realized that, that was going to be hard to maintain long term and came to us. So I think again, we have a good value story once it's OpenStack. And there's a natural sense that OpenStack is going to be at least 1 of the 2 platforms that most enterprises are looking at deploying."

So I know a lot of it has to do with -- and I'm just kind of looking at the last couple of quarters, about some of what, let's say, the expectation is. So upfront, I just want to mention as everyone knows, we do not provide any forecast on billings because it's difficult to kind of forecast. And one of the things I looked at over the last week or so, if you look at some of the range of what the estimates were, it's about a $30-plus million range between the high and the low. But if we've -- and we've done a lot of analysis on the billings, at least I have, in the last few weeks. And looking at them, I'm really pretty proud of the stats that we have this quarter. One of the things from a billings perspective, just to kind of go through it, so billings proxy, as we look at it, will be the revenue and the change in deferred. So for the quarter, we had about $479 million. So that's up 9% in dollars and 17% in constant currency. And that's fairly consistent when you look at the performance we had in the last Q2, right, from the standpoint of a modest increase year-on-year. I mentioned earlier about the contract duration for the first half. So it was about 20 months. So slightly below the historic level of the 21 months, and we talked about that, and the strength of that was -- what caused that was more related to the public cloud and the government business. And we're expecting it to kind of move back into the 21 months. But if you look underneath the billings, the short-term billings, which we think is probably a better gauge when you take into consideration the points I mentioned about the contract duration, which looked at it over a 12-month period, in Q2, the billings were about $484 million. And that was up about 13% in dollars and 21% in constant currency. And then another view, and I know I'm throwing a lot of numbers out there, but just this is part of the analysis I looked at, so looking at short-term billings but also looking at what we think is probably a better trend view of the business when you're looking at billings, is to look at a rolling average 4-quarter billings proxy, which is revenue plus the change in deferred on a cash flow statement over the 4 quarters. And the importance of this is that it deals with the seasonality of our business, especially when you kind of look at the back half of the year. It also takes in consideration some of the variations that we have in currency. And if you look at it as of the end of Q2, that number was $539 million. That was up 16% year-on-year in dollars and it was up 22% year-on-year in constant currency. So -- and if I look back at what that rolling average was for the last 4, 5 quarters, it was about 20% or higher with the current number being at 22% at the highest number. So again, I think it's a good indication of how it's trending along with what we're seeing from a revenue standpoint. So again, as I said, we're pretty proud of how that's working out."

We frankly don't see a lot of head-to-head against HP. We do see Mirantis more. We've had several wins or people who are moving away from Mirantis to RHEL. Our value proposition very much is a -- we lock down. We build a certification kind of infrastructure. Everything will work with a defined light, which as OpenStack continues to mature becomes even more valuable. And so Mirantis has done some good work for customers, but often, that is starting off with a code base but then tailoring it and modifying it to a customer's needs. And that feels good in the short run. But again, RHEV, OpenStack forward and you have a whole patch set. You're trying to RHEV forward because it's not pushed upstream. Customers, frankly, get frustrated. And so we have seen migrations as customers have said, ""Oh, no, now I'm [ph] stuck on an old one or I got to migrate this patch set. Maybe it is time to standardize on a company that draws everything upstream first,"" which is obviously what we've been talking about for a long time. And so I do think that's starting to -- even customers who were initially skeptical of that, who were not kind of going through that pain, are starting to come back to us. So I feel good about the competition and the way that's going. I think you mentioned that only 3 companies we see. Nothing is -- Canonical, we rarely -- I have yet to see a case where we've competed with them. I think it is Mirantis and HP. And again, HP must be in more of their kind of own kind of heavily dominant HP hardware customers because we certainly don't see them playing in places where there are other hardware platforms, which is the majority of what I think of as the large customers out there. So again, I think as any technology matures more, our value proposition only gets stronger. So again, I think we're starting to see some things that, frankly, we have lost a year or 2 ago starting to come back our way."

One is we still have a significant amount of share take from established vendors. So if you look especially across the JBoss portfolio, we like to talk about the mobile and some of the newer technologies, and there are certainly drivers. But WebSphere to WebLogic. ILog into the JBoss portfolio. A lot of these kind of older, very expensive middleware technologies to JBoss, which is what I think of it is pure commoditization. Our integration technologies, our BPM technologies, all of those are growing quite nicely. I think a lot of that's being driven not necessarily by kind of new cloud-type workloads. Those are just vendor management. We can come in with equivalent solutions that dramatically lower cost. And so that's driving -- so there's that still -- in the same way, UNIX to Linux and Windows to Linux continues to happen. There's a lot happening, especially in the middleware portfolio as customers are still starting to see Red Hat as a long-term enterprise partner. They're starting to move the middleware stacks that way. Now then obviously, the second pillar is as enterprises are building new infrastructure and building applications for that next-generation scale-out infrastructure, we win a chunk there. So those are the 2 main themes. We don't break out the numbers around it. But I know we talk a lot on the cloud theme, but I don't want to forget the theme of we're continuing to take significant share in the traditional data center, which is still the vast majority of the dollars that are spent on IT broadly. And it also will allow us to pivot well. In down markets, we talk about value, value, value. In up markets, we talk about innovation. And we're credible at both of those stories."

Let me start off saying we just had our Strategic Advisory Board but -- so I do happen to see a lot of customers' containers and thinking about how to consume and manage containers is the single biggest topic. It comes up among what I think of as leading -- technology leading. So financial services, technology and telco customers, without a doubt, more than, frankly, I even hear about OpenStack. And it's so certainly, certainly far beyond web companies. One kind of public example is Amadeus is building their kind of new platform for their new workloads around OpenShift 3. And their desire is for all their new workloads to be running Docker [indiscernible] containers on OpenShift v3. So it is something -- and what you actually hear, even the infrastructure people at financial services institutions, I was talking to one week ago, 1.5 weeks ago, and he was basically saying I don't have a choice because my developers are delivering containers. And I'm going to have to be able to manage them and so Red Hat run as fast as you can because it's not just about taking the container. As you said, it's about security. It's about management, all the telemetry you need to understand performance bottlenecks and all of that kind of work that still is being done. And so the Atomic platform that we talked about is something a lot of customers are interested in. Literally every industry all walks, again, not because the infrastructure people necessarily want it because -- but the developers are picking it up because it's so much more productive for developers. So the interesting thing about containers, I want to emphasize this over and over, is you can build a story around efficiency of running your infrastructure. That is not what's driving this. Developer efficiency is what is driving this. And literally, I had a CIO tell me I've lost control, really. Developers are going to do this. We have to make sure that we can consume these. On your security point, there are several issues around security. The point you made about what's in the container is critically important. And virtualization does nothing to help you with that, right? You got to recognize that what's in the container is basically the user space side of the operating system. We did an analysis where we wrote a Hello World app in 4 different languages and looked back what packages would need to be subsumed into each of those, and we did like Java, node, so JavaScript. We did PHP. And we looked back over the last year how many security updates had been made that would affect those containers. And depending on the language, it varies from 30 to 50 in the last year. So understanding what's in the container and understanding how you can push updates into that is critical. Obviously, it's an operating system vendor. Our ability to do that, we believe, is far superior to anyone else because we obviously track these packages and no kind of what, when and how security updates need to be pushed. So we actually think that's -- as a commercial vendor, that is a very, very good thing for us because that allows us to kind of tell a security story. Now you are right. There's a separate set of security, which does come around bare metal versus virtualize, which is around certain name spaces, ability to get to certain I/O, filesystems and making sure those are separate. We -- there's 2 parallels paths there. One is to run it virtualized because we've had a lot of that virtualization, and certainly, many of our customers are running OpenShift on OpenStack as a way to resolve that, or you can run it on VMware as well. At the same time, obviously, the Linux community is driving towards bare metal solutions to that same set of problems as we continue to push that forward. If you look at RHEL 7.2, there are several kind of steps forward in the technology around security around containers. So yes, security is an issue. To some extent, that's a good thing for Red Hat in that allows us to shine with what we do, both in terms of manageability and security updating, et cetera, et cetera. Sorry, that's a long answer, but it's a subtle but important point."

I also want to personally welcome Frank Calderoni to his first earnings call with Red Hat. I'm very pleased to have Frank join the Red Hat leadership team, where his capabilities and experience will add value and strength as we look to scale our business to the next level in the years ahead.
In Q2, we continued to drive and benefit from the adoption of open hybrid cloud technologies, as companies look to modernize the data center and on-ramp to the cloud. We also continued to build momentum for our technologies that enable a new mode of application development, where agility, continuous deployment and enhanced customer experience are key deliverables for CIOs. With these trends and strong execution by all Red Hat associates, I'm pleased to announce that our second quarter results exceeded our guidance, and we are increasing our outlook for the year, as Frank will detail in a few minutes.
In addition, we passed 2 milestones of note during the quarter. First, we exceeded the $0.5 billion mark in quarterly revenues for a run rate of over $2 billion annually. Second, we achieved an annual run rate of $100 million from our Certified Cloud and Service Provider program. We reached this milestone due in part to the addition of new customers and the expanded utilization of RHEL in production workloads in public clouds.
With that overview, let me discuss a few of our recent technology highlights. First, we kicked off Q2 with our premier user event, the Red Hat Summit in Boston, with record attendance, energy and excitement were high as our customers led sessions on how they use Red Hat technologies to improve their businesses' agility, scale and flexibility. Customers such as Intuit, Volvo, Target, Bloomberg and FICO spoke about their experience implementing our cloud infrastructure technologies, such as OpenStack and CloudForms.
For our OpenShift PaaS solution, we had customers such as Amadeus, Cisco, Barclays, DreamWorks and Telus speak about the benefits of Red Hat technology and Linux containers for application development and easier production deployment. We believe the strength of our offerings, combined with great endorsements from innovative companies, will help us to further drive adoption of Red Hat's cloud solutions across both public, private and cloud deployments.
In conjunction with the Summit, we launched the latest version of our PaaS solution, OpenShift Enterprise 3, a container-based application platform. Our enhanced platform, which uses the Docker container format is powered by RHEL to offer a more secure, efficient and portable way to develop, deploy and run application services. OpenShift 3 also includes Kubernetes, a container orchestration and management engine developed with Google. Docker, Kubernetes, Linux and OpenShift Origin, which are each part of OpenShift 3 are all open source projects, where Red Hat is leading -- where Red Hat is a leading contributor. Our leadership in the upstream community enables us to bring these technologies together to make it easier for enterprises to consume open source innovation.
Also, at the Summit, we continued to expand our Linux container offerings with Red Hat Atomic enterprise platform, utilizing the same core-enabling technologies as OpenShift 3, including Docker and Kubernetes, Atomic Enterprise provides a platform for executing multi-container applications. It is designed to help organizations orchestrate across traditional and cloud-native applications while scaling to meet changing business demands.
At Summit, we also announced an exciting new alliance with Samsung Electronics that aims to deliver the next generation of mobile solutions for the enterprise. The alliance draws on the breadth of Samsung's mobile device portfolio fused with the depth of Red Hat's open source middleware, mobile and cloud technologies to deliver mobile solutions that facilitate rapid development and integration of enterprise applications for organizations moving towards a mobile-first strategy. We are making great progress in mobile and have been recently named by Forrester Research in ""The Forrester Wave Mobile Infrastructure Services"" report. In the report, Red Hat received the highest cumulative score for vendor strategy based on strength of vision, customer satisfaction, speed to market and partner alliances.
More recently, in August, we launched RHEL OpenStack platform 7 based on the Kilo release. Version 7 includes several new features aimed at accelerating the adoption of OpenStack, including simplified operational management and resource provisioning, high availability, greater security control and network flexibility. We have deployed this new version of OpenStack internally and at several large global customers with enthusiastic reviews.
In summary, we executed well in the first half of 2016, and I want to thank all Red Hat's associates around the globe for their focus on achieving these results. As we look ahead, I believe we are well positioned for the second half of the year as we continue to execute on behalf of our customers to deliver innovation and solutions to solve their challenges.
With that, let me turn the call over to Frank."

It's a great time to be at Red Hat, and I'm truly very excited to be part of the team. One of the top priorities that remain is our continued focus on creating value for our shareholders, our customers, employees as well as our partners. Our company's growth initiatives, along with our expanding portfolio of solution, positions us very well within the marketplace. I look forward to working with the investors and the analysts who follow us.
I'm pleased to share that Q2 was another strong quarter with results that exceeded our guidance. Based on the strength of our Q2 and a positive view on the remainder of the year, we are raising our full year outlook as I will detail in a moment. 
First, I will focus my remarks on the financial highlights of our Q2 performance, which is a practice I will do my best to follow so that we can maximize the amount of time in our call dedicated to answering your questions. For a more detailed view of our results and metrics, please refer to our press release, the presentation materials and the transcript of our prepared remarks that are available in the Investor Relations section of redhat.com.
Here are some of the Q2 financial highlights. Total revenue for the quarter was $504 million, which grew 21% on a year-over-year basis in constant currency, or 13% in U.S. dollars. Taking into account the fluctuation of foreign exchange rates, total revenue would have been $37 million or 820 basis points higher using the rates from Q2 of last year. As a result of the FX volatility, I will provide both U.S. dollar and constant currency results for the quarter using the rates from Q2 last year where it's appropriate. In U.S. dollars, we exceeded the high end of our revenue guidance by $8 million. Our improved revenue performance this quarter resulted from better-than-expected execution, improved linearity and upsides in our public cloud business and our customer education and compliance program. 
The main driver of our total revenue growth was subscription revenue of $442 million, an increase of 21% in constant currency and 13% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. In USD, this renewable revenue stream now constitutes 88% of total revenue, which provides us with a high level of future revenue visibility and predictability.
Breaking out the subscription revenue by technology. The subscription revenue for our infrastructure-related offering was $363 million, an increase of 17% in constant currency and 9% year-over-year in USD. Subscription revenue for application development-related and emerging technologies offerings was $79 million, an increase of 48% in constant currency and 37% year-over-year in USD. Application development-related and emerging technologies revenue grew to approximately 16% of total revenue in USD, and that's up from 13% from a year ago.
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income grew 13% and non-GAAP operating margin was 24.4%. This non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 140 basis points above our guidance due to the strong revenue growth. We had record hiring of approximately 400 associates this quarter, which puts us on track to add approximately 1,200 associates this year, which has been our investment goal. We added approximately 600 associates year-to-date.
Using our estimated annual effective tax rate of 29%, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.47, and that's $0.03 above our guidance. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2 billion, and this balance was after returning $70 million to shareholders after repurchasing approximately 895,000 shares of Red Hat stock. We had approximately $430 million remaining on the current share repurchase authorization at the end of the quarter.
Total deferred revenue at quarter end was $1.4 billion, an increase of $162 million or 13% over the same quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, the total deferred revenue would have been up 20%. The total change in deferred revenue from a cash flow statement that neutralizes most of the impact of the currency changes was a decline of $25 million. Operating cash flow of $120 million for the quarter was up 12% year-over-year, and year-to-date operating cash flow was up 21%.
Our rolling 4 quarter's billing proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, the billings proxy was $539 million, up 16% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, this metric would have been up 22%, a modest increase from a year-ago quarter and continues to demonstrate the momentum that we have in our business. This metric also reflects the higher bookings duration that we had last year and the 20-month average duration that we've experienced through the first half of this year. As we look ahead, we would expect the bookings duration for the second half of fiscal 2016 to be closer to the historic 21-month level.
Now let's look at some of the metrics of the business momentum and some of the large deals in the quarter. On a geographic basis, this quarter's 60% of bookings came from the Americas, 22% from EMEA and 18% from Asia-Pacific, versus a 59-24-17 split in Q2 of last year. We continue to deliver globally despite the FX headwind.
The Q2 sales route-to-market mix was 75% from the channel and 25% from the direct sales force, and this is versus 69-31 split in Q2 of last year. Consistent with Q2 of last year, we closed a large number of channel deals, and we're making progress toward our annual goal of a 70-30 split.
Now let me give you some additional details on the largest deals and our renewals that closed in the quarter. Within our top largest -- 30 largest deals metric, all 30 were approximately $1 million or more. We had 4 deals that were in excess of $5 million, and we had 1 deal that was well over $10 million. 
Cross-selling was strong with 65% of the deals including one or more components from our group of application development and emerging technologies offering. We expect the growing adoption of these technologies like Middleware, the RHEL OpenStack platform, OpenShift, cloud management and storage, to continue to drive revenue growth. The top vertical for the quarter was financial, followed closely by mainstream customers in health care, transportation and retail verticals.
On our renewal business, I'm pleased to share that once again, we renewed all of the top 25 deals that were up for renewal. The total subscription value of these top 25 renewals was approximately 115% of the prior value.
Now I would like to turn to guidance, which will factor in the solid performance we had in the first half of the fiscal year, and our outlook assumes similar business conditions and foreign exchange rates as of September 18, 2015, which included a dollar to euro of 1.13 and a yen to dollar of 121. 
With these assumptions, we are raising our full year revenue guidance to $2.034 billion to $2.044 billion, up approximately 14% in USD or approximately 20% in constant currency. We are modestly increasing the operating margin to a target of 23.6%, and we're raising the cash flow to $690 million to $705 million. We're also increasing our target for full year non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.85 to $1.87 per share, assuming a 29% annual effective tax rate and a $1 million per quarter forecast for other income.
Our guidance also reflects our focused investment in our application development in emerging technologies that we believe will further drive future growth.
For Q3, specifically, I offer the following outlook. We expect revenue to be in the range of $519 million to $523 million, which is up 15% in USD or at the high end of the range of approximately 20% in constant currency; non-GAAP operating income of approximately 23%; non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.47.
Consistent with prior practices at Red Hat, I will not forecast quarterly cash flow. However, I would suggest that while estimating cash flow, you use the AR balance as your starting point.
In summary, we are pleased with the very solid performance in the first half of the fiscal year. And with our broad portfolio of solutions and strong execution, we believe we will become the first open source company to exceed $2 billion in annual revenue.

We -- it does a really good job of kind of identifying hardware and lighting it up. Of course, that means there's a lot of work to do around certifying that hardware, making sure it lights up appropriately, et cetera, et cetera. So our customers who have been using it have generally been thrilled. We've had some specific-hardware platforms we've been a little challenged on, so we've been kind of working through those components. And obviously, that eats up some professional services resources. But in general, it's allowed us to have a couple of big wins. One of the very large global telcos chose RHEL OSP, a very, very large financial services institution again chose RHEL OSP both this quarter. I think a lot of it was due to the progress that we've made. Mark, there are really 2 pieces around, I think, getting it truly in mainstream, running production applications. One is continuing to make it simpler. And I think we made a big step forward and we'll continue to do that. The other is some more high-availability features, right? So one of the, I think, issues or features with OpenStack is its scalability. But it's basically kind of assuming applications that are stateless. And so continue to build more high-availability features and to allow it to run traditional application is something we've been talking a lot to customers about. So I think there's a general belief that OpenStack is going to be a kind of low-cost platform of choice with customers going forward. But there's a sense that ""Hey, Red Hat, you need to help us take some of our existing applications and migrate them onto OpenStack."" So we're actively working with some customers on that. So hard to say exactly when these technologies go, but we're starting to see a lot more production applications start to move. Again, these are early adopters doing this. So this isn't quite mainstream, but really pleased with the progress we're seeing there."

We saw, of course, an improvement in the cloud business -- the public cloud business. And as you know, that is recorded in arrears. So that's more realtime business, not necessarily deferred business. So that's going to affect the overall mix of contract. The other thing, too, is we had strength in the government business, which is also another good sign, another quarter of very good strength in our government business. And the government business tends to be a 12-month business. So those 2 elements have a higher percentage of the mix that's going to kind of put a little bit of pressure on the contract -- on the average contract length. So not necessarily anything to be concerned about, it's just a matter of the mix of the business. But as Jim mentioned, what we expect is in the back half of the year, to see it more towards the historic average of 21 months."

So that is typically net new customers because if you have an existing relationship, we have a vehicle for you to purchase and run your subscriptions, whether it's on-premise or on RHEL, right? So those are generally net new workloads and net new customers. One of the very, very large public cloud providers collect that data would they ask, ""Are you a Red Hat customer?"" and the vast majority is new to us. We see some customers taking advantage of being able to run RHEL on public clouds. But recognize, and this is -- more and more seems to be settling out, as I talked to our large customers, for dev and test or for applications that are bearing a lot workloads where elasticity is important. Public cloud has a lot of benefit. But once workload has been up and running, and it is kind of -- it reach kind of a stable, predictable amount, a lot of our large customers or data centers prefer to run those in their data centers. So we're not seeing a lot of people saying, ""Hey, I'm taking an existing application and moving it into the cloud."" It's more new workloads are being built to run either permanently or often temporarily in the cloud. And so they settle down the performance characteristics and the intention is moving it back in. So it's hard to -- because people are thinking applications essentially running across, it's hard to directly answer that question. So that's one of the piece of benefits that we provide, right? Your right to -- our infrastructure, you can run on public cloud or in your own data center."

One is, I think, it's typically OpenStack and then we have to explain why OpenStack, so that decision is made first. But I want to be clear, it's rarely a single decision. Virtually, anyone is going to have a Microsoft environment in their infrastructure. And so they're obviously thinking about whether that's going to be on a Microsoft infrastructure or on VMware and -- or Azure, et cetera, et cetera. Most companies want to then have a separate infrastructure -- so 2 different infrastructures, right? So you want to have a proprietary and an open, so you can get into how big those things are going to be. But there's always going to be a Microsoft footprint there. I think that generally benefit us because, frankly, a lot of -- customers will say, I'm going to have a Microsoft footprint, but I want to have my second one be VMware because there's -- that gives me 2 different proprietary ones and does that necessarily help me in the long run. So I do think we're benefiting from the fact that the alternative to Microsoft, I think, more and more people are thinking open as they're think about their next generation. And so we -- and we obviously do well there. And then it comes down to really with, especially the early adopters, we do get a lot of am I going to buy Red Hat OpenStack now or later? I think most kind of see us as we'll be the Red Hat of OpenStack. And the question is do they want to consume something closer to the trunk or are they ready to stabilize now? So the big telco I mentioned started off with we call it a snowflake, so they started off working with a primarily professional services firm, doing work on OpenStack where they've added in some of their own features. After a couple of RHEVs realized that, that was going to be hard to maintain long term and came to us. So I think, again, we have a good value story once it's OpenStack. And there's a natural sense that OpenStack is going to be at least one of the 2 platforms that most enterprises are looking at deploying."

So I know a lot of it has to do with -- and I'm just kind of looking at the last couple of quarters, about some of what, let's say, the expectation is. So upfront, I just want to mention as everyone knows, we do not provide any forecast on billings because it's difficult to kind of forecast. And one of the things I looked at over the last week or so, if you look at some of the range of what the estimates were, it's about a $30-plus million range between the high and the low. But if we've -- and we've done a lot of analysis on the billings, at least I have, in the last few weeks. And looking at them, I'm really pretty proud of the stats that we have this quarter. One of the things from a billings perspective, just to kind of go through it, so billings proxy, as we look at it, will be the revenue and the change in deferred. So for the quarter, we had about $479 million. So that's up 9% in dollars and 17% in constant currency. And that's fairly consistent when you look at the performance we had in the last Q2, right, from the standpoint of a modest increase year-on-year. I mentioned earlier about the contract duration for the first half. So it was about 20 months. So slightly below the historic level of the 21 months, and we talked about that, and the strength of that was -- what caused that was more related to the public cloud and the government business. And we're expecting it to kind of move back into the 21 months. But if you look underneath the billings, the short-term billings, which we think is probably a better gauge when you take into consideration the points I mentioned about the contract duration, which looked at it over a 12-month period, in Q2, the billings were about $484 million. And that was up about 13% in dollars and 21% in constant currency. And then another view, and I know I'm throwing a lot of numbers out there, but just this is part of the analysis I looked at, so looking at short-term billings but also looking at what we think is probably a better trend view of the business when you're looking at billings, is to look at a rolling average 4-quarter billings proxy, which is revenue plus the change in deferred on a cash flow statement over the 4 quarters. And the importance of this is that it deals with the seasonality of our business, especially when you kind of look at the back half of the year. It also takes in consideration some of the variations that we have in currency. And if you look at it as of the end of Q2, that number was $539 million. That was up 16% year-on-year in dollars and it was up 22% year-on-year in constant currency. So -- and if I look back at what that rolling average was for the last 4, 5 quarters, it was about 20% or higher with the current number being at 22% at the highest number. So again, I think it's a good indication of how it's trending along with what we're seeing from a revenue standpoint. So again, as I said, we're pretty proud of how that's working out."

We frankly don't see a lot of head-to-head against HP. We do see Mirantis more. We've had several wins or people who were moving away from Mirantis to RHEL. Our value proposition very much is a -- we lock down. We build a certification kind of infrastructure. Everything will work with a defined light, which as OpenStack continues to mature, becomes even more valuable. And so Mirantis has done some good work for customers, but often, that is starting off with a code base but then tailoring it and modifying it to a customer's needs. And that feels good in the short run. But again, RHEV, OpenStack forward and you have a whole patch set. You're trying to RHEV forward because it's not pushed upstream, customers, frankly, get frustrated. And so we have seen migrations as customers have said, ""Oh, no, now I'm either stuck on an old one or I got to migrate this patch set. Maybe it is time to standardize on a company that drives [ph] everything upstream first,"" which is obviously what we've been talking about for a long time. And so I do think that's starting to -- even customers who were initially skeptical of that, who are now kind of going through that pain, are starting to come back to us. So I feel good about the competition and the way that's going. I think you mentioned that only 3 companies we see. Nothing is -- Canonical, we rarely -- I have yet to see a case where we've competed with them. I think it is Mirantis and HP. And again, HP must be in more of their kind of own kind of heavily dominant HP hardware customers because we certainly don't see them playing in places where there are other hardware platforms, which is the majority of what I think of as the large customers out there. So again, I think as any technology matures more, our value proposition only gets stronger. So again, I think we're starting to see some things that, frankly, we have lost a year or 2 ago starting to come back our way."

One is we still have a significant amount of share take from established vendors. So if you look especially across the JBoss portfolio, we like to talk about the mobile and some of the newer technologies, and there are certainly drivers. But WebSphere to WebLogic. ILog into the JBoss portfolio. A lot of these kind of older, very expensive middleware technologies to JBoss, which is what I think of it is pure commoditization. Our integration technologies, our BPM technologies, all of those are growing quite nicely. I think a lot of that's being driven not necessarily by kind of new cloud-type workloads. Those are just vendor management. We can come in with equivalent solutions that dramatically lower cost. And so that's driving -- so there's that still -- in the same way, UNIX to Linux and Windows to Linux continues to happen. There's a lot happening, especially in the middleware portfolio as customers are still starting to see Red Hat as a long-term enterprise partner. They're starting to move the middleware stacks that way. Now then obviously, the second pillar is as enterprises are building new infrastructure and building applications for that next-generation scale-out infrastructure, we win a chunk there. So those are the 2 main themes. We don't break out the numbers around it. But -- and I know we talk a lot on the cloud theme, but I don't want to forget the theme of we're continuing to take significant share in the traditional data center, which is still the vast majority of the dollars that are spent on IT broadly. And it also will allow us to pivot well. In down markets, we talk about value, value, value. In up markets, we talk about innovation. And we're credible at both of those stories."

Let me start off saying we just had our Strategic Advisory Board but I also go out and see a lot of customers' containers and thinking about how to consume and manage containers is the single biggest topic that comes up among what I think of as leading -- technology leading. So financial services, technology and telco customers, without a doubt, more than, frankly, I even hear about OpenStack. And it's -- so certainly, certainly far beyond web companies. One kind of public example is Amadeus is building their kind of new platform for their new workloads around OpenShift 3. And their desire is for all their new workloads to be running -- dockerizing containers on OpenShift v3. So it is something -- and what you actually hear, even the infrastructure people at financial services institutions, I was talking to one week ago, 1.5 weeks ago, and he was basically saying I don't have a choice because my developers are delivering containers. And I'm going to have to be able to manage them and so Red Hat run as fast as you can because it's not just about taking the container. As you said, it's about security. It's about management, all the telemetry you need to understand performance bottlenecks and all of that kind of work that still is being done. And so the Atomic platform that we talked about is something a lot of customers are interested in. Literally every industry all walks, again, not because the infrastructure people necessarily want it because -- but the developers are picking it up because it's so much more productive for developers. So the interesting thing about containers, I want to emphasize this over and over, is you can build a story around efficiency of running your infrastructure. That is not what's driving this. Developer efficiency is what is driving this. And literally, I had a CIO tell me I've lost control, really. Developers are going to do this. We have to make sure that we can consume these. On your security point, there are several issues around security. The point you made about what's in the container is critically important. And virtualization does nothing to help you with that, right? You got to recognize that what's in the container is basically the user space side of the operating system. We did an analysis where we wrote a Hello World app in 4 different languages and looked back what packages would need to be subsumed into each of those, and we did like Java, node, so JavaScript. We did PHP. And we looked back over the last year how many security updates had been made that would affect those containers. And depending on the language, it varies from 30 to 50 in the last year. So understanding what's in the container and understanding how you can push updates into that is critical. Obviously, it's an operating system vendor. Our ability to do that, we believe, is far superior to anyone else because we obviously track these packages and know kind of what, when and how security updates need to be pushed. So we actually think that's -- as a commercial vendor, that is a very, very good thing for us because that allows us to kind of tell a security story. Now you are right. There's a separate set of security, which does come around bare metal versus virtualize, which is around certain name spaces, ability to get to certain I/O, filesystems and making sure those are separate. We -- there's 2 parallels paths there. One is to run it virtualized because we've hit a lot of that virtualization, and certainly, many of our customers are running OpenShift on OpenStack as a way to resolve that, or you can run it on VMware as well. At the same time, obviously, the Linux community is driving towards bare metal solutions to that same set of problems as we continue to push that forward. If you look at RHEL 7.2, there are several kind of steps forward in the technology around security around containers. So yes, security is an issue. To some extent, that's a good thing for Red Hat in that allows us to shine with what we do, both in terms of manageability and security updating, et cetera, et cetera. Sorry, that's a long answer, but it's a subtle but important point."

I'm please to announced that we delivered another strong quarter, with both revenue and profitability exceeding our guidance for Q3. Even more importantly, looking forward, we continued to strengthen our leadership position in the emerging open hybrid cloud sector. Red Hat's associates are executing at a high level across the company as we further increase our strategic importance with customers. We believe that Red Hat is highly differentiated in our ability to help organizations and transform their ID to be more agile and improve our customers' experiences. This led to Q3 results that demonstrated solid growth across all major geographies, consistently high revenue growth in both our infrastructure as well as our application development and emerging technologies product groups; and we experienced large deal wins, cross-selling and strong renewals within our top deals.  The strength of our results are evidence of the strong demand for technologies that address the modernization of IT and customers' desire to work in an open hybrid cloud world. Red Hat continues to grow by better enabling our customers to build, deploy and manage their applications across multiple environments and infrastructures. 
With that overview, let me discuss a few of our recent technology, marketing and partnership highlights. First, as a premier sponsor of the OpenStack Summit in Tokyo, we took the opportunity to highlight our enterprise customers' success stories across a variety of verticals including telecommunications, education and banking. At the conference, we also jointly demonstrated our offerings for OpenStack with the service provider panel that included Verizon, China Mobile and tell us. In addition, we announced an expanded relationship with Lenovo to provide Red Hat enterprise and its OpenStack platform with Lenovo hardware to bring more secure, reliable and flexible platforms to enterprise IT looking to build hybrid cloud deployments. 
Second, we enhanced our management capabilities with the acquisition of Ansible, an open source IT automation software company launched in 2013. We chose Ansible because it is aligned with the core principles that shaped Red Hat's management strategy in the following ways:
Ansible is simple to use since it's agentless. Its playbooks make it easier to both write and maintain automation workflows. The team has built a highly popular open source project with strong community. Ansible technologies support heterogenous IT environment including Linux, Microsoft, AWS and the Google cloud. And theY expand our capabilities to offer application management across the 4 footprints of physical, virtual, private cloud and public cloud. The integration of Ansible is well underway, and we're hearing strong interest from customers. And there is great internal excitement for the additional value they bring to our technologies. In fact, the Ansible team has great momentum and closed several new wins including their largest deal to date, a 6-figure deal with a global transportation technology provider.  As part of our management portfolio, Ansible's role in dev ops and automation will be an important component of how Red Hat helps customers modernize their IT applications in the world of continues deployment. 
Third, we launched strategic partnership with Microsoft that was really milestone event for the industry. Both Microsoft and Red Hat showed the same view that it we'll be a hybrid cloud world, and we are working together to enable customers to realize the benefits of this transformation of IT. Let me describe and provide an update on some of the key elements of the partnership. 
is the preferred choice for enterprise Linux workflows on Azure and is now available for customers, representing the first deliverable of the partnership. We've already established customer -- have already enabled customers to take full advantage of their Red Hat subscriptions at Azure through the Red Hat Cloud Access program where customers are able to bring their own subscriptions to run and Azure and fully supported by both Red Hat and Microsoft. Comfort customers will now be able to build and it toy applications and Azure using subscriptions of RHEL, JBoss safety, JBoss web server, Red Hat storage and OpenStack -- sorry, OpenShift . 
In the coming months, Red Hat technologies on demand will also be available in Azure. This space to go RHEL images would be available in the Azure marketplace and supported by Red Hat. Customers will be offered cross-platform, cross-company support spanning the Microsoft and Red Hat offerings in an integrated way, unlike any of our previous partnerships in the public cloud. We have already begun the colocating support teams at Azure premises with the goal of making the customer experience simple and seamless at cloud speed. 
In addition, being able to manage workloads across a variety of infrastructures will be an important capability for customers in the hybrid cloud world. The management solution to do this will be our CloudForms technology. This month, we launched CloudForms 4.0, which gives customers the ability to manage RHEL on both hyper V and Azure. 
We are also collaborating on .NET for a new generation of application development capabilities. The plan is it enable developers to access .NET technologies across Red Hat offerings, including OpenShift and RHEL, jointly by Microsoft and Red Hat. RHEL will be the primary Microsoft development and referenced operating system for .NET core on Linux. This is an exciting partnership for our joint customers, and I look forward to updating you on our progress. 
In summary, I am pleased with our execution and results so far this year. I'm looking forward to a strong finish for the fiscal year where we expect to achieve the $2 billion revenue milestone. Beyond this year, we have a compelling opportunity in front of us and exciting work to do to achieve our potential in open hybrid cloud. 
In closing, I want to thank Red Hat associates around the globe for their hard work. Red Hat associates have created an exciting and place to make a difference. In fact, Red Hat was recently recognized among the top 50 Best Places to Work in Glassdoor's 2016 survey. Red Hat has been built by a truly passionate and talented team, and I'm honored to be a part of it. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Frank."
33679,318230345,915024,"Red Hat, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Dec 17, 2015",2015-12-17,"Earnings Calls","Red Hat, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. We executed well with a strong quarter, which resulted in our ability to exceed our guidance across a number of metrics.

We executed well with a strong quarter, which resulted in our ability to exceed our guidance across a number of metrics. We continue to see our investment in emerging technologies and expanded partnerships in high-caliber sales teams contributing to the high growth. This marked our fourth consecutive quarter of 20%-plus total revenue growth on a constant-currency basis. 
Let me first start with my remarks with the financial highlights of our Q3 performance, and then update our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. For a more detailed view of our results and metrics, please refer to our press release, supplemental metrics and a copy of our prepared remarks that are available in the Investor Relations section of redhat.com. 
Here are the Q3 financial highlights. We were pleased to see total revenue of $524 million, which grew 21% on a year-over-year basis in constant currency or 15% in U.S. dollars. Taking into account the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, total revenue would have been $28 million or 630 basis points higher using the rates from Q3 of last year. Due to continued high FX volatility, I will provide both U.S. dollar and constant currency results for the quarter, using the rates from Q3 last year where it's appropriate. 
Our revenue performance for the quarter exceeded the high end of our guidance by approximately $1 million on a U.S. dollar basis and approximately $4 million when using the exchange rates we provided in our guidance in September. Our better-than-expected revenue performance this quarter resulted from continued strong demand that Jim just referenced as well as execution across our organization. The main driver of our total revenue growth was subscription revenue of $457 million, an increase of 22% in constant currency and 16% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. This renewable revenue stream now constitutes 87% of total revenue, which provides us with a high level of revenue visibility in addition to future growth opportunities as we renew and expand our customer relationships. 
Breaking out the subscription revenue by technology, we are very pleased to see the subscription revenue for the infrastructure-related offerings were $373 million, an increase of 18% in constant currency and 12% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. And particular to note, subscription revenue for application development related and emerging technologies offerings was $84 million, an increase of 45% in constant currency and 37% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Application development related and emerging technologies revenue was approximately 60% of total revenue, and this is up from 14% of total revenue in the year-ago quarter. 
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income grew 13%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 23.5%. This non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 60 basis points above our guidance, which as a reminder included the expenses related to the Ansible acquisition. The 60 basis points of margin upside was due in part to the strong revenue growth. 
With investments in our growth initiatives, we added approximately 400 associates this quarter, including approximately 50 associates related to the acquisition of Ansible. As we build our talent base with skills -- of 2 skill sets, we have added approximately 950 associates in Q3 and we are on track to add more than 1,250 associates for the full fiscal year. 
Using our estimated annual effective tax rate of 29%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.48, $0.02 above the guidance we provided after the Ansible acquisition. Higher revenue and disciplined spending were the main drivers of EPS upside. 
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $1.87 billion. We returned $78 million to shareholders from repurchasing approximately 987,000 shares of stock. And we hadn't approximately $352 million remaining on the current share repurchase authorization at the end of the quarter. 
Total deferred revenue at quarter end was $1.49 billion, an increase of $187 million or 14% over the same quarter a year ago. On a constant-currency basis, total deferred revenue would have been up 20%. The total change in deferred revenue from our cash flow statement that neutralizes most of the impact of currency fluctuation was an increase of $97 million. 
Operating cash flow of $140 million for the quarter was up 5% year-over-year. The timing of customer collections and cash disbursements can affect the growth rates on a single quarter basis.  The year-to-date operating cash flow was up 16%. 
Our rolling 4 quarters billings proxy was calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, the billings proxy was $559 million, up 15% year-over-year. on a constant-currency basis, this metric would have been 21%. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of 20%-plus year-over-year growth, demonstrating our consistent growth in the business. This metric also reflects both the higher bookings duration in Q3 over last year of 24 months and the 22-month average duration we experienced in Q3 of this fiscal year. As we look ahead, we would expect the bookings duration for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 to be closer to the historic 21-month level compared to 22 months in Q4 a year ago. 
I will review the metrics for business momentum and the large deals in the quarter. Across all geographies, we saw continued growth in our bookings despite FX headwinds. This quarter, 60% of the bookings came from the Americas; 26% from EMEA; and 14% from Asia-Pacific versus a 62%-25%-13% split in Q3 of last year. The Q3 sales route to market mix was 67% from the channel and 33% from our direct sales force compared to a 70%-30% split in Q3 of last year. Consistent with Q3 seasonality, we closed a number of large direct deals and continue to target annual goal of the 70%-30% split. 
Within our top largest -- 30 top largest deals, all of them were approximately $1 million or more. Within that, we had 11 deals that were in excess of $5 million. And of these deals, 3 were over $10 million. 
Cross-selling was strong, with 70% of the deals including one or more components from our group of application development and emerging technology offerings. We expect the growing adoption of these technologies like middleware, RHEL OpenStack platform, OpenShift, cloud management storage to continued to drive revenue growth.  The top vertical for the quarter was financial followed closely by mainstream customers in sectors such as health care, transportation and retail. 
On our renewal business, we once again renewed all of the top 25 deals the we were expecting. The total subscription value of these 25 renewals was approximately 120% of the prior value. 
Jim discussed Red Hat's increasing strategic importance with customers. This quarter, we had a great example of this with the third largest deal in the quarter, a global financial services customer that renewed in excess of $10 million. First, let me give you some background. This global financial services customer was an early adopter of Linux and ran a mixed Linux environment. Around 2007, the customer decided on Linux vendor offering free multiyear support on Linux distribution. The account team did not give up on this customer. And by fiscal year 2013, the customer decided to standardize on RHEL, and we closed a multiyear deal for approximately $2 million. Through exemplary account management, we renewed this customer this quarter to a significant 3-year commitment in excess of $10 million. We have not only expanded the footprint of RHEL, but we're also helping this customer realize the benefits of private cloud computing, software-defined storage and container. This customer is now buying RHEL, cloud , Red Hat, come OpenShift and OpenStack. So I wanted to say congratulations to the account team for an exceptional job of focusing on the needs of the customer. 
I would like now to turn to our guidance. Our outlook assumes similar business conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as of December 17, 2015, which included a dollar to euro of $1.09 and a yen to dollar of JPY 123. Foreign exchange rate remain very volatile and may change from the rates we are using today. Our guidance also reaffirms our Q4 outlook for the Ansible acquisition, which we closed in October. 
I'm pleased to announce the despite the impact of weaker foreign exchange rate, we are raising our full year revenue guidance to $2.044 billion to $2.048 billion, up approximately 50% in U.S. dollars or approximately 20% in constant currency at the high end of the range. The annual revenue guidance is up approximately $12 million in constant currency from the high end of range of our September guidance. 
We are modestly increasing operating margin to approximately 23.5%. And we're improving the cash flow by tightening the range from $695 million to $705 million. 
We are also increasing our target of full year non-GAAP earnings per share to approximately $1.86 per share, assuming a 29% annual effective tax rate and $1 million per quarter forecast for other income. This EPS is approximately $0.03 higher than the midpoint of the guidance we provided after the Ansible acquisition. 
For Q4 specifically, this implies the following outlook:  We expect revenue to be in the range of $535 million to $539 million, which is up 16% in U.S. dollars at the high end of the range, or up approximately 20% in constant currency. This is an increase of $10 million from our previous fourth quarter guidance on a constant-currency basis. 
We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 22.5%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of the $0.47. Both of these estimates include the previous guidance on the impact of Ansible in Q4, which equates to approximately $0.02 a share. 
Consistent with prior practices, I will not forecast quarterly cash flow, even though there is an implied range in the full year outlook. 
Overall, we are very pleased with our financial performance in the third quarter. We are excited about the strategic leadership position for both open source and hybrid cloud computing as we are confident in the long term to continue to grow our market share. Given our higher outlook for revenue, non-GAAP operating margin and EPS, we look forward to a strong finish of the fiscal year.

So in terms of Linux, most of it comes from we win a very high share of net new workloads. so I think there's a shift going on. There continues to be some UNIX to Linux migrations, and that continues well. But a lot of the share shift just happens because we get a larger shift of the application portfolio because the applications are much more likely to be built on RHEL. And so that drives the natural share shift as we get a larger percentage of application portfolio every year. In terms of OpenShift, we just launched the dedicated instances which a lot of enterprises wanted to couple of weeks ago. So virtually all of the traction the I was just talking about in terms of dollars, and the big deals is all on-premise OpenShift Enterprise. That said, we're up to let's say, 2.8-plus million dollars applications running on OpenShift Online. It continues to grow really, really nicely. So we are seeing nice traction there as well."

First of all from an engineering perspective, in addition to the base core business that we had and expanding the platform, especially around measuring projects have support the from and this year, but even more important is to scale from a global perspective in being able to merging technologies out into the global marketplace. So getting additional coverage as well as working with the various partners in investment to have to make in our go to market to get broader coverage and be able to sustain and improve that with it has been the focus. One of the things the we talked about over the last 2 quarters is trying to accelerate the investment in Q3 and Q4, which we have done at this part of what we do saw this quarter and what's in the forecast of the next quarter, to enable us to continue as we go into the fiscal year. As far as the margins, I mean we've had very healthy margins this year. Closing out the the year at operating margin at 23.5% I think is extremely well positioned. It's slightly above where we were last year. And our objective, and I know think that's also what investors are looking for, is to enable us to continue that. But I think we're trying to balance of growth as well as also sustain those margins. So as we get into closing out this year and we give our guidance for FY '17, I think we'll have a better sense for how that will be for next year. And given a lot of the strategic planning right now, it's underway for the last month or so, we'll continue there at this quarter. And I think the will help us division the right balance of going after growth and investments [indiscernible] would be able the profitability."

And then also from the perspective of coverage, right? Because we do not have -- we've through been growing at a great rate, but we still have opportunity in all our geographies to go after new accounts. And it goes back to even question that we had before. It's great the we have the renewals and we have the upsell, but we also want to make sure the we're going after new accounts. And as we go into FY '17, that's a major focus for us is to go after new accounts. In order to go after new accounts, have some investments the you need to make. So compensation of new accounts investments as well as the expansion of the emerging market. It's just earlier today, I was talking with our service the diversity and that's another great example first investment were making services. Services instead of their presales for us to get customers on RHEL, a little more importantly believe, to get them on emerging product.

I'm please to announced that we delivered another strong quarter, with both revenue and profitability exceeding our guidance for Q3. Even more importantly, looking forward, we continued to strengthen our leadership position in the emerging open hybrid cloud sector. 
Red Hat associates are executing at a high level across the company as we further increase our strategic importance with customers. We believe that Red Hat is highly differentiated in our ability to help organizations transform their IT to be more agile and improve their customers' experiences. 
This led to Q3 results that demonstrated solid growth across all major geographies, consistently high revenue growth in both our infrastructure as well as our application development and emerging technologies product groups. And we experienced large deal wins, cross-selling and strong renewals within our top deals.  The strength of our results are evidence of the strong demand for technologies that address the modernization of IT and customers' desire to work in an open hybrid cloud world. Red Hat continues to grow by better enabling our customers to build, deploy and manage their applications across multiple environments and infrastructures. 
With that overview, let me discuss a few of our recent technology, marketing and partnership highlights. First, as a premier sponsor of the OpenStack Summit in Tokyo, we took the opportunity to highlight our enterprise customers' success stories across a variety of verticals including telecommunications, education and banking. At the conference, we also jointly demonstrated our NFV offerings for OpenStack with the service provider panel that included Verizon, China Mobile and Telus. In addition, we announced an expanded relationship with Lenovo to provide Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack platform with Lenovo hardware to bring more secure, reliable and flexible platforms to enterprise IT looking to build hybrid cloud deployments. 
Second, we enhanced our management capabilities with the acquisition of Ansible, an open source IT automation software company launched in 2013. We chose Ansible because it is aligned with the core principles that shaped Red Hat's management strategy in the following ways:
Ansible is simple to use since it's agentless. Its playbooks make it easier to both write and maintain automation workflows. The team has built a highly popular open source project with a strong community. Ansible technologies support heterogenous IT environments including Linux, Microsoft, AWS and the Google Cloud. And they expand our capabilities to offer application management across the 4 footprints of physical, virtual, private cloud and public cloud. 
The integration of Ansible is well underway, and we're hearing strong interest from customers. And there is great internal excitement for the additional value they bring to our technology stack. In fact, the Ansible team had great momentum and closed several new wins, including their largest deal to date, a 6-figure deal with a global transportation technology provider. As part of our management portfolio, Ansible's role in dev ops and automation will be an important component of how Red Hat helps customers modernize their IT applications in the world of continuous deployment. 
 
Third, we launched a strategic partnership with Microsoft that was really milestone event for the industry. Both Microsoft and Red Hat shared the same view that it will be a hybrid cloud world, and we are working together to enable customers to realize the benefits of this transformation of IT. Let me describe and provide an update on some of the key elements of the partnership. 
RHEL is the preferred choice for enterprise Linux workflows on Azure and is now available for customers, representing the first deliverable of the partnership. We've already established customer -- have already enabled customers to take full advantage of their Red Hat subscriptions at Azure through the Red Hat Cloud Access program, where customers are able to bring their own subscriptions to run in Azure and be fully supported by both Red Hat and Microsoft. Comfort customers will now be able to build and deploy applications in Azure using subscriptions of RHEL, JBoss EAP, JBoss Web Server, Red Hat Gluster Storage and OpenStack -- sorry, OpenShift PaaS.
In the coming months, Red Hat technologies on demand will also be available in Azure. [indiscernible] RHEL images will be available in the Azure marketplace and supported by Red Hat. Customers will be offered cross-platform, cross-company support spanning the Microsoft and Red Hat offerings in an integrated way, unlike any of our previous partnerships in the public cloud. We have already begun the co-locating support teams at Azure premises with the goal of making the customer experience simple and seamless at cloud speed. 
In addition, being able to manage workloads across a variety of environments and infrastructures will be an important capability for customers in the hybrid cloud world. The management solution to do this will be our CloudForms technology. This month, we launched CloudForms 4.0, which gives customers the ability to manage RHEL on both Hyper-V and Azure. 
We're also collaborating on .NET for a new generation of application development capabilities. The plan is it enable developers to access .NET technologies across Red Hat offerings, including OpenShift and RHEL, jointly backed by Microsoft and Red Hat. RHEL will be the primary Microsoft development and referenced operating system for .NET Core on Linux. This is an exciting partnership for our joint customers, and I look forward to updating you on our progress. 
In summary, I am pleased with our execution and results so far this year. I'm looking forward to a strong finish to the fiscal year, where we expect to achieve the $2 billion revenue milestone. Beyond this year, we have a compelling opportunity in front of us and exciting work to do to achieve our potential in the open hybrid cloud. 
In closing, I want to thank Red Hat associates around the globe for their hard work. Red Hat associates have created an exciting, enviable place to make a difference. In fact, Red Hat was recently recognized among the top 50 Best Places to Work in Glassdoor's 2016 survey. Red Hat has been built by a truly passionate and talented team, and I'm honored to be a part of it. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Frank."

We executed well with another strong quarter, which resulted in our ability to exceed our guidance across a number of metrics. We continue to see our investments in emerging technologies, expanded partnerships in high-caliber sales teams contributing to the high growth. This marked our fourth consecutive quarter of 20%-plus total revenue growth on a constant currency basis. 
Let me first start with my remarks with the financial highlights of our Q3 performance and then update our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. For a more detailed view of our results and metrics, please refer to our press release, supplemental metrics and a copy of our prepared remarks that are available in the Investor Relations section of redhat.com. 
Here are the Q3 financial highlights. We were pleased to see total revenue of $524 million, which grew 21% on a year-over-year basis in constant currency or 15% in U.S. dollars. Taking into account the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, total revenue would have been $28 million or 630 basis points higher using the rates from Q3 of last year. Due to the continued high FX volatility, I will provide both U.S. dollar and constant currency results for the quarter using the rates from Q3 last year where it's appropriate. 
Our revenue performance for the quarter exceeded the high end of our guidance by approximately $1 million on a U.S. dollar basis and approximately $4 million when using the exchange rates we provided in our guidance in September. Our better-than-expected revenue performance this quarter resulted from continued strong demand that Jim just referenced as well as execution across our organization. The main driver of our total revenue growth was subscription revenue of $457 million, an increase of 22% in constant currency and 16% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. This renewable revenue stream now constitutes 87% of total revenue, which provides us with a high level of revenue visibility in addition to future growth opportunities as we renew and expand our customer relationships. 
Breaking out the subscription revenue by technology, we are very pleased to see the subscription revenue for the infrastructure-related offerings was $373 million, an increase of 18% in constant currency and 12% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. And particular to note, subscription revenue for application development-related and emerging technologies offerings was $84 million, an increase of 45% in constant currency and 37% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Application development-related and emerging technologies revenue was approximately 60% of total revenue, and this is up from 14% of total revenue in the year-ago quarter. 
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income grew 13%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 23.5%. This non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 60 basis points above our guidance, which as a reminder included the expenses related to the Ansible acquisition. The 60 basis points of margin upside was due in part to the strong revenue growth. 
With investments in our growth initiatives, we added approximately 400 associates this quarter, including approximately 50 associates related to the acquisition of Ansible. As we build our talent base of key skill sets, we have added approximately 950 associates in Q3 and we are on track to add more than 1,250 associates for the full fiscal year. 
Using our estimated annual effective tax rate of 29%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.48, $0.02 above the guidance we provided after the Ansible acquisition. Higher revenue and disciplined spending were the main drivers of the EPS upside. 
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $1.87 billion. We returned $78 million to shareholders from repurchasing approximately 987,000 shares of stock. And we hadn't approximately $352 million remaining on the current share repurchase authorization at the end of the quarter. 
Total deferred revenue at quarter end was $1.49 billion, an increase of $187 million or 14% over the same quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, total deferred revenue would have been up 20%. The total change in deferred revenue from our cash flow statement that neutralizes most of the impact of currency fluctuation was an increase of $97 million. 
Operating cash flow of $140 million for the quarter was up 5% year-over-year. The timing of customer collections and cash disbursements can affect the growth rate on a single quarter basis. The year-to-date operating cash flow was up 16%. 
Our rolling 4 quarters billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, the billings proxy was $559 million, up 15% year-over-year. on a constant-currency basis, this metric would have been 21%. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of 20%-plus year-over-year growth, demonstrating our consistent growth in the business. This metric also reflects both the higher bookings duration in Q3 over last year of 24 months and the 22-month average duration we have experienced in Q3 of this fiscal year. As we look ahead, we would expect the bookings duration for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 to be closer to the historic 21-month level compared to the 22 months in Q4 a year ago. 
I will now review the metrics for business  momentum and the large deals in the quarter. Across all geographies, we saw continued growth in our bookings despite FX headwinds. This quarter, 60% of the bookings came from the Americas, 26% from EMEA, and 14% from Asia-Pacific versus a 62%-25%-13% split in Q3 of last year. 
The Q3 sales route to market mix was 67% from the channel and 33% from our direct sales force compared to a 70%-30% split in Q3 of last year. Consistent with Q3 seasonality, we closed a number of large direct deals and continue to target annual goal of a 70%-30% split. 
Within our top largest -- 30 top largest deals, all of them were approximately $1 million or more. Within that, we had 11 deals that were in excess of $5 million. And of these deals, 3 were over $10 million. 
Cross-selling was strong, with 70% of the deals including one or more components from our group of application development and emerging technologies offerings. We expect the growing adoption of these technologies like Middleware, the RHEL OpenStack platform, OpenShift, cloud management storage to continue to drive revenue growth.  
The top vertical for the quarter was financial followed closely by mainstream customers in sectors such as health care, transportation and retail. 
On our renewal business, we once again renewed all of the top 25 deals the we were expecting. The total subscription value of these 25 renewals was approximately 120% of the prior value. 
 
Jim discussed Red Hat's increasing strategic importance with customers. This quarter, we had a great example of this with the third largest deal of the quarter, a global financial services customer that renewed in excess of $10 million. First, let me give you some background. This global financial services customer was an early adopter of Linux and ran a mixed Linux environment. Around 2007, the customer decided on a Linux vendor offering free multiyear support on their Linux distribution. 
The account team did not give up on this customer, and by fiscal year 2013, the customer decided to standardize on RHEL, and we closed a multiyear deal for approximately $2 million. Through exemplary account management, we renewed this customer this quarter to a significant 3-year commitment in excess of $10 million. We have not only expanded the footprint of RHEL, but we are also helping this customer realize the benefits of private cloud computing, software-defined storage and container. This customer is now buying RHEL, CloudForms, Red Hat Storage, OpenShift and OpenStack. So I wanted to say congratulations to the account team for an exceptional job of focusing on the needs of the customer. 
I would like now to turn to our guidance. Our outlook assumes similar business conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as of December 17, 2015, which included a dollar to euro of $1.09 and a yen to dollar of JPY 123. Foreign exchange rate remain very volatile and may change from the rates we are using today. Our guidance also reaffirms our Q4 outlook for the Ansible acquisition, which we closed in October. 
I'm pleased to announce that despite the impact of weaker foreign exchange rates, we are raising our full year revenue guidance to $2.044 billion to $2.048 billion, up approximately 15% in U.S. dollars or approximately 20% in constant currency at the high end of the range. The annual revenue guidance is up approximately $12 million in constant currency from the high end of range of our September guidance. 
We are modestly increasing operating margin to approximately 23.5%, and we're improving the cash flow by tightening the range from $695 million to $705 million. 
We are also increasing our target of full year non-GAAP earnings per share to approximately $1.86 per share, assuming a 29% annual effective tax rate and $1 million per quarter forecast for other income. This EPS is approximately $0.03 higher than the midpoint of the guidance we provided after the Ansible acquisition. 
For Q4 specifically, this implies the following outlook:  We expect revenue to be in the range of $535 million to $539 million, which is up 16% in U.S. dollars at the high end of the range, or up approximately 20% in constant currency. This is an increase of $10 million from our previous implied fourth quarter guidance on a constant currency basis. 
We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 22.5%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of the $0.47. Both of these estimates include the previous guidance on the impact of Ansible in Q4, which equates to approximately $0.02 a share. 
Consistent with prior practices, I will not forecast quarterly cash flow even though there is an implied range in the full year outlook. 
Overall, we are very pleased with our financial performance in the third quarter. We are excited about the strategic leadership position for both open source and hybrid cloud computing as we are confident in the long term to continue to grow our market share. Given our higher outlook for revenue, non-GAAP operating margin and EPS, we look forward to a strong finish to the fiscal year. 
Operator, I would now like to turn it back to you for the first question."

We didn't talk about it, haven't been asked about it this much, but we've seen really strong performance there.

And we're looking at it in 2 ways. First of all, from an engineering perspective, in addition to the base core business that we've had and expanding the platform, especially around the emerging products to help support that from an engineering, so we've had the growth this year. But even more important is to scale from a global perspective in being able to bring those emerging technologies out into that global marketplace. So getting additional coverage as well as working with various partners in investments that we have to make in our go-to-market to get broader coverage and be able to sustain and improve that growth rate has been the focus. One of the things that we talked about over the last 2 quarters is trying to accelerate the investment in Q3 and Q4, which we have done at this part of what we do saw this quarter and what's in the forecast for the next quarter, to enable us to continue with that story as we go into the new fiscal year. As far as the margins, I mean I think we've had very healthy margins this year, closing out the year at operating margin at 23.5%, I think, is extremely well positioned. It's slightly above where we were last year. And our objective, and I know that's also what investors are looking for, is to enable us to continue that. But again, we're trying to balance, grow as well as also sustain those margins. So as we get into closing out this year and we give our guidance for FY '17, I think we'll have a better sense for how that will be for next year. And we're doing a lot of that strategic planning right now. It's underway for the last month or so, and we'll continue that throughout this quarter.

Obviously, yes, we do, and customers ask us about it all the time. We have enough other things on our plate right now that has bubbled on the top of the list. But it's certainly something we have both kind of ramp permission from our customers and capability to do.

And then back on what I was saying, as far as the investment, more of the investments are in the expansion of our go-to-market so that we can help support the emerging products, which tend to have a longer sales cycles, and enable to continue the momentum that we're seeing in OpenStack and OpenShift. And then also from the perspective of coverage, right? Because we do not have -- we've been growing at a great rate, but we still have opportunity in all our geographies to go after new accounts. And it goes back to even the question that we had before. It's great that we have the renewals and we have the upsell, but we also want to make sure that we're going after new accounts. And as we go into FY '17, that's a major focus for us is to go after new accounts. And in order to go after new accounts, you have some investments that you need to make. So a combination of new accounts investments as well as the expansion of the emerging market. Just earlier today, I was talking with our service -- lead of our services business, and that's another great example as far as the investment we're making in services. Services is kind of a presale for us to get customers on RHEL, or a little more importantly, to get them on emerging products. And usually, it requires an investment somewhere in the 6 to 9-month time frame. So we're making those kinds of investments, which is going to bring future growth."

So RHEV us, which is our scale-up VMware competitor, has continued to do well as we get in conversations around workloads.

That 21-month, that duration, that short-term deferred also supports our revenue for the coming years.

And so we try -- and it was primarily VMware sold in a license model. Then you put those things together, it was able to kind of balloon up really, really quick. This is the infrastructure for the next generation of computing. And so it is net new workloads. And as people build scale out workloads, they are highly likely if they're going to run on prems, they run on OpenStack. And so it will be big, but the relative way in which it will scale over time will just be a more natural ramp. So at some point, in any ramp, there's kind of the S-curve kink up. And if that kink up next year or just beyond, it's hard to exactly say. We're really, really pleased with the customers, the workloads people are putting on and the experience that people are now having. So at some point, the S-curve will really kind of kink up, but it's hard for me to give you an exact kind of time on that."

I'm pleased to announce that we delivered another strong quarter, with both revenue and profitability exceeding our guidance for Q3. Even more importantly, looking forward, we continued to strengthen our leadership position in the emerging open hybrid cloud sector. 
Red Hat associates are executing at a high level across the company as we further increase our strategic importance with customers. We believe that Red Hat is highly differentiated in our ability to help organizations transform their IT to be more agile and improve their customers' experiences. 
This led to the Q3 results that demonstrated solid growth across all major geographies, consistently high revenue growth in both our infrastructure, as well as our application development and emerging technologies product groups. And we experienced large deal wins, cross-selling and strong renewals within our top deals.  The strength of our results are evidence of the strong demand for technologies that address the modernization of IT and customers' desire to work in an open hybrid cloud world. Red Hat continues to grow by better enabling our customers to build, deploy and manage their applications across multiple environments and infrastructures. 
With that overview, let me discuss a few of our recent technology, marketing and partnership highlights. First, as a premier sponsor of the OpenStack Summit in Tokyo, we took the opportunity to highlight our enterprise customers' success stories across a variety of verticals including telecommunications, education and banking. At the conference, we also jointly demonstrated our NFV offerings for OpenStack with the service provider panel that included Verizon, China Mobile and Telus. In addition, we announced an expanded relationship with Lenovo to provide Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack platform with Lenovo hardware to bring more secure, reliable and flexible platforms to enterprise IT looking to build hybrid cloud deployments. 
Second, we enhanced our management capabilities with the acquisition of Ansible, an open source IT automation software company launched in 2013. We chose Ansible because it is aligned with the core principles that shape Red Hat's management strategy in the following ways:
Ansible is simple to use since it's agentless. Its playbooks make it easier to both write and maintain automation workflows. The team has built a highly popular open source project with a strong community. Ansible technologies support heterogeneous IT environments including Linux, Microsoft, AWS and the Google Cloud. And they expand our capabilities to offer application management across the 4 footprints of physical, virtual, private cloud and public cloud. 
The integration of Ansible is well underway, and we're hearing strong interest from customers. And there is great internal excitement for the additional value they bring to our technology stack. In fact, the Ansible team had great momentum and closed several new wins, including their largest deal to date, a 6-figure deal with a global transportation technology provider. As part of our management portfolio, Ansible's role in dev ops and automation will be an important component of how Red Hat helps customers modernize their IT applications in the world of continuous deployment. 
 
Third, we launched a strategic partnership with Microsoft that was really a milestone event for the industry. Both Microsoft and Red Hat share the same view that it will be a hybrid cloud world, and we are working together to enable customers to realize the benefits of this transformation of IT. Let me describe and provide an update on some of the key elements of the partnership. 
RHEL is the preferred choice for enterprise Linux workflows on Azure and is now available for customers, representing the first deliverable of the partnership. We've already established customer -- have already enabled customers to take full advantage of their Red Hat subscriptions at Azure through the Red Hat Cloud Access program, where customers are able to bring their own subscriptions to run in Azure and be fully supported by both Red Hat and Microsoft. Customers will now be able to build and deploy applications in Azure using subscriptions of RHEL, JBoss EAP, JBoss Web Server, Red Hat Gluster Storage and OpenStack -- sorry, OpenShift PaaS.
In the coming months, Red Hat technologies on demand will also be available in Azure. These pay-as-you-go RHEL images will be available in the Azure marketplace and supported by Red Hat. Customers will be offered cross-platform, cross-company support spanning the Microsoft and Red Hat offerings in an integrated way, unlike any of our previous partnerships in the public cloud. We have already begun the co-locating support teams at Azure premises with the goal of making the customer experience simple and seamless at cloud speed. 
In addition, being able to manage workloads across a variety of environments and infrastructures will be an important capability for customers in the hybrid cloud world. The management solution to do this will be our CloudForms technology. This month, we launched CloudForms 4.0, which gives customers the ability to manage RHEL on both Hyper-V and Azure. 
We're also collaborating on .NET for our new generation of application development capabilities. The plan is it enable developers to access .NET technologies across Red Hat offerings, including OpenShift and RHEL, jointly backed by Microsoft and Red Hat. RHEL will be the primary Microsoft development and reference operating system for .NET Core on Linux. This is an exciting partnership for our joint customers, and I look forward to updating you on our progress. 
In summary, I am pleased with our execution and results so far this year. I'm looking forward to a strong finish to the fiscal year, where we expect to achieve the $2 billion revenue milestone. Beyond this year, we have a compelling opportunity in front of us and exciting work to do to achieve our potential in the open hybrid cloud. 
In closing, I want to thank Red Hat associates around the globe for their hard work. Red Hat's associates have created an exciting, enviable place to make a difference. In fact, Red Hat was recently recognized among the top 50 Best Places to Work in Glassdoor's 2016 survey. Red Hat has been built by a truly passionate and talented team, and I'm honored to be a part of it. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Frank."

We executed well with another strong quarter, which resulted in our ability to exceed our guidance across a number of metrics.

We executed well with another strong quarter, which resulted in our ability to exceed our guidance across a number of metrics. We continue to see our investments in emerging technologies, expanded partnerships in high-caliber sales teams contributing to the high growth. This marked our fourth consecutive quarter of 20%-plus total revenue growth on a constant-currency basis. 
Let me first start with my remarks with the financial highlights of our Q3 performance and then update our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. For a more detailed view of our results and metrics, please refer to our press release, supplemental metrics and a copy of our prepared remarks that are available in the Investor Relations section of redhat.com. 
Here are the Q3 financial highlights. We were pleased to see total revenue of $524 million, which grew 21% on a year-over-year basis in constant currency or 15% in U.S. dollars. Taking into account the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, total revenue would have been $28 million or 630 basis points higher using the rates from Q3 of last year. Due to the continued high FX volatility, I will provide both U.S. dollar and constant-currency results for the quarter using the rates from Q3 last year where it's appropriate. 
Our revenue performance for the quarter exceeded the high end of our guidance by approximately $1 million on a U.S. dollar basis and approximately $4 million when using the exchange rates we provided in our guidance in September. Our better-than-expected revenue performance this quarter resulted from continued strong demand that Jim just referenced, as well as execution across our organization. The main driver of our total revenue growth was subscription revenue of $457 million, an increase of 22% in constant currency and 16% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. This renewable revenue stream now constitutes 87% of total revenue, which provides us with a high level of revenue visibility in addition to future growth opportunities as we renew and expand our customer relationships. 
Breaking out the subscription revenue by technology, we are very pleased to see the subscription revenue for the Infrastructure-related offerings was $373 million, an increase of 18% in constant currency and 12% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. And particular to note, our subscription revenue for application development-related and emerging technologies offerings was $84 million, an increase of 45% in constant currency and 37% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Application development-related and emerging technologies revenue was approximately 60% of total revenue, and this is up from 14% of total revenue in the year-ago quarter. 
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income grew 13%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 23.5%. This non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 60 basis points above our guidance, which as a reminder included the expenses related to the Ansible acquisition. The 60 basis points of margin upside was due in part to the stronger revenue growth. 
With investments in our growth initiatives, we added approximately 400 associates this quarter, including approximately 50 associates related to the acquisition of Ansible. As we build our talent base of key skill sets, we have added approximately 950 associates through Q3 and we are on track to add more than 1,250 associates for the full fiscal year. 
Using our estimated annual effective tax rate of 29%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.48, $0.02 above the guidance we provided after the Ansible acquisition. Higher revenue and disciplined spending were the main drivers of the EPS upside. 
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $1.87 billion. We returned $78 million to shareholders from repurchasing approximately 987,000 shares of stock. And we had approximately $352 million remaining on the current share repurchase authorization at the end of the quarter. 
Total deferred revenue at quarter end was $1.49 billion, an increase of $187 million or 14% over the same quarter a year ago. On a constant-currency basis, total deferred revenue would have been up 20%. The total change in deferred revenue from our cash flow statement that neutralizes most of the impact of currency fluctuations was an increase of $97 million. 
Operating cash flow of $140 million for the quarter was up 5% year-over-year. The timing of customer collections and cash disbursements can affect the growth rate on a single quarter basis. The year-to-date operating cash flow was up 16%. 
Our rolling 4 quarters billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, the billings proxy was $559 million, up 15% year-over-year. On a constant-currency basis, this metric would have been 21%. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of 20%-plus year-over-year growth, demonstrating our consistent growth in the business. This metric also reflects both the higher bookings duration in Q3 of last year of 24 months and the 22-month average duration we have experienced in Q3 of this fiscal year. As we look ahead, we would expect the bookings duration for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 to be closer to the historic 21-month level compared to the 22 months in Q4 a year ago. 
I will now review the metrics for business momentum and the large deals in the quarter. Across all geographies, we saw continued growth in our bookings despite FX headwinds. This quarter, 60% of the bookings came from the Americas, 26% from EMEA and 14% from Asia-Pacific versus a 62%-25%-13% split in Q3 of last year. 
The Q3 sales route to market mix was 67% from the channel and 33% from our direct sales force compared to a 70%-30% split in Q3 of last year. Consistent with Q3 seasonality, we closed a number of large direct deals and continue to target an annual goal of a 70%-30% split. 
Within our top largest -- 30 top largest deals, all of them were approximately $1 million or more. Within that, we had 11 deals that were in excess of $5 million. And of these deals, 3 were over $10 million. 
Cross-selling was strong, with 70% of the deals including one or more components from our group of application development and emerging technologies offerings. We expect the growing adoption of these technologies like Middleware, the RHEL OpenStack platform, OpenShift, cloud management and storage to continue to drive revenue growth.  
The top vertical for the quarter was financial followed closely by mainstream customers in sectors such as health care, transportation and retail. 
On our renewal business, we once again renewed all of the top 25 deals that we were expecting. The total subscription value of these 25 renewals was approximately 120% of the prior value. 
 
Jim discussed Red Hat's increasing strategic importance with customers. This quarter, we had a great example of this with the third largest deal of the quarter, a global financial services customer that renewed in excess of $10 million. First, let me give you some background. This global financial services customer was an early adopter of Linux and ran a mixed Linux environment. Around 2007, the customer decided on a Linux vendor offering free multiyear support on their Linux distribution. 
The account team did not give up on this customer, and by fiscal year 2013, the customer decided to standardize on RHEL, and we closed a multiyear deal for approximately $2 million. Through exemplary account management, we renewed this customer this quarter to a significant 3-year commitment in excess of $10 million. We have not only expanded the footprint of RHEL, but we are also helping this customer realize the benefits of private cloud computing, software-defined storage and containers. This customer is now buying RHEL, CloudForms, Red Hat Storage, OpenShift and OpenStack. So I want to just say congratulations to the account team for an exceptional job of focusing on the needs of the customer. 
I would like now to turn to our guidance. Our outlook assumes similar business conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as of December 17, 2015, which included a dollar to euro of $1.09 and a yen to dollar of JPY 123. Foreign exchange rates remain very volatile and may change from the rates we are using today. Our guidance also reaffirms our Q4 outlook for the Ansible acquisition, which we closed in October. 
I'm pleased to announce that despite the impact of weaker foreign exchange rates, we are raising our full year revenue guidance to $2.044 billion to $2.048 billion, up approximately 15% in U.S. dollars or approximately 20% in constant currency at the high end of the range. The annual revenue guidance is up approximately $12 million in constant currency from the high end of range of our September guidance. 
We are modestly increasing operating margin to approximately 23.5%, and we're improving the cash flow by tightening the range from $695 million to $705 million. 
We are also increasing our target of full year non-GAAP earnings per share to approximately $1.86 per share, assuming a 29% annual effective tax rate and a $1 million per quarter forecast for other income. This EPS is approximately $0.03 higher than the midpoint of the guidance we provided after the Ansible acquisition. 
For Q4 specifically, this implies the following outlook:  We expect revenue to be in the range of $535 million to $539 million, which is up 16% in U.S. dollars at the high end of the range, or up approximately 20% in constant currency. This is an increase of $10 million from our previous implied fourth quarter guidance on a constant-currency basis. 
We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 22.5%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of the $0.47. Both of these estimates include the previous guidance on the impact of Ansible in Q4, which equates to approximately $0.02 a share. 
Consistent with prior practices, I will not forecast quarterly cash flow even though there is an implied range in the full year outlook. 
Overall, we are very pleased with our financial performance in the third quarter. We are excited about the strategic leadership position for both open source and hybrid cloud computing as we are confident in the long term to continue to grow our market share. Given our higher outlook for revenue, non-GAAP operating margin and EPS, we look forward to a strong finish to the fiscal year. 
Operator, I would now like to turn it back to you for the first question."

We didn't talk about it, we hadn't been asked about it this much, but we've seen a really strong performance there.

First of all, from an engineering perspective, in addition to the base core business that we've had and expanding the platform, especially around the emerging products, sales support, platform and engineering is where we've had the growth this year. But even more important is to scale from a global perspective in being able to bring those emerging technologies out into that global marketplace. So getting additional coverage as well as working with various partners in investments that we have to make in our go-to-market to get broader coverage and be able to sustain and improve that growth rate has been the focus. One of the things that we talked about over the last 2 quarters is trying to accelerate the investment in Q3 and Q4, which we have done. It is part of what we just saw this quarter and what's in the forecast for the next quarter, to enable us to continue with that story as we go into the new fiscal year. As far as the margins, I mean I think we've had very healthy margins this year, closing out the year at operating margin at 23.5%, I think, is extremely well positioned. It's slightly above where we were last year. And our objective, and I know that's also what investors are looking for, is to enable us to continue that. But again, we're trying to balance, grow as well as also sustain those margins. So as we get into closing out this year and we give our guidance for FY '17, I think we'll have a better sense for how that will be for next year. And we're doing a lot of that strategic planning right now. It's underway for the last month or so, and we'll continue that throughout this quarter. And I think that will help us position the right balance of going after growth and the investments we need to support that so we'll be able to see good profitability."

But it's certainly something we have both kind of brand permission from our customers and capability to do. But we have great partners in that space right now, and we have a lot of other things that we're looking to execute on, so at this point, it hasn't kind of hit our radar as an area to do a product offering. That's expensive. It's a different buyer. It's a whole different set of technologies. So making the decision to do that and do that as a kind of mission-critical way that Red Hat does open source, it would be expensive. So we're focused on cloud right now."

And more likely in most of the scenarios, it's really kind of expanding across emerging products, right. So and that's why even in our top deals, we're seeing more with OpenStack, OpenShift, Middleware. So that's a good momentum and it's continuing for the last couple of quarters. I would expect that to continue as we look at the next couple of quarters and seeing a similar type balance. So as I said, it's a good model to have."

And then back on what I was saying as far as the investments, more of the investments are in the expansion of our go-to-market so that we can help support the emerging products, which tend to have a longer sales cycle, and enable to continue the momentum that we're seeing in OpenStack and OpenShift, and then also from the perspective of coverage, right. Because we do not have -- we've been growing at a great rate, but we still have opportunity in all our geographies to go after new accounts. And it goes back to even the question that we had before. It's great that we have the renewals and we have the upsell, but we also want to make sure that we're going after new accounts. And as we go into FY '17, that's a major focus for us is to go after new accounts. And in order to go after new accounts, you have some investments that you need to make. So a combination of new accounts investment, as well as the expansion of the emerging market. Just earlier today, I was talking with our service -- lead of our services business, and that's another great example as far as the investment we're making in services. Services is kind of a presale for us to get customers on RHEL, or more importantly, to get them on emerging products. And usually, it requires an investment somewhere in the 6- to 9-month time frame. So we're making those kinds of investments, which is going to bring future growth."

But 21 months seems to be the historic duration. It's one that we're actually saying is going to be the case as we go into Q4. That 21-month, that duration, that short-term deferred also supports our revenue for the coming years. So I think we're not giving guidance for FY '17, but clearly, our objective would be to help support that type of continuation of a growth rate going forward with the new opportunities, both renewals as well as new customers.

And so it will be big, but the relative way in which it will scale over time will just be a more natural ramp. So at some point, in any ramp, there's kind of the S-curve kink up. And is that kink up next year or just beyond? It's hard to exactly say. We're really, really pleased with the customers, the workloads people are putting on it, the experience that people are now having. So at some point, the S-curve will really kind of kink up, but it's hard for me to give you an exact kind of time on that."

But even on the emerging products, again I've just got back from trips to both Asia and EMEA, and most of those conversations are around containers and dev ops and OpenStack, OpenShift. And so I don't really see any difference, which I agree with you is kind of a bit surprising. We generally think of the U.S. as an early adopter, but it really is strong across the world."

We've already started that, and we've got engineers on both sides. We'll continue to ramp those engineers as necessary, so kind of monitoring their success. Working between 2 companies is always a challenge, but we feel optimistic that we can kind of work to it. The other piece is the .NET. And again, it's early, so we want to see what type of traction that we have on .NET.

So as we continue to work through this, we'll come up with some metrics.

I'm pleased to announce that we delivered another strong quarter, with both revenue and profitability exceeding our guidance for Q3. Even more importantly, looking forward, we continued to strengthen our leadership position in the emerging open hybrid cloud sector. 
Red Hat associates are executing at a high level across the company as we further increase our strategic importance with customers. We believe that Red Hat is highly differentiated in our ability to help organizations transform their IT to be more agile and improve their customers' experiences. 
This led to the Q3 results that demonstrated solid growth across all major geographies, consistently high revenue growth in both our infrastructure, as well as our application development and emerging technologies product groups. And we experienced large deal wins, cross-selling and strong renewals within our top deals.  The strength of our results are evidence of the strong demand for technologies that address the modernization of IT and customers' desire to work in an open hybrid cloud world. Red Hat continues to grow by better enabling our customers to build, deploy and manage their applications across multiple environments and infrastructures. 
With that overview, let me discuss a few of our recent technology, marketing and partnership highlights. First, as a premier sponsor of the OpenStack Summit in Tokyo, we took the opportunity to highlight our enterprise customers' success stories across a variety of verticals including telecommunications, education and banking. At the conference, we also jointly demonstrated our NFV offerings for OpenStack with the service provider panel that included Verizon, China Mobile and Telus. In addition, we announced an expanded relationship with Lenovo to provide Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack platform with Lenovo hardware to bring more secure, reliable and flexible platforms to enterprise IT looking to build hybrid cloud deployments. 
Second, we enhanced our management capabilities with the acquisition of Ansible, an open source IT automation software company launched in 2013. We chose Ansible because it is aligned with the core principles that shape Red Hat's management strategy in the following ways:
Ansible is simple to use since it's agentless. Its playbooks make it easier to both write and maintain automation workflows. The team has built a highly popular open source project with a strong community. Ansible technologies support heterogeneous IT environments including Linux, Microsoft, AWS and the Google Cloud. And they expand our capabilities to offer application management across the 4 footprints of physical, virtual, private cloud and public cloud. 
The integration of Ansible is well underway, and we're hearing strong interest from customers. And there is great internal excitement for the additional value they bring to our technology stack. In fact, the Ansible team had great momentum and closed several new wins, including their largest deal to date, a 6-figure deal with a global transportation technology provider. As part of our management portfolio, Ansible's role in dev ops and automation will be an important component of how Red Hat helps customers modernize their IT applications in the world of continuous deployment. 
 
Third, we launched a strategic partnership with Microsoft that was really a milestone event for the industry. Both Microsoft and Red Hat share the same view that it will be a hybrid cloud world, and we are working together to enable customers to realize the benefits of this transformation of IT. Let me describe and provide an update on some of the key elements of the partnership. 
RHEL is the preferred choice for enterprise Linux workflows on Azure and is now available for customers, representing the first deliverable of the partnership. We've already established customer -- have already enabled customers to take full advantage of their Red Hat subscriptions at Azure through the Red Hat Cloud Access program, where customers are able to bring their own subscriptions to run in Azure and be fully supported by both Red Hat and Microsoft. Customers will now be able to build and deploy applications in Azure using subscriptions of RHEL, JBoss EAP, JBoss Web Server, Red Hat Gluster Storage and OpenStack -- sorry, OpenShift PaaS.
In the coming months, Red Hat technologies on demand will also be available in Azure. These pay-as-you-go RHEL images will be available in the Azure marketplace and supported by Red Hat. Customers will be offered cross-platform, cross-company support spanning the Microsoft and Red Hat offerings in an integrated way, unlike any of our previous partnerships in the public cloud. We have already begun the co-locating support teams at Azure premises with the goal of making the customer experience simple and seamless at cloud speed. 
In addition, being able to manage workloads across a variety of environments and infrastructures will be an important capability for customers in the hybrid cloud world. The management solution to do this will be our CloudForms technology. This month, we launched CloudForms 4.0, which gives customers the ability to manage RHEL on both Hyper-V and Azure. 
We're also collaborating on .NET for our new generation of application development capabilities. The plan is it enable developers to access .NET technologies across Red Hat offerings, including OpenShift and RHEL, jointly backed by Microsoft and Red Hat. RHEL will be the primary Microsoft development and reference operating system for .NET Core on Linux. This is an exciting partnership for our joint customers, and I look forward to updating you on our progress. 
In summary, I am pleased with our execution and results so far this year. I'm looking forward to a strong finish to the fiscal year, where we expect to achieve the $2 billion revenue milestone. Beyond this year, we have a compelling opportunity in front of us and exciting work to do to achieve our potential in the open hybrid cloud. 
In closing, I want to thank Red Hat associates around the globe for their hard work. Red Hat's associates have created an exciting, enviable place to make a difference. In fact, Red Hat was recently recognized among the top 50 Best Places to Work in Glassdoor's 2016 survey. Red Hat has been built by a truly passionate and talented team, and I'm honored to be a part of it. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Frank."

We executed well with another strong quarter, which resulted in our ability to exceed our guidance across a number of metrics. We continue to see our investments in emerging technologies, expanded partnerships in high-caliber sales teams contributing to the high growth. This marked our fourth consecutive quarter of 20%-plus total revenue growth on a constant-currency basis. 
Let me first start with my remarks with the financial highlights of our Q3 performance and then update our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. For a more detailed view of our results and metrics, please refer to our press release, supplemental metrics and a copy of our prepared remarks that are available in the Investor Relations section of redhat.com. 
Here are the Q3 financial highlights. We were pleased to see total revenue of $524 million, which grew 21% on a year-over-year basis in constant currency or 15% in U.S. dollars. Taking into account the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, total revenue would have been $28 million or 630 basis points higher using the rates from Q3 of last year. Due to the continued high FX volatility, I will provide both U.S. dollar and constant-currency results for the quarter using the rates from Q3 last year where it's appropriate. 
Our revenue performance for the quarter exceeded the high end of our guidance by approximately $1 million on a U.S. dollar basis and approximately $4 million when using the exchange rates we provided in our guidance in September. Our better-than-expected revenue performance this quarter resulted from continued strong demand that Jim just referenced, as well as execution across our organization. The main driver of our total revenue growth was subscription revenue of $457 million, an increase of 22% in constant currency and 16% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. This renewable revenue stream now constitutes 87% of total revenue, which provides us with a high level of revenue visibility in addition to future growth opportunities as we renew and expand our customer relationships. 
Breaking out the subscription revenue by technology, we are very pleased to see the subscription revenue for the Infrastructure-related offerings was $373 million, an increase of 18% in constant currency and 12% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. And particular to note, our subscription revenue for application development-related and emerging technologies offerings was $84 million, an increase of 45% in constant currency and 37% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Application development-related and emerging technologies revenue was approximately 60% of total revenue, and this is up from 14% of total revenue in the year-ago quarter. 
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income grew 13%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 23.5%. This non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 60 basis points above our guidance, which as a reminder included the expenses related to the Ansible acquisition. The 60 basis points of margin upside was due in part to the stronger revenue growth. 
With investments in our growth initiatives, we added approximately 400 associates this quarter, including approximately 50 associates related to the acquisition of Ansible. As we build our talent base of key skill sets, we have added approximately 950 associates through Q3 and we are on track to add more than 1,250 associates for the full fiscal year. 
Using our estimated annual effective tax rate of 29%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.48, $0.02 above the guidance we provided after the Ansible acquisition. Higher revenue and disciplined spending were the main drivers of the EPS upside. 
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $1.87 billion. We returned $78 million to shareholders from repurchasing approximately 987,000 shares of stock. And we had approximately $352 million remaining on the current share repurchase authorization at the end of the quarter. 
Total deferred revenue at quarter end was $1.49 billion, an increase of $187 million or 14% over the same quarter a year ago. On a constant-currency basis, total deferred revenue would have been up 20%. The total change in deferred revenue from our cash flow statement that neutralizes most of the impact of currency fluctuations was an increase of $97 million. 
Operating cash flow of $140 million for the quarter was up 5% year-over-year. The timing of customer collections and cash disbursements can affect the growth rate on a single quarter basis. The year-to-date operating cash flow was up 16%. 
Our rolling 4 quarters billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, the billings proxy was $559 million, up 15% year-over-year. On a constant-currency basis, this metric would have been 21%. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of 20%-plus year-over-year growth, demonstrating our consistent growth in the business. This metric also reflects both the higher bookings duration in Q3 of last year of 24 months and the 22-month average duration we have experienced in Q3 of this fiscal year. As we look ahead, we would expect the bookings duration for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 to be closer to the historic 21-month level compared to the 22 months in Q4 a year ago. 
I will now review the metrics for business momentum and the large deals in the quarter. Across all geographies, we saw continued growth in our bookings despite FX headwinds. This quarter, 60% of the bookings came from the Americas, 26% from EMEA and 14% from Asia-Pacific versus a 62%-25%-13% split in Q3 of last year. 
The Q3 sales route to market mix was 67% from the channel and 33% from our direct sales force compared to a 70%-30% split in Q3 of last year. Consistent with Q3 seasonality, we closed a number of large direct deals and continue to target an annual goal of a 70%-30% split. 
Within our top largest -- 30 top largest deals, all of them were approximately $1 million or more. Within that, we had 11 deals that were in excess of $5 million. And of these deals, 3 were over $10 million. 
Cross-selling was strong, with 70% of the deals including one or more components from our group of application development and emerging technologies offerings. We expect the growing adoption of these technologies like Middleware, the RHEL OpenStack platform, OpenShift, cloud management and storage to continue to drive revenue growth.  
The top vertical for the quarter was financial followed closely by mainstream customers in sectors such as health care, transportation and retail. 
On our renewal business, we once again renewed all of the top 25 deals that we were expecting. The total subscription value of these 25 renewals was approximately 120% of the prior value. 
 
Jim discussed Red Hat's increasing strategic importance with customers. This quarter, we had a great example of this with the third largest deal of the quarter, a global financial services customer that renewed in excess of $10 million. First, let me give you some background. This global financial services customer was an early adopter of Linux and ran a mixed Linux environment. Around 2007, the customer decided on a Linux vendor offering free multiyear support on their Linux distribution. 
The account team did not give up on this customer, and by fiscal year 2013, the customer decided to standardize on RHEL, and we closed a multiyear deal for approximately $2 million. Through exemplary account management, we renewed this customer this quarter to a significant 3-year commitment in excess of $10 million. We have not only expanded the footprint of RHEL, but we are also helping this customer realize the benefits of private cloud computing, software-defined storage and containers. This customer is now buying RHEL, CloudForms, Red Hat Storage, OpenShift and OpenStack. So I want to just say congratulations to the account team for an exceptional job of focusing on the needs of the customer. 
I would like now to turn to our guidance. Our outlook assumes similar business conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as of December 17, 2015, which included a dollar to euro of $1.09 and a yen to dollar of JPY 123. Foreign exchange rates remain very volatile and may change from the rates we are using today. Our guidance also reaffirms our Q4 outlook for the Ansible acquisition, which we closed in October. 
I'm pleased to announce that despite the impact of weaker foreign exchange rates, we are raising our full year revenue guidance to $2.044 billion to $2.048 billion, up approximately 15% in U.S. dollars or approximately 20% in constant currency at the high end of the range. The annual revenue guidance is up approximately $12 million in constant currency from the high end of range of our September guidance. 
We are modestly increasing operating margin to approximately 23.5%, and we're improving the cash flow by tightening the range from $695 million to $705 million. 
We are also increasing our target of full year non-GAAP earnings per share to approximately $1.86 per share, assuming a 29% annual effective tax rate and a $1 million per quarter forecast for other income. This EPS is approximately $0.03 higher than the midpoint of the guidance we provided after the Ansible acquisition. 
For Q4 specifically, this implies the following outlook:  We expect revenue to be in the range of $535 million to $539 million, which is up 16% in U.S. dollars at the high end of the range, or up approximately 20% in constant currency. This is an increase of $10 million from our previous implied fourth quarter guidance on a constant-currency basis. 
We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 22.5%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of the $0.47. Both of these estimates include the previous guidance on the impact of Ansible in Q4, which equates to approximately $0.02 a share. 
Consistent with prior practices, I will not forecast quarterly cash flow even though there is an implied range in the full year outlook. 
Overall, we are very pleased with our financial performance in the third quarter. We are excited about the strategic leadership position for both open source and hybrid cloud computing as we are confident in the long term to continue to grow our market share. Given our higher outlook for revenue, non-GAAP operating margin and EPS, we look forward to a strong finish to the fiscal year. 
Operator, I would now like to turn it back to you for the first question."

We didn't talk about it, we hadn't been asked about it this much, but we've seen a really strong performance there.

And so that drives the natural share shift as we get a larger and larger percentage of the application portfolio every year. In terms of OpenShift, we just launched the Dedicated Instances, which a lot of our enterprises wanted a couple of weeks ago. So virtually, all of the traction that I was talking about in terms of dollars and the big deals is all on-premise OpenShift Enterprise.

First of all, from an engineering perspective, in addition to the base core business that we've had and expanding the platform, especially around the emerging products, sales support, platform and engineering is where we've had the growth this year. But even more important is to scale from a global perspective in being able to bring those emerging technologies out into that global marketplace. So getting additional coverage as well as working with various partners in investments that we have to make in our go-to-market to get broader coverage and be able to sustain and improve that growth rate has been the focus. One of the things that we talked about over the last 2 quarters is trying to accelerate the investment in Q3 and Q4, which we have done. It is part of what we just saw this quarter and what's in the forecast for the next quarter, to enable us to continue with that story as we go into the new fiscal year. As far as the margins, I mean I think we've had very healthy margins this year, closing out the year at operating margin at 23.5%, I think, is extremely well positioned. It's slightly above where we were last year. And our objective, and I know that's also what investors are looking for, is to enable us to continue that. But again, we're trying to balance, grow as well as also sustain those margins. So as we get into closing out this year and we give our guidance for FY '17, I think we'll have a better sense for how that will be for next year. And we're doing a lot of that strategic planning right now. It's underway for the last month or so, and we'll continue that throughout this quarter. And I think that will help us position the right balance of going after growth and the investments we need to support that so we'll be able to see good profitability."

The examples that I provided earlier is a good example of a renewal where it was kind of an improvement in the amount, like 120% above what they were spending before. So we're seeing on average not only a high amount of renewals, but also an increase in the amount of purchase spend. And more likely in most of the scenarios, it's really kind of expanding across emerging products, right. So and that's why even in our top deals, we're seeing more with OpenStack, OpenShift, Middleware. So that's a good momentum and it's continuing for the last couple of quarters. I would expect that to continue as we look at the next couple of quarters and seeing a similar type balance. So as I said, it's a good model to have."

So that's factored in there, so you need to kind of look at it from that perspective. And then back on what I was saying as far as the investments, more of the investments are in the expansion of our go-to-market so that we can help support the emerging products, which tend to have a longer sales cycle, and enable to continue the momentum that we're seeing in OpenStack and OpenShift, and then also from the perspective of coverage, right. Because we do not have -- we've been growing at a great rate, but we still have opportunity in all our geographies to go after new accounts. And it goes back to even the question that we had before. It's great that we have the renewals and we have the upsell, but we also want to make sure that we're going after new accounts. And as we go into FY '17, that's a major focus for us is to go after new accounts. And in order to go after new accounts, you have some investments that you need to make. So a combination of new accounts investment, as well as the expansion of the emerging market. Just earlier today, I was talking with our service -- lead of our services business, and that's another great example as far as the investment we're making in services. Services is kind of a presale for us to get customers on RHEL, or more importantly, to get them on emerging products. And usually, it requires an investment somewhere in the 6- to 9-month time frame. So we're making those kinds of investments, which is going to bring future growth."

So RHEV for us, which is our scale-up VMware competitor, has continued to do well as we get in conversations around workloads. So I want to do OpenStack, but if I'm going to do that for scale out, I may as well look at RHEV with a similar technology stack under my scale up workload.

As far as the other part of your question, as I mentioned earlier and we've said in the past, if you look at our contract duration, historically, it's been around 21 months, and so it can fluctuate a little higher, a little lower. But 21 months seems to be the historic duration. It's one that we're actually saying is going to be the case as we go into Q4. That 21-month, that duration, that short-term deferred also supports our revenue for the coming years. So I think we're not giving guidance for FY '17, but clearly, our objective would be to help support that type of continuation of a growth rate going forward with the new opportunities, both renewals as well as new customers.

I guess is there any sort of lag or anything you could -- and I guess, around that, do you feel like the emerging technologies distribution platform still needs to be built out internationally? Or is it just simply sort of a technology adoption update that you see, U.S. then international?"

The only thing that was a downer is it's even harder to find skilled resources in some of these countries, language capabilities, et cetera, et cetera. So internationally, we are very much supply constrained. Eight of our top 30 deals were in EMEA, to give an example. But even on the emerging products, again I've just got back from trips to both Asia and EMEA, and most of those conversations are around containers and dev ops and OpenStack, OpenShift. And so I don't really see any difference, which I agree with you is kind of a bit surprising. We generally think of the U.S. as an early adopter, but it really is strong across the world."

I mean, this took a while for it to come together. There are a lot of complexities around intellectual property and other things that we needed to make sure that we had right that were fully consistent with the GPL and our open source principles, and those things took a while. So no, the discussions have been underway for quite a long time. I think for both of us, we've had a lot of customers pushing us both to do this. A lot of customers, their infrastructure runs on RHEL, and they decided they would like to run that on Azure. And so this was really customer-driven that we ultimately got it done, but it was a -- kind of several quarters' worth of work to actually get it done. We're excited about the results."

And now we're making sure that the 2 companies can come together on the key areas. Of course, the first one is to be able to make the offering available to customers and start tracking the customers that actually move on to RHEL on Azure. Secondly, we have an agreement between the 2 companies to co-locate engineers to make sure that we can support some of the customers and make it a much better experience for them. We've already started that, and we've got engineers on both sides. We'll continue to ramp those engineers as necessary, so kind of monitoring their success. Working between 2 companies is always a challenge, but we feel optimistic that we can kind of work to it. The other piece is the .NET. And again, it's early, so we want to see what type of traction that we have on .NET. And then also just explore what other options we have working with Microsoft Azure as far as some of our other products, and that's where I think there's a lot more value. So as we continue to work through this, we'll come up with some metrics. Clearly, we have metrics internally, but ones that I think we can sure use externally to give you some traction or give you some indication of how the traction's working over time."
