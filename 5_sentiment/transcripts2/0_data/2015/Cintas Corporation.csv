With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Corporate Controller. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions.The Private Securities Litigat",798,"Good evening and thank you for joining us this evening as we report our third quarter results for fiscal 2015. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Corporate Controller. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions.
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion of these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
As we reported in today's press release, our results for continuing operations, adjusted to exclude all impact of the Document Management businesses are more representative of our ongoing performance. Therefore, our discussion of the company's performance will be based on the exclusion of Document Management.
We are pleased to report third quarter revenue of $1,109,000,000; organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency and the Shred-it transaction, was 7.5% for the third quarter. Each of our business's organic growth was positive for the third quarter, with rental organic growth being 7.8%; Uniform Direct Sales being 4.8%; and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection service's organic growth being 7.5%.
The third quarter revenue impact from severe winter weather and oil and gas related customers was relatively minor. Paul will touch on this when discussing the individual business results.
We're also pleased to show continued improvements in income as adjusted compared to last year's third quarter as adjusted, as operating income increased 17.1%, net income from continuing operations increased 20.2%, and earnings per diluted share increased 25%. Certainly lower energy related costs helped the comparison to last year, but we also feel good about our ability to leverage our infrastructure and manage our cost structure. Paul will discuss the energy related cost in more detail. We want to recognize our employees, whom we call partners, for their dedication and competitive urgency in serving our customers. They continue to do a great job.
Let me make a few comments about the Shred-it investment. First, regarding the presentation on the income statement, we have pulled the results out of SG&A and included and aligned under income taxes entitled Loss on Investments in Shred-it Net of Tax. This is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and provides a clear indication of the performance of the business.
Second, regarding the third quarter impact, we recognize the $6.8 million net loss for our third quarter or negative $0.06 per share. This negative impact was primarily due to integration costs, such as IT, system conversion costs and rebranding costs. In addition, Shred-it has a fairly large presence in Canada and a weakening of the Canadian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar also had a negative impact. The conversion in general though continues to progress as planned, and we are pleased with the performance of the business.
We indicated in today's press release that we acquired 3.2 million shares of our common stock during the third quarter. The total cost was $251 million and the average cost per share wore $78.84. This buyback had a $0.01 positive impact on our third quarter EPS, and we expect it to benefit the fourth quarter by $0.02. As we announced on the past January 13, the Cintas board authorized a new buyback program of $500 million, and that entire program remains available as of today.
We also announced in today's press release that we have updated our guidance. We now expect our fiscal '15 revenue to be in the range of $4.46 billion to $4.49 billion. We have tightened the revenue range slightly to reflect continued weakening of the Canadian dollar and for potential oil and gas related customer impact. While we did not see any noticeable revenue impact in the third quarter from our oil and gas related customers, we did begin to hear from them that a negative impact is coming.
On the EPS side, we now expect our fiscal '15 earnings per diluted share guidance to be in the range of $3.55 to $3.58. When excluding the special items of the impact of the Document Shredding business and the additional gain on the Shred-it transaction, the impact of the sale of stock in an equity investment and the impact of discontinued operations, including the sale of the Document Storage and Imaging business, we expect fiscal '15 earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $3.31 to $3.34. This EPS guidance is detailed in a table within today's press release.
I'll now turn the call over to Paul for more details on the third quarter performance."

Before moving into the third quarter results, let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in this year's third quarter, which is the same as last year's third quarter.

Before moving into the third quarter results, let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in this year's third quarter, which is the same as last year's third quarter. Our fourth quarter will have 65 workdays, which is the same as last year's fourth quarter for a total of 260 workdays for the fiscal year. Looking ahead to next fiscal year, this fiscal '16 will have 262 workdays, so 2 more than this year. By quarter, the workdays will be 66 in the first quarter, 65 in the second and third quarters and 66 in the fourth quarter.
As Mike mentioned, total revenue the quarter increased 7.0%, excluding last year's impact of Document Shredding. Total revenue increased organically by 7.5%. Total company gross margin was 42.9% for the third quarter of this year compared to 42.3% in last year's third quarter. The current quarter gross margin of 42.9% expanded 80 basis points from last year's third quarter gross margin of 42.1%, adjusted to exclude Document Shredding.
Total company energy related expenses for this year's third quarter were 2.4%. Last year's third quarter energy related expenses were 3.2%. But excluding Document Management, they were 3.0%. I'll discuss gross margin and energy related expenses by business in just a moment.
Before doing so, let me remind you that we have 3 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection services. Uniform Direct Sales and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection services are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.
The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue was $859.5 million, which is up 7.2% compared to last year's third quarter. Organic growth, which excluded the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency changes, was 7.8%. Organic growth was higher than total growth because of the continued weakening of the Canadian dollar. We did not see any noticeable third quarter revenue effect from oil and gas related customers. But as Mike mentioned, these customer's businesses did begin to feel the impact of the low oil prices in the latter part of the quarter. Aside from the oil and gas related customers, we saw no marketable change to net add-stops in the third quarter.
Our rental segment gross margin was 44.6% for the third quarter, an increase from 43.9% in last year's third quarter. Most of this improvement came from energy related costs, which were 70 basis points lower than in last year's third quarter. The third quarter rental segment gross margin of 44.6% was a slight decrease from this fiscal year's second quarter gross margin of 44.8%. Energy related costs in the third quarter were 20 basis points lower than in this fiscal year's second quarter.
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segments includes the direct sale of uniforms and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog.
Uniform Direct Sales revenue for the third quarter was $112.2 million, an increase of 4.2% compared to last year's third quarter. When adjusting for foreign currency changes, organic growth was 4.8%. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 27.7% for the third quarter, a slight improvement from last year's third quarter gross margin of 27.5%, and this year's second quarter gross margin of 27.6%. Both of these improvements are mostly due to lower energy related expenses.
Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue for the third quarter was $137.1 million, which was 8.2% higher than last year's third quarter. Organic growth was 7.5%. We continue to be very pleased with this business.
Third quarter organic growth came down some from previous quarters due to fewer repair jobs on the fire protection side of the business and due to the severe winter weather in the Northeast. This segment's gross margin was 44.3% in the third quarter, an improvement of 80 basis points compared to last year's third quarter gross margin of 43.5%. Energy related costs were 60 basis points lower than last year's third quarter.
The third quarter gross margin of 44.3% was also an improvement over this fiscal year's second quarter gross margin of 43.8%. Energy related cost accounted for 40 basis points of the improvement.
Switching to the selling and administrative expenses. Total company SG&A was 27.2% as a percentage of third quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's third quarter of 28.6%. But excluding the impact the Document Shredding had on last year's third quarter SG&A and revenue, last year's adjusted total company SG&A was 27.8% as a percentage of the adjusted revenue.
On our second quarter call, we indicated that our risk management claims experience was better than the previous year, and that better experience continued into our third quarter. Keep in mind, however, that we are self-insured. In addition to risk management, a number of other minor improvements were realized in other expense categories.
The third quarter SG&A of 27.2% was a 50 basis point increase compared to the 26.7% in this fiscal year's second quarter. As we mentioned on the second quarter call, payroll taxes reset in our third quarter. This expected increase was partially offset by a number of minor improvements and other expenses.
Our effective tax rate was 36.2% for the quarter compared to the 36.7% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. We expect the fiscal '15 effective tax rate to be 37.3%.
Our cash and marketable securities were $490 million at February 28, a decrease of $337 million from the $827 million at November 30. This decrease is due to paying the $202 million dividend in early December and the execution of the $251 million share buyback during the third quarter, partially offset by cash generated from our operating cash flows.
Accounts receivable decreased $12 million since November 30 due to the timing of collections. New goods inventory and in-service inventory levels at February 28 were relatively consistent with November 30 balances.
Accounts payable increased roughly $27 million since November 30 due to the timing of vendor payment due dates. Current accrued liabilities decreased by $221 million since November 30 due largely to the payment of the accrued dividend, which was paid in December.
Long-term debt remained at $1.3 billion, representing 1.6x EBITDA. And finally, CapEx for the third quarter was about $50 million. Our CapEx by operating segments was as follows: $43 million in rental, $2 million in Uniform Direct Sales and $5 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2015 to be in the range of $220 million to $250 million.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now be glad to answer any of your questions."

With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Corporate Controller. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions.The Private Securities Litiga",797,"Good evening, and thank you for joining us this evening as we report our third quarter results for fiscal 2015. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Corporate Controller. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions.
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
As we reported in today's press release, our results for continuing operations, adjusted to exclude all impact of the Document Management businesses, are more representative of our ongoing performance. Therefore, our discussion of the company's performance will be based on the exclusion of Document Management.
We are pleased to report third quarter revenue of $1,109,000,000. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency and the Shred-it transaction was 7.5% for the third quarter. Each of our business' organic growth was positive for the third quarter with rental organic growth being 7.8%; Uniform Direct Sales being 4.8%; and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services organic growth being 7.5%. The third quarter revenue impact from severe winter weather and oil and gas related customers was relatively minor. Paul will touch on this when discussing the individual business results.
We are also pleased to show continued improvements in income as adjusted compared to last year's third quarter as adjusted, as operating income increased 17.1%, net income from continuing operations increased 20.2%, and earnings per diluted share increased 25%. Certainly, lower energy-related costs helped the comparison to last year, but we also feel good about our ability to leverage our infrastructure and manage our cost structure. Paul will discuss the energy-related costs in more detail.
We want to recognize our employees, whom we call partners, for their dedication and competitive urgency in serving our customers. They continue to do a great job.
Let me make a few comments about the Shred-it investment. First, regarding the presentation on the income statement, we have pulled the results out of SG&A and included and aligned under income taxes entitled Loss on Investment in Shred-it Net of Tax. This is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and provides a clear indication of the performance of the business.
Second, regarding the third quarter impact, we recognize the $6.8 million net loss for our third quarter or negative $0.06 per share. This negative impact was primarily due to integration costs such as IT, system conversion costs and rebranding costs. In addition, Shred-it has a fairly large presence in Canada, and the weakening of the Canadian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar also had a negative impact. The conversion in general though continues to progress as planned, and we are pleased with the performance of the business.
We indicated in today's press release that we acquired 3.2 million shares of our common stock during the third quarter. The total cost was $251 million, and the average cost per share was $78.84. This buyback had a $0.01 positive impact on our third quarter EPS, and we expect it to benefit the fourth quarter by $0.02. As we announced on this past January 13, the Cintas board authorized a new buyback program of $500 million, and that entire program remains available as of today.
We also announced in today's press release that we have updated our guidance. We now expect our fiscal '15 revenue to be in the range of $4.46 billion to $4.49 billion. We have tightened the revenue range slightly to reflect continued weakening of the Canadian dollar and for potential oil and gas related customer impacts. While we did not see any noticeable revenue impact in the third quarter from our oil and gas related customers, we did begin to hear from them that a negative impact is coming.
On the EPS side, we now expect our fiscal '15 earnings per diluted share guidance to be in the range of $3.55 to $3.58. When excluding the special items of the impact of the Document Shredding business and the additional gain on the Shred-it transaction, the impact of the sale of stock in an equity investment and the impact of discontinued operations, including the sale of the Document Storage and Imaging business, we expect fiscal '15 earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $3.31 to $3.34. This EPS guidance is detailed in a table within today's press release.
I'll now turn the call over to Paul for more details on the third quarter performance."

Before moving into the third quarter results, let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in this year's third quarter, which is the same as last year's third quarter. Our fourth quarter will have 65 workdays, which is the same as last",1197,"Thank you, Mike. Before moving into the third quarter results, let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in this year's third quarter, which is the same as last year's third quarter. Our fourth quarter will have 65 workdays, which is the same as last year's fourth quarter for a total of 260 workdays for the fiscal year. Looking ahead to next fiscal year. This fiscal '16 will have 262 workdays, so 2 more than this year. By quarter, the workdays will be 66 in the first quarter, 65 in the second and third quarters and 66 in the fourth quarter.
As Mike mentioned, total revenue the quarter increased 7.0%, excluding last year's impact of Document Shredding. Total revenue increased organically by 7.5%. Total company gross margin was 42.9% for the third quarter of this year compared to 42.3% in last year's third quarter. The current quarter gross margin of 42.9% expanded 80 basis points from last year's third quarter gross margin of 42.1%, adjusted to exclude Document Shredding.
Total company energy-related expenses for this year's third quarter were 2.4%. Last year's third quarter energy-related expenses were 3.2%, but excluding Document Management, they were 3.0%. I'll discuss gross margin and energy-related expenses by business in just a moment.
Before doing so let me remind you that we have 3 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services. Uniform Direct Sales and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services are combined and presented as other services on the income statement.
The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue was $859.5 million, which is up 7.2% compared to last year's third quarter. Organic growth, which excluded the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency changes, was 7.8%. Organic growth was higher than total growth because of the continued weakening of the Canadian dollar. We did not see any noticeable third quarter revenue effect from oil and gas related customers, but as Mike mentioned, these customers' businesses did begin to feel the impact of the low oil prices in the latter part of the quarter. Aside from the oil and gas related customers, we saw no marketable change to net add-stops in the third quarter.
Our rental segment gross margin was 44.6% for the third quarter, an increase from 43.9% in last year's third quarter. Most of this improvement came from energy-related costs, which were 70 basis points lower than in last year's third quarter. The third quarter rental segment gross margin of 44.6% was a slight decrease from this fiscal year's second quarter gross margin of 44.8%. Energy-related costs in the third quarter were 20 basis points lower than in this fiscal year's second quarter.
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segments includes the direct sale of uniforms and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue for the third quarter was $112.2 million, an increase of 4.2% compared to last year's third quarter. When adjusting for foreign currency changes, organic growth was 4.8%. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 27.7% for the third quarter, a slight improvement from last year's third quarter gross margin of 27.5% and this year's second quarter gross margin of 27.6%. Both of these improvements are mostly due to lower energy-related expenses.
Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue for the third quarter was $137.1 million, which was 8.2% higher than last year's third quarter. Organic growth was 7.5%. We continue to be very pleased with this business.  Third quarter organic growth came down some from previous quarters due to fewer repair jobs on the fire protection side of the business and due to the severe winter weather in the Northeast. This segment's gross margin was 44.3% in the third quarter, an improvement of 80 basis points compared to last year's third quarter gross margin of 43.5%. Energy-related costs were 60 basis points lower than last year's third quarter. The third quarter gross margin of 44.3% was also an improvement over this fiscal year's second quarter gross margin of 43.8%. Energy-related costs accounted for 40 basis points of the improvements.
Switching to the selling and administrative expenses. Total company SG&A was 27.2% as a percentage of third quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's third quarter of 28.6%. When excluding the impact that Document Shredding had on last year's third quarter SG&A and revenue, last year's adjusted total company SG&A was 27.8% as a percentage of the adjusted revenue.
On our second quarter call, we indicated that our risk management claims experience was better than the previous year, and that better experience continued into our third quarter. Keep in mind, however, that we are self insured. In addition to risk management, a number of other minor improvements were realized in other expense categories.
The third quarter SG&A of 27.2% was a 50-basis-point increase compared to the 26.7% in this fiscal year's second quarter. As we mentioned on the second quarter call, payroll taxes reset in our third quarter. This expected increase was partially offset by a number of minor improvements and other expenses.
Our effective tax rate was 36.2% for the quarter compared to the 36.7% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. We expect the fiscal '15 effective tax rate to be 37.3%.
Our cash and marketable securities were $490 million at February 28, a decrease of $337 million from the $827 million at November 30. This decrease is due to paying the $202 million dividend in early December and the execution of the $251 million share buyback during the third quarter partially offset by cash generated from our operating cash flows.
Accounts receivable decreased $12 million since November 30 due to the timing of collections. New goods inventory and in-service inventory levels at February 28 were relatively consistent with November 30 balances. Accounts payable increased roughly $27 million since November 30 due to the timing of vendor payment due dates. Current accrued liabilities decreased by $221 million since November 30 due largely to the payment of the accrued dividend, which was paid in December.
Long-term debt remained at $1.3 billion, representing 1.6x EBITDA. And finally, CapEx for the third quarter was about $50 million. Our CapEx by operating segments was as follows: $43 million in rental; $2 million in Uniform Direct Sales; and $5 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2015 to be in the range of $220 million to $250 million.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now be glad to answer any of your questions."

I think Bill and I talked a little bit about that being relatively consistent throughout the year, and I wouldn't expect to change from that now."

From a rental standpoint, the operating margin was close to 50% in the second half of the year, the incremental operating margins. It's hard to keep that rate going for long periods of time. But we do still believe that we can have very good incremental margins because we've got quite an infrastructure around the U.S. and Canada, and we can continue to add products and services to our customers. And some of those are not -- some of the revenue that we're getting is not processed, so we're not really using any processing capacity. So we think there still certainly are good incremental margin opportunities as we move forward. Having said that, at the 50% clip, that's pretty hard to sustain over long periods of time."

With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Corporate Controller. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions.The Private Securities Litiga",797,"Good evening, and thank you for joining us this evening as we report our third quarter results for fiscal 2015. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Corporate Controller. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions.
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
As we reported in today's press release, our results for continuing operations, adjusted to exclude all impact of the Document Management businesses, are more representative of our ongoing performance. Therefore, our discussion of the company's performance will be based on the exclusion of Document Management.
We are pleased to report third quarter revenue of $1,109,000,000. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency and the Shred-it transaction was 7.5% for the third quarter. Each of our business' organic growth was positive for the third quarter with rental organic growth being 7.8%; Uniform Direct Sales being 4.8%; and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services organic growth being 7.5%. The third quarter revenue impact from severe winter weather and oil and gas related customers was relatively minor. Paul will touch on this when discussing the individual business results.
We are also pleased to show continued improvements in income as adjusted compared to last year's third quarter as adjusted, as operating income increased 17.1%, net income from continuing operations increased 20.2%, and earnings per diluted share increased 25%. Certainly, lower energy-related costs helped the comparison to last year, but we also feel good about our ability to leverage our infrastructure and manage our cost structure. Paul will discuss the energy-related costs in more detail.
We want to recognize our employees, whom we call partners, for their dedication and competitive urgency in serving our customers. They continue to do a great job.
Let me make a few comments about the Shred-it investment. First, regarding the presentation on the income statement, we have pulled the results out of SG&A and included and aligned under income taxes entitled Loss on Investment in Shred-it Net of Tax. This is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and provides a clear indication of the performance of the business.
Second, regarding the third quarter impact, we recognize the $6.8 million net loss for our third quarter or negative $0.06 per share. This negative impact was primarily due to integration costs such as IT, system conversion costs and rebranding costs. In addition, Shred-it has a fairly large presence in Canada, and the weakening of the Canadian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar also had a negative impact. The conversion in general though continues to progress as planned, and we are pleased with the performance of the business.
We indicated in today's press release that we acquired 3.2 million shares of our common stock during the third quarter. The total cost was $251 million, and the average cost per share was $78.84. This buyback had a $0.01 positive impact on our third quarter EPS, and we expect it to benefit the fourth quarter by $0.02. As we announced on this past January 13, the Cintas board authorized a new buyback program of $500 million, and that entire program remains available as of today.
We also announced in today's press release that we have updated our guidance. We now expect our fiscal '15 revenue to be in the range of $4.46 billion to $4.49 billion. We have tightened the revenue range slightly to reflect continued weakening of the Canadian dollar and for potential oil and gas related customer impacts. While we did not see any noticeable revenue impact in the third quarter from our oil and gas related customers, we did begin to hear from them that a negative impact is coming.
On the EPS side, we now expect our fiscal '15 earnings per diluted share guidance to be in the range of $3.55 to $3.58. When excluding the special items of the impact of the Document Shredding business and the additional gain on the Shred-it transaction, the impact of the sale of stock in an equity investment and the impact of discontinued operations, including the sale of the Document Storage and Imaging business, we expect fiscal '15 earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $3.31 to $3.34. This EPS guidance is detailed in a table within today's press release.
I'll now turn the call over to Paul for more details on the third quarter performance."

Before moving into the third quarter results, let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in this year's third quarter, which is the same as last year's third quarter. Our fourth quarter will have 65 workdays, which is the same as last",1197,"Thank you, Mike. Before moving into the third quarter results, let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in this year's third quarter, which is the same as last year's third quarter. Our fourth quarter will have 65 workdays, which is the same as last year's fourth quarter for a total of 260 workdays for the fiscal year. Looking ahead to next fiscal year. This fiscal '16 will have 262 workdays, so 2 more than this year. By quarter, the workdays will be 66 in the first quarter, 65 in the second and third quarters and 66 in the fourth quarter.
As Mike mentioned, total revenue in the quarter increased 7.0%, excluding last year's impact of Document Shredding. Total revenue increased organically by 7.5%. Total company gross margin was 42.9% for the third quarter of this year compared to 42.3% in last year's third quarter. The current quarter gross margin of 42.9% expanded 80 basis points from last year's third quarter gross margin of 42.1%, adjusted to exclude Document Shredding.
Total company energy-related expenses for this year's third quarter were 2.4%. Last year's third quarter energy-related expenses were 3.2%, but excluding Document Management, they were 3.0%. I'll discuss gross margin and energy-related expenses by business in just a moment.
Before doing so let me remind you that we have 3 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services. Uniform Direct Sales and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services are combined and presented as other services on the income statement.
The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue was $859.5 million, which is up 7.2% compared to last year's third quarter. Organic growth, which excluded the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency changes, was 7.8%. Organic growth was higher than total growth because of the continued weakening of the Canadian dollar. We did not see any noticeable third quarter revenue effect from oil and gas related customers, but as Mike mentioned, these customers' businesses did begin to feel the impact of the low oil prices in the latter part of the quarter. Aside from the oil and gas related customers, we saw no marketable change to net add-stops in the third quarter.
Our rental segment gross margin was 44.6% for the third quarter, an increase from 43.9% in last year's third quarter. Most of this improvement came from energy-related costs, which were 70 basis points lower than in last year's third quarter. The third quarter rental segment gross margin of 44.6% was a slight decrease from this fiscal year's second quarter gross margin of 44.8%. Energy-related costs in the third quarter were 20 basis points lower than in this fiscal year's second quarter.
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue for the third quarter was $112.2 million, an increase of 4.2% compared to last year's third quarter. When adjusting for foreign currency changes, organic growth was 4.8%. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 27.7% for the third quarter, a slight improvement from last year's third quarter gross margin of 27.5% and this year's second quarter gross margin of 27.6%. Both of these improvements are mostly due to lower energy-related expenses.
Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue for the third quarter was $137.1 million, which was 8.2% higher than last year's third quarter. Organic growth was 7.5%. We continue to be very pleased with this business.  Third quarter organic growth came down some from previous quarters due to fewer repair jobs on the fire protection side of the business and due to the severe winter weather in the Northeast. This segment's gross margin was 44.3% in the third quarter, an improvement of 80 basis points compared to last year's third quarter gross margin of 43.5%. Energy-related costs were 60 basis points lower than last year's third quarter. The third quarter gross margin of 44.3% was also an improvement over this fiscal year's second quarter gross margin of 43.8%. Energy-related costs accounted for 40 basis points of the improvements.
Switching to the selling and administrative expenses. Total company SG&A was 27.2% as a percentage of third quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's third quarter of 28.6%. When excluding the impact that Document Shredding had on last year's third quarter SG&A and revenue, last year's adjusted total company SG&A was 27.8% as a percentage of the adjusted revenue.
On our second quarter call, we indicated that our risk management claims experience was better than the previous year, and that better experience continued into our third quarter. Keep in mind, however, that we are self-insured. In addition to risk management, a number of other minor improvements were realized in other expense categories.
The third quarter SG&A of 27.2% was a 50-basis-point increase compared to the 26.7% in this fiscal year's second quarter. As we mentioned on the second quarter call, payroll taxes reset in our third quarter. This expected increase was partially offset by a number of minor improvements and other expenses.
Our effective tax rate was 36.2% for the quarter compared to the 36.7% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. We expect the fiscal '15 effective tax rate to be 37.3%.
Our cash and marketable securities were $490 million at February 28, a decrease of $337 million from the $827 million at November 30. This decrease is due to paying the $202 million dividend in early December and the execution of the $251 million share buyback during the third quarter partially offset by cash generated from our operating cash flows.
Accounts receivable decreased $12 million since November 30 due to the timing of collections. New goods inventory and in-service inventory levels at February 28 were relatively consistent with November 30 balances. Accounts payable increased roughly $27 million since November 30 due to the timing of vendor payment due dates. Current accrued liabilities decreased by $221 million since November 30 due largely to the payment of the accrued dividend, which was paid in December.
Long-term debt remained at $1.3 billion, representing 1.6x EBITDA. And finally, CapEx for the third quarter was about $50 million. Our CapEx by operating segments was as follows: $43 million in rental; $2 million in Uniform Direct Sales; and $5 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2015 to be in the range of $220 million to $250 million.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now be glad to answer any of your questions."

From a rental standpoint, the operating margin was close to 50% in the second half of the year, the incremental operating margins. It's hard to keep that rate going for long periods of time. But we do still believe that we can have very good incremental margins because we've got quite an infrastructure around the U.S. and Canada, and we can continue to add products and services to our customers. And some of those are not -- some of the revenue that we're getting is not processed, so we're not really using any processing capacity. So we think there still certainly are good incremental margin opportunities as we move forward. Having said that, at the 50% clip, that's pretty hard to sustain over long periods of time."

With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Corporate Controller. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions.The Private Securities Litiga",798,"Good evening, and thank you for joining us this evening as we report our third quarter results for fiscal 2015. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Corporate Controller. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions.
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
As we reported in today's press release, our results for continuing operations, adjusted to exclude all impact of the Document Management businesses, are more representative of our ongoing performance. Therefore, our discussion of the company's performance will be based on the exclusion of Document Management.
We are pleased to report third quarter revenue of $1,109,000,000. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency and the Shred-it transaction was 7.5% for the third quarter. Each of our business' organic growth was positive for the third quarter with rental organic growth being 7.8%; Uniform Direct Sales being 4.8%; and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services organic growth being 7.5%. The third quarter revenue impact from severe winter weather and oil and gas related customers was relatively minor. Paul will touch on this when discussing the individual business results.
We are also pleased to show continued improvements in income as adjusted compared to last year's third quarter as adjusted, as operating income increased 17.1%, net income from continuing operations increased 20.2%, and earnings per diluted share increased 25%. Certainly, lower energy-related costs helped the comparison to last year, but we also feel good about our ability to leverage our infrastructure and manage our cost structure. Paul will discuss the energy-related costs in more detail.
We want to recognize our employees, whom we call partners, for their dedication and competitive urgency in serving our customers. They continue to do a great job.
Let me make a few comments about the Shred-it investment. First, regarding the presentation on the income statement, we have pulled the results out of SG&A and included in a line under income taxes entitled Loss on Investment in Shred-it Net of Tax. This is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and provides a clear indication of the performance of the business.
Second, regarding the third quarter impact, we recognize the $6.8 million net loss for our third quarter or negative $0.06 per share. This negative impact was primarily due to integration costs such as IT, system conversion costs and rebranding costs. In addition, Shred-it has a fairly large presence in Canada, and the weakening of the Canadian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar also had a negative impact. The conversion in general though continues to progress as planned, and we are pleased with the performance of the business.
We indicated in today's press release that we acquired 3.2 million shares of our common stock during the third quarter. The total cost was $251 million, and the average cost per share was $78.84. This buyback had a $0.01 positive impact on our third quarter EPS, and we expect it to benefit the fourth quarter by $0.02. As we announced on this past January 13, the Cintas board authorized a new buyback program of $500 million, and that entire program remains available as of today.
We also announced in today's press release that we have updated our guidance. We now expect our fiscal '15 revenue to be in the range of $4.46 billion to $4.49 billion. We have tightened the revenue range slightly to reflect continued weakening of the Canadian dollar and for potential oil and gas related customer impacts. While we did not see any noticeable revenue impact in the third quarter from our oil and gas related customers, we did begin to hear from them that a negative impact is coming.
On the EPS side, we now expect our fiscal '15 earnings per diluted share guidance to be in the range of $3.55 to $3.58. When excluding the special items of the impact of the Document Shredding business and the additional gain on the Shred-it transaction, the impact of the sale of stock in an equity investment and the impact of discontinued operations, including the sale of the Document Storage and Imaging business, we expect fiscal '15 earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $3.31 to $3.34. This EPS guidance is detailed in a table within today's press release.
I'll now turn the call over to Paul for more details on the third quarter performance."

Before moving into the third quarter results, let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in this year's third quarter, which is the same as last year's third quarter. Our fourth quarter will have 65 workdays, which is the same as last",1197,"Thank you, Mike. Before moving into the third quarter results, let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in this year's third quarter, which is the same as last year's third quarter. Our fourth quarter will have 65 workdays, which is the same as last year's fourth quarter for a total of 260 workdays for the fiscal year. Looking ahead to next fiscal year. This fiscal '16 will have 262 workdays, so 2 more than this year. By quarter, the workdays will be 66 in the first quarter, 65 in the second and third quarters and 66 in the fourth quarter.
As Mike mentioned, total revenue in the quarter increased 7.0%, excluding last year's impact of Document Shredding. Total revenue increased organically by 7.5%. Total company gross margin was 42.9% for the third quarter of this year compared to 42.3% in last year's third quarter. The current quarter gross margin of 42.9% expanded 80 basis points from last year's third quarter gross margin of 42.1%, adjusted to exclude Document Shredding.
Total company energy-related expenses for this year's third quarter were 2.4%. Last year's third quarter energy-related expenses were 3.2%, but excluding Document Management, they were 3.0%. I'll discuss gross margin and energy-related expenses by business in just a moment.
Before doing so let me remind you that we have 3 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services. Uniform Direct Sales and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services are combined and presented as other services on the income statement.
The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue was $859.5 million, which is up 7.2% compared to last year's third quarter. Organic growth, which excluded the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency changes, was 7.8%. Organic growth was higher than total growth because of the continued weakening of the Canadian dollar. We did not see any noticeable third quarter revenue effect from oil and gas related customers, but as Mike mentioned, these customers' businesses did begin to feel the impact of the low oil prices in the latter part of the quarter. Aside from the oil and gas related customers, we saw no marketable change to net add-stops in the third quarter.
Our rental segment gross margin was 44.6% for the third quarter, an increase from 43.9% in last year's third quarter. Most of this improvement came from energy-related costs, which were 70 basis points lower than in last year's third quarter. The third quarter rental segment gross margin of 44.6% was a slight decrease from this fiscal year's second quarter gross margin of 44.8%. Energy-related costs in the third quarter were 20 basis points lower than in this fiscal year's second quarter.
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue for the third quarter was $112.2 million, an increase of 4.2% compared to last year's third quarter. When adjusting for foreign currency changes, organic growth was 4.8%. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 27.7% for the third quarter, a slight improvement from last year's third quarter gross margin of 27.5% and this year's second quarter gross margin of 27.6%. Both of these improvements are mostly due to lower energy-related expenses.
Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue for the third quarter was $137.1 million, which was 8.2% higher than last year's third quarter. Organic growth was 7.5%. We continue to be very pleased with this business.  Third quarter organic growth came down some from previous quarters due to fewer repair jobs on the fire protection side of the business and due to the severe winter weather in the Northeast. This segment's gross margin was 44.3% in the third quarter, an improvement of 80 basis points compared to last year's third quarter gross margin of 43.5%. Energy-related costs were 60 basis points lower than last year's third quarter. The third quarter gross margin of 44.3% was also an improvement over this fiscal year's second quarter gross margin of 43.8%. Energy-related costs accounted for 40 basis points of the improvements.
Switching to the selling and administrative expenses. Total company SG&A was 27.2% as a percentage of third quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's third quarter of 28.6%. When excluding the impact that Document Shredding had on last year's third quarter SG&A and revenue, last year's adjusted total company SG&A was 27.8% as a percentage of the adjusted revenue.
On our second quarter call, we indicated that our risk management claims experience was better than the previous year, and that better experience continued into our third quarter. Keep in mind, however, that we are self-insured. In addition to risk management, a number of other minor improvements were realized in other expense categories.
The third quarter SG&A of 27.2% was a 50-basis-point increase compared to the 26.7% in this fiscal year's second quarter. As we mentioned on the second quarter call, payroll taxes reset in our third quarter. This expected increase was partially offset by a number of minor improvements in other expenses.
Our effective tax rate was 36.2% for the quarter compared to the 36.7% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. We expect the fiscal '15 effective tax rate to be 37.3%.
Our cash and marketable securities were $490 million at February 28, a decrease of $337 million from the $827 million at November 30. This decrease is due to paying the $202 million dividend in early December and the execution of the $251 million share buyback during the third quarter partially offset by cash generated from our operating cash flows.
Accounts receivable decreased $12 million since November 30 due to the timing of collections. New goods inventory and in-service inventory levels at February 28 were relatively consistent with November 30 balances. Accounts payable increased roughly $27 million since November 30 due to the timing of vendor payment due dates. Current accrued liabilities decreased by $221 million since November 30 due largely to the payment of the accrued dividend, which was paid in December.
Long-term debt remained at $1.3 billion, representing 1.6x EBITDA. And finally, CapEx for the third quarter was about $50 million. Our CapEx by operating segments was as follows: $43 million in rental; $2 million in Uniform Direct Sales; and $5 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2015 to be in the range of $220 million to $250 million.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now be glad to answer any of your questions."

When a customer adds a new employee, we will go to our stockroom where we have existing garments, and we'll pull as many of those existing garments as we can. And those are already in our cost structure. However, there are times, due to size differences, et cetera, where we may have to order some new garments as well, so there's a little bit of an incremental material cost impact. We then have to wash those instead of those garments sitting in our stockroom. We have to wash those garments and sort them. But then from a service standpoint, we're already going to that customer. We're already delivering, and there really isn't any additional cost there. So it is a very accretive kind of business. And it's great business, and we love to see more of it.

And some of those are not -- some of the revenue that we're getting is not processed, so we're not really using any processing capacity.

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
As we reported today in today's press release, our results from continuing operations, adjusted to exclude all impacts of the Document Management businesses and the first quarter benefit from the gain on the sale of stock in an equity method investment, are more representative of our ongoing performance. Therefore, our discussion of the company's performance will exclude these items.
We are pleased to report fourth quarter revenue $1,142,000,000. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency and the Shred-it Transaction, was 6% for the quarter. Full fiscal year revenue was $4,476,000,000, representing organic growth of 7.1% over the prior fiscal year. 
While revenue in our Uniform Direct Sales segment was unchanged compared to fiscal 2014, our 2 largest segments, Rental uniforms and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection, grew organically for the year by 7.7% and 9.2% respectively.  The performance of our sales force in both businesses were strong. We sold profitable business and penetrated existing customers with our broad line of products and services.
Fourth quarter operating income was $177 million, which was 15.6% of revenue compared to an adjusted operating margin of 15.4% in the prior year. Full fiscal year operating income was $696 million or 15.6% of revenue. This represents a 120 basis point improvement over last year's adjusted operating margin.  We are pleased with our ability to leverage our infrastructure and with the results of our increased focus on managing our cost structure following the Shred-it Transaction.  Additionally, we benefited from lower energy-related costs compared to last year. Paul will discuss the energy-related costs in more detail.
Earnings per diluted share as adjusted for the fourth quarter were $0.86, representing an increase of 11.7% over last year. For the full fiscal year, EPS was $3.35, an increase of 21.8% over last year.
As our CEO, Scott Farmer, stated in today's press release, we also demonstrated our continuing commitment to providing shareholder value through our stock buyback program. We purchased 4.4 million shares of our common stock during the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of fiscal '16 for $370 million.
Fiscal 2015 was a very successful year for Cintas. We thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their hard work in ensuring this outcome.
Yesterday, the company announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its investment in Shred-it for approximately $550 million to $600 million before taxes. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2015, subject to obtaining regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. These proceeds will be in addition to the $180 million received at the closing of the Partnership transaction on April 30 of 2014 and the $113 million received in May of 2015 in the form of a dividend from Shred-it.
Looking forward to fiscal 2016, we expect revenue to be in the range of $4,700,000,000 to $4,780,000,000. We also expect double-digit EPS growth in the range of $3.74 to $3.83.  This guidance excludes the impact of having 2 more workdays in fiscal '16 compared to fiscal '15. Our guidance does not include any EPS impact from the recently announced agreement to sell our investment in Shred-it, nor does it include any deterioration in the U.S. economy or any additional share buybacks.  The EPS guidance is detailed on the table within today's press release.
I'll now turn the call over to Paul for more details on company performance."

First, please note that there were 65 workdays in this year's fourth quarter, which is the same as last year's fourth quarter. The full fiscal year of 2015 had the same number of days as fiscal 2014 of 260 days. Fiscal year 2016 will have 26",1107,"Thanks, Mike. First, please note that there were 65 workdays in this year's fourth quarter, which is the same as last year's fourth quarter. The full fiscal year of 2015 had the same number of days as fiscal 2014 of 260 days. Fiscal year 2016 will have 262 workdays, two more than fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2016, the number of workdays by quarter are 66 in the first quarter, 65 in the second and third quarters and 66 in the fourth quarter.
As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.0% in the fourth quarter and by 7.1% for the full fiscal year. Total company gross margin was 42.6% for the fourth quarter of this year compared to 42.2% in last year's fourth quarter as adjusted.  Total company energy-related expenses for this year's fourth quarter were 2.2%. Last year's fourth quarter energy-related expenses were 3.0% excluding Document Management. 
For the full year, total company gross margin was 42.9%, an increase of 120 basis points over the prior year adjusted margin of 41.7%.  For the full year, total company energy-related expenses of 2.5% were 40 basis points lower than fiscal 2014 as adjusted to exclude Document Management.
I will discuss gross margin and energy-related expenses by segment in just a moment. Before doing so, let me remind you that we have 3 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection services.  Uniform Direct Sales and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection services are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.
The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the Rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services.  Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue was $873 million, an increase of 5.8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, was 6.5%. Organic growth was higher than total growth because of continued weakening of the Canadian dollar. For the full year, Rental segment total growth and organic growth was 7.2% and 7.7% respectively.
Rental segment revenue mix for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 was unchanged from the prior year quarter. The revenue mix was as follows: Uniform revenue accounted for approximately 52% of revenue. Dust control, comprised mainly of entrance mats, accounted for 19%. Hygiene and Other Services, including restroom supply, cleaning services and chemical services, was 16% of revenue. Shop towels were 5%. And linen and other, which is mainly nonperson specific garments such as aprons and butcher coats, was 8%.
Our rental segment gross margin was 44.0% for the fourth quarter, an increase from 43.6% in last year's fourth quarter. Energy-related costs were 90 basis points lower than in last year's fourth quarter.  For the year, rental segment gross margin was 44.6%, an increase of 130 basis points compared to the prior year period, about 50 basis points of which was due to lower energy-related costs.
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog.  Uniform Direct Sales revenue for the fourth quarter was $118 million, an increase of 0.3% compared to last year's fourth quarter. When adjusting for foreign currency exchange rate changes, organic growth was 1.1% for the quarter and flat for the full fiscal year.
Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 29.8% for the fourth quarter compared to 30.0% in the prior year quarter. For both the full and fiscal years of 2015 and 2014, gross margin was 28.5%. The decrease in energy-related costs benefited gross margin 30 basis points and 10 basis points in the fourth quarter and full year periods, respectively.
Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue for the fourth quarter was $150 million, which was 9.8% higher than last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was 7.3%. For the full year, segment total growth and organic growth was 10.5% and 9.2% respectively.
This segment's gross margin was 44.4% in the fourth quarter compared to 44.6% in the prior year period. Energy-related costs were 60 basis points lower than in last year's fourth quarter. For the year, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection segment gross margin was 44.1%, an increase of 30 basis points compared to the prior year. Energy-related costs were 40 basis points lower than fiscal 2014.
Regarding selling, general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 27.0% as a percentage of fourth quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's fourth quarter of 27.8%. When excluding the impact that Document Shredding had last year's fourth quarter SG&A and revenue, last year's adjusted total company SG&A was 26.8% as a percentage of the adjusted revenue. We had an increase in legal and expenses in the fourth quarter. Full year SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 27.4% for fiscal 2015, the same percentage as in fiscal 2014 when adjusted for Document Shredding.
Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 37.6% compared to 40.4% in the prior year period. The full year 2015 effective tax rate was 37.2% compared to 38.3% in fiscal 2014. The higher your fiscal 2014 effective tax rate was a result of a number of discrete items related to the Shred-it Transaction. We expect the fiscal 2016 effective tax rate to be 37.3%.
Our cash and marketable securities were $433 million at May 31, an increase of $30 million from the $403 million at February 28. Cash provided by operating activities was $202 million in the fiscal fourth quarter, driven by net income and increases in working capital resulting from the timing of vendor and other payments compared to the previous quarter. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we received a dividend from Shred-it of $113 million. And finally, the company paid $237 million in the fourth quarter to repurchase common stock.
Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $54 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $44 million in rental, $3 million in Uniform Direct Sales and $7 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2016 in the range of $250 million to $300 million.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

So our rental organic growth, it did come down a bit from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, and there were several things that accounted for that. First of all, we did see a little bit of softening in our net add-stops performance, a little pullback from our customers. I would say in the mid- -- middle of the quarter, we started to see a little bit of a worsening trend, and that actually continued into our first quarter. We also saw a little bit of a pullback from our national account customers, especially in our emergency service -- emergency services business. We saw a little bit of a negative impact from the oil and gas that we've talked about in the past. And then lastly, I would say would did see a little bit of an impact from pricing from the standpoint of the year-over-year impact. So let me talk a bit about pricing. Last year in the fourth quarter, we talked about how we saw an improvement in the pricing environment, and that carried throughout our fiscal '15. And we really didn't see much of a change in our fourth quarter. But one thing to keep in mind is we did lap the beginning of that. What we saw was a bit of unimproved environment. So year-over-year growth was affected by it a little bit. So I would say those 4 things contributed to a little bit of a deceleration in the rental organic growth. From a manufacturing segment standpoint, I can't say that we saw anything unusual or any significant trend or noticeable trend."

We certainly would be actively involved in looking at businesses, acquiring businesses in our current businesses if the value was there, if we felt like synergies were available. And so we certainly have an active corporate development team and certainly are open to making acquisitions again that are at the right value and can provide long-term value for us. Certainly after that, we've shown that we will increase the dividend. We've done so every year since we went public in 1983. And so dividends are an important part of our capital allocation. And then lastly, as you've seen in the last quarter or so, the buyback program is very important to us. And as we mentioned, we acquired $370 million of our stock in the last quarter and into the first quarter. So when we think about capital allocation, those are our thoughts. Now certainly, with the Shred-it Transaction that will close in the fourth quarter, our board will be busy thinking about how to deploy that cash, what is the -- what's the appropriate way to use that.

In first aid, it went up about 30 basis points. We've -- we continue to invest in both businesses. And I think in the fourth quarter, we saw a little bit maybe of pulling repair and maintenance into the fourth quarter that may have happened in the first quarter. I think we started hiring a little bit early for the businesses on the routes particularly. So we added routes maybe a little bit more aggressively in both businesses than we have and probably just setting the table for fiscal '16. So as we think about the guidance, I would say we still believe that there is gross margin opportunity. We think incremental margins are going to be healthy. As it relates to our rental business, we've talked a little bit about during fiscal '15 about pushing some capacity growth into fiscal '16. That goes into our guidance thinking a little bit. And the other thing is when we, from the standpoint of energy, so gas fuel prices for us, we've included an expectation that fuel prices for the year will be about the same in fiscal '16 as in fiscal '15. Both years would be about 2.5%. On the flip side though as I mentioned from a rental organic growth standpoint, we did see a little bit of a negative impact from our oil and gas customers in the fourth quarter. And we've also included in our guidance into fiscal '16 that that kind of performance would continue as long as we see the fuel in that 2.5% range. And so the point is on a net basis, while we got a benefit certainly in fiscal '15 from net oil and gas and the fuel costs, we think it might turn around a little bit in fiscal '16."

But as of May 31, our book value was $219 million, and that came down because of the dividend. So we have to record that dividend as a reduction in our book value of our investment. So you can kind of think of the cash that we received, let's call it the midpoint of $575 million compared to a book value of as of May 31, $219 million, that's a $350 million-ish gain. And so we'll pay taxes on that gain. And probably an easy way to think about that at the moment is using our 37.3% against that. One thing from a cash standpoint to keep in mind is that the gain we recognized a year ago was a deferred tax gain. So we didn't pay taxes on that piece of the gain, so we'll have to do that as well when we receive the cash at closing. Does that make sense? So I would say it's going to be a fairly good-sized tax bill, but we'll have a lot of cash left over. We'll certainly provide more details as we get through those calculations and we firm up the amount of the proceeds."

We, because of the transaction, and you probably have seen that there was an IPO process as well, we didn't -- we just didn't have a clarity on what that performance might look like. And so we've not included any impact from the Shred-it net income performance that we will share in. And then once -- we haven't received the cash yet. We need to close that deal first. And until we do that, we're not ready to provide any other guidance on how that cash may impact us.

So to answer your question about how do we continue to grow and what's the next business, we feel like we've got a lot of opportunity in our existing businesses. Now having said that, we certainly would look for other ideas that might be holding new businesses, but it's got to be a business that can create a good long-term value for us."

We've seen a fair amount of movement in the Canadian exchange rate during the year. Keep in mind, our guidance is total revenue growth. For the current fiscal year, so for fiscal '15, our average currency exchange rate was about CAD 1.15. And we have seen that now go to closer to CAD 1.20, CAD 1.25. And so our guidance assumes CAD 1.25 for fiscal '16. And so that does have about a 50 to 60 basis point negative impact on total revenue growth. So having said that, let me put that aside and make sure that I am also talking about, look, we feel really good about the business. We've had some really nice momentum. And so we believe that we do have some real nice opportunities. But you're right, we've got a little bit of headwind in the Canadian currency, got a little bit of headwind in the oil and gas impact and a little bit of headwind in the net add-stops area."

We took a business, changed the business model from on-site to off-site shredding. We added our people, our culture and our processes. And we felt like we really made a -- created a good business. But there were some things that we didn't like as much. And that is generally, what we found was the decision-maker was different than the decision-maker for most of our businesses. The commodity impact was a bit of a bumpy ride through the years, and we weren't crazy about that. We felt like we were a little concerned that there weren't many product adjacencies for us in that business, so the growth was coming from volume primarily. And so for those reasons, we -- and then, finally, we weren't seeing enough or improvement quickly enough. And that's -- that was one of the main reasons why we also wanted to do the transaction with Shred-it a year ago. When we think about how that's gone over the last year, as I've mentioned several times over the last few quarters, we've been very, very pleased with how the business has progressed, how the integration has progressed. But when you think about our investment, there's been a lot of uncertainty in the macroenvironment. There is a lot of uncertainties about how commodities will continue to effect that business. There's uncertainty in the way of the stock market as it related to the IPO alternative, with Greece and China creating some wild rides. There's uncertainty as it relates to being a minority owner and having a bit of a limited influence. And then, finally, there was uncertainty as it relates to the impact that it would have on our P&L. And so generally speaking, the thoughts that we had a year ago for making the transaction and the uncertainty about the position that we were in led us to believe that taking the certainty of this deal was a great opportunity for us."

We're focused on continuing to drive penetration. I don't have any new things to talk about. We certainly know that innovation is important and we're working on it. But I don't have anything new to talk to you about. We are just focus on continuing to penetrate with some of these newer products and services we we've got a lot of room."

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
As we reported today in today's press release, our results for continuing operations, adjusted to exclude all impacts of the Document Management businesses and the first quarter benefit from the gain on the sale of stock in an equity method investment, are more representative of our ongoing performance. Therefore, our discussion of the company's performance will exclude these items.
We're pleased to report fourth quarter revenue $1,142,000,000. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency and the Shred-it transaction, was 6% for the quarter. Full fiscal year revenue was $4,476,000,000, representing organic growth of 7.1% over the prior fiscal year. 
While revenue in our Uniform Direct Sales segment was unchanged compared to fiscal 2014, our 2 largest segments, Rental uniforms and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection, grew organically for the year by 7.7% and 9.2% respectively.  The performance of our sales force in both businesses was strong. We sold profitable business and penetrated existing customers with our broad line of products and services.
Fourth quarter operating income was $177 million, which was 15.6% of revenue compared to an adjusted operating margin of 15.4% in the prior year. Full fiscal year operating income was $696 million or 15.6% of revenue. This represents a 120 basis point improvement over last year's adjusted operating margin. We're pleased with our ability to leverage our infrastructure and with the results of our increased focus on managing our cost structure following the Shred-it transaction. Additionally, we benefited from lower energy-related costs compared to last year. Paul will discuss the energy-related costs in more detail.
Earnings per diluted share as adjusted for the fourth quarter were $0.86, representing an increase of 11.7% over last year. For the full fiscal year, EPS was $3.35, an increase of 21.8% over last year.
As our CEO, Scott Farmer, stated in today's press release, we also demonstrated our continuing commitment to providing shareholder value through our stock buyback program. We purchased 4.4 million shares of our common stock during the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of fiscal '16 for $370 million.
Fiscal 2015 was a very successful year for Cintas. We thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their hard work in ensuring this outcome.
Yesterday, the company announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its investment in Shred-it for approximately $550 million to $600 million before taxes. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2015, subject to obtaining regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. These proceeds will be in addition to the $180 million received at the closing of the Partnership transaction on April 30th of 2014, and the $113 million received in May of 2015 in the form of a dividend from Shred-it.
Looking forward to fiscal 2016, we expect revenue to be in the range of $4,700,000,000 to $4,780,000,000. We also expect double-digit EPS growth in the range of $3.74 to $3.83. This guidance includes the impact of having 2 more workdays in fiscal '16 compared to fiscal '15. Our guidance does not include any EPS impact from the recently announced agreement to sell our investment in Shred-it, nor does it include any deterioration in the U.S. economy or any additional share buybacks. The EPS guidance is detailed in the table within today's press release.
I'll now turn the call over to Paul for more details on company performance."

First, please note that there were 65 workdays in this year's fourth quarter, which is the same as last year's fourth quarter. The full fiscal year of 2015 had the same number of days as fiscal 2014 of 260 days. Fiscal year 2016 will have 26",1108,"Thanks, Mike. First, please note that there were 65 workdays in this year's fourth quarter, which is the same as last year's fourth quarter. The full fiscal year of 2015 had the same number of days as fiscal 2014 of 260 days. Fiscal year 2016 will have 262 workdays, 2 more than fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2016, the number of workdays by quarter are 66 in the first quarter, 65 in the second and third quarters and 66 in the fourth quarter.
As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.0% in the fourth quarter and by 7.1% for the full fiscal year. Total company gross margin was 42.6% for the fourth quarter of this year compared to 42.2% in last year's fourth quarter as adjusted. Total company energy-related expenses for this year's fourth quarter were 2.2%. Last year's fourth quarter energy-related expenses were 3.0%, excluding Document Management. 
For the full year, total company gross margin was 42.9%, an increase of 120 basis points over the prior year adjusted margin of 41.7%. For the full year, total company energy-related expenses of 2.5% were 40 basis points lower than fiscal 2014 as adjusted to exclude Document Management.
I will discuss gross margin and energy-related expenses by segment in just a moment. Before doing so, let me remind you that we have 3 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection services. Uniform Direct Sales and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection services are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.
The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services.  Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue was $873 million, an increase of 5.8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, was 6.5%. Organic growth was higher than total growth because of continued weakening of the Canadian dollar. For the full year, Rental segment total growth and organic growth was 7.2% and 7.7% respectively.
Rental segment revenue mix for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 was unchanged from the prior year quarter. The revenue mix was as follows: Uniform rental accounted for approximately 52% of revenue. Dust control, comprised mainly of entrance mats, accounted for 19%. Hygiene and Other Services, including restroom supply, cleaning services and chemical services, was 16% of revenue. Shop towels were 5%. And linen and other, which is mainly nonperson-specific garments such as aprons and butcher coats, was 8%.
Our rental segment gross margin was 44.0% for the fourth quarter, an increase from 43.6% in last year's fourth quarter. Energy-related costs were 90 basis points lower than in last year's fourth quarter. For the year, rental segment gross margin was 44.6%, an increase of 130 basis points compared to the prior year period, about 50 basis points of which was due to lower energy-related costs.
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog.  Uniform Direct Sales revenue for the fourth quarter was $118 million, an increase of 0.3% compared to last year's fourth quarter. When adjusting for foreign currency exchange rate changes, organic growth was 1.1% for the quarter and flat for the full fiscal year.
Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 29.8% for the fourth quarter compared to 30.0% in the prior year quarter. For both the full and fiscal years of 2015 and 2014, gross margin was 28.5%. The decrease in energy-related costs benefited gross margin 30 basis points and 10 basis points in the fourth quarter and full year periods, respectively.
Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue for the fourth quarter was $150 million, which was 9.8% higher than last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was 7.3%. For the full year, segment total growth and organic growth was 10.5% and 9.2% respectively.
This segment's gross margin was 44.4% in the fourth quarter compared to 44.6% in the prior year period. Energy-related costs were 60 basis points lower than in last year's fourth quarter. For the year, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection segment gross margin was 44.1%, an increase of 30 basis points compared to the prior year. Energy-related costs were 40 basis points lower than fiscal 2014.
Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 27.0% as a percentage of fourth quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's fourth quarter of 27.8%. When excluding the impact that Document Shredding had on last year's fourth quarter SG&A and revenue, last year's adjusted total company SG&A was 26.8% as a percentage of the adjusted revenue. We had an increase in legal and professional expenses in the fourth quarter. Full year SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 27.4% for fiscal 2015, the same percentage as in fiscal 2014 when adjusted for Document Shredding.
Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 37.6% compared to 40.4% in the prior year period. The full year 2015 effective tax rate was 37.2% compared to 38.3% in fiscal 2014. The higher fiscal 2014 effective tax rate was a result of a number of discrete items related to the Shred-it transaction. We expect the fiscal 2016 effective tax rate to be 37.3%.
Our cash and marketable securities were $433 million at May 31, an increase of $30 million from the $403 million at February 28. Cash provided by operating activities was $202 million in the fiscal fourth quarter, driven by net income and increases in working capital resulting from the timing of vendor and other payments compared to the previous quarter. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we received a dividend from Shred-it of $113 million. And finally, the company paid $237 million in the fourth quarter to repurchase common stock.
Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $54 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $44 million in rental; $3 million in Uniform Direct Sales; and $7 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2016 in the range of $250 million to $300 million.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

So our rental organic growth, it did come down a bit from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, and there were several things that accounted for that. First of all, we did see a little bit of softening in our net add-stops performance, a little pullback from our customers. I would say in the middle of the quarter, we started to see a little bit of a worsening trend, and that actually continued into our first quarter. We also saw a little bit of a pullback from our national account customers, especially in our emergency services business. We saw a little bit of a negative impact from the oil and gas that we've talked about in the past. And then, lastly, I would say, we did see a little bit of an impact from pricing from the standpoint of the year-over-year impact. So let me talk a bit about pricing. Last year, in the fourth quarter, we talked about how we saw an improvement in the pricing environment, and that carried throughout our fiscal '15. And we really didn't see much of a change in our fourth quarter. But one thing to keep in mind is we did lap the beginning of that. What we saw was a bit of an improved environment. So the year-over-year growth was affected by a little bit. So I would say those 4 things contributed to a little bit of a deceleration in that rental organic growth. From a manufacturing segment standpoint, I can't say that we saw anything unusual or any significant trend or noticeable trend."

Secondly, we really do like acquisition opportunities if they are at the right value and they create synergies and long-term benefits for the company. We certainly would be actively involved in looking at businesses, acquiring businesses in our current businesses if the value was there, if we felt like synergies were available. And so we certainly have an active corporate development team and certainly are open to making acquisitions again that are at the right value and that can provide long-term value for us. Certainly, after that, we've shown that we will increase the dividend, we've done so every year since we went public in 1983. And so dividends are an important part of our capital allocation. And then, lastly, as you've seen in the last quarter or so, the buyback program is very important to us. And as we mentioned, we acquired $370 million of our stock in the last quarter and into the first quarter. So when we think about capital allocation, those are our thoughts. Now certainly, with the Shred-it transaction that will close in the fourth quarter, our board will be busy thinking about how to deploy that cash, what's the appropriate way to use that. And we'll certainly be actively thinking in terms of how to use that."

And I think, in the fourth quarter, we saw a little bit maybe of pulling repair and maintenance into the fourth quarter that may have happened in the first quarter. I think, we started hiring a little bit early for the businesses on the routes particularly. So we added routes maybe a little bit more aggressively in both businesses than we have and probably just setting the table for fiscal '16. So as we think about the guidance, I would say we still believe that there is gross margin opportunity. We think incremental margins are going to be healthy. As it relates to our rental business, we've talked a little bit about during fiscal '15 about pushing some capacity growth into fiscal '16, that goes into our guidance thinking a little bit. And the other thing is when we -- from the standpoint of energy, so gas fuel prices for us, we've included an expectation that fuel prices for the year would be about the same in fiscal '16 as in fiscal '15. Both years would be about 2.5%. On the flip side though, as I mentioned from a rental organic growth standpoint, we did see a little bit of negative impact from our oil and gas customers in the fourth quarter. And we've also included in our guidance into fiscal '16 that, that kind of performance would continue as long as we see the fuel in that 2.5% range. And so the point is on a net basis, while we got a benefit certainly in fiscal '15 from net oil and gas and the fuel costs, we think it might turn around a little bit in fiscal '16."

But as of May 31, our book value was $219 million, and that came down because of the dividend. So we have to record that dividend as a reduction in our book value of our investment. So you can kind of think of the cash that we receive, let's call it the midpoint of $575 million compared to a book value of as of May 31, $219 million, that's a $350-ish million gain. And so we'll pay taxes on that gain. And probably an easy way to think about that at the moment is using our 37.3% against that. One thing from a cash standpoint to keep in mind is that the gain we recognized a year ago was a deferred tax gain. So we didn't pay taxes on that piece of the gain, so we'll have to do that as well when we receive the cash at closing. Does that make sense? So I would say it's going to be a fairly good-sized tax bill, but we'll have a lot of cash leftover. We'll certainly provide more details as we get through those calculations and we firm up the amount of the proceeds."

So roughly, for the first half of the year, we will record our share of the Shred-it income just like we did in fiscal '15. We -- because of the transaction, and you probably have seen that there was an IPO process as well, we didn't -- we just didn't have clarity on what that performance might look like. And so we've not included any impact from the Shred-it net income performance that we will share in. And then, once -- we haven't received the cash yet. We need to close that deal first. And until we do that, we're not ready to provide any other guidance on how that cash may impact us. One thing about the first -- particularly the first quarter as it relates to our share of the Shred-it income, they have the IPO process going as well as this transaction that we announced yesterday. And there will likely be a fair amount of transaction-related expenses that we will share in. Now when we record that, when we record our share of those expenses in the first quarter and in the second quarter, keep in mind, those are noncash -- that's a noncash entry for us. And the impact is it reduces our -- it increases our book value even more, so it's just an offset. We get that gain back when the transaction closes."

So the good news is we have replaced it now. Now clearly, how do we continue to grow into the future? From a rental business, we need to continue to create solutions for our customers that are of high value. We need to get more note programmers into uniform rental programs, things like new types of Carhartt programs; FR, fire-resistant clothing offerings. So we need to continue to create innovation. We need to create innovation with our facility services products and services. And we need to continue to penetrate. We've got quite a, we believe, to be quite a penetration opportunity in our customer base. And the nice thing about having about 1 million customers is we've got a lot of warm leads out there that we can continue to work to penetrate. From a first aid, safety and fire business standpoint, it's a bit of the same. We need to go out and capture new customers and we need to continue to look for adjacencies under the umbrellas of safety and protection. And we've done a very nice job in creating product adjacencies that we can then sell into existing customers. So to answer your question about how do we continue to grow and what's the next business, we feel like we've got a lot of opportunity in our existing businesses.

When we think about how that's gone over the last year, as I've mentioned several times over the last few quarters, we've been very, very pleased with how the business has progressed, how the integration has progressed. But when we think about our investment, there's a lot of uncertainty in the macroenvironment. There is a lot of uncertainty about how commodities will continue to effect that business. There's uncertainty in the way of the stock market as it related to the IPO alternative with Greece and China creating some wild rides. There's uncertainty as it relates to being a minority owner and having a bit of a limited influence. And then, finally, there was uncertainty as it relates to the impact that it would have on our P&L.

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
As we reported today in today's press release, our results for continuing operations, adjusted to exclude all impacts of the Document Management businesses and the first quarter benefit from the gain on the sale of stock in an equity method investment, are more representative of our ongoing performance. Therefore, our discussion of the company's performance will exclude these items.
We're pleased to report fourth quarter revenue of $1,142,000,000. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency and the Shred-it transaction, was 6% for the quarter. Full fiscal year revenue was $4,476,000,000, representing organic growth of 7.1% over the prior fiscal year. 
While revenue in our Uniform Direct Sales segment was unchanged compared to fiscal 2014, our 2 largest segments, Rental uniforms and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection, grew organically for the year by 7.7% and 9.2% respectively.  The performance of our sales force in both businesses was strong. We sold profitable business and penetrated existing customers with our broad line of products and services.
Fourth quarter operating income was $177 million, which was 15.6% of revenue compared to an adjusted operating margin of 15.4% in the prior year. Full fiscal year operating income was $696 million or 15.6% of revenue. This represents a 120 basis point improvement over last year's adjusted operating margin. We're pleased with our ability to leverage our infrastructure and with the results of our increased focus on managing our cost structure following the Shred-it transaction. Additionally, we benefited from lower energy-related costs compared to last year. Paul will discuss the energy-related costs in more detail.
Earnings per diluted share as adjusted for the fourth quarter were $0.86, representing an increase of 11.7% over last year. For the full fiscal year, EPS was $3.35, an increase of 21.8% over last year.
As our CEO, Scott Farmer, stated in today's press release, we also demonstrated our continuing commitment to providing shareholder value through our stock buyback program. We purchased 4.4 million shares of our common stock during the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of fiscal '16 for $370 million.
Fiscal 2015 was a very successful year for Cintas. We thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their hard work in ensuring this outcome.
Yesterday, the company announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its investment in Shred-it for approximately $550 million to $600 million before taxes. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2015, subject to obtaining regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. These proceeds will be in addition to the $180 million received at the closing of the Partnership transaction on April 30th of 2014, and the $113 million received in May of 2015 in the form of a dividend from Shred-it.
Looking forward to fiscal 2016, we expect revenue to be in the range of $4,700,000,000 to $4,780,000,000. We also expect double-digit EPS growth in the range of $3.74 to $3.83. This guidance includes the impact of having 2 more workdays in fiscal '16 compared to fiscal '15. Our guidance does not include any EPS impact from the recently announced agreement to sell our investment in Shred-it, nor does it include any deterioration in the U.S. economy or any additional share buybacks. The EPS guidance is detailed in the table within today's press release.
I'll now turn the call over to Paul for more details on company performance."

First, please note that there were 65 workdays in this year's fourth quarter, which is the same as last year's fourth quarter. The full fiscal year of 2015 had the same number of days as fiscal 2014 of 260 days. Fiscal year 2016 will have 26",1107,"Thanks, Mike. First, please note that there were 65 workdays in this year's fourth quarter, which is the same as last year's fourth quarter. The full fiscal year of 2015 had the same number of days as fiscal 2014 of 260 days. Fiscal year 2016 will have 262 workdays, 2 more than fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2016, the number of workdays by quarter are 66 in the first quarter, 65 in the second and third quarters and 66 in the fourth quarter.
As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.0% in the fourth quarter and by 7.1% for the full fiscal year. Total company gross margin was 42.6% for the fourth quarter of this year compared to 42.2% in last year's fourth quarter as adjusted. Total company energy-related expenses for this year's fourth quarter were 2.2%. Last year's fourth quarter energy-related expenses were 3.0%, excluding Document Management. 
For the full year, total company gross margin was 42.9%, an increase of 120 basis points over the prior year adjusted margin of 41.7%. For the full year, total company energy-related expenses of 2.5% were 40 basis points lower than fiscal 2014 as adjusted to exclude Document Management.
I will discuss gross margin and energy-related expenses by segment in just a moment. Before doing so, let me remind you that we have 3 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection services. Uniform Direct Sales and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection services are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.
The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services.  Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue was $873 million, an increase of 5.8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, was 6.5%. Organic growth was higher than total growth because of continued weakening of the Canadian dollar. For the full year, Rental segment total growth and organic growth was 7.2% and 7.7% respectively.
Rental segment revenue mix for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 was unchanged from the prior year quarter. The revenue mix was as follows: Uniform rental accounted for approximately 52% of revenue. Dust control, comprised mainly of entrance mats, accounted for 19%. Hygiene and Other Services, including restroom supply, cleaning services and chemical services, was 16% of revenue. Shop towels were 5%. And linen and other, which is mainly nonperson-specific garments such as aprons and butcher coats, was 8%.
Our rental segment gross margin was 44.0% for the fourth quarter, an increase from 43.6% in last year's fourth quarter. Energy-related costs were 90 basis points lower than in last year's fourth quarter. For the year, rental segment gross margin was 44.6%, an increase of 130 basis points compared to the prior year period, about 50 basis points of which was due to lower energy-related costs.
Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog.  Uniform Direct Sales revenue for the fourth quarter was $118 million, an increase of 0.3% compared to last year's fourth quarter. When adjusting for foreign currency exchange rate changes, organic growth was 1.1% for the quarter and flat for the full fiscal year.
Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 29.8% for the fourth quarter compared to 30.0% in the prior year quarter. For both the full fiscal years of 2015 and 2014, gross margin was 28.5%. The decrease in energy-related costs benefited gross margin 30 basis points and 10 basis points in the fourth quarter and full year periods, respectively.
Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue for the fourth quarter was $150 million, which was 9.8% higher than last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was 7.3%. For the full year, segment total growth and organic growth was 10.5% and 9.2%, respectively.
This segment's gross margin was 44.4% in the fourth quarter compared to 44.6% in the prior year period. Energy-related costs were 60 basis points lower than in last year's fourth quarter. For the year, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection segment gross margin was 44.1%, an increase of 30 basis points compared to the prior year. Energy-related costs were 40 basis points lower than fiscal 2014.
Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 27.0% as a percentage of fourth quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's fourth quarter of 27.8%. When excluding the impact that Document Shredding had on last year's fourth quarter SG&A and revenue, last year's adjusted total company SG&A was 26.8% as a percentage of the adjusted revenue. We had an increase in legal and professional expenses in the fourth quarter. Full year SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 27.4% for fiscal 2015, the same percentage as in fiscal 2014 when adjusted for Document Shredding.
Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 37.6% compared to 40.4% in the prior year period. The full year 2015 effective tax rate was 37.2% compared to 38.3% in fiscal 2014. The higher fiscal 2014 effective tax rate was the result of a number of discrete items related to the Shred-it transaction. We expect the fiscal 2016 effective tax rate to be 37.3%.
Our cash and marketable securities were $433 million at May 31, an increase of $30 million from the $403 million at February 28. Cash provided by operating activities was $202 million in the fiscal fourth quarter, driven by net income and increases in working capital resulting from the timing of vendor and other payments compared to the previous quarter. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we received a dividend from Shred-it of $113 million. And finally, the company paid $237 million in the fourth quarter to repurchase common stock.
Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $54 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $44 million in rental; $3 million in Uniform Direct Sales; and $7 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2016 in the range of $250 million to $300 million.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

So our rental organic growth, it did come down a bit from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, and there were several things that accounted for that. First of all, we did see a little bit of softening in our net add-stops performance, a little pullback from our customers. I would say in the middle of the quarter, we started to see a little bit of a worsening trend, and that actually continued into our first quarter. We also saw a little bit of a pullback from our national account customers, especially in our emergency services business. We saw a little bit of a negative impact from the oil and gas that we've talked about in the past. And then, lastly, I would say, we did see a little bit of an impact from pricing from the standpoint of the year-over-year impact. So let me talk a bit about pricing. Last year, in the fourth quarter, we talked about how we saw an improvement in the pricing environment, and that carried throughout our fiscal '15. And we really didn't see much of a change in our fourth quarter. But one thing to keep in mind is we did lap the beginning of that. What we saw was a bit of an improved environment. So the year-over-year growth was affected by a little bit. So I would say those 4 things contributed to a little bit of a deceleration in that rental organic growth. From a manufacturing segment standpoint, I can't say that we saw anything unusual or any significant trend or noticeable trend."

Secondly, we really do like acquisition opportunities if they are at the right value and they create synergies and long-term benefits for the company. We certainly would be actively involved in looking at businesses, acquiring businesses in our current businesses if the value was there, if we felt like synergies were available. And so we certainly have an active corporate development team and certainly are open to making acquisitions again that are at the right value and that can provide long-term value for us. Certainly, after that, we've shown that we will increase the dividend, we've done so every year since we went public in 1983. And so dividends are an important part of our capital allocation. And then, lastly, as you've seen in the last quarter or so, the buyback program is very important to us. And as we mentioned, we acquired $370 million of our stock in the last quarter and into the first quarter. So when we think about capital allocation, those are our thoughts.

In First Aid, it went up about 30 basis points. We've -- we continue to invest in both businesses. And I think, in the fourth quarter, we saw a little bit maybe of pulling repair and maintenance into the fourth quarter that may have happened in the first quarter. I think we started hiring a little bit early for the businesses on the routes particularly. So we added routes maybe a little bit more aggressively in both businesses than we have and probably just setting the table for fiscal '16. So as we think about the guidance, I would say we still believe that there is gross margin opportunity. We think incremental margins are going to be healthy. As it relates to our rental business, we've talked a little bit about -- during fiscal '15, about pushing some capacity growth into fiscal '16. That goes into our guidance thinking a little bit. And the other thing is when we -- from the standpoint of energy, so gas fuel prices for us, we've included an expectation that fuel prices for the year would be about the same in fiscal '16 as in fiscal '15. Both years would be about 2.5%. On the flip side though, as I mentioned from a rental organic growth standpoint, we did see a little bit of negative impact from our oil and gas customers in the fourth quarter. And we've also included in our guidance into fiscal '16 that, that kind of performance would continue as long as we see the fuel in that 2.5% range. And so the point is, on a net basis, while we got a benefit certainly in fiscal '15 from net oil and gas and the fuel costs, we think it might turn around a little bit in fiscal '16."

But as of May 31, our book value was $219 million, and that came down because of the dividend. So we have to record that dividend as a reduction in our book value of our investment. So you can kind of think of the cash that we receive, let's call it the midpoint of $575 million, compared to a book value of as of May 31, $219 million, that's a $350-ish million gain. And so we'll pay taxes on that gain. And probably an easy way to think about that at the moment is using our 37.3% against that. One thing from a cash standpoint to keep in mind is that the gain we recognized a year ago was a deferred tax gain. So we didn't pay taxes on that piece of the gain, so we'll have to do that as well when we receive the cash at closing. Does that make sense? So I would say it's going to be a fairly good-sized tax bill, but we'll have a lot of cash leftover. We'll certainly provide more details as we get through those calculations and we firm up the amount of the proceeds."

We took a business, changed the business model from on-site to off-site shredding. We added our people, our culture, our processes. And we felt like we really made a -- created a great business. But there were some things that we didn't like as much. And that is, generally, what we found was the decision-maker was different than the decision-maker for most of our businesses. The commodity impact was a bit of a bumpy ride through the years, and we weren't crazy about that. We felt like we were a little concerned that there weren't many product adjacencies for us in that business, so the growth was coming from volume primarily. And so for those reasons, we -- and then, finally, we weren't seeing enough -- or improvement quickly enough. And that was one of the main reasons why we also wanted to do the transaction with Shred-it a year ago. When we think about how that's gone over the last year, as I've mentioned several times over the last few quarters, we've been very, very pleased with how the business has progressed, how the integration has progressed. But when we think about our investment, there's a lot of uncertainty in the macro-environment. There is a lot of uncertainty about how commodities will continue to affect that business. There's uncertainty in the way of the stock market as it related to the IPO alternative with Greece and China creating some wild rides. There's uncertainty as it relates to being a minority owner and having a bit of a limited influence. And then, finally, there was uncertainty as it relates to the impact that it would have on our P&L. And so generally speaking, the thoughts that we had a year ago for making the transaction and the uncertainty about the position that we were in led us to believe that taking the certainty of this deal was a great opportunity for us."

This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. 
As we reported today in the press release, please note that a change in our reportable segments, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require companies to evaluate their reportable operating expense when certain events occur.
require companies to evaluate their reportable operating segments when certain events occur. As a result of a recent evaluation, effective June 1, 2015, we will report the following operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services and All Other. All Other primarily consists of Fire Protection Services and our direct sale business division. 
We are pleased to report first quarter revenue of $1,199,000,000,, an increase of 8.8% from the prior year first quarter. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, workday differences and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 6.8%. Organic revenue growth for our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 6.8%, and the First Aid and Safety Services segment organic growth was 10.5%.  The performance of our sales in both segments were strong. We continue to add new customers and provide existing customers with additional products and services from our broad line. 
First quarter operating income was $185.5 million, which was 15.5% of revenue compared to an operating margin of 14.8% in the prior year period. This represents a 70 basis point improvement from last year's operating margin. 
Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 was $106.2 million, and earnings per diluted share, or EPS, from continuing operations for the first quarter were $0.93. Note that the first quarter of last year's -- of last fiscal year's net income and EPS from continuing operations were positively impacted by a gain from the sale of stock in an equity method investment. Excluding this gain, first quarter net income and EPS from continuing operations increased 15.1% and 19.2% respectively compared to the prior year.  Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue improved 50 basis points to 8.9% from 8.4% of revenue in last fiscal year's first quarter excluding the prior year period gain. 
We also demonstrated our continuing commitment to providing shareholder value through our stock buyback program. During August and into September through the close of business yesterday, Cintas purchased 2.9 million shares of common stock. This share buyback had no impact on first quarter EPS but is expected to benefit full fiscal year EPS by $0.05. Since the beginning of fiscal 2016, approximately 4.5 million shares of common stock have been purchased at an aggregate cost of $381.2 million. As of September 23, 2015, Cintas had $381.8 million available under the current Board of Directors stock repurchase authorization. 
As Cintas CEO, Scott Farmer, stated in today's press release, we are off to a good start to our fiscal 2016 year. We thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their strong performance. 
On August 1, 2015, the company closed on the acquisition of ZEE Medical for a consideration of approximately $134 million in cash. About $121 million were paid at the closing of the transaction, and an additional $13 million may be paid in the future fiscal year subject to holdback provisions. We are in very early stages of the ZEE business. We are excited about the benefits and opportunities this acquisition provides, including expanding our footprint and enabling us to serve an even greater number of customers in North America. 
As a result of our first quarter results and additional acquisition of ZEE Medical, we are updating our annual guidance. We expect fiscal 2016 revenue to be in the range of $4.8 billion to $4.88 billion and fiscal 2016 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.79 to $3.88. This guidance does not include any EPS impact from the announced agreement to sell our investment, Shred-it, which is not yet closed. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy or additional share buybacks. The EPS guidance is detailed in the table within today's press release. 
I'll now turn the call over to Paul for more details on company financial performance."

As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.8% in the first quarter. New business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services, retention and price increases, also -- all contributed to the strong growth rate. Total company gross margin was 43.7% for the first quarter of this year compared to 43.4% last year.  Total company energy-related expenses for this year's first quarter were 2.2%. Last year's first quarter energy-related expenses were 2.8%. 
As Mike previously stated, effective June 1, 2015, we have 3 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services and All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our direct sale business division. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as other services on the income statement. 
The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $938 million, an increase of 7.4% compared to last year's first quarter. Organic growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, workday differences and foreign currency exchange rate changes, was 6.8%. For comparative purposes, this segment's organic growth for the previous quarter, our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter, was 6.2%.  Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.7% for the first quarter, an increase of 19 basis points from 43.8% in last year's first quarter. Energy-related costs were 70 basis points lower than the last year's first quarter. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $99 million, which was 24.5% higher than last year's first quarter. Total growth benefited from the ZEE Medical acquisition. On an organic basis, growth was 10.5%. This was a good sequential increase in the growth rate from 8.2% in our fourth quarter. This segment's gross margin was 42.3% in the first quarter compared to 45.9% in the prior year period. Energy-related costs were 40 basis points lower than in last year's first quarter. 
As Mike stated earlier, we are in the very beginning stages of the integration of the business. As expected, our First Aid and Safety Services results were negatively impacted by conversion costs, the amortization of intangible assets resulting from the purchase price accounting and other charges. This impact will continue in the short term as we assimilate the acquired business and begin to realize the synergies. We're excited about the benefits and opportunities that this acquisition provides. 
Regarding selling and general administrative expenses. Total company SG&A was 28.2% as a percentage of first quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's first quarter of 28.5%. The 30 basis point improvement in SG&A was realized despite a 40 basis point increase in medical expenses this quarter compared to last year. 
On July 15 2015, Cintas announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to sell its investment in Shred-it for approximately $550 million to $600 million before taxes. The transaction is still expected to close in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2015. As a result of the announced sale of the investment, the related income or loss is now reported in discontinued operations. The investment in Shred-it in the balance sheet is reported in assets held for sale, and the related tax liability is reported in our liabilities held for sale. 
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 37.2%, the same rate as in the prior year period. We expect the full year of 2016 effective tax rate to be 37.3%. 
Our cash and marketable securities were $200 million at August 31, a decrease of $233 million from the $433 million at May 31.  Cash provided by operating activities was $143 million in our first quarter. Uses of cash included $121 million net of cash required for acquisitions and about $222 million were repurchases of Cintas common stock. 
Capital expenditures for the first quarter were approximately $63 million. Our CapEx by reportable operating segments was as follows: $55 million in uniform rental, $4 million in first aid and safety and $4 million in All Other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2015 to be in the range of $250 million to $300 million. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

So let's call is about a 40 basis point benefit from the workday. We have talked about the energy-related customers creating a bit of a drag. Keep in mind when those customers stop or eliminate positions, that is lost revenue. But we still have the amortization of the garments, and we still are driving the truck to that customer. So we still have a lot of the costs without the revenue. That is basically an offset to that work day benefit during our first quarter. Now I will tell you also, when you compare our first quarter gross margin in the rental business to the fourth quarter, in a quarter that had the same level of energy, our gross margin was 190 basis points better. And let's take off 40 basis points from the workday, we still have a very nice sequential improvement. And we feel very, very good about that. We're getting a lot of good leverage. And the last comment I'll make is one thing to keep in mind about last year was that our first quarter gross margin in the rental was the strongest of the year. It was 50 basis points better than any other quarter. We did have a very good quarter. There was a onetime customer buyout within the quarter that helped that gross margins. And so I think we had a very good gross margin quarter. And I would expect that we're going to continue to see good leveraging within that business, knowing that we do have a little bit, we're experiencing a little bit of a tailwind, or all of the tailwind of the energy costs to go away in the latter part of the year.

I would say the other thing about the the business, the routes were not as efficient as the Cintas routes. The revenue per route, the revenue per customer is not nearly as high as Cintas. And so it's -- it's a little bit more of an inefficient business, and we've got some work to do to integrate and get that to the levels where we want them to be. Having said that, the integration is going very well. And we're excited about that business and opportunity that it creates for our first aid business.

Now one thing to keep in mind is some of those proceeds will drag out a little bit with kind of a customary holdbacks, but let's go to the midpoint of that number. You will see on the balance sheet that there is a -- an asset held for sale of $194.275 million. That is our book value. The difference between the proceeds and that book value is a gain on which we'll have tax of 37.3%. In addition to that, on the balance sheet, there's liability held for sale of $78.457 million. And that essentially is a deferred tax item because we did not pay any tax on last year's gain at the time of the transaction, nor did we pay tax on the dividend that occurred in May. So that when we pay taxes, we'll have a little bit of a catch-up because of that deferred liability. I would expect that as Paul said, we'll see -- we expect that to close in the fourth quarter of this calendar year. I would expect that if that happens, we'll pay those taxes in the first calendar quarter of next year."

With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2016. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions.
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
As we reported today in the press release, please note that a change in our reportable segments. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require companies to evaluate their reportable operating segments when certain events occur.
As a result of a recent evaluation, effective June 1, 2015, we will report the following operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services and All Other. All Other primarily consists of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business division.
We are pleased to report first quarter revenue of $1,199,000,000, an increase of 8.8% from the prior year first quarter. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, workday differences and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 6.8%. Organic revenue growth for our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 6.8%, and the First Aid and Safety Services segment organic growth was 10.5%. The performance of our sales force in both segments was strong. We continue to add new customers and provide existing customers with additional products and services from our broad line.
First quarter operating income was $185.5 million, which was 15.5% of revenue compared to an operating margin of 14.8% in the prior year period. This represents a 70-basis-point improvement from last year's operating margin.
Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 was $106.2 million, and earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter were $0.93. Note that the first quarter of last year's -- of last fiscal year's net income and EPS from continuing operations were positively impacted by a gain from the sale of stock in an equity method investment. Excluding this gain, first quarter net income and EPS from continuing operations increased 15.1% and 19.2%, respectively, compared to the prior year.  Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue improved 50 basis points to 8.9% from 8.4% of revenue in last fiscal year's first quarter, excluding the prior year period gain.
We also demonstrated our continuing commitment to providing shareholder value through our stock buyback program. During August and into September through the close of business yesterday, Cintas purchased 2.9 million shares of common stock. This share buyback had no impact on first quarter EPS, but is expected to benefit full fiscal year EPS by $0.05. Since the beginning of fiscal 2016, approximately 4.5 million shares of common stock have been purchased at an aggregate cost of $381.2 million. As of September 23, 2015, Cintas had $381.8 million available under the current Board of Directors stock repurchase authorization.
As Cintas CEO Scott Farmer stated in today's press release, we are off to a good start to our fiscal 2016 year. We thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their strong performance.
On August 1, 2015, the company closed on the acquisition of ZEE Medical for a consideration of approximately $134 million in cash. About $121 million were paid at the closing of the transaction and an additional $13 million may be paid in future fiscal years subject to holdback provisions. We are in the very early stages of the integration of the ZEE business. We are excited about the benefits and opportunities this acquisition provides, including expanding our footprint and enabling us to serve an even greater number of customers in North America.
As a result of our first quarter results and the recent acquisition of ZEE Medical, we are updating our annual guidance. We expect fiscal 2016 revenue to be in the range of $4,800,000,000 to $4,880,000,000 and fiscal 2016 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.79 to $3.88. This guidance does not include any EPS impact from the announced agreement to sell our investment in Shred-it, which has not yet closed. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy or additional share buybacks. The EPS guidance is detailed in a table within today's press release.
I'll now turn the call over to Paul for more details on company financial performance."

First, please note that there were 66 workdays in this year's first quarter compared to 65 in last year's first quarter. The second and third quarters of this fiscal year will have the same number of workdays as last year of 65. This year's",833,"Thanks, Mike. First, please note that there were 66 workdays in this year's first quarter compared to 65 in last year's first quarter. The second and third quarters of this fiscal year will have the same number of workdays as last year of 65. This year's fourth quarter will have 66 workdays compared to 65 in last year's fourth quarter. Thus, fiscal year 2016 will have 262 workdays, 2 more than in fiscal 2015.
As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.8% in the first quarter. New business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services, retention and price increases, also -- all contributed to the strong growth rate. Total company gross margin was 43.7% for the first quarter of this year compared to 43.4% last year. Total company energy-related expenses for this year's first quarter were 2.2%. Last year's first quarter energy-related expenses were 2.8%.
As Mike previously stated, effective June 1, 2015, we have 3 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services and All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business division. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.
The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $938 million, an increase of 7.4% compared to last year's first quarter. Organic growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, workday differences and foreign currency exchange rate changes, was 6.8%. For comparative purposes, this segment's organic growth for the previous quarter, our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter, was 6.2%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.7% for the first quarter, an increase of 90 basis points from 43.8% in last year's first quarter. Energy-related costs were 70 basis points lower than in last year's first quarter.
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $99 million, which was 24.5% higher than last year's first quarter. Total growth benefited from the ZEE Medical acquisition. On an organic basis, growth was 10.5%. This was a good sequential increase in the growth rate from 8.2% in our fourth quarter. This segment's gross margin was 42.3% in the first quarter compared to 45.9% in the prior year period. Energy-related costs were 40 basis points lower than in last year's first quarter.
As Mike stated earlier, we are in the very beginning stages of the integration of the ZEE business. As expected, our First Aid and Safety Services results were negatively impacted by conversion costs, the amortization of intangible assets resulting from the purchase price accounting and other charges. This impact will continue in the short term as we assimilate the acquired business and begin to realize the synergies. We are excited about the benefits and opportunities that this acquisition provides.
Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses. Total company SG&A was 28.2% as a percentage of first quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's first quarter of 28.5%. The 30-basis-point improvement in SG&A was realized despite a 40 basis point increase in medical expenses this quarter compared to last year.
On July 15, 2015, Cintas announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to sell its investment in Shred-it for approximately $550 million to $600 million before taxes. The transaction is still expected to close in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2015. As a result of the announced sale of the investment, the related income or loss is now reported in discontinued operations. The investment in Shred-it on the balance sheet is recorded as assets held for sale and a related tax liability is recorded as liabilities held for sale.
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 37.2%, the same rate as in the prior year period. We expect the full year 2016 effective tax rate to be 37.3%.
Our cash and marketable securities were $200 million at August 31, a decrease of $233 million from the $433 million on May 31. Cash provided by operating activities was $143 million in our first quarter. Uses of cash included $121 million net of cash acquired were acquisitions and about $222 million were repurchases of Cintas common stock.
Capital expenditures for the first quarter were approximately $63 million. Our CapEx by reportable operating segment was as follows: $55 million in Uniform Rental, $4 million in First Aid and Safety and $4 million in All Other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $250 million to $300 million.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

Today, it was somewhere in the CAD 1.33, CAD 1.34 range, which is a little bit weaker than we guided at CAD 1.25. So we may see a little bit of top line impact as we go through the rest of the year.

So let's call it about a 40 basis point benefit from the workday. We have talked about the energy-related customers creating a bit of a drag. Keep in mind, when those customers stop or eliminate positions, that is lost revenue. But we still have the amortization of the garments, and we still are driving the truck to that customer. So we still have a lot of the costs without the revenue. That is basically an offset to that workday benefit during our first quarter. Now I will tell you also, when you compare our first quarter gross margin in the rental business to the fourth quarter, in a quarter that had the same level of energy, our gross margin was 190 basis points better. And let's take off 40 basis points from the workday, we still had a very nice sequential improvement. And we feel very, very good about that. We're getting a lot of good leverage. And then the last comment I'll make is, one thing to keep in mind about last year was that our first quarter gross margin in rental was the strongest of the year. It was 50 basis points better than any other quarter. We did have a very good quarter. There was a onetime customer buyout within the quarter that helped that gross margin. And so I think we had a very good gross margin quarter. And I would expect that we're going to continue to see good leveraging within that business, knowing that we do have a little bit -- we're expecting a little bit of the tailwind or all of the tailwind of the energy costs to go away in the latter part of the year.

With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2016. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions.
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
As we reported today in the press release, please note that a change in our reportable segments. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require companies to evaluate their reportable operating segments when certain events occur.
As a result of a recent evaluation, effective June 1, 2015, we will report the following operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services and All Other. All Other primarily consists of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business division.
We are pleased to report first quarter revenue of $1,199,000,000, an increase of 8.8% from the prior year first quarter. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, workday differences and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 6.8%. Organic revenue growth for our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 6.8%, and the First Aid and Safety Services segment organic growth was 10.5%. The performance of our sales force in both segments was strong. We continue to add new customers and provide existing customers with additional products and services from our broad line.
First quarter operating income was $185.5 million, which was 15.5% of revenue compared to an operating margin of 14.8% in the prior year period. This represents a 70-basis-point improvement from last year's operating margin.
Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 was $106.2 million, and earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter were $0.93. Note that the first quarter of last year's -- of last fiscal year's net income and EPS from continuing operations were positively impacted by a gain from the sale of stock in an equity method investment. Excluding this gain, first quarter net income and EPS from continuing operations increased 15.1% and 19.2%, respectively, compared to the prior year.  Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue improved 50 basis points to 8.9% from 8.4% of revenue in last fiscal year's first quarter, excluding the prior year period gain.
We also demonstrated our continuing commitment to providing shareholder value through our stock buyback program. During August and into September through the close of business yesterday, Cintas purchased 2.9 million shares of common stock. This share buyback had no impact on first quarter EPS, but is expected to benefit full fiscal year EPS by $0.05. Since the beginning of fiscal 2016, approximately 4.5 million shares of common stock have been purchased at an aggregate cost of $381.2 million. As of September 23, 2015, Cintas had $381.8 million available under the current Board of Directors stock repurchase authorization.
As Cintas CEO Scott Farmer stated in today's press release, we are off to a good start to our fiscal 2016 year. We thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their strong performance.
On August 1, 2015, the company closed on the acquisition of ZEE Medical for a consideration of approximately $134 million in cash. About $121 million were paid at the closing of the transaction and an additional $13 million may be paid in future fiscal years subject to holdback provisions. We are in the very early stages of the integration of the ZEE business. We are excited about the benefits and opportunities this acquisition provides, including expanding our footprint and enabling us to serve an even greater number of customers in North America.
As a result of our first quarter results and the recent acquisition of ZEE Medical, we are updating our annual guidance. We expect fiscal 2016 revenue to be in the range of $4,800,000,000 to $4,880,000,000 and fiscal 2016 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.79 to $3.88. This guidance does not include any EPS impact from the announced agreement to sell our investment in Shred-it, which has not yet closed. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy or additional share buybacks. The EPS guidance is detailed in a table within today's press release.
I'll now turn the call over to Paul for more details on company financial performance."

First, please note that there were 66 workdays in this year's first quarter compared to 65 in last year's first quarter. The second and third quarters of this fiscal year will have the same number of workdays as last year of 65. This year's",833,"Thanks, Mike. First, please note that there were 66 workdays in this year's first quarter compared to 65 in last year's first quarter. The second and third quarters of this fiscal year will have the same number of workdays as last year of 65. This year's fourth quarter will have 66 workdays compared to 65 in last year's fourth quarter. Thus, fiscal year 2016 will have 262 workdays, 2 more than in fiscal 2015.
As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.8% in the first quarter. New business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services, retention and price increases, also -- all contributed to the strong growth rate. Total company gross margin was 43.7% for the first quarter of this year compared to 43.4% last year. Total company energy-related expenses for this year's first quarter were 2.2%. Last year's first quarter energy-related expenses were 2.8%.
As Mike previously stated, effective June 1, 2015, we have 3 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services and All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business division. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.
The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $938 million, an increase of 7.4% compared to last year's first quarter. Organic growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, workday differences and foreign currency exchange rate changes, was 6.8%. For comparative purposes, this segment's organic growth for the previous quarter, our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter, was 6.2%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.7% for the first quarter, an increase of 90 basis points from 43.8% in last year's first quarter. Energy-related costs were 70 basis points lower than in last year's first quarter.
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $99 million, which was 24.5% higher than last year's first quarter. Total growth benefited from the ZEE Medical acquisition. On an organic basis, growth was 10.5%. This was a good sequential increase in the growth rate from 8.2% in our fourth quarter. This segment's gross margin was 42.3% in the first quarter compared to 45.9% in the prior year period. Energy-related costs were 40 basis points lower than in last year's first quarter.
As Mike stated earlier, we are in the very beginning stages of the integration of the ZEE business. As expected, our First Aid and Safety Services results were negatively impacted by conversion costs, the amortization of intangible assets resulting from the purchase price accounting and other charges. This impact will continue in the short term as we assimilate the acquired business and begin to realize the synergies. We are excited about the benefits and opportunities that this acquisition provides.
Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses. Total company SG&A was 28.2% as a percentage of first quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's first quarter of 28.5%. The 30-basis-point improvement in SG&A was realized despite a 40 basis point increase in medical expenses this quarter compared to last year.
On July 15, 2015, Cintas announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to sell its investment in Shred-it for approximately $550 million to $600 million before taxes. The transaction is still expected to close in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2015. As a result of the announced sale of the investment, the related income or loss is now reported in discontinued operations. The investment in Shred-it on the balance sheet is recorded as assets held for sale and a related tax liability is recorded as liabilities held for sale.
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 37.2%, the same rate as in the prior year period. We expect the full year 2016 effective tax rate to be 37.3%.
Our cash and marketable securities were $200 million at August 31, a decrease of $233 million from the $433 million on May 31. Cash provided by operating activities was $143 million in our first quarter. Uses of cash included $121 million net of cash acquired were acquisitions and about $222 million were repurchases of Cintas common stock.
Capital expenditures for the first quarter were approximately $63 million. Our CapEx by reportable operating segment was as follows: $55 million in Uniform Rental, $4 million in First Aid and Safety and $4 million in All Other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $250 million to $300 million.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

So let's call it about a 40 basis point benefit from the workday. We have talked about the energy-related customers creating a bit of a drag. Keep in mind, when those customers stop or eliminate positions, that is lost revenue. But we still have the amortization of the garments, and we still are driving the truck to that customer. So we still have a lot of the costs without the revenue. That is basically an offset to that workday benefit during our first quarter. Now I will tell you also, when you compare our first quarter gross margin in the rental business to the fourth quarter, in a quarter that had the same level of energy, our gross margin was 190 basis points better. And let's take off 40 basis points from the workday, we still had a very nice sequential improvement. And we feel very, very good about that. We're getting a lot of good leverage. And then the last comment I'll make is, one thing to keep in mind about last year was that our first quarter gross margin in rental was the strongest of the year. It was 50 basis points better than any other quarter. We did have a very good quarter. There was a onetime customer buyout within the quarter that helped that gross margin. And so I think we had a very good gross margin quarter. And I would expect that we're going to continue to see good leveraging within that business, knowing that we do have a little bit -- we're expecting a little bit of the tailwind or all of the tailwind of the energy costs to go away in the latter part of the year.

And so it's a bit of a -- a little bit more of an inefficient business, and we've got some work to do to integrate and get that to the levels where we want them to be. Having said that, the integration is going very well. And we're excited about that business and its opportunity that it creates for our first aid business.

With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2016. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions.
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
As we reported today in the press release, please note that a change in our reportable segments. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require companies to evaluate their reportable operating segments when certain events occur.
As a result of a recent evaluation, effective June 1, 2015, we will report the following operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services and All Other. All Other primarily consists of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business division.
We are pleased to report first quarter revenue of $1,199,000,000, an increase of 8.8% from the prior year first quarter. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, workday differences and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 6.8%. Organic revenue growth for our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 6.8%, and the First Aid and Safety Services segment organic growth was 10.5%. The performance of our sales force in both segments was strong. We continue to add new customers and provide existing customers with additional products and services from our broad line.
First quarter operating income was $185.5 million, which was 15.5% of revenue compared to an operating margin of 14.8% in the prior year period. This represents a 70 basis point improvement from last year's operating margin.
Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 was $106.2 million, and earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter were $0.93. Note that the first quarter of last year's -- of last fiscal year's net income and EPS from continuing operations were positively impacted by a gain from the sale of stock in an equity method investment. Excluding this gain, first quarter net income and EPS from continuing operations increased 15.1% and 19.2%, respectively, compared to the prior year. Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue improved 50 basis points to 8.9% from 8.4% of revenue in last fiscal year's first quarter, excluding the prior year period gain.
We also demonstrated our continuing commitment to providing shareholder value through our stock buyback program. During August and into September through the close of business yesterday, Cintas purchased 2.9 million shares of common stock. This share buyback had no impact on first quarter EPS, but is expected to benefit full fiscal year EPS by $0.05. Since the beginning of fiscal 2016, approximately 4.5 million shares of common stock have been purchased at an aggregate cost of $381.2 million. As of September 23, 2015, Cintas had $381.8 million available under the current Board of Directors stock repurchase authorization.
As Cintas CEO Scott Farmer stated in today's press release, we are off to a good start to our fiscal 2016 year. We thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their strong performance.
On August 1, 2015, the company closed on the acquisition of ZEE Medical for a consideration of approximately $134 million in cash. About $121 million were paid at the closing of the transaction and an additional $13 million may be paid in future fiscal years subject to holdback provisions. We are in the very early stages of the integration of the ZEE business. We are excited about the benefits and opportunities this acquisition provides, including expanding our footprint and enabling us to serve an even greater number of customers in North America.
As a result of our first quarter results and the recent acquisition of ZEE Medical, we are updating our annual guidance. We expect fiscal 2016 revenue to be in the range of $4,800,000,000 to $4,880,000,000 and fiscal 2016 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.79 to $3.88. This guidance does not include any EPS impact from the announced agreement to sell our investment in Shred-it, which has not yet closed. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy or additional share buybacks. The EPS guidance is detailed in a table within today's press release.
I'll now turn the call over to Paul for more details on company financial performance."

First, please note that there were 66 workdays in this year's first quarter compared to 65 in last year's first quarter. The second and third quarters of this fiscal year will have the same number of workdays as last year of 65. This year's",835,"Thanks, Mike. First, please note that there were 66 workdays in this year's first quarter compared to 65 in last year's first quarter. The second and third quarters of this fiscal year will have the same number of workdays as last year of 65. This year's fourth quarter will have 66 workdays compared to 65 in last year's fourth quarter. Thus, fiscal year 2016 will have 262 workdays, 2 more than in fiscal 2015.
As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.8% in the first quarter. New business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services, retention and price increases, also -- all contributed to the strong growth rate. Total company gross margin was 43.7% for the first quarter of this year compared to 43.4% last year. Total company energy-related expenses for this year's first quarter were 2.2%. Last year's first quarter energy-related expenses were 2.8%.
As Mike previously stated, effective June 1, 2015, we have 3 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services and All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business division. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.
The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $938 million, an increase of 7.4% compared to last year's first quarter. Organic growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, workday differences and foreign currency exchange rate changes, was 6.8%. For comparative purposes, this segment's organic growth for the previous quarter, our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter, was 6.2%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.7% for the first quarter, an increase of 90 basis points from 43.8% in last year's first quarter. Energy-related costs were 70 basis points lower than in last year's first quarter.
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $99 million, which was 24.5% higher than last year's first quarter. Total growth benefited from the ZEE Medical acquisition. On an organic basis, growth was 10.5%. This was a good sequential increase in the growth rate from 8.2% in our fourth quarter. This segment's gross margin was 42.3% in the first quarter compared to 45.9% in the prior year period. Energy-related costs were 40 basis points lower than in last year's first quarter.
As Mike stated earlier, we are in the very beginning stages of the integration of the ZEE business. As expected, our First Aid and Safety Services results were negatively impacted by conversion costs, the amortization of intangible assets resulting from the purchase price accounting and other charges. This impact will continue in the short term as we assimilate the acquired business and begin to realize the synergies. We are excited about the benefits and opportunities that this acquisition provides.
Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses. Total company SG&A was 28.2% as a percentage of first quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's first quarter of 28.5%. The 30 basis point improvement in SG&A was realized despite a 40 basis point increase in medical expenses this quarter compared to last year.
On July 15, 2015, Cintas announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to sell its investment in Shred-it for approximately $550 million to $600 million before taxes. The transaction is still expected to close in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2015. As a result of the announced sale of the investment, the related income or loss is now reported in discontinued operations. The investment in Shred-it on the balance sheet is recorded as assets held for sale and a related tax liability is recorded as liabilities held for sale.
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 37.2%, the same rate as in the prior year period. We expect the full year 2016 effective tax rate to be 37.3%.
Our cash and marketable securities were $200 million at August 31, a decrease of $233 million from the $433 million on May 31. Cash provided by operating activities was $143 million in our first quarter. Uses of cash included $121 million net of cash acquired were acquisitions and about $222 million were repurchases of Cintas common stock.
Capital expenditures for the first quarter were approximately $63 million. Our CapEx by reportable operating segment was as follows: $55 million in Uniform Rental, $4 million in First Aid and Safety and $4 million in All Other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $250 million to $300 million.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

So let's call it about a 40 basis point benefit from the workday. We have talked about the energy-related customers creating a bit of a drag. Keep in mind, when those customers stop or eliminate positions, that is lost revenue. But we still have the amortization of the garments, and we still are driving the truck to that customer. So we still have a lot of the costs without the revenue. That is basically an offset to that workday benefit during our first quarter. Now I will tell you also, when you compare our first quarter gross margin in the rental business to the fourth quarter, in a quarter that had the same level of energy, our gross margin was 190 basis points better. And let's take off 40 basis points from the workday, we still had a very nice sequential improvement. And we feel very, very good about that. We're getting a lot of good leverage. And then the last comment I'll make is, one thing to keep in mind about last year was that our first quarter gross margin in rental was the strongest of the year. It was 50 basis points better than any other quarter. We did have a very good quarter. There was a onetime customer buyout within the quarter that helped that gross margin. And so I think we had a very good gross margin quarter. And I would expect that we're going to continue to see good leveraging within that business, knowing that we do have a little bit -- we're expecting a little bit of the tailwind or all of the tailwind of the energy costs to go away in the latter part of the year.

And so it's a bit of a -- a little bit more of an inefficient business, and we've got some work to do to integrate and get that to the levels where we want them to be. Having said that, the integration is going very well. And we're excited about that business and its opportunity that it creates for our first aid business.

The difference between the proceeds and that book value is a gain on which we'll have a tax of 37.3%. In addition to that, on the balance sheet, there's a liability held for sale of $78.457 million.

We will discuss our second quarter results for fiscal 2016, and after our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions. 
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
We're pleased to report second quarter revenue of $1,219,000,000, an increase of 8.5% from the prior year's second quarter. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 6.5%. Organic revenue growth for uniform rental and facility services was 6.2%, and the first aid and safety services organic growth was 9.8%.
The performance of our sales force in both segments continues to be strong, with solid improvement in sales rep productivity. We are pleased with our ability to continue to add new customers and to provide existing customers with additional products and services from our broad line.
Second quarter operating income was $200.3 million, an increase of 10.3% over last year's second quarter. Second quarter operating margin improved to 16.4% of revenue compared to an operating margin of 16.2% in the prior year period. The uniform rental and facility services segment led the way with a margin of 18.1%.
Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was $115.5 million compared to $103.7 million in the prior year period, an increase of 11.3%. Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue improved to 9.5% from 9.2% of revenue in last fiscal year's second quarter.
Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal year '16 were $1.03 compared to $0.86 for the second quarter of last year. Second quarter fiscal '16 EPS from continuing operations increased 19.8% compared to the prior year period. We are on pace to achieve our sixth consecutive year of double-digit increases in EPS. 
As Cintas' CEO Scott Farmer stated in today's press release, we are happy to again report strong increases in revenue, operating income and EPS. We thank our employees, whom we call partners, for continuously striving to exceed expectations.
As a result of our second quarter results, we are updating our annual guidance. We expect fiscal 2016 revenue to be in the range of $4,825,000,000 to $4,880,000,000 and fiscal 2016 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.83 to $3.90. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy or additional share buybacks. The EPS guidance is detailed in the table within today's press release.
On December 4, we paid an annual dividend of $1.05 per share, totaling $115.5 million. The dividend per share was 23.5% more than last year's annual dividend of $0.85 per share and was the 32nd consecutive year it had been increased. The dividend, coupled with our share buyback program, demonstrates our commitment to increasing shareholder value. 
As previously disclosed, since the beginning of fiscal year 2016, Cintas repurchased about 4.5 million shares under our buyback program at an aggregate cost of $382.9 million, including $180.4 million of repurchases in the second quarter. The company still has $380 million available under the current Board of Directors stock repurchase authorization.
Before Paul provides more details of company financial performance, I want to briefly address the impact of oil, gas and coal on our results. We talked a lot about the benefits of low fuel prices, but we've seen these low fuel prices affect our customers more than anticipated 90 days ago. U.S. oil rig counts are down over 60% compared to last year, and the price of oil has tumbled below $40 per barrel. 
We see the impact of headcount reductions in not only the oil industry but also in gas and coal. We estimate that headcount reductions in these industries lowered our organic growth rate by about 75 basis points in the second quarter and reduced our operating margin by about 35 basis points. While low fuel prices still more than offset this bottom line impact in the second quarter, we expect this net impact to be even or slightly negative in the second half of the year.
I'll now turn the call to Paul for additional information."

First, please note that there were 65 workdays in this year's second quarter, the same number of days as last year's second quarter. The same will hold true for the third quarter. However, this year's fourth quarter will have 66 work days",1005,"Thank you, Mike. First, please note that there were 65 workdays in this year's second quarter, the same number of days as last year's second quarter. The same will hold true for the third quarter. However, this year's fourth quarter will have 66 work days compared to only 65 in last year's fourth quarter. In total, fiscal year 2016 will have 262 work days, 2 more than in fiscal 2015.
As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.5% in the second quarter. New business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services, customer retention and price increases all contributed to this solid growth rate.
Total company gross margin was 43.3% for the second quarter of this year compared to 42.9% last year. Total company energy-related expenses for this year's second quarter were 2.0% of revenue compared to 2.6% of revenue in last year's second quarter. 
I'll address the impacts of oil, gas and coal and the recent ZEE Medical acquisition on gross margin at the operating margin segment level. Recall that effective June 1 of this year, we have 3 reportable operating segments: uniform rental and facility services; first aid and safety services and All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our direct sale business division. First aid and safety services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.
The uniform rental and facility services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on Route. Uniform rental and facility services revenue was $937.7 million, an increase of 5.2% compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, organic growth was 6.2%.
Our uniform rental and facility services segment gross margin was 43.9% for the second quarter, an increase of 60 basis points from 43.3% in last year's second quarter. Energy-related costs were 50 basis points lower than in last year's second quarter. We estimate that job losses in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year second quarter gross margin by 20 basis points.
Our first aid and safety services operating segments includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the second quarter was $120.4 million, which was 46.4% higher than last year's second quarter, total growth benefited from the ZEE Medical acquisition. On an organic basis, growth for the segment was 9.8%.
This segment's gross margin was 43.2% in the second quarter compared to 46.7% in the prior year period. The reduction in gross margin is wholly attributable to the impact of the recently acquired ZEE Medical business. Given that the acquisition occurred about 4 months ago, we are in the integration phase and incurring the customary cost of conversion. The assimilation of the business, including Route consolidation, is now underway, which is integral to the realization of synergies. And we are pleased to report 90 basis points of improved gross margin on a sequential basis. We are excited about the benefits and opportunities this acquisition provides. First aid and safety is well on its way to becoming a $0.5 billion operating segment for us.
Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 26.8% as a percentage of second quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's second quarter of 26.7%. Medical expenses as a percentage of revenue were 10 basis points higher in this year's second quarter.
Very soon, we will introduce an exciting new marketing campaign. The expense of the campaign began to be recognized in the second quarter. Its impact on SG&A was about 10 basis points. The related expense will continue through the end of the fiscal year, with the greatest impact falling in our third quarter.
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter was 37.4%, the same rate as in the prior year period. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect the effective tax rate to be 37.3% in both the third and fourth quarters. For comparative purposes, the effective tax rate in last fiscal year's third and fourth quarters was 36.2% and 37.6%, respectively.
On October 1 of this year, we sold our investment in Shred-it for $578.3 million before taxes. Cintas also has the opportunity to receive up to $34 million in additional consideration in the future, subject to certain holdback provisions. Note that the gain on sale of the investment is included in discontinued operations. 
The sale of the investment completes our exit from the Document Management business. As a result of both the Shredding transactions and the sale of the Document Storage business, we realized total proceeds of $1,100,000,000 on a segment that had annual revenue of about $360 million [ph] That's a multiple of 3x annual revenue.
Our cash and marketable securities were $672.6 million as of November 30, an increase of $472.4 million from the balances of August 31. Cash provided by operating activities was $122 million in our second quarter. Uses of cash in the quarter included $180.7 million for repurchases of Cintas common stock. As previously mentioned, $578.3 million was received in the quarter as proceeds on the sale of the investment of Shred-it.  Note that our cash will be used in part to pay the taxes on the gains of our Shred-it investment in our fiscal third and fourth quarters. The amount of taxes to be paid is approximately $225 million.
Capital expenditures for the second quarter were about $59 million. Our CapEx by reportable operating segments was as follows: $51 million in uniform rental; $3 million in first aid and safety; and $5 million in All Other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $250 million to $300 million. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

So we obviously are reading the same press releases that you are. We understand the headwinds to U.S. manufacturing and we're keeping an eye on it.

And so for many of those, they are receiving the benefits of lower energy prices and other low input costs to their cost structure like commodities, et cetera.

And with something like a campaign, you can kind of turn it on and off a little bit. You can swerve it to meet the needs and we've done a little bit of that. And we did it -- because at the beginning of the year, we've got so much of the year to go, we want to see how the beginning of the year goes before we commit to things. But the year's gone well so far. We did start spending on that campaign in the second quarter. I would expect, as Paul said, to see that expense go up in the third quarter. We're excited about the campaign. One of the things that we hear from our customers frequently is that they didn't know that we can provide all of the different products and services that we do. So for example, we hear from uniform rental customers, ""Gosh, I didn't know that you were in the first aid and safety business."" Or ""I didn't know that you provide Fire Protection Services."" And so one of the goals is to raise awareness of all of the ways that we can provide value to our customers and we're excited about that. As it relates to more details, I would say stay tuned but we're excited about that. Now when we -- when I mentioned that and Paul mentioned that we'll see a little bit more expense in the third quarter, let me speak a little bit to the second half of the year guidance. Paul touched on a few things in his opening comments. One is we may spend a little bit more on this marketing campaign in the third quarter. Secondly, our tax rate in the third quarter last year was less than what we're guiding towards this year in the third quarter. It was more in the fourth quarter last year than what we're guiding towards. So that's going to have a year-over-year impact, slightly negative in the third, maybe a little bit positive in the fourth. And then the last thing I would point to as it relates to the second half of the year guidance is that we have one more work day in the fourth quarter than we do in the third quarter. And so when you take all 3 of those things and you think about our guidance and you think about your modeling, I would suggest that the fourth quarter is going to be weighted more heavily in terms of profitability than the third quarter is.

So if we think about the overall operating margin, I think that we expect that we'll get some continued margin improvement in the back half of the year. It is going to be a little bit pressured though because the year-over-year benefit of energy is going to decrease. Probably assuming that 2% rate down to 40 basis points in the third and 20 basis points in the fourth. And that negative impact from our oil and gas customers will start to become a bigger part of the net number, if you will.

We did not buy all of the business, we bought only a part of the business. It was a little bit kind of different kind of acquisition for us, first time we bought a business out of bankruptcy. And so we're in the midst of integrating that. And because it's in -- because it was in bankruptcy, obviously, it probably wasn't the strongest business that we've ever acquired. And so we want to make sure we understand how it rolls in, but we paid about $33.6 million for the acquisition. We believe that it will provide about $25 million to $30 million of annual revenue. We're in the midst of integrating that into quite a few different rental facilities where it's a really nice tuck-in opportunity. We have contemplated that the guidance. And I would say from a top line perspective, a couple of things to keep in mind. While we have contemplated that into the guidance, we have also seen the impact of the Canadian dollar weakening a little bit more than we anticipated 90 days ago. And as we've talked about oil and gas, that impact, negative impact is a little bit higher than we anticipated 90 days ago as well. So when you combine those 3 things together, we feel like the right thing to do is to leave the top end of the guidance where it is. But we feel good enough about the operating environment to move that bottom end of the guidance, revenue guidance up $25 million. From an EPS standpoint, that kind of -- that acquisition kind of fits into again, getting a better feel for where we are at the middle of the year.

But what's in the guidance? Is it -- going back on the guidance overall, what affects those first 3 components that are more commodity components, is that basically if the current commodity prices remain the same is how you're thinking about the guidance? And then part of the question too is if you could just elaborate on the concern you discussed on construction and manufacturing. Was that just reading headlines like the rest of us?

This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
We're pleased to report second quarter revenue of $1,219,000,000, an increase of 8.5% from the prior year's second quarter. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 6.5%. Organic revenue growth for Uniform Rental and Facility Services was 6.2%, and the First Aid and Safety Services organic growth was 9.8%.
The performance of our sales force in both segments continues to be strong, with solid improvement in sales rep productivity. We are pleased with our ability to continue to add new customers and to provide existing customers with additional products and services from our broad line.
Second quarter operating income was $200.3 million, an increase of 10.3% over last year's second quarter. Second quarter operating margin improved to 16.4% of revenue compared to an operating margin of 16.2% in the prior year period. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment led the way with a margin of 18.1%.
Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was $115.5 million compared to $103.7 million in the prior year period, an increase of 11.3%. Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue improved to 9.5% from 9.2% of revenue in last fiscal year's second quarter.
Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal year '16 were $1.03 compared to $0.86 for the second quarter of last year. Second quarter fiscal '16 EPS from continuing operations increased 19.8% compared to the prior year period. We are on pace to achieve our sixth consecutive year of double-digit increases in EPS. 
As Cintas' CEO Scott Farmer stated in today's press release, we are happy to again report strong increases in revenue, operating income and EPS. We thank our employees, whom we call partners, for continuously striving to exceed expectations.
As a result of our second quarter results, we are updating our annual guidance. We expect fiscal 2016 revenue to be in the range of $4,825,000,000 to $4,880,000,000 and fiscal 2016 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.83 to $3.90. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy or additional share buybacks. The EPS guidance is detailed in the table within today's press release.
On December 4, we paid an annual dividend of $1.05 per share, totaling $115.5 million. The dividend per share was 23.5% more than last year's annual dividend of $0.85 per share and was the 32nd consecutive year it had been increased. The dividend, coupled with our share buyback program, demonstrates our commitment to increasing shareholder value. 
As previously disclosed, since the beginning of fiscal year 2016, Cintas repurchased about 4.5 million shares under our buyback program at an aggregate cost of $382.9 million, including $180.4 million of repurchases in the second quarter. The company still has $380 million available under the current Board of Directors stock repurchase authorization.
Before Paul provides more details of company financial performance, I want to briefly address the impact of oil, gas and coal on our results. We've talked a lot about the benefits of low fuel prices, but we've seen these low fuel prices affect our customers more than anticipated 90 days ago. U.S. oil rig counts are down over 60% compared to last year, and the price of oil has tumbled below $40 per barrel. 
We see the impact of headcount reductions in not only the oil industry but also in gas and coal. We estimate that headcount reductions in these industries lowered our organic growth rate by about 75 basis points in the second quarter and reduced our operating margin by about 35 basis points. While low fuel prices still more than offset this bottom line impact in the second quarter, we expect this net impact to be even or slightly negative in the second half of the year.
I'll now turn the call over to Paul for additional information."

First, please note that there were 65 workdays in this year's second quarter, the same number of days as last year's second quarter. The same will hold true for the third quarter. However, this year's fourth quarter will have 66 work days",1004,"Thank you, Mike. First, please note that there were 65 workdays in this year's second quarter, the same number of days as last year's second quarter. The same will hold true for the third quarter. However, this year's fourth quarter will have 66 work days compared to only 65 in last year's fourth quarter. In total, fiscal year 2016 will have 262 workdays, 2 more than in fiscal 2015.
As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.5% in the second quarter. New business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services, customer retention and price increases all contributed to this solid growth rate.
Total company gross margin was 43.3% for the second quarter of this year compared to 42.9% last year. Total company energy-related expenses for this year's second quarter were 2.0% of revenue compared to 2.6% of revenue in last year's second quarter. 
I'll address the impacts of oil, gas and coal and the recent ZEE Medical acquisition on gross margin at the operating margin segment level. Recall that effective June 1 of this year, we have 3 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services; First Aid and Safety Services and All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business division. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.
The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $937.7 million, an increase of 5.2% compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, organic growth was 6.2%.
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 43.9% for the second quarter, an increase of 60 basis points from 43.3% in last year's second quarter. Energy-related costs were 50 basis points lower than in last year's second quarter. We estimate that job losses in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year second quarter gross margin by 20 basis points.
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the second quarter was $120.4 million, which was 46.4% higher than last year's second quarter, total growth benefited from the ZEE Medical acquisition. On an organic basis, growth for the segment was 9.8%.
This segment's gross margin was 43.2% in the second quarter compared to 46.7% in the prior year period. The reduction in gross margin is wholly attributable to the impact of the recently acquired ZEE Medical business. Given that the acquisition occurred about 4 months ago, we are in the integration phase and incurring the customary cost of conversion. The assimilation of the business, including route consolidation, is now underway, which is integral to the realization of synergies. And we are pleased to report 90 basis points of improved gross margin on a sequential basis. We are excited about the benefits and opportunities this acquisition provides. First Aid and Safety is well on its way to becoming a $0.5 billion operating segment for us.
Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses. Total company SG&A was 26.8% as a percentage of second quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's second quarter of 26.7%. Medical expenses as a percentage of revenue were 10 basis points higher in this year's second quarter.
Very soon, we will introduce an exciting new marketing campaign. The expense of the campaign began to be recognized in the second quarter. Its impact on SG&A was about 10 basis points. The related expense will continue through the end of the fiscal year, with the greatest impact falling in our third quarter.
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter was 37.4%, the same rate as in the prior year period. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect the effective tax rate to be 37.3% in both the third and fourth quarters. For comparative purposes, the effective tax rate in last fiscal year's third and fourth quarters was 36.2% and 37.6%, respectively.
On October 1 of this year, we sold our investment in Shred-it for $578.3 million before taxes. Cintas also has the opportunity to receive up to $34 million in additional consideration in the future, subject to certain holdback provisions. Note that the gain on sale of the investment is included in discontinued operations. 
The sale of the investment completes our exit from the Document Management business. As a result of both the Shredding transactions and the sale of the Document Storage business, we realized total proceeds of $1,100,000,000 on a segment that had annual revenue of about $360 million. That's a multiple of 3x annual revenue.
Our cash and marketable securities were $672.6 million as of November 30, an increase of $472.4 million from the balances of August 31. Cash provided by operating activities was $122 million in our second quarter. Uses of cash in the quarter included $180.7 million for repurchases of Cintas common stock. As previously mentioned, $578.3 million was received in the quarter as proceeds on the sale of the investment in Shred-it.  Note that our cash will be used in part to pay the taxes on the gains on our Shred-it investment in our fiscal third and fourth quarters. The amount of taxes to be paid is approximately $225 million.
Capital expenditures for the second quarter were about $59 million. Our CapEx by reportable operating segments was as follows: $51 million in Uniform Rental; $3 million in First Aid and Safety; and $5 million in All Other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $250 million to $300 million. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

Now we have more hygiene products than we ever had before. We have retail-inspired workwear like Carhartt that enables us to put people in uniform that previously did not want the program or were not interested in one, and we're in health care, I mean, with Scrub Rental. So we continue to evolve such that, currently, our percentage of our customer base that is in the service-providing sector of the economy is about 70%. So about 30% of our customer base is in the goods-producing areas of the economy. And by goods-producing, I mean, oil, gas, coal, construction and manufacturing as well. So we, obviously, are reading the same press releases that you are. We understand the headwinds to U.S. manufacturing, and we're keeping an eye on it. But at the same time, we're trying to keep things in perspective. We do know that not every single one of our customers in manufacturing exports. And so for many of those, they are receiving the benefits of lower energy prices and other low input costs to their cost structure like commodities, et cetera.

And with something like a campaign, you can kind of turn it on and off a little bit. You can swerve it to meet the needs and we've done a little bit of that. And we did it -- because at the beginning of the year, we've got so much of the year to go, we want to see how the beginning of the year goes before we commit to things. But the year's gone well so far. We did start spending on that campaign in the second quarter. I would expect, as Paul said, to see that expense go up in the third quarter. We're excited about the campaign. One of the things that we hear from our customers frequently is that they didn't know that we can provide all of the different products and services that we do. So for example, we hear from Uniform Rental customers, ""Gosh, I didn't know that you were in the first aid and safety business."" Or ""I didn't know that you -- that you provide fire protection services."" And so one of the goals is to raise awareness of all of the ways that we can provide value to our customers and we're excited about that. As it relates to more details, I would say stay tuned but we're excited about that. Now when we -- when I mentioned that, and Paul mentioned, that we'll see a little bit more expense in the third quarter, let me speak a little bit to the second half of the year guidance. Paul touched on a few things in his opening comments. One is, we may spend a little bit more on this marketing campaign in the third quarter. Secondly, our tax rate in the third quarter last year was less than what we're guiding towards this year in the third quarter. It was more in the fourth quarter last year than what we're guiding towards. So that's going to have a year-over-year impact, so slightly negative in the third, maybe a little bit positive in the fourth. And then the last thing I would point to as it relates to the second half of the year guidance is that we have one more workday in the fourth quarter than we do in the third quarter. And so when you take all 3 of those things and you think about our guidance and you think about your modeling, I would suggest that the fourth quarter is going to be weighted more heavily in terms of profitability than the third quarter is.

And so, if we think about the overall operating margin, I think that we expect that we'll get some continued margin improvement in the back half of the year. It is going to be a little bit pressured though because the year-over-year benefit of energy is going to decrease, probably if assuming that 2% rate down to 40 basis points in the third and 20 basis points in the fourth. And that negative impact from our oil and gas customers will start to become a bigger part of the net number, if you will. So while we do expect to continue to improve margins, I would say that, given the pressure of that alone, we might be a little -- we might see a little bit of narrowing in the second half of the year."

We did not buy all of the business; we bought only a part of the business. It's a little bit kind of different kind of acquisition for us, first time we bought a business out of bankruptcy, and so we're in the midst of integrating that. And because it's in -- because it was in bankruptcy, obviously, it probably wasn't the strongest business that we've ever acquired. And so we want to make sure we understand how it rolls in, but it's -- we paid about $33.6 million for the acquisition. We believe that it will provide about $25 million to $30 million of annual revenue. We're in the midst of integrating that into quite a few different rental facilities where it's a really nice tuck-in opportunity. We have contemplated that into the guidance. And I would say, from a top line perspective, a couple of things to keep in mind. While we have contemplated that into the guidance, we have also seen the impact of the Canadian dollar weakening a little bit more than we anticipated 90 days ago. And as we've talked about oil and gas, that impact, negative impact is a little bit higher than we anticipated 90 days ago as well. And so when you combine those 3 things together, we feel like the right thing to do is to leave the top end of the guidance where it is. But we feel good enough about the operating environment to move that bottom end of the guidance, revenue guidance up $25 million. From an EPS standpoint, that kind of -- that acquisition kind of fits into, again, getting a better feel for where we are at the middle of the year.

And we expect that every single year. And so absent the couple of callouts, we expect to get leveraging in the G&A area every single year. So getting back to, is 28% the right number? Andrew -- or is 27%, 28% the right number? We need to see a little bit more of how our First Aid business operates with the ZEE integration. And I think next year will be a better indicator."

We will discuss our second quarter results for fiscal 2016, and after our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions. 
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
We're pleased to report second quarter revenue of $1,219,000,000, an increase of 8.5% from the prior year's second quarter. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 6.5%. Organic revenue growth for Uniform Rental and Facility Services was 6.2%, and the First Aid and Safety Services organic growth was 9.8%.
The performance of our sales force in both segments continues to be strong, with solid improvement in sales rep productivity. We are pleased with our ability to continue to add new customers and to provide existing customers with additional products and services from our broad line.
Second quarter operating income was $200.3 million, an increase of 10.3% over last year's second quarter. Second quarter operating margin improved to 16.4% of revenue compared to an operating margin of 16.2% in the prior year period. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment led the way with a margin of 18.1%.
Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was $115.5 million compared to $103.7 million in the prior year period, an increase of 11.3%. Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue improved to 9.5% from 9.2% of revenue in last fiscal year's second quarter.
Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal year '16 were $1.03 compared to $0.86 for the second quarter of last year. Second quarter fiscal '16 EPS from continuing operations increased 19.8% compared to the prior year period. We are on pace to achieve our sixth consecutive year of double-digit increases in EPS. 
As Cintas' CEO Scott Farmer stated in today's press release, we are happy to again report strong increases in revenue, operating income and EPS. We thank our employees, whom we call partners, for continuously striving to exceed expectations.
As a result of our second quarter results, we are updating our annual guidance. We expect fiscal 2016 revenue to be in the range of $4,825,000,000 to $4,880,000,000 and fiscal 2016 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.83 to $3.90. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy or additional share buybacks. The EPS guidance is detailed in the table within today's press release.
On December 4, we paid an annual dividend of $1.05 per share, totaling $115.5 million. The dividend per share was 23.5% more than last year's annual dividend of $0.85 per share and was the 32nd consecutive year it had been increased. The dividend, coupled with our share buyback program, demonstrates our commitment to increasing shareholder value. 
As previously disclosed, since the beginning of fiscal year 2016, Cintas repurchased about 4.5 million shares under our buyback program at an aggregate cost of $382.9 million, including $180.4 million of repurchases in the second quarter. The company still has $380 million available under the current Board of Directors' stock repurchase authorization.
Before Paul provides more details of company financial performance, I want to briefly address the impact of oil, gas and coal on our results. We've talked a lot about the benefits of low fuel prices, but we've seen these low fuel prices affect our customers more than anticipated 90 days ago. U.S. oil rig counts are down over 60% compared to last year, and the price of oil has tumbled below $40 per barrel. 
We see the impact of headcount reductions in not only the oil industry but also in gas and coal. We estimate that headcount reductions in these industries lowered our organic growth rate by about 75 basis points in the second quarter and reduced our operating margin by about 35 basis points. While low fuel prices still more than offset this bottom line impact in the second quarter, we expect this net impact to be even or slightly negative in the second half of the year.
I'll now turn the call over to Paul for additional information."

First, please note that there were 65 workdays in this year's second quarter, the same number of days as last year's second quarter. The same will hold true for the third quarter. However, this year's fourth quarter will have 66 work days",1005,"Thank you, Mike. First, please note that there were 65 workdays in this year's second quarter, the same number of days as last year's second quarter. The same will hold true for the third quarter. However, this year's fourth quarter will have 66 work days compared to only 65 in last year's fourth quarter. In total, fiscal year 2016 will have 262 workdays, 2 more than in fiscal 2015.
As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.5% in the second quarter. New business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services, customer retention and price increases all contributed to this solid growth rate.
Total company gross margin was 43.3% for the second quarter of this year compared to 42.9% last year. Total company energy-related expenses for this year's second quarter were 2.0% of revenue compared to 2.6% of revenue in last year's second quarter. 
I will address the impacts of oil, gas and coal and the recent ZEE Medical acquisition on gross margin at the operating margin segment level. Recall that effective June 1 of this year, we have 3 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services; First Aid and Safety Services and All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business division. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.
The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $937.7 million, an increase of 5.2% compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, organic growth was 6.2%.
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 43.9% for the second quarter, an increase of 60 basis points from 43.3% in last year's second quarter. Energy-related costs were 50 basis points lower than in last year's second quarter. We estimate that job losses in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year second quarter gross margin by 20 basis points.
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the second quarter was $120.4 million, which was 46.4% higher than last year's second quarter, total growth benefited from the ZEE Medical acquisition. On an organic basis, growth for the segment was 9.8%.
This segment's gross margin was 43.2% in the second quarter compared to 46.7% in the prior year period. The reduction in gross margin is wholly attributable to the impact of the recently acquired ZEE Medical business. Given that the acquisition occurred about 4 months ago, we are in the integration phase and incurring the customary cost of conversion. The assimilation of the business, including route consolidation, is now underway, which is integral to the realization of synergies. And we are pleased to report 90 basis points of improved gross margin on a sequential basis. We are excited about the benefits and opportunities this acquisition provides. First Aid and Safety is well on its way to becoming a $0.5 billion operating segment for us.
Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses. Total company SG&A was 26.8% as a percentage of second quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's second quarter of 26.7%. Medical expenses as a percentage of revenue were 10 basis points higher in this year's second quarter.
Very soon, we will introduce an exciting new marketing campaign. The expense of the campaign began to be recognized in the second quarter. Its impact on SG&A was about 10 basis points. The related expense will continue through the end of the fiscal year, with the greatest impact falling in our third quarter.
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter was 37.4%, the same rate as in the prior year period. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect the effective tax rate to be 37.3% in both the third and fourth quarters. For comparative purposes, the effective tax rate in last fiscal year's third and fourth quarters was 36.2% and 37.6%, respectively.
On October 1 of this year, we sold our investment in Shred-it for $578.3 million before taxes. Cintas also has the opportunity to receive up to $34 million in additional consideration in the future, subject to certain holdback provisions. Note that the gain on sale of the investment is included in discontinued operations. 
The sale of the investment completes our exit from the Document Management business. As a result of both the Shredding transactions and the sale of the Document Storage business, we realized total proceeds of $1,100,000,000 on a segment that had annual revenue of about $360 million. That's a multiple of 3x annual revenue.
Our cash and marketable securities were $672.6 million as of November 30, an increase of $472.4 million from the balances of August 31. Cash provided by operating activities was $122 million in our second quarter. Uses of cash in the quarter included $180.7 million for repurchases of Cintas common stock. As previously mentioned, $578.3 million was received in the quarter as proceeds on the sale of the investment in Shred-it.  Note that our cash will be used in part to pay the taxes on the gains on our Shred-it investment in our fiscal third and fourth quarters. The amount of taxes to be paid is approximately $225 million.
Capital expenditures for the second quarter were about $59 million. Our CapEx by reportable operating segments was as follows: $51 million in Uniform Rental; $3 million in First Aid and Safety; and $5 million in All Other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $250 million to $300 million. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

Now we have more hygiene products than we ever had before. We have retail-inspired workwear like Carhartt that enables us to put people in uniform that previously did not want the program or were not interested in one, and we're in health care with Scrub Rental. So we continue to evolve such that, currently, our percentage of our customer base that is in the service-providing sector of the economy is about 70%, so about 30% of our customer base is in the goods-producing areas of the economy. And by goods-producing, I mean, oil, gas, coal, construction and manufacturing as well. So we, obviously, are reading the same press releases that you are. We understand the headwinds to U.S. manufacturing, and we're keeping an eye on it. But at the same time, we're trying to keep things in perspective. We do know that not every single one of our customers in manufacturing exports. And so for many of those, they are receiving the benefits of lower energy prices and other low input costs to their cost structure like commodities, et cetera. So the bottom line is we're continuing to monitor it, but at this point in time, the only negative impact to our business that we see in this goods-producing sector of the economy is from oil, gas and coal."

And with something like a campaign, you can kind of turn it on and off a little bit. You can swerve it to meet the needs and we've done a little bit of that. And we didn't -- because at the beginning of the year, there's -- we've got so much of the year to go, we want to see how the beginning of the year goes before we commit to things. But the year's gone well so far. We did start spending on that campaign in the second quarter. I would expect, as Paul said, to see that expense go up in the third quarter. We're excited about the campaign. One of the things that we hear from our customers frequently is that they didn't know that we can provide all of the different products and services that we do. So for example, we hear from Uniform Rental customers, ""Gosh, I didn't know that you were in the first aid and safety business."" Or ""I didn't know that you have -- that you provide fire protection services."" And so one of the goals is to raise awareness of all of the ways that we can provide value to our customers and we're excited about that. As it relates to more details, I would say stay tuned but we're excited about that. Now when we -- when I mentioned that -- and Paul mentioned, that we'll see a little bit more expense in the third quarter, let me speak a little bit to the second half of the year guidance. Paul touched on a few things in his opening comments. One is we may spend a little bit more on this marketing campaign in the third quarter. Secondly, our tax rate in the third quarter last year was less than what we're guiding towards this year in the third quarter. It was more in the fourth quarter last year than what we're guiding towards. So that's going to have a year-over-year impact, slightly negative in the third, maybe a little bit positive in the fourth. And then the last thing I would point to as it relates to the second half of the year guidance is that we have one more workday in the fourth quarter than we do in the third quarter. And so when you take all 3 of those things and you think about our guidance and you think about your modeling, I would suggest that the fourth quarter is going to be weighted more heavily in terms of profitability than the third quarter is.

We did not buy all of the business; we bought only a part of the business. It's a little bit kind of a different kind of acquisition for us, first time we bought a business out of bankruptcy, and so we're in the midst of integrating that. And because it's in -- because it was in bankruptcy, obviously, it probably wasn't the strongest business that we've ever acquired. And so we want to make sure we understand how it rolls in, but it's -- we paid about $33.6 million for the acquisition. We believe that it will provide about $25 million to $30 million of annual revenue. We're in the midst of integrating that into quite a few different rental facilities where it's a really nice tuck-in opportunity. We have contemplated that into the guidance. And I would say, from a top line perspective, a couple of things to keep in mind. While we have contemplated that into the guidance, we have also seen the impact of the Canadian dollar weakening a little bit more than we anticipated 90 days ago. And as we've talked about oil and gas, that impact, negative impact, is a little bit higher than we anticipated 90 days ago as well. And so when you combine those 3 things together, we feel like the right thing to do is to leave the top end of the guidance where it is. But we feel good enough about the operating environment to move that bottom end of the guidance, revenue guidance up $25 million. From an EPS standpoint, that kind of -- that acquisition kind of fits into, again, getting a better feel for where we are at the middle of the year.

And thank you very much for the color you've provided on oil, gas, coal. You -- I heard some cautionary remarks on construction, manufacturing, saying those domestically who don't export are doing okay. But what's in the guidance? Is it -- going back on the guidance overall, what affects those first 3 components that are more commodity components, is that basically if the current commodity prices remain the same is how you're thinking about the guidance? And then part of the question, too, is, if you could just elaborate on the concern you discussed on construction and manufacturing. Was that just reading headlines like the rest of us? Was it the import-export? And is that petering on being something that could go incrementally worse?"

And I think what Paul was referring to is that we're not convinced that we're in an industrial recessionary environment. We certainly know that the strong dollar can have some impact on certain types of manufacturing and certain types of customers, but we also know that it's a benefit to others. And our thoughts are generally that the current operating environment will continue in the second half of the year. And while we're cautious and maybe a little bit more so than 90 days ago, we still feel good about this operating environment and our ability to achieve the guidance in this environment."

About $100 million of that is outside of the U.S. So to bring that into the U.S. would be fairly costly. We did spend $115.5 million on our dividend in the first week of December. That was a dividend of $1.05 which was a 23.5% increase. So we are happy to share that with our shareholders. We did make the Coyne acquisition that closed on December 4 to just over $33 million. And as Paul said, we've got a -- you'll see on the balance sheet about a $236 million income taxes payable that will happen in February. So those last 3 items, we're going to be spending just under $400 million on those alone. So while there is a lot of cash on the balance sheet at November 30, there are plans for a good chunk of that. Having said that, we'll continue to generate cash. We would love to put that cash to work in accretive acquisitions similar to ZEE and Coyne, and we'll keep looking for those opportunities. That certainly is our highest priority.

That's a business that -- where we didn't bring a lot of G&A and overhead across and that's why we like that opportunity so much. So we've seen some real nice leveraging there. Yes, the marketing campaign is a little bit of a blip in the second half of our fiscal year. But I would say, going into fiscal '17 and then even more so in fiscal '18, we're going to have the SAP project concluding and beginning to depreciate. And so we will see some impact of that in the next 2 fiscal years. Absent that, we absolutely believe that we should be and believe we can grow SG&A at a slower rate than our revenue growth. And we expect that every single year. And so absent the couple of callouts, we expect to get leveraging in the G&A area every single year. So getting back to, is 28% the right number? Andrew, I -- or is 27%, 28% the right number? We need to see a little bit more of how our First Aid business operates with the ZEE integration. And I think next year will be a better indicator."
