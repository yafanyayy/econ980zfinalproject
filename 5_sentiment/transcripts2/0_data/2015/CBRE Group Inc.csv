The hard work we've done to grow our client base, improve and expand our service offering and invest in our people in operating platform paid off in a record year. 
Global revenue reached a record $9 million, rising 26% for the year. Normalized EBITDA set a new high at $1.2 billion. And adjusted EPS of $1.68 improved 17%. This strong growth was achieved over 2013 a year in which EBITDA in our Investment Management business exceeded $200 million with significant carried interest. In addition to record financial performance, we had other noteworthy achievements. These include material improvement in our operating platform, notably technology, research and specialized consulting services, allowing us to better serve of our clients, and in turn, create opportunity for our people and growth for our shareholders. While investing in our operating platform, we achieved significant operating leverage in our regional services businesses before the contribution from Norland. We successfully integrated Norland, a significant acquisition which closed a few days before the start of the year, and then grew its revenue by approximately 20% to $869 million. Our clients benefited from the considerable expertise of the Norland professionals. We also integrated 11 infill acquisitions, bringing more of the industries highest-quality resources to our clients. Finally, we took advantage of the liquidity and low rates available in the debt markets to further optimize balance sheet strength and flexibility. This performance is a direct result of our people's steadfast commitment to executing our strategy and creating distinct advantage for our clients. We thank them for their excellent performance in 2014. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim who will walk through our financial results in greater detail."

If you exclude carried interest",1468,"Thank you, Bob. Please turn to Slide 5. As Bob indicated, 2014 was an excellent year for CBRE. This is especially the case given that we are in the $75 million less EBITDA relating to carried interest in 2014 than in 2013. If you exclude carried interest from both years, normalized EBITDA increased by 24% and adjusted EPS by 31% for the full year. 
Our 3 regional service segments achieved significant revenue growth and operating leverage in 2014. Together, these regions produced growth without the contribution from Norland of 21% in normalized EBITDA and 17% in revenue. Combined, the margin improved 50 basis points for the year, again, without the contribution from Norland. CBRE global investors and development services exceeded our guidance of flat performance for the year x carried interest. Together, EBITDA, without carried interest, was up about 7% or approximately $12 million for the year. 
Bob mentioned our efforts to optimize the long-term strength and flexibility of our balance sheet. Towards this end, we continue to shift shorter-term fixed or floating rate debt to 10-year fixed-rate bonds and to expand and refresh our revolver. In December, we issued an additional $125 million of 10.5-year bonds. Last month, we closed on an expanded $2.6 billion 5-year revolving credit facility and $500 million tranche term loan facility. Proceeds from the financing was along with cash-on-hand were used to pay off the balances of our sure to maturity term loans and outstanding revolver balance of approximately $5 million. This priority to year-end, Standard & Poor's raised CBRE's corporate rating to investment-grade. At year-end 2014, our net debt to normalized EBITDA ratio was 1.0. 
Please turn to Slide 6, which outlines our revenue growth by line of business for the full year. I'll make 2 observations on this slide. First, the 2 largest parts of our business achieved very strong top line growth with leasing up 16% to approach $2.4 billion in revenue, and Global Corporate Services and Asset Services, up 51% or 16% without the addition of Norland to exceed $3.7 billion in revenue. Note that the leasing and capital markets revenues associated with corporate and asset services are accounted for under the leasing and capital markets headings on the slide. Second is the profile of our business mix. Contractual revenue equals 51% of total revenue for the year. Contractual revenue and leasing revenue, which is largely recurring, totaled 77%. Property sales accounted for 17% of total revenue. 
Now please turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of our results for the fourth quarter. Performance in Q4 was strong. To understand the comparison to Q4 2013, it is important to remember that we realized $58 million of EBITDA from carried interest in last year's Q4. Excluding carried interest from both quarters, normalized EBITDA rose 20% from the prior year quarter and adjusted EPS increased 18%. Currency fluctuations reduced adjusted EPS by 2% to $0.68. Normalized amortization and depreciation expense in Q4 2014 increased approximately $11 million versus Q4 '13. Our normalized tax rate was 32% for the quarter, resulting in a 35% rate for the full year. 
Please turn to Slide 8 where we present our Q4 revenue performance by line of business. Global Property Leasing revenue rose by more than 20% as we continue to gain market share. Our occupier outsourcing business, which we call Global Corporate Services, continued to perform very well. Revenue, including relating transaction revenues, increased 60% or 19% without the contribution from Norland. We signed a record number of outsourcing contracts with new customers during the quarter. Property sales revenues rose 17%. Strong revenue gains in property sales were notable in the U.S., France, Japan and Spain with each exceeding 20% growth in the quarter. Commercial mortgage services was up 35% globally. Revenue growth was also strong in our global valuations business, up 21%. In Americas, we saw a pickup in traditional appraisal activity, supplemented by acquisitions that complement our existing service offering. Our Development Services business continued to perform exceptionally well. While as expected, revenue declined in Global Investment Management. Capital raising activities in Investment Management were robust, reflecting strong performance for our clients. 
Now I'll turn to the Q4 results for our regional business segments, starting with our largest segment, the Americas, on Slide 9. Overall revenue for the Americas rose 20%, the ninth quarter in a row of double-digit revenue growth. This growth rate is particularly notable for a $5 billion business segment. Leasing turned in it's best growth in 4 years with revenue surging 25%. This robust growth is a product of the investments we've made in recent years to support our brokers as they serve our clients and to enhance our brokerage ranks to recruiting and targeted infill M&A. We also benefited from steadily improving macro conditions. Property sales rose solidly driven by the U.S. where revenues rose by 20%. Commercial mortgage services revenues rose 26%. Combined, Global Corporate Services and Asset Services revenue increased 17%. 
Please turn to Slide 10 regarding EMEA. EMEA revenue grew vigorously across our entire suite of services. Overall revenue jumped 78% or 23% excluding Norland. Norland contributed $240 million of revenue for the quarter. Property sales revenue increased 23%. The U.K. continued to be a bellwether for the region and we achieved significant growth in several other countries, including France, Ireland, Poland and Spain. Given our broad capabilities across the region, we have been well-positioned as capital has moved increasingly across Europe. Leasing rebounded strongly following a subdued performance in Q3. Revenue from this line of business climbed 22%. Growth was particularly impressive in the U.K., up 25%, where we achieved higher market share in Central London. We also saw notable growth in Germany and the Netherlands. Combined, the Global Corporate Services and Asset Services revenue increased 11% before the contributions from Norland. 
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding Asia-Pacific. Revenue in this region improved 14% for the quarter. The fastest-growing area of our business was Global Corporate Services and Asset Services with combined revenue up 19%. Most of this growth occurred in Australia and India. Our leasing business line also produced a very good growth this quarter with revenue up 15%. Australia and Japan set the pace for the region. Property sales revenue rose 13% during the quarter, again, driven by Australia and Japan. This growth compares within specially strong Q4 of 2013 when year-over-year revenue surged 46% over Q4 2012. 
Please turn to Slide 12 regarding occupier outsourcing, which we call Global Corporate Services. This global line of business is reported within the 3 regional service businesses. Our Global Corporate Services business sustains its long-term track record of strong growth as the depth, capability and maturity of CBRE's integrated service offering continues to attract new clients. Reflecting this, Q4 was one of our best quarters ever with 63 total contracts signed. Globally, we brought on 107 new contractual accounts last year, by far, our most in a single year. We expect our globally integrated outsourcing platform and increasing synergies with our leasing business to continue to drive long-term growth. 
Please turn to Slide 13 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. As we've expected, this business saw lower results compared to a standout 2013. As already noted, EBITDA associated with carried interest was $46 million less than last year's Q4, and $75 million less than the full year 2013. Looking at the quarter, we saw solid growth in investment portfolio as AUM increased by $3.8 billion in local currency, offset by $1.8 billion of exchange rate impact $90.6 billion. For the full year 2014, AUM increased by $5.8 billion in local currency, offset by $4.3 billion of exchange rate impact. As we noted at the beginning of last year, 2014 was a transition year as we sold $10 billion of assets and exited a couple of businesses in 2013 and absorbed lower fees in Continental Europe in 2014. We expect growth in normalized EBITDA and AUM in 2015 as we continue to deploy $88.6 billion of capital that we raised in 2014. 
Please turn to Slide 14 regarding our Development Services segment. Our Development Services business, again, generated significant growth. For the quarter, revenue plus equity earnings and net gains on real estate dispositions increased 50% to $74.9 million versus Q4 2013. EBITDA for the quarter rose 70% to $37 million. Our pipeline increased to $4 billion, up $1.1 billion from the third quarter of 2014. Most of this increase is due to fee development work in the healthcare sector. Projects in process totaled $5.4 billion, up $300 million from the third quarter of 2014. Our equity co-invest in development business totaled $119 million at the end of 2014, while our guarantees on outstanding debt balances stood at $10 million. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Bob for closing remarks."

We believe 2015 will be another year of strong growth. Market fundamentals continue to gradually improve. The investments we've made in our people and operating platform have materially strengthen our global business lines and position as to further market share gains. Among our global business lines, we expect leasing revenue to increase at a low double-digit rate as we continue to benefit from our growth initiatives and better macro market conditions, particularly in the U.S. Our Global Corporate Services business remains poised for mid-teens revenue growth. We continue to benefit from our improved platform and increased collaboration between our leasing and corporate services professionals. Our capital markets business, which includes property sales and mortgage services, is expected to grow at a high-single digit pace. The influx of capital in the Commercial Real Estate remains strong, but market volume growth can reasonably be expected to moderate from the robust levels of the past few years. However, Capital Markets volume can fluctuate materially from quarter-to-quarter. 
Looking at our business overall, we expect our 3 regional services businesses, combined, to achieve further operating leverage and margin improvement, likely moderating from last year's increases. Our combined principal businesses should perform roughly in line with 2014 with Investment Management up and development down coming from the strong year of gains in 2014. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be up approximately $25 million this year, primarily relating to investments in our operating platform and strategic M&A. Interest expense will likely be flat to down slightly. Our normalized tax rate for 2015 is expected to approximate last year's level of 35% for the full year. 
Last year, we commented on our historical percentage distribution of normalized EBITDA by quarter. Our quarterly normalized EBITDA profile for the last 4 years has been an average of 16% in the first quarter, 23% in the second and third quarters and 38% in the fourth quarter. This information is being provided to demonstrate historical context for CBRE's quarterly normalized EBITDA distribution. Please note, this is not meant to be quarterly guidance for 2015 and the percentage may vary somewhat in any given quarter. In light of our outlook for the business, we expect to achieve earnings per share as adjusted in the range of $1.90 to $1.95 for 2015 for a growth rate of 15% at the midpoint of this range. We approach 2015 with great enthusiasm for our business. Our people are working together to execute our strategy, drive growth, produce distinct advantages for our clients and create value for our shareholders. 
With that, operator, we'll now take questions."

We're confident we took market share in leasing and that's been going on for a couple of years, partly because of some changes we made to our platform that allows our Global Corporate Services business and our leasing teams to work more effectively together. Partly because we've done an offer lot of recruiting over the last 2 years. We mentioned last year that we had -- have had a record year. And this year we had comparable recruiting around the world.

I'd say that can move around a bit from year-to-year. 2013 was an exaggerated amount of carried interest because pre-'14, we just ran expenses, comp expense for carried interest per gap, which meant that the comp, if the expense hit the expense hit in different years sometimes from the revenue. So in 2013, that was an exaggerated impact because almost all of the revenue, actually even little more was all EBITDA. Since the beginning of 2014, we've changed that policy where we adjust the match and timing of the comp expense with a carried interest revenue. So that's cut down the volatility quite a bit and I think it's a more picture of the reality of the business. But next year, we expect -- this year was reasonably modest. And '15, we think will be similar, the amount of carried interest in this year, which was actually quite modest. But there are a number of funds that are doing well and we think toward interested the future."

The hard work we've done to grow our client base, improve and expand our service offering and invest in our people and operating platform paid off in a record year.
Global revenue reached a record $9 billion, rising 26% for the year. Normalized EBITDA set a new high at $1.2 billion. And adjusted EPS of $1.68 improved 17%. This strong growth was achieved over 2013, a year in which EBITDA in our Investment Management business exceeded $200 million, with significant carried interest. In addition to record financial performance, we had other noteworthy achievements. These include material improvement in our operating platform, notably technology, research and specialized consulting services, allowing us to better serve our clients, and in turn, create opportunity for our people and growth for our shareholders. 
While investing in our operating platform, we achieved significant operating leverage in our regional services businesses before the contribution from Norland. We successfully integrated Norland, a significant acquisition which closed a few days before the start of the year, and then grew its revenue by approximately 20% to $869 million. Our clients benefited from the considerable expertise of the Norland professionals. We also integrated 11 infill acquisitions, bringing more of the industry's highest-quality resources to our clients. Finally, we took advantage of the liquidity and low rates available in the debt markets to further optimize balance sheet strength and flexibility. This performance is a direct result of our people's steadfast commitment to executing our strategy and creating distinct advantage for our clients. We thank them for their excellent performance in 2014.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim who will walk through our financial results in greater detail."

If you exclude carried interest",1474,"Thank you, Bob. Please turn to Slide 5. As Bob indicated, 2014 was an excellent year for CBRE. This is especially the case given that we are in the $75 million less EBITDA relating to carried interest in 2014 than in 2013. If you exclude carried interest from both years, normalized EBITDA increased by 24% and adjusted EPS by 31% for the full year.
Our 3 regional service segments achieved significant revenue growth and operating leverage in 2014. Together, these regions produced growth, without the contribution from Norland, of 21% in normalized EBITDA and 17% in revenue. Combined, the margin improved 50 basis points for the year, again, without the contribution from Norland. CBRE global investors and development services exceeded our guidance of flat performance for the year x carried interest. Together, EBITDA, without carried interest, was up about 7% or approximately $12 million for the year.
Bob mentioned our efforts to optimize the long-term strength and flexibility of our balance sheet. Towards this end, we continue to shift shorter-term fixed or floating rate debt to 10-year fixed rate bonds and to expand and refresh our revolver. In December, we issued an additional $125 million of 10.5-year bonds. Last month, we closed on an expanded $2.6 billion 5-year revolving credit facility and $500 million Tranche A term loan facility. Proceeds from the financings, along with cash-on-hand, were used to pay off the balances of our shorter-maturity term loans and the outstanding revolver balance of approximately $5 million. Just prior to year-end, Standard & Poor's raised CBRE's corporate rating to investment-grade. At year-end 2014, our net debt to normalized EBITDA ratio was 1.0. 
Please turn to Slide 6, which outlines our revenue growth by line of business for the full year. I'll make 2 observations on this slide. First, the 2 largest parts of our business achieved very strong top line growth, with leasing up 16% to approach $2.4 billion in revenue, and Global Corporate Services and Asset Services, up 51% or 16% without the addition of Norland to exceed $3.7 billion in revenue. Note that the leasing in capital markets revenues associated with corporate and asset services are accounted for under the Leasing and Capital Markets headings on the slide. Second is the profile of our business mix. Contractual revenue equals 51% of total revenue for the year. Contractual revenue and leasing revenue, which is largely recurring, totaled 77%. Property sales accounted for 17% of total revenue. 
Now please turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of our results for the fourth quarter. Performance in Q4 was strong. To understand the comparison to Q4 2013, it is important to remember that we realized $58 million of EBITDA from carried interest in last year's Q4. Excluding carried interest from both quarters, normalized EBITDA rose 20% from the prior year quarter and adjusted EPS increased 18%. Currency fluctuations reduced adjusted EPS by 2% to $0.68. Normalized amortization and depreciation expense in Q4 2014 increased approximately $11 million versus Q4 '13. Our normalized tax rate was 32% for the quarter, resulting in a 35% rate for the full year. 
Please turn to Slide 8, where we present our Q4 revenue performance by line of business. Global Property Leasing revenue rose by more than 20% as we continue to gain market share. Our occupier outsourcing business, which we call Global Corporate Services, continued to perform very well. Revenue, including related transaction revenues, increased 60% or 19% without the contribution from Norland. We signed a record number of outsourcing contracts with new customers during the quarter. Property sales revenues rose 17%. Strong revenue gains in property sales were notable in the U.S., France, Japan and Spain, with each exceeding 20% growth in the quarter. Commercial mortgage services was up 35% globally. Revenue growth was also strong in our global valuations business, up 21%. In the Americas, we saw a pickup in traditional appraisal activity, supplemented by acquisitions that complement our existing service offering. Our Development Services business continued to perform exceptionally well, while as expected, revenue declined in Global Investment Management. Capital raising activities in Investment Management were robust, reflecting strong performance for our clients.
Now I'll turn to the Q4 results for our regional business segments, starting with our largest segment, the Americas, on Slide 9. Overall revenue for the Americas rose 20%, the ninth quarter in a row of double-digit revenue growth. This growth rate is particularly notable for a $5 billion business segment. Leasing turned in its best growth in 4 years, with revenue surging 25%. This robust growth is a product of the investments we've made in recent years to support our brokers as they serve our clients and to enhance our brokerage ranks through to recruiting and targeted infill M&A. We also benefited from steadily improving macro conditions. Property sales rose solidly driven by the U.S. where revenues rose by 20%. Commercial mortgage services revenues rose 26%. Combined, Global Corporate Services and Asset Services revenue increased 17%. 
Please turn to Slide 10, regarding EMEA. EMEA revenue grew vigorously across our entire suite of services. Overall revenue jumped 78% or 23% excluding Norland. Norland contributed $240 million of revenue for the quarter. Property sales revenue increased 23%. The U.K. continued to be a bellwether for the region and we achieved significant growth in several other countries, including France, Ireland, Poland and Spain. Given our broad capabilities across the region, we have been well positioned as capital has moved increasingly across Europe. Leasing rebounded strongly following a subdued performance in Q3. Revenue from this line of business climbed 22%. Growth was particularly impressive in the U.K., up 25%, where we achieved higher market share in Central London. We also saw notable growth in Germany and the Netherlands. Combined, the Global Corporate Services and Asset Services revenue increased 11% before the contributions from Norland. 
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding Asia-Pacific. Revenue in this region improved 14% for the quarter. The fastest-growing area of our business was Global Corporate Services and Asset Services, with combined revenue up 19%. Most of this growth occurred in Australia and India. Our leasing business line also produced a very good growth this quarter, with revenue up 15%. Australia and Japan set the pace for the region. Property sales revenue rose 13% during the quarter, again, driven by Australia and Japan. This growth compares within specially strong Q4 of 2013 when year-over-year revenue surged 46% over Q4 2012. 
Please turn to Slide 12 regarding occupier outsourcing, which we call Global Corporate Services. This global line of business is reported within the 3 regional service businesses. Our Global Corporate Services business sustains its long-term track record of strong growth as the depth, capability and maturity of CBRE's integrated service offering continues to attract new clients. Reflecting this, Q4 was one of our best quarters ever, with 63 total contracts signed. Globally, we brought on 107 new contractual accounts last year, by far, our most in a single year. We expect our globally integrated outsourcing platform and increasing synergies with our leasing business to continue to drive long-term growth.
Please turn to Slide 13 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. As we has expected, this business saw lower results compared to a standout 2013. As already noted, EBITDA associated with carried interest was $46 million less than last year's Q4, and $75 million less than the full year 2013. Looking at the quarter, we saw solid growth in investment portfolio as AUM increased by $3.8 billion in local currency, offset by $1.8 billion of exchange rate impact $90.6 billion. For the full year 2014, AUM increased by $5.8 billion in local currency, offset by $4.3 billion of exchange rate impact. As we noted at the beginning of last year, 2014 was a transition year as we sold $10 billion of assets and exited a couple of businesses in 2013 and absorbed lower fees in Continental Europe in 2014. We expect growth in normalized EBITDA and AUM in 2015 as we continue to deploy the $8.6 billion of capital that we raised in 2014. 
Please turn to Slide 14 regarding our Development Services segment. Our Development Services business, again, generated significant growth. For the quarter, revenue plus equity earnings and net gains on real estate dispositions increased 50% to $74.9 million versus Q4 2013. EBITDA for the quarter rose 70% to $37 million. Our pipeline increased to $4 billion, up $1.1 billion from the third quarter of 2014. Most of this increase is due to fee development work in the healthcare sector. Projects in process totaled $5.4 billion, up $300 million from the third quarter of 2014. Our equity co-invest in the development business totaled $119 million at the end of 2014, while our guarantees on outstanding debt balances stood at $10 million.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Bob for closing remarks."

We believe 2015 will be another year of strong growth. Market fundamentals continue to gradually improve. The investments we've made in our people and operating platform have materially strengthened our global business lines and positioned us to further market share gains. Among our global business lines, we expect leasing revenue to increase at a low double-digit rate as we continue to benefit from our growth initiatives and better macro market conditions, particularly in the U.S. Our Global Corporate Services business remains poised for mid-teens revenue growth. We continue to benefit from our improved platform and increased collaboration between our leasing and corporate services professionals. Our capital markets business, which includes property sales and mortgage services, is expected to grow at a high single-digit pace. The influx of capital in the Commercial Real Estate remained strong, but market volume growth can reasonably be expected to moderate from the robust levels of the past few years. However, capital markets volume can fluctuate materially from quarter-to-quarter. 
Looking at our business overall, we expect our 3 regional services businesses, combined, to achieve further operating leverage and margin improvement, likely moderating from last year's increases. Our combined principal businesses should perform roughly in line with 2014 with Investment Management up and Development down coming from the strong year of gains in 2014. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be up approximately $25 million this year, primarily relating to investments in our operating platform and strategic M&A. Interest expense will likely be flat to down slightly. Our normalized tax rate for 2015 is expected to approximate last year's level of 35% for the full year.
Last year, we commented on our historical percentage distribution of normalized EBITDA by quarter. Our quarterly normalized EBITDA profile for the last 4 years has been an average of 16% in the first quarter, 23% in the second and third quarters and 38% in the fourth quarter. This information is being provided to demonstrate historical context for CBRE's quarterly normalized EBITDA distribution. Please note, this is not meant to be quarterly guidance for 2015 and the percentage may vary somewhat in any given quarter. In light of our outlook for the business, we expect to achieve earnings per share as adjusted in the range of $1.90 to $1.95 for 2015 for a growth rate of 15% at the midpoint of this range. We approach 2015 with great enthusiasm for our business. Our people are working together to execute our strategy, drive growth, produce distinct advantages for our clients and create value for our shareholders.

So in 2013, that was an exaggerated impact because almost all of the revenue, actually even more, was all EBITDA. Since the beginning of 2014, we've changed that policy where we adjust the match and timing of the comp expense with a carried interest revenue. So that's cut down the volatility quite a bit and I think it creates a more clear picture of the reality of the business. But next year, we expect -- this year was reasonably modest. And '15, we think will be similar, the amount of carried interest in this year, which was actually quite modest.

The hard work we've done to grow our client base, improve and expand our service offering and invest in our people and operating platform paid off in a record year.
Global revenue reached a record $9 billion, rising 26% for the year. Normalized EBITDA set a new high at $1.2 billion. And adjusted EPS of $1.68 improved 17%. This strong growth was achieved over 2013, a year in which EBITDA in our Investment Management business exceeded $200 million, with significant carried interest. In addition to record financial performance, we had other noteworthy achievements. These include material improvement in our operating platform, notably technology, research and specialized consulting services, allowing us to better serve our clients, and in turn, create opportunity for our people and growth for our shareholders. 
While investing in our operating platform, we achieved significant operating leverage in our regional services businesses before the contribution from Norland. We successfully integrated Norland, a significant acquisition which closed a few days before the start of the year, and then grew its revenue by approximately 20% to $869 million. Our clients benefited from the considerable expertise of the Norland professionals. We also integrated 11 infill acquisitions, bringing more of the industry's highest-quality resources to our clients. Finally, we took advantage of the liquidity and low rates available in the debt markets to further optimize balance sheet strength and flexibility. This performance is a direct result of our people's steadfast commitment to executing our strategy and creating distinct advantage for our clients. We thank them for their excellent performance in 2014.

If you exclude carried interest",1474,"Thank you, Bob. Please turn to Slide 5. As Bob indicated, 2014 was an excellent year for CBRE. This is especially the case given that we are in the $75 million less EBITDA relating to carried interest in 2014 than in 2013. If you exclude carried interest from both years, normalized EBITDA increased by 24% and adjusted EPS by 31% for the full year.
Our 3 regional service segments achieved significant revenue growth and operating leverage in 2014. Together, these regions produced growth, without the contribution from Norland, of 21% in normalized EBITDA and 17% in revenue. Combined, margin improved 50 basis points for the year, again, without the contribution from Norland. CBRE global investors and development services exceeded our guidance of flat performance for the year x carried interest. Together, EBITDA, without carried interest, was up about 7% or approximately $12 million for the year.
Bob mentioned our efforts to optimize the long-term strength and flexibility of our balance sheet. Towards this end, we continue to shift shorter-term fixed or floating rate debt to 10-year fixed rate bonds and to expand and refresh our revolver. In December, we issued an additional $125 million of 10.5-year bonds. Last month, we closed on an expanded $2.6 billion 5-year revolving credit facility and $500 million tranche A term loan facility. Proceeds from the financings, along with cash-on-hand, were used to pay off the balances of our shorter-maturity term loans and the outstanding revolver balance of approximately $5 million. Just prior to year-end, Standard & Poor's raised CBRE's corporate rating to investment grade. At year-end 2014, our net debt to normalized EBITDA ratio was 1.0. 
Please turn to Slide 6, which outlines our revenue growth by line of business for the full year. I'll make 2 observations on this slide. First, the 2 largest parts of our business achieved very strong top line growth, with leasing up 16% to approach $2.4 billion in revenue, and Global Corporate Services and Asset Services, up 51% or 16% without the addition of Norland to exceed $3.7 billion in revenue. Note that the leasing and capital markets revenues associated with corporate and asset services are accounted for under the Leasing and Capital Markets headings on the slide. Second is the profile of our business mix. Contractual revenue equals 51% of total revenue for the year. Contractual revenue and leasing revenue, which is largely recurring, totaled 77%. Property sales accounted for 17% of total revenue. 
Now please turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of our results for the fourth quarter. Performance in Q4 was strong. To understand the comparison to Q4 2013, it is important to remember that we realized $58 million of EBITDA from carried interest in last year's Q4. Excluding carried interest from both quarters, normalized EBITDA rose 20% from the prior year quarter and adjusted EPS increased 18%. Currency fluctuations reduced adjusted EPS by 2% to $0.68. Normalized amortization and depreciation expense in Q4 2014 increased approximately $11 million versus Q4 '13. Our normalized tax rate was 32% for the quarter, resulting in a 35% rate for the full year. 
Please turn to Slide 8, where we present our Q4 revenue performance by line of business. Global Property Leasing revenue rose by more than 20% as we continue to gain market share. Our occupier outsourcing business, which we call Global Corporate Services, continued to perform very well. Revenue, including related transaction revenues, increased 60% or 19% without the contribution from Norland. We signed a record number of outsourcing contracts with new customers during the quarter. Property sales revenues rose 17%. Strong revenue gains in property sales were notable in the U.S., France, Japan and Spain, with each exceeding 20% growth in the quarter. Commercial mortgage services was up 35% globally. Revenue growth was also strong in our global valuations business, up 21%. In the Americas, we saw a pickup in traditional appraisal activity, supplemented by acquisitions that complement our existing service offering. Our Development Services business continued to perform exceptionally well, while as expected, revenue declined in Global Investment Management. Capital raising activities in Investment Management were robust, reflecting strong performance for our clients.
Now I'll turn to the Q4 results for our regional business segments, starting with our largest segment, the Americas, on Slide 9. Overall revenue for the Americas rose 20%, the ninth quarter in a row of double-digit revenue growth. This growth rate is particularly notable for a $5 billion business segment. Leasing turned in its best growth in 4 years, with revenue surging 25%. This robust growth is a product of the investments we've made in recent years to support our brokers as they serve our clients and to enhance our brokerage ranks through to recruiting and targeted infill M&A. We also benefited from steadily improving macro conditions. Property sales rose solidly driven by the U.S. where revenues rose by 20%. Commercial mortgage services revenues rose 26%. Combined, Global Corporate Services and Asset Services revenue increased 17%. 
Please turn to Slide 10, regarding EMEA. EMEA revenue grew vigorously across our entire suite of services. Overall revenue jumped 78% or 23% excluding Norland. Norland contributed $240 million of revenue for the quarter. Property sales revenue increased 23%. The U.K. continued to be a bellwether for the region and we achieved significant growth in several other countries, including France, Ireland, Poland and Spain. Given our broad capabilities across the region, we have been well positioned as capital has moved increasingly across Europe. Leasing rebounded strongly following a subdued performance in Q3. Revenue from this line of business climbed 22%. Growth was particularly impressive in the U.K., up 25%, where we achieved higher market share in Central London. We also saw notable growth in Germany and the Netherlands. Combined, Global Corporate Services and Asset Services revenue increased 11% before the contributions from Norland. 
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding Asia-Pacific. Revenue in this region improved 14% for the quarter. The fastest-growing area of our business was Global Corporate Services and Asset Services, with combined revenue up 19%. Most of this growth occurred in Australia and India. Our leasing business line also produced a very good growth this quarter, with revenue up 15%. Australia and Japan set the pace for the region. Property sales revenue rose 13% during the quarter, again, driven by Australia and Japan. This growth compares with an especially strong Q4 of 2013 when year-over-year revenue surged 46% over Q4 2012. 
Please turn to Slide 12 regarding occupier outsourcing, which we call Global Corporate Services. This global line of business is reported within the 3 regional service businesses. Our Global Corporate Services business sustained its long-term track record of strong growth as the depth, capability and maturity of CBRE's integrated service offering continues to attract new clients. Reflecting this, Q4 was one of our best quarters ever, with 63 total contracts signed. Globally, we brought on 107 new contractual accounts last year, by far, our most in a single year. We expect our globally integrated outsourcing platform and increasing synergies with our leasing business to continue to drive long-term growth.
Please turn to Slide 13 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. As we had expected, this business saw lower results compared to a standout 2013. As already noted, EBITDA associated with carried interest was $46 million less than last year's Q4, and $75 million less than the full year 2013. Looking at the quarter, we saw solid growth in investment portfolio as AUM increased by $3.8 billion in local currency, offset by $1.8 billion of exchange rate impact $90.6 billion. For the full year 2014, AUM increased by $5.8 billion in local currency, offset by $4.3 billion of exchange rate impact. As we noted at the beginning of last year, 2014 was a transition year as we sold $10 billion of assets and exited a couple of businesses in 2013 and absorbed lower fees in Continental Europe in 2014. We expect growth in normalized EBITDA and AUM in 2015 as we continue to deploy the $8.6 billion of capital that we raised in 2014. 
Please turn to Slide 14 regarding our Development Services segment. Our Development Services business, again, generated significant growth. For the quarter, revenue plus equity earnings and net gains on real estate dispositions increased 50% to $74.9 million versus Q4 2013. EBITDA for the quarter rose 70% to $37 million. Our pipeline increased to $4 billion, up $1.1 billion from the third quarter of 2014. Most of this increase is due to fee development work in the healthcare sector.

We believe 2015 will be another year of strong growth. Market fundamentals continue to gradually improve. The investments we've made in our people and operating platform have materially strengthened our global business lines and positioned us for further market share gains. Among our global business lines, we expect leasing revenue to increase at a low double-digit rate as we continue to benefit from our growth initiatives and better macro market conditions, particularly in the U.S. Our Global Corporate Services business remains poised for mid-teens revenue growth. We continue to benefit from our improved platform and increased collaboration between our leasing and corporate services professionals. Our capital markets business, which includes property sales and mortgage services, is expected to grow at a high single-digit pace. The influx of capital into Commercial Real Estate remained strong, but market volume growth can reasonably be expected to moderate from the robust levels of the past few years. However, capital markets volume can fluctuate materially from quarter-to-quarter. 
Looking at our business overall, we expect our 3 regional services businesses, combined, to achieve further operating leverage and margin improvement, likely moderating from last year's increases. Our combined principal businesses should perform roughly in line with 2014 with Investment Management up and Development down coming from a strong year of gains in 2014. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be up approximately $25 million this year, primarily relating to investments in our operating platform and strategic M&A. Interest expense will likely be flat to down slightly. Our normalized tax rate for 2015 is expected to approximate last year's level of 35% for the full year.
Last year, we commented on our historical percentage distribution of normalized EBITDA by quarter. Our quarterly normalized EBITDA profile for the last 4 years has been an average of 16% in the first quarter, 23% in the second and third quarters and 38% in the fourth quarter. This information is being provided to demonstrate historical context for CBRE's quarterly normalized EBITDA distribution. Please note, this is not meant to be quarterly guidance for 2015 and the percentage may vary somewhat in any given quarter. In light of our outlook for the business, we expect to achieve earnings per share as adjusted in the range of $1.90 to $1.95 for 2015 for a growth rate of 15% at the midpoint of this range. We approach 2015 with great enthusiasm for our business. Our people are working together to execute our strategy, drive growth, produce distinct advantages for our clients and create value for our shareholders. 
With that, operator, we'll now take questions."

We're confident we took market share in leasing and that's been going on for a couple of years, partly because of some changes we made to our platform that allows our Global Corporate Services business and our leasing teams to work more effectively together, partly because we've done an awful lot of recruiting over the last 2 years. We mentioned last year that we had a -- had, had a record year, and this year we had comparable recruiting around the world.

So in 2013, that was an exaggerated impact because almost all of the revenue, actually even more, was all EBITDA. Since the beginning of 2014, we've changed that policy where we adjust the match and timing of the comp expense with the carried interest revenue. So that's cut down the volatility quite a bit and I think it creates a more clear picture of the reality of the business. But next year, we expect -- this year was reasonably modest. And '15, we think will be similar, the amount of carried interest in this year, which was actually quite modest.

The hard work we've done to grow our client base, improve and expand our service offering and invest in our people and operating platform paid off in a record year.
Global revenue reached a record $9 billion, rising 26% for the year. Normalized EBITDA set a new high at $1.2 billion. And adjusted EPS of $1.68 improved 17%. This strong growth was achieved over 2013, a year in which EBITDA in our Investment Management business exceeded $200 million, with significant carried interest. In addition to record financial performance, we had other noteworthy achievements. These include material improvement in our operating platform, notably technology, research and specialized consulting services, allowing us to better serve our clients, and in turn, create opportunity for our people and growth for our shareholders. 
While investing in our operating platform, we achieved significant operating leverage in our regional services businesses before the contribution from Norland. We successfully integrated Norland, a significant acquisition which closed a few days before the start of the year, and then grew its revenue by approximately 20% to $869 million. Our clients benefited from the considerable expertise of the Norland professionals. We also integrated 11 infill acquisitions, bringing more of the industry's highest-quality resources to our clients. Finally, we took advantage of the liquidity and low rates available in the debt markets to further optimize balance sheet strength and flexibility. This performance is a direct result of our people's steadfast commitment to executing our strategy and creating distinct advantage for our clients. We thank them for their excellent performance in 2014.

If you exclude carried interest from",1472,"Thank you, Bob. Please turn to Slide 5. As Bob indicated, 2014 was an excellent year for CBRE. This is especially the case given that we earned $75 million less EBITDA relating to carried interest in 2014 than in 2013. If you exclude carried interest from both years, normalized EBITDA increased by 24% and adjusted EPS by 31% for the full year.
Our 3 regional service segments achieved significant revenue growth and operating leverage in 2014. Together, these regions produced growth, without the contribution from Norland, of 21% in normalized EBITDA and 17% in revenue. Combined, margin improved 50 basis points for the year, again, without the contribution from Norland. CBRE global investors and development services exceeded our guidance of flat performance for the year x carried interest. Together, EBITDA, without carried interest, was up about 7% or approximately $12 million for the year.
Bob mentioned our efforts to optimize the long-term strength and flexibility of our balance sheet. Towards this end, we continue to shift shorter-term fixed or floating rate debt to 10-year fixed rate bonds and to expand and refresh our revolver. In December, we issued an additional $125 million of 10.5-year bonds. Last month, we closed on an expanded $2.6 billion 5-year revolving credit facility and $500 million tranche A term loan facility. Proceeds from the financings, along with cash-on-hand, were used to pay off the balances of our shorter-maturity term loans and the outstanding revolver balance of approximately $5 million. Just prior to year-end, Standard & Poor's raised CBRE's corporate rating to investment grade. At year-end 2014, our net debt to normalized EBITDA ratio was 1.0. 
Please turn to Slide 6, which outlines our revenue growth by line of business for the full year. I'll make 2 observations on this slide. First, the 2 largest parts of our business achieved very strong top line growth, with leasing up 16% to approach $2.4 billion in revenue, and Global Corporate Services and Asset Services, up 51% or 16% without the addition of Norland to exceed $3.7 billion in revenue. Note that the leasing and capital markets revenues associated with corporate and asset services are accounted for under the Leasing and Capital Markets headings on the slide. Second is the profile of our business mix. Contractual revenue equals 51% of total revenue for the year. Contractual revenue and leasing revenue, which is largely recurring, totaled 77%. Property sales accounted for 17% of total revenue. 
Now please turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of our results for the fourth quarter. Performance in Q4 was strong. To understand the comparison to Q4 2013, it is important to remember that we realized $58 million of EBITDA from carried interest in last year's Q4. Excluding carried interest from both quarters, normalized EBITDA rose 20% from the prior year quarter and adjusted EPS increased 18%. Currency fluctuations reduced adjusted EPS by 2% to $0.68. Normalized amortization and depreciation expense in Q4 2014 increased approximately $11 million versus Q4 '13. Our normalized tax rate was 32% for the quarter, resulting in a 35% rate for the full year. 
Please turn to Slide 8, where we present our Q4 revenue performance by line of business. Global Property Leasing revenue rose by more than 20% as we continue to gain market share. Our occupier outsourcing business, which we call Global Corporate Services, continued to perform very well. Revenue, including related transaction revenues, increased 60% or 19% without the contribution from Norland. We signed a record number of outsourcing contracts with new customers during the quarter. Property sales revenues rose 17%. Strong revenue gains in property sales were notable in the U.S., France, Japan and Spain, with each exceeding 20% growth in the quarter. Commercial mortgage services was up 35% globally. Revenue growth was also strong in our global valuations business, up 21%. In the Americas, we saw a pickup in traditional appraisal activity, supplemented by acquisitions that complement our existing service offering. Our Development Services business continued to perform exceptionally well, while as expected, revenue declined in Global Investment Management. Capital raising activities in Investment Management were robust, reflecting strong performance for our clients.
Now I'll turn to the Q4 results for our regional business segments, starting with our largest segment, the Americas, on Slide 9. Overall revenue for the Americas rose 20%, the ninth quarter in a row of double-digit revenue growth. This growth rate is particularly notable for a $5 billion business segment. Leasing turned in its best growth in 4 years, with revenue surging 25%. This robust growth is a product of the investments we've made in recent years to support our brokers as they serve our clients and to enhance our brokerage ranks through to recruiting and targeted infill M&A. We also benefited from steadily improving macro conditions. Property sales rose solidly driven by the U.S. where revenues rose by 20%. Commercial mortgage services revenues rose 26%. Combined, Global Corporate Services and Asset Services revenue increased 17%. 
Please turn to Slide 10, regarding EMEA. EMEA revenue grew vigorously across our entire suite of services. Overall revenue jumped 78% or 23% excluding Norland. Norland contributed $240 million of revenue for the quarter. Property sales revenue increased 23%. The U.K. continued to be a bellwether for the region and we achieved significant growth in several other countries, including France, Ireland, Poland and Spain. Given our broad capabilities across the region, we have been well positioned as capital has moved increasingly across Europe. Leasing rebounded strongly following a subdued performance in Q3. Revenue from this line of business climbed 22%. Growth was particularly impressive in the U.K., up 25%, where we achieved higher market share in Central London. We also saw notable growth in Germany and the Netherlands. Combined, Global Corporate Services and Asset Services revenue increased 11% before the contributions from Norland. 
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding Asia-Pacific. Revenue in this region improved 14% for the quarter. The fastest-growing area of our business was Global Corporate Services and Asset Services, with combined revenue up 19%. Most of this growth occurred in Australia and India. Our leasing business line also produced a very good growth this quarter, with revenue up 15%. Australia and Japan set the pace for the region. Property sales revenue rose 13% during the quarter, again, driven by Australia and Japan. This growth compares with an especially strong Q4 of 2013 when year-over-year revenue surged 46% over Q4 2012. 
Please turn to Slide 12 regarding occupier outsourcing, which we call Global Corporate Services. This global line of business is reported within the 3 regional service businesses. Our Global Corporate Services business sustained its long-term track record of strong growth as the depth, capability and maturity of CBRE's integrated service offering continues to attract new clients. Reflecting this, Q4 was one of our best quarters ever, with 63 total contracts signed. Globally, we brought on 107 new contractual accounts last year, by far, our most in a single year. We expect our globally integrated outsourcing platform and increasing synergies with our leasing business to continue to drive long-term growth.
Please turn to Slide 13 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. As we had expected, this business saw lower results compared to a standout 2013. As already noted, EBITDA associated with carried interest was $46 million less than last year's Q4, and $75 million less than the full year 2013. Looking at the quarter, we saw solid growth in investment portfolio as AUM increased by $3.8 billion in local currency, offset by $1.8 billion of exchange rate impact $90.6 billion. For the full year 2014, AUM increased by $5.8 billion in local currency, offset by $4.3 billion of exchange rate impact. As we noted at the beginning of last year, 2014 was a transition year as we sold $10 billion of assets and exited a couple of businesses in 2013 and absorbed lower fees in Continental Europe in 2014. We expect growth in normalized EBITDA and AUM in 2015 as we continue to deploy the $8.6 billion of capital that we raised in 2014. 
Please turn to Slide 14 regarding our Development Services segment. Our Development Services business, again, generated significant growth. For the quarter, revenue plus equity earnings and net gains on real estate dispositions increased 50% to $74.9 million versus Q4 2013. EBITDA for the quarter rose 70% to $37 million. Our pipeline increased to $4 billion, up $1.1 billion from the third quarter of 2014. Most of this increase is due to fee development work in the healthcare sector. Projects in process totaled $5.4 billion, up $300 million from the third quarter of 2014. Our equity co-invest in the development business totaled $119 million at the end of 2014, while our guarantees on outstanding debt balances stood at $10 million.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Bob for closing remarks."

We believe 2015 will be another year of strong growth. Market fundamentals continue to gradually improve. The investments we've made in our people and operating platform have materially strengthened our global business lines and positioned us for further market share gains. Among our global business lines, we expect leasing revenue to increase at a low double-digit rate as we continue to benefit from our growth initiatives and better macro market conditions, particularly in the U.S. Our Global Corporate Services business remains poised for mid-teens revenue growth. We continue to benefit from our improved platform and increased collaboration between our leasing and corporate services professionals. Our capital markets business, which includes property sales and mortgage services, is expected to grow at a high single-digit pace. The influx of capital into Commercial Real Estate remained strong, but market volume growth can reasonably be expected to moderate from the robust levels of the past few years. However, capital markets volume can fluctuate materially from quarter-to-quarter. 
Looking at our business overall, we expect our 3 regional services businesses, combined, to achieve further operating leverage and margin improvement, likely moderating from last year's increases. Our combined principal businesses should perform roughly in line with 2014 with Investment Management up and Development down coming from a strong year of gains in 2014. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be up approximately $25 million this year, primarily relating to investments in our operating platform and strategic M&A. Interest expense will likely be flat to down slightly. Our normalized tax rate for 2015 is expected to approximate last year's level of 35% for the full year.
Last year, we commented on our historical percentage distribution of normalized EBITDA by quarter. Our quarterly normalized EBITDA profile for the last 4 years has been an average of 16% in the first quarter, 23% in the second and third quarters and 38% in the fourth quarter. This information is being provided to demonstrate historical context for CBRE's quarterly normalized EBITDA distribution. Please note, this is not meant to be quarterly guidance for 2015 and the percentage may vary somewhat in any given quarter. In light of our outlook for the business, we expect to achieve earnings per share as adjusted in the range of $1.90 to $1.95 for 2015 for a growth rate of 15% at the midpoint of this range. We approach 2015 with great enthusiasm for our business. Our people are working together to execute our strategy, drive growth, produce distinct advantages for our clients and create value for our shareholders. 
With that, operator, we'll now take questions."

So in 2013, that was an exaggerated impact because almost all of the revenue, actually even a little more, was all EBITDA. Since the beginning of 2014, we've changed that policy where we adjust the match and timing of the comp expense with the carried interest revenue.

But I was wondering if that was the main point or if there are any other things that's factored into that 20% growth that you referenced?"

The opening months of 2015 have been an exciting time for CBRE in a number of fronts. As you saw in our press release, the strong momentum in our business continued in the first quarter with double-digit growth on the top and bottom lines. The strong increase in adjusted earnings per share is especially notable during the quarter when analysts are expecting average earnings for S&P 500 companies to be down over last year. In these results we are seeing the impact of our strategy to drive growth by enhancing our service offering for clients, strengthening the platform that enables our professionals to deliver market-leading solutions, augmenting our talent pool through strategic recruiting and targeted M&A and continuing our focus on balance sheet strength, which supports investments in our people and platform while providing financial flexibility. Strong broker recruiting has continued into the first quarter of 2015 as talented professionals recognize the many advantages CBRE affords them, both in meaningful spectrum of client needs and in building their careers. The first quarter performance of the leasing and sales businesses, particularly in the Americas, reflects our recruiting success over the past 2 years and continued to increase production by our existing transaction professionals. As our largest business segment, the Americas is benefiting significantly from our strategy and was the primary growth catalyst during the quarter. The region posted its third consecutive quarter of at least 20% revenue growth, along with strong normalized EBITDA growth and healthy margin expansion. Asia-Pacific also performed well with double-digit revenue growth before the effects of currency translation. Growth slowed in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and turned negative in U.S. dollar terms as we faced the challenging comparison against last year's robust first quarter. 
We've completed 2 infill acquisitions this year that bolster our service offering. The first was United Commercial Realty, a highly regarded firm that serves retailers and retail property investors across the U.S. The second, which we closed 2 weeks after the end of the first quarter, was Environmental Systems Inc., an energy management specialist that complements the array of services offered by our Global Corporate Services business. Finally and very importantly, as you all are aware, we announced an agreement in late March to acquire the Global Workplace Solutions business from Johnson Controls. This is a significant strategic move for CBRE. It will vastly expand our ability to self-perform facilities management services on a worldwide basis, particularly from more technically oriented facilities, and it will deepen our relationships with some of the world's largest corporations. In the days following the news, we have had an enthusiastic reaction from the employees of both companies, from our shareholders, and most significantly, from our clients. The regulatory approval process is under way and we look forward to completing the transaction later this year and welcoming John Murphy and the GBWS employees from more than 50 countries around the world. We're also excited about our strategic partnership with Johnson Controls, which will enhance our ability to bring innovation and value to our clients. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim who will describe our first quarter performance in more detail."

As Bob indicated, CBRE is off to a strong start in 2015. Normalized EBITDA of $247 million reflected a 24% increase in the first quarter of 2015 and a 17% margin on fee revenue, up 200 basis points from Q1 of 2014.",1393,"Thank you, Bob. Please turn to Slide 5. As Bob indicated, CBRE is off to a strong start in 2015. Normalized EBITDA of $247 million reflected a 24% increase in the first quarter of 2015 and a 17% margin on fee revenue, up 200 basis points from Q1 of 2014. Adjusted earnings per share improved 28% for the quarter. Both revenue and fee revenue rose 10% or 15% in local currency. These results followed a strong first quarter in 2014. The results include approximately $13 million pretax or $0.02 per share after-tax of net gains from foreign currency movement after the impact of currency hedging activities for the year. Together, our 3 regional service segments, the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific, achieved significant operating leverage for the quarter even after excluding currency hedging gains. This was driven by the Americas, which benefited from strong growth across all business lines. We also saw a resurgence of origination activity and gains from related servicing rights associated with U.S. government-sponsored entities, which produced EBITDA growth of slightly more than $20 million over prior year Q1. Normalized depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately $8 million driven by increased platform investments and higher mortgage servicing rights. While net interest expense decreased about $2.5 million from Q1 2014. Our normalized tax rate was 36.5% for the quarter, higher than the 35% we expect for the full year 2015. Our net debt declined by approximately $275 million or half a turn to 1.2x trailing 12-month normalized EBITDA at the end of Q1 2015 as compared to Q1 2014. 
Reflecting our increasingly strong financial position, Moody's raised it's rating on our senior secured and senior unsecured debt to investment-grade in March. This followed Standard & Poor's upgrade of our corporate user rating to investment grade late last year. 
Please turn to Slide 6 for a review of our performance in each of our global lines of business in Q1. Our capital markets businesses were particularly strong performers. Property sales revenue increased 21% with the U.S. up strongly and single-digit growth in EMEA and Asia-Pacific. Meanwhile, mortgage services recorded its best growth in 3 years, spurred by the jump in GSE activity. Leasing reported 13% revenue growth globally, the second consecutive quarter of double-digit increases. This growth was paced by continued strong market share gains in the U.S. Global Corporate Services continue to grow at double-digit clip. Excluding related transaction revenues, which are accounted for in leasing and sales, GCS achieved a 13% increase in revenue and 12% in fee revenue with double-digit growth in all 3 regions. Asset Services saw solid growth with revenue up 12% and fee revenue up 8%. The Global Valuations business saw revenue up 20%. Growth in the U.S. was supported by acquisitions, which have enhanced and expanded the services we can offer to clients. Global Investment Management revenue rose by 5% driven by higher carried interest compared with last year's Q1. Contractual fee revenue comprised 39% of total fee revenue for Q1, while contractual fee revenue plus leasing, which is largely recurring, totaled 70%. Property sales accounted for 21% of total fee revenue. 
Please turn to Slide 7 where I will review Q1 results for our 3 regional service segments, starting with the Americas. Overall revenue for the Americas rose by 21%. This region's revenue has now grown by double digits for 10 consecutive quarters. Every major business line posted double-digit growth for the quarter. Capital Markets at a brisk pace with property sales revenue up 32% and mortgage services up 43%. We were pleased to have again achieved the highest market share in the U.S. investment sales according to our CA with a 200 basis-point improvement over prior year Q1. Leasing again logged rigorous growth with revenue up 19%. While market conditions continued to steadily improve, we are seeing tangible benefits from our broker recruiting and infill M&A, along with increased productivity from our existing producers. Fee revenue from Global Corporate Services and Asset Services combined increased 12%. 
Please turn to Slide 8 regarding EMEA. EMEA revenue rose 6%. This region faced a particularly tough comparison with last year's exceptionally strong Q1 when revenue increased 27%, excluding contributions from Norland. Nevertheless, we saw growth in Global Corporate Services and Asset Services. Combined fee revenue increased 9% with double-digit growth in facilities management, reflecting the growing appetite for real estate outsourcing within the region. Property sales revenue rose 6% on top of the 54% surge in last year's Q1. Growth was driven by Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Property leasing revenue declined 6%. The number of smaller countries in the continent saw improved activity. This was more than offset by decreases relative to Q1 of last year in France and the United Kingdom. 
Please turn to Slide 9 regarding Asia-Pacific. We saw a strong growth in the region with overall revenue rising 15% for the quarter. Like EMEA, Global Corporate Services and Asset Services set the pace for growth in the region. Fee revenue improved 12% as outsourcing continues to make inroads in the region. Greater China and India showed particularly strong growth in Q1. Leasing revenue rose solidly, increasing by 8%, most of this growth occurred in Australia and New Zealand. Property sales rose 3% on top of 38% growth in the prior year Q1 with significant gains in Australia. The investment climate across Asia-Pacific is mixed amidst a shortage of available product in some markets, flowing economies and domestic capital that is increasingly migrating to the U.S. and Europe in search of yield. 
Please turn to Slide 10 regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which we call Global Corporate Services. Results from this global business line are reported within the 3 regional services segments. Global Corporate Services have increased revenue at a double-digit compounded annual growth rate over the last decade. This growth is being sustained by CBRE's unique ability to deliver globally integrated solutions. Closely linking our outsourcing services with our market-leading brokerage professionals, it completed $285 billion of sales and leasing transactions in 2014, gives us distinct advantages in creating value for our clients both locally and globally. We experienced continued strong growth in Q1 2015 signing 58 total contracts and bringing on more new customers than in any previous quarter. International markets remained further ground for growth with 19 contracts signed in Asia-Pacific and EMEA. 
Earlier in the call, Bob mentioned the ESI acquisition. ESI is a leading systems integrator and provider of energy management services. They remotely monitors and analyzes energy usage in real time for more than 180 million square feet of facilities. This is a strategic addition to our Global Corporate Services offering. Since announcing the acquisition, we have seen significant incremental interest from our clients regarding energy and sustainability services. We anticipate ESI will bring added value to our new clients coming over from Global Workplay Solutions when it closes, which we expect to be later this year. 
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Revenue was up 5% and normalized EBITDA rose 16% in local currency driven by carried interest. In local currency, Assets Under Management was unchanged compared with year-end 2014 and up more than $5 billion from the first quarter of 2014. However, the weakening of the euro and British pound sterling caused the AUM to decrease to 87.1 billion from year-end 2014 when converted to U.S. dollars. Capital raising totaled $1.3 billion for the quarter and $8.7 billion for the trailing 4 quarters with strong pipeline for the remainder of the year. 
Please turn to Slide 12 regarding our Development Services segment. You'll recall that we completed outsized asset sales in last year's Q1. With fewer sales this year's and this year's Q1, pro forma revenue and EBITDA declined from a year ago. We expect sales activity to also be lighter in Q2 and weighted toward the back half of the year. Our pipelines stood at $3.6 billion at the end of Q1 2015, a decrease of approximately $400 million from year-end 2014. Projects in process totaled $5.5 billion, up $100 million from year-end 2014. As of Q1 2015, our equity co-invest and development business totaled $121.5 million and our guarantees on outstanding debt balances stood at just $11.9 million.

CBRE accomplished a great deal in the first few months of 2015. First, we announced our largest acquisition in 8 years, which when completed will materially advance our strategy for serving occupiers. Second, we continued to make investments in our people and platform to enhance our competitive position. And third, we again generated outstanding financial results for our shareholders. Our 52,000 professionals are extremely hardworking and intensely focused on harnessing the full breadth of CBRE's resources and expertise to create great outcomes for our clients. We thank them for their contributions to our success. Needless to say, we are pleased with our start to 2015. However, it is important to bear in mind that the first quarter comprises a relatively small portion of our annual revenue and earnings. And as we've often said, it may not be an effective barometer of full year performance. What's more, our currency hedges are mark-to-market each quarter. And at current rates, the hedging gains we realized in the first quarter will be offset by currency translation losses in future quarters. Similarly, we can expect GSE lending activity, which moved robustly in the quarter, to taper off later this year as regulatory caps come into play and other lenders step up their activity. In light of this, we are maintaining our expectations for adjusted earnings per share of $1.90 to $1.95 for 2015, an increase of 15% over 2014 at the midpoint of our estimate. 
There is good underlying momentum in our business and the advantages we enjoy as the global market leader of becoming more pronounced as we continue to invest in our people, our platform and our service offering. Increasingly, investors and occupiers are gravitating to CBRE due to our ability to deliver high-quality, globally integrated solutions that leverage the industry's top talent to create real competitive advantages for our clients around the world.

The opening months of 2015 have been an exciting time for CBRE on a number of fronts. As you saw in our press release, the strong momentum in our business continued in the first quarter with double-digit growth on the top and bottom lines. The strong increase in adjusted earnings per share is especially notable during the quarter when analysts are expecting average earnings for S&P 500 companies to be down over last year. In these results, we are seeing the impact of our strategy to drive growth by enhancing our service offering for clients, strengthening the platform that enables our professionals to deliver market-leading solutions, augmenting our talent pool through strategic recruiting and targeted M&A and continuing our focus on balance sheet strength, which supports investments in our people and platform while providing financial flexibility. Strong broker recruiting has continued into the first quarter of 2015 as talented professionals recognize the many advantages CBRE affords them, both in meeting the spectrum of client needs and in building their careers. The first quarter performance of the leasing and sales businesses, particularly in the Americas, reflects our recruiting success over the past 2 years and continued increased production by our existing transaction professionals. As our largest business segment, the Americas is benefiting significantly from our strategy and was the primary growth catalyst during the quarter. The region posted its third consecutive quarter of at least 20% revenue growth, along with strong normalized EBITDA growth and healthy margin expansion. Asia-Pacific also performed well with double-digit revenue growth before the effects of currency translation. Growth slowed in Europe, Middle East and Africa and turned negative in U.S. dollar terms as we faced the challenging comparison against last year's robust first quarter. 
We have completed 2 infill acquisitions this year that bolster our service offering. The first was United Commercial Realty, a highly regarded firm that serves retailers and retail property investors across the U.S. The second, which we closed 2 weeks after the end of the first quarter, was Environmental Systems, Inc., an energy management specialist that complements the array of services offered by our Global Corporate Services business. Finally and very importantly, as you all are aware, we announced an agreement in late March to acquire the Global Workplace Solutions business from Johnson Controls. This is a significant strategic move for CBRE. It will vastly expand our ability to self-perform facilities management services on a worldwide basis, particularly from more technically oriented facilities, and it will deepen our relationships with some of the world's largest corporations. In the days following the news, we have had an enthusiastic reaction from the employees of both companies, from our shareholders, and most significantly, from our clients. The regulatory approval process is underway, and we look forward to completing the transaction later this year and welcoming John Murphy and the GWS employees from more than 50 countries around the world. We're also excited about our strategic partnership with Johnson Controls, which will enhance our ability to bring innovation and value to our clients. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim, who will describe our first quarter performance in more detail."

As Bob indicated, CBRE is off to a strong start in 2015. Normalized EBITDA of $247 million reflected a 24% increase in the first quarter of 2015 and a 17% margin on fee revenue, up 200 basis points from Q1 of 2014.",1393,"Thank you, Bob. Please turn to Slide 5. As Bob indicated, CBRE is off to a strong start in 2015. Normalized EBITDA of $247 million reflected a 24% increase in the first quarter of 2015 and a 17% margin on fee revenue, up 200 basis points from Q1 of 2014. Adjusted earnings per share improved 28% for the quarter. Both revenue and fee revenue rose 10% or 15% in local currency. These results followed a strong first quarter in 2014. The results include approximately $13 million pretax or $0.02 per share after-tax of net gains from foreign currency movement after the impact of currency hedging activities for the year. Together, our 3 regional service segments, the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific, achieved significant operating leverage for the quarter, even after excluding currency hedging gains. This was driven by the Americas, which benefited from strong growth across all business lines. We also saw a resurgence of origination activity and gains from related servicing rights associated with U.S. government-sponsored entities, which produced EBITDA growth of slightly more than $20 million over prior year Q1. Normalized depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately $8 million, driven by increased platform investments and higher mortgage servicing rights. While net interest expense decreased about $2.5 million from Q1 2014, our normalized tax rate was 36.5% for the quarter, higher than the 35% we expect for the full year 2015. Our net debt declined by approximately $275 million or half a turn to 1.2x trailing 12-month normalized EBITDA at the end of Q1 2015 as compared to Q1 2014. 
Reflecting our increasingly strong financial position, Moody's raised its rating on our senior secured and senior unsecured debt to investment grade in March. This followed Standard & Poor's upgrade of our corporate user rating to investment grade late last year. 
Please turn to Slide 6 for a review of our performance in each of our global lines of business in Q1. Our capital markets businesses were particularly strong performers. Property sales revenue increased 21% with the U.S. up strongly and single-digit growth in EMEA and Asia-Pacific. Meanwhile, mortgage services recorded its best growth in 3 years, spurred by the jump in GSE activity. Leasing recorded 13% revenue growth globally, the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit increases. This growth was paced by continued strong market share gains in the U.S. Global Corporate Services continued to grow at double-digit clip. Excluding related transaction revenues, which are accounted for in leasing and sales, GCS achieved a 13% increase in revenue and 12% in fee revenue with double-digit growth in all 3 regions. Asset Services saw solid growth with revenue up 12% and fee revenue up 8%. The global valuations business saw revenue up 20%. Growth in the U.S. was supported by acquisitions, which have enhanced and expanded the services we can offer to clients. Global Investment Management revenue rose by 5%, driven by higher carried interest compared with last year's Q1. Contractual fee revenue comprised 39% of total fee revenue for Q1, while contractual fee revenue plus leasing, which is largely recurring, totaled 70%. Property sales accounted for 21% of total fee revenue. 
Please turn to Slide 7 where I will review Q1 results for our 3 regional service segments, starting with the Americas. Overall revenue for the Americas rose by 21%. This region's revenue has now grown by double digits for 10 consecutive quarters. Every major business line posted double-digit growth for the quarter. Capital markets had a brisk pace with property sales revenue up 32% and mortgage services up 43%. We were pleased to have again achieved the highest market share in the U.S. investment sales, according to RCA, with a 200 basis point improvement over prior year Q1. Leasing again logged vigorous growth with revenue up 19%. While market conditions continue to steadily improve, we are seeing tangible benefits from our broker recruiting and infill M&A, along with increased productivity from our existing producers. Fee revenue from Global Corporate Services and Asset Services combined increased 12%. 
Please turn to Slide 8 regarding EMEA. EMEA revenue rose 6%. This region faced a particularly tough compare with last year's exceptionally strong Q1 when revenue increased 27%, excluding contributions from Norland. Nevertheless, we saw growth in Global Corporate Services and Asset Services. Combined fee revenue increased 9% with double-digit growth in facilities management, reflecting the growing appetite for real estate outsourcing within the region. Property sales revenue rose 6% on top of a 54% surge in last year's Q1. Growth was driven by Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Property leasing revenue declined 6%. The number of smaller countries in the continent saw improved activity. This was more than offset by decreases relative to Q1 of last year in France and the United Kingdom. 
Please turn to Slide 9 regarding Asia-Pacific. We saw strong growth in the region with overall revenue rising 15% for the quarter. Like EMEA, Global Corporate Services and Asset Services set the pace for growth in the region. Fee revenue improved 12% as outsourcing continues to make inroads in the region. Greater China and India showed particularly strong growth in Q1. Leasing revenue rose solidly, increasing by 8%. Most of this growth occurred in Australia and New Zealand. Property sales rose 3% on top of 38% growth in the prior year Q1 with significant gains in Australia. The investment climate across Asia-Pacific is mixed amid a shortage of available product in some markets, slowing economies and domestic capital that is increasingly migrating to the U.S. and Europe in search of yield.
Please turn to Slide 10 regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which we call Global Corporate Services. Results from this global business line are reported within the 3 regional services segments. Global Corporate Services has increased revenue at a double-digit compounded annual growth rate over the last decade. Its growth is being sustained by CBRE's unique ability to deliver globally integrated solutions. Closely linking our outsourcing services with our market-leading brokerage professionals, we completed $285 billion of sales and leasing transactions in 2014, gives us distinct advantages in creating value for our clients, both locally and globally. We experienced continued strong growth in Q1 2015, signing 58 total contracts and bringing on more new customers than in any previous quarter. International markets remained fertile ground for growth with 19 contracts signed in Asia-Pacific and EMEA. 
Earlier in the call, Bob mentioned the ESI acquisition. ESI is a leading systems integrator and provider of energy management services that remotely monitors and analyzes energy usage in real time for more than 180 million square feet of facilities. This is a strategic addition to our Global Corporate Services offering. Since announcing the acquisition, we have seen significant incremental interest from our clients regarding energy and sustainability services. We anticipate ESI will bring added value to our new clients coming over from Global Workplace Solutions when it closes, which we expect to be later this year. 
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Revenue was up 5% and normalized EBITDA rose 16% in local currency, driven by carried interest. In local currency, Assets Under Management was unchanged compared with year-end 2014 and up more than $5 billion from the first quarter of 2014. However, the weakening of the euro and British pound sterling caused the AUM to decrease to $87.1 billion from year-end 2014 when converted to U.S. dollars. Capital raising totaled $1.3 billion for the quarter and $8.7 billion for the trailing 4 quarters with strong pipeline for the remainder of the year. 
Please turn to Slide 12 regarding our Development Services segment. You'll recall that we completed outsized asset sales in last year's Q1. With fewer sales this year's and this year's Q1, pro forma revenue and EBITDA declined from a year ago. We expect sales activity to also be lighter in Q2 and weighted toward the back half of the year. Our pipelines stood at $3.6 billion at the end of Q1 2015, a decrease of approximately $400 million from year-end 2014. Projects in process totaled $5.5 billion, up $100 million from year-end 2014. As of Q1 2015, our equity co-invest and development business totaled $121.5 million and our guarantees on outstanding debt balances stood at just $11.9 million.

CBRE accomplished a great deal in the first few months of 2015. First, we announced our largest acquisition in 8 years, which, when completed, will materially advance our strategy for serving occupiers. Second, we continued to make investments in our people and platform to enhance our competitive position. And third, we again generated outstanding financial results for our shareholders. Our 52,000 professionals are extremely hardworking and intensely focused on harnessing the full breadth of CBRE's resources and expertise to create great outcomes for our clients. We thank them for their contributions to our success. Needless to say, we are pleased with our start to 2015. However, it is important to bear in mind that the first quarter comprises a relatively small portion of our annual revenue and earnings. And as we have often said, it may not be an effective barometer of full year performance. What's more, our currency hedges are mark-to-market each quarter, and at current rates, the hedging gains we realized in the first quarter will be offset by currency translation losses in future quarters. Similarly, we can expect GSE lending activity, which moved robustly in the quarter, to taper off later this year as regulatory caps come into play and other lenders step up their activity. In light of this, we are maintaining our expectations for adjusted earnings per share of $1.90 to $1.95 for 2015, an increase of 15% over 2014 at the midpoint of our estimate. 
There is good underlying momentum in our business, and the advantages we enjoy as the global market leader are becoming more pronounced as we continue to invest in our people, our platform and our service offering. Increasingly, investors and occupiers are gravitating to CBRE due to our ability to deliver high-quality, globally integrated solutions that leverage the industry's top talent to create real competitive advantages for our clients around the world.

And then on EMEA, I know you already talked about this, but -- and I realize that FX was a big driver of the decline in revenue, but presumably this was also a pretty big impact for the fourth quarter and you were sure would have put a pretty solid growth for fourth quarter year-over-year. So I'm trying to understand how much of the decline is attributed to more difficult comps versus Q1 2014, how much is a bigger FX headwind versus where you were at last quarter and really trying to get at whether or not you're seeing any actual deceleration in this business once you take into account these considerations."

CapEx took our revenue growth down significantly in EMEA this quarter, but we were dealing with a very, very strong compare relative to last year. So that was a big part of what you saw. The other thing to keep in mind is first quarter is a relatively small part of year. So in any region, and particularly in Europe and Asia, which are smaller than the U.S., you can have a few things moved from one quarter to the next or be pulled into one quarter from the previous quarter, and it changes your trajectory and your numbers pretty materially. So I think those are really the 3 things I would look at after that small quarter and really very, very difficult compare from last year."

The opening months of 2015 have been an exciting time for CBRE on a number of fronts. As you saw in our press release, the strong momentum in our business continued in the first quarter with double-digit growth on the top and bottom lines. The strong increase in adjusted earnings per share is especially notable during the quarter when analysts are expecting average earnings for S&P 500 companies to be down over last year. In these results, we are seeing the impact of our strategy to drive growth by enhancing our service offering for clients, strengthening the platform that enables our professionals to deliver market-leading solutions, augmenting our talent pool through strategic recruiting and targeted M&A and continuing our focus on balance sheet strength, which supports investments in our people and platform while providing financial flexibility. Strong broker recruiting has continued into the first quarter of 2015 as talented professionals recognize the many advantages CBRE affords them, both in meeting the full spectrum of client needs and in building their careers. The first quarter performance of the leasing and sales businesses, particularly in the Americas, reflects our recruiting success over the past 2 years and continued increased production by our existing transaction professionals. As our largest business segment, the Americas is benefiting significantly from our strategy and was a primary growth catalyst during the quarter. The region posted its third consecutive quarter of at least 20% revenue growth, along with strong normalized EBITDA growth and healthy margin expansion. Asia-Pacific also performed well with double-digit revenue growth before the effects of currency translation. Growth slowed in Europe, Middle East and Africa and turned negative in U.S. dollar terms as we faced the challenging comparison against last year's robust first quarter. 
We have completed 2 infill acquisitions this year that bolster our service offering. The first was United Commercial Realty, a highly regarded firm that serves retailers and retail property investors across the U.S. The second, which we closed 2 weeks after the end of the first quarter, was Environmental Systems, Inc., an energy management specialist that complements the array of services offered by our Global Corporate Services business. Finally and very importantly, as you all are aware, we announced an agreement in late March to acquire the Global Workplace Solutions business from Johnson Controls. This is a significant strategic move for CBRE. It will vastly expand our ability to self-perform facilities management services on a worldwide basis, particularly for more technically oriented facilities, and it will deepen our relationships with some of the world's largest corporations. In the days following the news, we have had an enthusiastic reaction from the employees of both companies, from our shareholders, and most significantly, from our clients. The regulatory approval process is underway, and we look forward to completing the transaction later this year and welcoming John Murphy and the GWS employees from more than 50 countries around the world. We're also excited about our strategic partnership with Johnson Controls, which will enhance our ability to bring innovation and value to our clients. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim, who will describe our first quarter performance in more detail."

As Bob indicated, CBRE is off to a strong start in 2015. Normalized EBITDA of $247 million reflected a 24% increase in the first quarter of 2015 and a 17% margin on fee revenue, up 200 basis points from Q1 of 2014.",1394,"Thank you, Bob. Please turn to Slide 5. As Bob indicated, CBRE is off to a strong start in 2015. Normalized EBITDA of $247 million reflected a 24% increase in the first quarter of 2015 and a 17% margin on fee revenue, up 200 basis points from Q1 of 2014. Adjusted earnings per share improved 28% for the quarter. Both revenue and fee revenue rose 10% or 15% in local currency. These results followed a strong first quarter in 2014. The results include approximately $13 million pretax or $0.02 per share after-tax of net gains from foreign currency movement after the impact of currency hedging activities for the year. Together, our 3 regional service segments, the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific, achieved significant operating leverage for the quarter, even after excluding currency hedging gains. This was driven by the Americas, which benefited from strong growth across all business lines. We also saw a resurgence of origination activity and gains from related servicing rights associated with U.S. government-sponsored entities, which produced EBITDA growth of slightly more than $20 million over prior year Q1. Normalized depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately $8 million, driven by increased platform investments and higher mortgage servicing rights. While net interest expense decreased about $2.5 million from Q1 2014, our normalized tax rate was 36.5% for the quarter, higher than the 35% we expect for the full year 2015. Our net debt declined by approximately $275 million or half a turn to 1.2x trailing 12-month normalized EBITDA at the end of Q1 2015 as compared to Q1 2014. 
Reflecting our increasingly strong financial position, Moody's raised its rating on our senior secured and senior unsecured debt to investment grade in March. This followed Standard & Poor's upgrade of our corporate user rating to investment grade late last year. 
Please turn to Slide 6 for a review of our performance in each of our global lines of business in Q1. Our capital markets businesses were particularly strong performers. Property sales revenue increased 21% with the U.S. up strongly and single-digit growth in EMEA and Asia-Pacific. Meanwhile, mortgage services recorded its best growth in 3 years, spurred by the jump in GSE activity. Leasing recorded 13% revenue growth globally, the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit increases. This growth was paced by continued strong market share gains in the U.S. Global Corporate Services continued to grow at double-digit clip. Excluding related transaction revenues, which are accounted for in leasing and sales, GCS achieved a 13% increase in revenue and 12% in fee revenue with double-digit growth in all 3 regions. Asset Services saw solid growth with revenue up 12% and fee revenue up 8%. The global valuations business saw revenue up 20%. Growth in the U.S. was supported by acquisitions, which have enhanced and expanded the services we can offer to clients. Global Investment Management revenue rose by 5%, driven by higher carried interest compared with last year's Q1. Contractual fee revenue comprised 39% of total fee revenue for Q1, while contractual fee revenue plus leasing, which is largely recurring, totaled 70%. Property sales accounted for 21% of total fee revenue. 
Please turn to Slide 7 where I will review Q1 results for our 3 regional service segments, starting with the Americas. Overall revenue for the Americas rose by 21%. This region's revenue has now grown by double digits for 10 consecutive quarters. Every major business line posted double-digit growth for the quarter. Capital markets set a brisk pace with property sales revenue up 32% and mortgage services up 43%. We were pleased to have again achieved the highest market share in the U.S. investment sales, according to RCA, with a 200 basis point improvement over prior year Q1. Leasing again logged vigorous growth with revenue up 19%. While market conditions continue to steadily improve, we are seeing tangible benefits from our broker recruiting and infill M&A, along with increased productivity from our existing producers. Fee revenue from Global Corporate Services and Asset Services combined increased 12%. 
Please turn to Slide 8 regarding EMEA. EMEA revenue rose 6%. This region faced a particularly tough compare with last year's exceptionally strong Q1 when revenue increased 27%, excluding contributions from Norland. Nevertheless, we saw growth in Global Corporate Services and Asset Services. Combined fee revenue increased 9% with double-digit growth in facilities management, reflecting the growing appetite for real estate outsourcing within the region. Property sales revenue rose 6% on top of a 54% surge in last year's Q1. Growth was driven by Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Property leasing revenue declined 6%. The number of smaller countries in the continent saw improved activity. This was more than offset by decreases relative to Q1 of last year in France and the United Kingdom. 
Please turn to Slide 9 regarding Asia-Pacific. We saw strong growth in the region with overall revenue rising 15% for the quarter. Like EMEA, Global Corporate Services and Asset Services set the pace for growth in the region. Fee revenue improved 12% as outsourcing continues to make inroads in the region. Greater China and India showed particularly strong growth in Q1. Leasing revenue rose solidly, increasing by 8%. Most of this growth occurred in Australia and New Zealand. Property sales rose 3% on top of 38% growth in the prior year Q1 with significant gains in Australia. The investment climate across Asia-Pacific is mixed amid a shortage of available product in some markets, slowing economies and domestic capital that is increasingly migrating to the U.S. and Europe in search of yield.
Please turn to Slide 10 regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which we call Global Corporate Services. Results from this global business line are reported within the 3 regional services segments. Global Corporate Services has increased revenue at a double-digit compounded annual growth rate over the last decade. Its growth is being sustained by CBRE's unique ability to deliver globally integrated solutions. Closely linking our outsourcing services with our market-leading brokerage professionals, we completed $285 billion of sales and leasing transactions in 2014, gives us distinct advantages in creating value for our clients, both locally and globally. We experienced continued strong growth in Q1 2015, signing 58 total contracts and bringing on more new customers than in any previous quarter. International markets remained fertile ground for growth with 19 contracts signed in Asia-Pacific and EMEA. 
Earlier in the call, Bob mentioned the ESI acquisition. ESI is a leading systems integrator and provider of energy management services. It remotely monitors and analyzes energy usage in real time for more than 180 million square feet of facilities. This is a strategic addition to our Global Corporate Services offering. Since announcing the acquisition, we have seen significant incremental interest from our clients regarding energy and sustainability services. We anticipate ESI will bring added value to our new clients coming over from Global Workplace Solutions when it closes, which we expect to be later this year. 
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Revenue was up 5% and normalized EBITDA rose 16% in local currency, driven by carried interest. In local currency, Assets Under Management was unchanged compared with yearend 2014 and up more than $5 billion from the first quarter of 2014. However, the weakening of the euro and British pound sterling caused the AUM to decrease to $87.1 billion from yearend 2014 when converted to U.S. dollars. Capital raising totaled $1.3 billion for the quarter and $8.7 billion for the trailing 4 quarters with strong pipeline for the remainder of the year. 
Please turn to Slide 12 regarding our Development Services segment. You'll recall that we completed outsized asset sales in last year's Q1. With fewer sales this year's -- in this year's Q1, pro forma revenue and EBITDA declined from a year ago. We expect sales activity to also be lighter in Q2 and weighted toward the back half of the year. Our pipelines stood at $3.6 billion at the end of Q1 2015, a decrease of approximately $400 million from yearend 2014. Projects in process totaled $5.5 billion, up $100 million from yearend 2014. As of Q1 2015, our equity co-invest and development business totaled $121.5 million and our guarantees on outstanding debt balances stood at just $11.9 million.

CBRE accomplished a great deal in the first few months of 2015. First, we announced our largest acquisition in 8 years, which, when completed, will materially advance our strategy for serving occupiers. Second, we continue to make investments in our people and platform to enhance our competitive position. And third, we again generated outstanding financial results for our shareholders. Our 52,000 professionals are extremely hardworking and intensely focused on harnessing the full breadth of CBRE's resources and expertise to create great outcomes for our clients. We thank them for their contributions to our success. Needless to say, we are pleased with our start to 2015. However, it is important to bear in mind that the first quarter comprises a relatively small portion of our annual revenue and earnings. And as we have often said, it may not be an effective barometer of full year performance. What's more, our currency hedges are mark-to-market each quarter, and at current rates, the hedging gains we realized in the first quarter will be offset by currency translation losses in future quarters. Similarly, we can expect GSE lending activity, which moved robustly in the quarter, to taper off later this year as regulatory caps come into play and other lenders step up their activity. In light of this, we are maintaining our expectations for adjusted earnings per share of $1.90 to $1.95 for 2015, an increase of 15% over 2014 at the midpoint of our estimate. 
There is good underlying momentum in our business, and the advantages we enjoy as the global market leader are becoming more pronounced as we continue to invest in our people, our platform and our service offering. Increasingly, investors and occupiers are gravitating to CBRE due to our ability to deliver high-quality, globally integrated solutions that leverage the industry's top talent to create real competitive advantages for our clients around the world.

So I'm trying to understand how much of the decline is attributed to more difficult comps versus Q1 2014, how much is a bigger FX headwind versus where you were at last quarter, and really trying to get at whether or not you're seeing any actual deceleration in this business once you take into account those considerations."

The other thing to keep in mind is first quarter is a relatively small part of year. So in any region, and particularly in Europe and Asia, which are smaller than the U.S., you can have a few things move from one quarter to the next or be pulled into one quarter from the previous quarter, and it changes your trajectory and your numbers pretty materially.

The opening months of 2015 have been an exciting time for CBRE on a number of fronts. As you saw in our press release, the strong momentum in our business continued in the first quarter with double-digit growth on the top and bottom lines. The strong increase in adjusted earnings per share is especially notable during the quarter when analysts are expecting average earnings for S&P 500 companies to be down over last year. In these results, we are seeing the impact of our strategy to drive growth by enhancing our service offering for clients, strengthening the platform that enables our professionals to deliver market-leading solutions, augmenting our talent pool through strategic recruiting and targeted M&A and continuing our focus on balance sheet strength, which supports investments in our people and platform while providing financial flexibility. Strong broker recruiting has continued into the first quarter of 2015 as talented professionals recognize the many advantages CBRE affords them, both in meeting the full spectrum of client needs and in building their careers. The first quarter performance of the leasing and sales businesses, particularly in the Americas, reflects our recruiting success over the past 2 years and continued increased production by our existing transaction professionals. As our largest business segment, the Americas is benefiting significantly from our strategy and was a primary growth catalyst during the quarter. The region posted its third consecutive quarter of at least 20% revenue growth, along with strong normalized EBITDA growth and healthy margin expansion. Asia-Pacific also performed well with double-digit revenue growth before the effects of currency translation. Growth slowed in Europe, Middle East and Africa and turned negative in U.S. dollar terms as we faced the challenging comparison against last year's robust first quarter. 
We have completed 2 infill acquisitions this year that bolster our service offering. The first was United Commercial Realty, a highly regarded firm that serves retailers and retail property investors across the U.S. The second, which we closed 2 weeks after the end of the first quarter, was Environmental Systems, Inc., an energy management specialist that complements the array of services offered by our Global Corporate Services business. Finally and very importantly, as you all are aware, we announced an agreement in late March to acquire the Global Workplace Solutions business from Johnson Controls. This is a significant strategic move for CBRE. It will vastly expand our ability to self-perform facilities management services on a worldwide basis, particularly for more technically oriented facilities, and it will deepen our relationships with some of the world's largest corporations. In the days following the news, we have had an enthusiastic reaction from the employees of both companies, from our shareholders, and most significantly, from our clients. The regulatory approval process is underway, and we look forward to completing the transaction later this year and welcoming John Murphy and the GWS employees from more than 50 countries around the world. We're also excited about our strategic partnership with Johnson Controls, which will enhance our ability to bring innovation and value to our clients. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim, who will describe our first quarter performance in more detail."

As Bob indicated, CBRE is off to a strong start in 2015. Normalized EBITDA of $247 million reflected a 24% increase in the first quarter of 2015 and a 17% margin on fee revenue, up 200 basis points from Q1 of 2014.",1394,"Thank you, Bob. Please turn to Slide 5. As Bob indicated, CBRE is off to a strong start in 2015. Normalized EBITDA of $247 million reflected a 24% increase in the first quarter of 2015 and a 17% margin on fee revenue, up 200 basis points from Q1 of 2014. Adjusted earnings per share improved 28% for the quarter. Both revenue and fee revenue rose 10% or 15% in local currency. These results followed a strong first quarter in 2014. The results include approximately $13 million pretax or $0.02 per share after-tax of net gains from foreign currency movement after the impact of currency hedging activities for the year. Together, our 3 regional service segments, the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific, achieved significant operating leverage for the quarter, even after excluding currency hedging gains. This was driven by the Americas, which benefited from strong growth across all business lines. We also saw a resurgence of origination activity and gains from related servicing rights associated with U.S. government-sponsored entities, which produced EBITDA growth of slightly more than $20 million over prior year Q1. Normalized depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately $8 million, driven by increased platform investments and higher mortgage servicing rights. While net interest expense decreased about $2.5 million from Q1 2014, our normalized tax rate was 36.5% for the quarter, higher than the 35% we expect for the full year 2015. Our net debt declined by approximately $275 million or half a turn to 1.2x trailing 12-month normalized EBITDA at the end of Q1 2015 as compared to Q1 2014. 
Reflecting our increasingly strong financial position, Moody's raised its rating on our senior secured and senior unsecured debt to investment grade in March. This followed Standard & Poor's upgrade of our corporate user rating to investment grade late last year. 
Please turn to Slide 6 for a review of our performance in each of our global lines of business in Q1. Our capital markets businesses were particularly strong performers. Property sales revenue increased 21% with the U.S. up strongly and single-digit growth in EMEA and Asia-Pacific. Meanwhile, mortgage services recorded its best growth in 3 years, spurred by the jump in GSE activity. Leasing recorded 13% revenue growth globally, the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit increases. This growth was paced by continued strong market share gains in the U.S. Global Corporate Services continued to grow at double-digit clip. Excluding related transaction revenues, which are accounted for in leasing and sales, GCS achieved a 13% increase in revenue and 12% in fee revenue with double-digit growth in all 3 regions. Asset Services saw solid growth with revenue up 12% and fee revenue up 8%. The global valuations business saw revenue up 20%. Growth in the U.S. was supported by acquisitions, which have enhanced and expanded the services we can offer to clients. Global Investment Management revenue rose by 5%, driven by higher carried interest compared with last year's Q1. Contractual fee revenue comprised 39% of total fee revenue for Q1, while contractual fee revenue plus leasing, which is largely recurring, totaled 70%. Property sales accounted for 21% of total fee revenue. 
Please turn to Slide 7 where I will review Q1 results for our 3 regional service segments, starting with the Americas. Overall revenue for the Americas rose by 21%. This region's revenue has now grown by double digits for 10 consecutive quarters. Every major business line posted double-digit growth for the quarter. Capital markets set a brisk pace with property sales revenue up 32% and mortgage services up 43%. We were pleased to have again achieved the highest market share in the U.S. investment sales, according to RCA, with a 200 basis point improvement over prior year Q1. Leasing again logged vigorous growth with revenue up 19%. While market conditions continue to steadily improve, we are seeing tangible benefits from our broker recruiting and infill M&A, along with increased productivity from our existing producers. Fee revenue from Global Corporate Services and Asset Services combined increased 12%. 
Please turn to Slide 8 regarding EMEA. EMEA revenue rose 6%. This region faced a particularly tough compare with last year's exceptionally strong Q1 when revenue increased 27%, excluding contributions from Norland. Nevertheless, we saw growth in Global Corporate Services and Asset Services. Combined fee revenue increased 9% with double-digit growth in facilities management, reflecting the growing appetite for real estate outsourcing within the region. Property sales revenue rose 6% on top of a 54% surge in last year's Q1. Growth was driven by Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Property leasing revenue declined 6%. The number of smaller countries in the continent saw improved activity. This was more than offset by decreases relative to Q1 of last year in France and the United Kingdom. 
Please turn to Slide 9 regarding Asia-Pacific. We saw strong growth in the region with overall revenue rising 15% for the quarter. Like EMEA, Global Corporate Services and Asset Services set the pace for growth in the region. Fee revenue improved 12% as outsourcing continues to make inroads in the region. Greater China and India showed particularly strong growth in Q1. Leasing revenue rose solidly, increasing by 8%. Most of this growth occurred in Australia and New Zealand. Property sales rose 3% on top of 38% growth in the prior year Q1 with significant gains in Australia. The investment climate across Asia-Pacific is mixed amid a shortage of available product in some markets, slowing economies and domestic capital that is increasingly migrating to the U.S. and Europe in search of yield.
Please turn to Slide 10 regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which we call Global Corporate Services. Results from this global business line are reported within the 3 regional services segments. Global Corporate Services has increased revenue at a double-digit compounded annual growth rate over the last decade. Its growth is being sustained by CBRE's unique ability to deliver globally integrated solutions. Closely linking our outsourcing services with our market-leading brokerage professionals, we completed $285 billion of sales and leasing transactions in 2014, gives us distinct advantages in creating value for our clients, both locally and globally. We experienced continued strong growth in Q1 2015, signing 58 total contracts and bringing on more new customers than in any previous quarter. International markets remained fertile ground for growth with 19 contracts signed in Asia-Pacific and EMEA. 
Earlier in the call, Bob mentioned the ESI acquisition. ESI is a leading systems integrator and provider of energy management services. It remotely monitors and analyzes energy usage in real time for more than 180 million square feet of facilities. This is a strategic addition to our Global Corporate Services offering. Since announcing the acquisition, we have seen significant incremental interest from our clients regarding energy and sustainability services. We anticipate ESI will bring added value to our new clients coming over from Global Workplace Solutions when it closes, which we expect to be later this year. 
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Revenue was up 5% and normalized EBITDA rose 16% in local currency, driven by carried interest. In local currency, Assets Under Management was unchanged compared with year-end 2014 and up more than $5 billion from the first quarter of 2014. However, the weakening of the euro and British pound sterling caused the AUM to decrease to $87.1 billion from year-end 2014 when converted to U.S. dollars. Capital raising totaled $1.3 billion for the quarter and $8.7 billion for the trailing 4 quarters with strong pipeline for the remainder of the year. 
Please turn to Slide 12 regarding our Development Services segment. You'll recall that we completed outsized asset sales in last year's Q1. With fewer sales this year's -- in this year's Q1, pro forma revenue and EBITDA declined from a year ago. We expect sales activity to also be lighter in Q2 and weighted toward the back half of the year. Our pipelines stood at $3.6 billion at the end of Q1 2015, a decrease of approximately $400 million from year-end 2014. Projects in process totaled $5.5 billion, up $100 million from year-end 2014. As of Q1 2015, our equity co-invest and development business totaled $121.5 million and our guarantees on outstanding debt balances stood at just $11.9 million.

CBRE accomplished a great deal in the first few months of 2015. First, we announced our largest acquisition in 8 years, which, when completed, will materially advance our strategy for serving occupiers. Second, we continue to make investments in our people and platform to enhance our competitive position. And third, we again generated outstanding financial results for our shareholders. Our 52,000 professionals are extremely hardworking and intensely focused on harnessing the full breadth of CBRE's resources and expertise to create great outcomes for our clients. We thank them for their contributions to our success. Needless to say, we are pleased with our start to 2015. However, it is important to bear in mind that the first quarter comprises a relatively small portion of our annual revenue and earnings. And as we have often said, it may not be an effective barometer of full year performance. What's more, our currency hedges are mark-to-market each quarter, and at current rates, the hedging gains we realized in the first quarter will be offset by currency translation losses in future quarters. Similarly, we can expect GSE lending activity, which moved robustly in the quarter, to taper off later this year as regulatory caps come into play and other lenders step up their activity. In light of this, we are maintaining our expectations for adjusted earnings per share of $1.90 to $1.95 for 2015, an increase of 15% over 2014 at the midpoint of our estimate. 
There is good underlying momentum in our business, and the advantages we enjoy as the global market leader are becoming more pronounced as we continue to invest in our people, our platform and our service offering. Increasingly, investors and occupiers are gravitating to CBRE due to our ability to deliver high-quality, globally integrated solutions that leverage the industry's top talent to create real competitive advantages for our clients around the world.

CBRE's excellent start to 2015 extended into the second quarter.

CBRE's excellent start to 2015 extended into the second quarter. Our business exhibited broad strength around the world, and we continue to execute our strategy and our people create real, competitive advantages for our clients. We were pleased to once again produce double-digit growth rates on the top and bottom lines. Our growth was especially impressive coming at a time when foreign currency exchange rates worked against us significantly.
In local currency, our increases of 19% in revenue and 22% in normalized EBITDA are among our best on record. Adjusted earnings per share, while up strongly at 17%, would've increased by more than 30% but for the currency effects. Our regional services businesses, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific, drove our strong performance during the quarter.
We continue to invest prudently in recruiting, M&A, platform enhancements and strategic initiatives to ensure that we are always providing best in class service for our clients and driving profitable growth for our business. The benefits of these efforts were very clear in the second quarter. Each of our 3 regions turned in exceptional results with high teens or better revenue growth in local currency, positive operating leverage and strong margins.
While achieving robust growth and remaining riveted on client service, we continued our progress toward completing the acquisition of the Global Workplace Solutions business from Johnson Controls. We remain on course to complete this transaction later this quarter or early next quarter and are very enthusiastic about the opportunities it will afford us to deepen our relationships with many of the world's largest corporations.
A final highlight of the quarter was CBRE's performance in the bearings 500 ranking published in May. Bearings uses detailed analytics to evaluate the financial performance of the 500 largest U.S. based corporations. We are extremely pleased to be number 2 on this prestigious ranking this year, up from number 7 last year. This is a great testament to the hard work our people are doing everyday to create value for our clients and our shareholders.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim who will describe our second quarter performance in greater detail."

As Bob indicated, our Q2 results reflect sustained, underlying momentum in our business. We are in a very good financial position, with market-leading scale, strong margins, robust cash flow and a flexible investmen",1265,"Thank you, Bob. Please turn to Slide 5. As Bob indicated, our Q2 results reflect sustained, underlying momentum in our business. We are in a very good financial position, with market-leading scale, strong margins, robust cash flow and a flexible investment grade balance sheet. Reflecting this, Standard & Poor's recently raised our investment grade rating to BBB from BBB minus.
Revenue and earnings achieved strong, double-digit growth, even after adverse foreign currency movement. Gross revenue and fee revenue both rose 12% or 19% in local currency. Normalized EBITDA increased 16% or 22% in local currency to $304 million.
We achieved a 17.1% normalized EBITDA margin on fee revenue, up 60 basis points from Q2 2014. Adjusted earnings per share improved 17% to $0.42 for the quarter, after a $0.05 negative impact from adverse foreign currency movement. Adjusted earnings per share would've improved 31% without the effects of foreign currency.
Please turn to Slide 6 for a review of the performance of our major global lines of business in Q2. As a reminder, all percentage increases are in local currency unless noted otherwise. We achieved outstanding growth in our capital markets business. Property sales revenue surged 32% with growth in the vast majority of countries worldwide. Mortgage services revenue growth exceeded 40% for the second quarter in a row. Mortgage servicing rights on loan activity associated with the U.S. government-sponsored enterprises or GSEs continue to grow rapidly, with EBITDA up $14 million over last year's Q2. As we indicated last quarter, GSE activity is expected to moderate in the second half of the year due to regulatory caps.
Global Corporate Services, our occupier outsourcing business, was particularly strong overseas as clients increasingly require globally integrated solutions. Excluding the transaction revenues generated by this business, we are accounting -- which are accounted for in leasing and sales revenues, Global Corporate Services achieved a 15% increase in fee revenue.
Asset services also showed robust growth around the world, with fee revenue up 24%. Property leasing revenue jumped 15% as our focus on market share gains continued to pay dividends. Evaluation business line had a very strong quarter, with revenue up 35%. Every region exhibited double-digit growth even before accounting for acquisitions completed in the second half of last year.
Revenue fell in Global Investment Management, in part due to minimal carried interest and incentive fees in this year's Q2. Overall, contractual fee revenue, plus leasing, which is largely recurring, totaled 68% of total fee revenue. Property sales accounted for 23% of total fee revenue.
Please turn to Slide #7, where we will review Q2 results for our 3 regional business services segments, starting with the Americas. The Americas, again, displayed strength across the board as overall fee revenue increased 19% to $1.06 billion. Every business line in the region produced double-digit revenue growth for the fourth quarter in a row. Once again, capital markets turned in a very strong performance. Property sales rose 25%, with major contributions from the U.S. and Mexico, while mortgage services improved 44%. We increased our market share in the U.S. investment sales and held the number 1 position at midyear, according to RCA. Leasing revenue grew at a double-digit clip for the eighth consecutive quarter. This reflects both improved productivity from our current brokers, as well as contributions from new producers where migrating to CBRE at an impressive rate. Revenue for the quarter was up 11%. Combined fee revenue from Global Corporate Services and asset services improved 11%.
Please turn to Slide 8 regarding EMEA. EMEA's performance rebounded significantly following a sluggish start to 2015. Fee revenue growth was robust across every service line and increased 33% overall to $409 million. Property sales revenue surged 62%. United Kingdom showed exceptionally strong growth with France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden also making notable gains. France recovered from a relatively low base in Q2 last year and remains a challenging macro environment. For the region, our growth markedly exceeded the estimated 19% volume growth recorded for the market as a whole. Growth in leasing was exceptional. Big gains in Germany, the United Kingdom and other countries resulted in a 33% increase in leasing revenue. Year-to-date, leasing is up 14%. Combined fee revenue from Global Corporate Services and asset services also achieved very strong growth, improving 25%. The United Kingdom accounted for the lion's share of this growth, with notable contributions from France, Germany and Spain.
Please turn to Slide 9, regarding Asia Pacific. This region achieved 17% growth in fee revenue to $200 million. Property sales revenue increased 24%, led by strong growth in Australia and Greater China. This was a notable improvement from a relatively soft Q1. Leasing revenue also rose solidly, increasing by 12%. Australia, India and Singapore all posted healthy gains. Combined fee revenue from Global Corporate Services and asset services rose 19%. China and India were key growth drivers as outsourcing continues to gain a firmer foothold in these emerging economies.
Please turn to Slide #10, regarding our occupier outsourcing business. Financial results for this business line, which we call Global Corporate Services, are reported within the 3 regional services segments. Global Corporate Services grew 15%, continuing its long-term record of solid, secular growth as we focus on extending our leadership position with deeper and broader services for our clients. The payoff can be seen in a growing roster of clients and the expansion of existing relationships. In Q2, we signed 83 total outsourcing contracts, one of our most productive quarters and nearly 40% entailed expanding services or geographies for existing customers. Mission-critical facilities have provided further ground for growth since we added the Norland capabilities 18 months ago. To illustrate, we were awarded data center management contracts with 2 Fortune 50 companies and the global financial information company during the quarter. Adding Global Workplace Solutions 16,000 people in more than 50 countries later this year will further broaden our reach and deepen our expertise.
Please turn to Slide 11, regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Revenue and normalized EBITDA in Global Investment Management decline in Q2 versus the prior year. This was driven disproportionately by minimal carried interest and incentive payments, as well as the impact of the weak market in the quarter. The MSCI U.S. REIT Index declined 10% during Q2 2015 as compared to a 7% increase in the index during the prior year second quarter. As a result, we did not achieve anticipated incentive fees in our listed securities business and we're impacted by the mark-to-market of our related co-investments. Overall, combined incentive fees and carried interests are expected to be more weighted at the second half of this year. We anticipate being on track with our Investment Management and Development Services combined guidance for the full year. Capital raise -- capital raising continued at a brisk pace. We raised $2.2 billion in the second quarter and $7.7 billion over trailing 4 quarters. The pipeline remains strong as we continue to produce solid returns for investors. Assets Under Management of $88.4 billion were up $2.1 billion over prior year Q2 in local currency, but down $4.4 billion when converted into U.S. dollars.
Please turn to Slide 12, regarding our Development Services segment. You will recall, we expected property sales and earnings in this business to be weighted to the second half of the year. Development projects in process totaled $6 billion, up $500 million over Q1 2015 and the pipeline totaled $3.7 billion, up over $100 million over Q1 2015.
Please turn to Slide 13 as I turn the call back over to Bob for closing remarks."

At the midpoint of 2015, CBRE is on course for another year of very strong financial performance. We are intensely focused on executing our strategy to sustain long-term secular growth and further extend our position as the industry leader.
During the first half of 2015, we completed 3 infill acquisitions that enhanced our service offering, and we continued to lay the groundwork for the smooth integration of Global Workplace Solutions later this year. This business is perfectly aligned with our strategy of helping large global clients to meet their objectives under long-term contractual relationships.
We also continued to selectively upgrade and expand our talent base. Brokerage recruiting is running at a brisk pace again this year. We are capitalizing on the growing recognition that CBRE affords the industry's top professionals the opportunity to better serve their clients and build their careers.
Finally, as Jim reviewed earlier, we are in a very strong position financially. As we start the second half, we are positive on our outlook for the remainder of 2015 and believe our full year performance is likely to be toward the upper end of our guidance range of $1.90 to $1.95 adjusted earnings per share.

Everything's relative, so our folks in Asia Pacific, while that part of the world is still growing faster than the rest of the world relative to historic standards, it's not as exciting. So I would say that they're feeling solid, but there's not the same enthusiasm about the relative movement in the market as there is in EMEA. And of course, the leasing, in general, is moving solid, not spectacular in Asia Pacific. Capital markets, a lot of capital wants to go there. There's a challenge around lack of product in some markets. So I think there's not a feeling of being threatened by the macro circumstances there. But on a relative basis, EMEA probably has a little more momentum now than Asia Pacific."

It reduced some of the fees off the base business, and then that 17% swing resulted in us marking the market our co-investments, which was not immaterial with about $60 million or so of co-investments in that business. So the combination of those 3, I would say, was somewhat of an anomalistic impact. FX also hit the businesses.

CBRE's excellent start to 2015 extended into the second quarter. Our business exhibited broad strength around the world, and we continue to execute our strategy. And our people create real competitive advantag",357,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. CBRE's excellent start to 2015 extended into the second quarter. Our business exhibited broad strength around the world, and we continue to execute our strategy. And our people create real competitive advantages for our clients. We were pleased to, once again, produce double-digit growth rates on the top and bottom lines. Our growth was especially impressive coming at a time when foreign currency exchange rates worked against us significantly.
In local currency, our increases of 19% in revenue and 22% in normalized EBITDA are among our best on record. Adjusted earnings per share, while up strongly at 17%, would've increased by more than 30% but for the currency effects. Our regional services businesses, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific, drove our strong performance during the quarter.
We continue to invest prudently in recruiting, M&A, platform enhancements and strategic initiatives to ensure that we are always providing best-in-class service for our clients and driving profitable growth for our business. The benefits of these efforts were very clear in the second quarter. Each of our 3 regions turned in exceptional results with high teens or better revenue growth in local currency, positive operating leverage and strong margins.
While achieving robust growth and remaining riveted on client service, we continued our progress toward completing the acquisition of the Global WorkPlace Solutions business from Johnson Controls. We remain on course to complete this transaction later this quarter or early next quarter, and are very enthusiastic about the opportunities it will afford us to deepen our relationships with many of the world's largest corporations.
A final highlight of the quarter was CBRE's performance in the Barron's 500 ranking published in May. Barron's uses detailed analytics to evaluate the financial performance of the 500 largest U.S.-based corporations. We are extremely pleased to be #2 on this prestigious ranking this year, up from #7 last year. This is a great testament to the hard work our people are doing everyday to create value for our clients and our shareholders.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim, who will describe our second quarter performance in greater detail."

As Bob indicated, our Q2 results reflect sustained underlying momentum in our business. We are in a very good financial position with market-leading scale, strong margins, robust cash flow and a flexible investment-",1264,"Thank you, Bob. Please turn to Slide 5. As Bob indicated, our Q2 results reflect sustained underlying momentum in our business. We are in a very good financial position with market-leading scale, strong margins, robust cash flow and a flexible investment-grade balance sheet. Reflecting this, Standard & Poor's recently raised our investment-grade rating to BBB from BBB minus.
Revenue and earnings achieved strong double-digit growth, even after adverse foreign currency movement. Gross revenue and fee revenue both rose 12% or 19% in local currency. Normalized EBITDA increased 16% or 22% in local currency to $304 million.
We achieved a 17.1% normalized EBITDA margin on fee revenue, up 60 basis points from Q2 2014. Adjusted earnings per share improved 17% to $0.42 for the quarter after a $0.05 negative impact from adverse foreign currency movement. Adjusted earnings per share would've improved 31% without the effects of foreign currency.
Please turn to Slide 6 for a review of the performance of our major global lines of business in Q2. As a reminder, all percentage increases are in local currency unless noted otherwise. We achieved outstanding growth in our capital markets business. Property sales revenue surged 32% with growth in the vast majority of countries worldwide. Mortgage services revenue growth exceeded 40% for the second quarter in a row. Mortgage servicing rights on loan activity associated with the U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises, or GSEs, continue to grow rapidly with EBITDA up $14 million over last year's Q2. As we indicated last quarter, GSE activity is expected to moderate in the second half of the year due to regulatory caps.
Global Corporate Services, our occupier outsourcing business, was particularly strong overseas as clients increasingly require globally integrated solutions. Excluding the transaction revenues generated by this business, we are accounting -- which are accounted for in leasing and sales revenues, Global Corporate Services achieved a 15% increase in fee revenue.
Asset Services also showed robust growth around the world, with fee revenue up 24%. Property leasing revenue jumped 15%, as our focus on market share gains continued to pay dividends. Evaluation business line had a very strong quarter, with revenue up 35%. Every region exhibited a double-digit growth even before accounting for acquisitions completed in the second half of last year.
Revenue fell in Global Investment Management, in part due to minimal carried interest and incentive fees in this year's Q2. Overall, contractual fee revenue plus leasing, which is largely recurring, totaled 68% of total fee revenue. Property sales accounted for 23% of total fee revenue.
Please turn to Slide #7, where we will review Q2 results for our 3 regional business services segments starting with the Americas. The Americas, again, displayed strength across the board as overall fee revenue increased 19% to $1.06 billion. Every business line in the region produced double-digit revenue growth for the fourth quarter in a row. Once again, capital markets turned in a very strong performance. Property sales rose 25% with major contributions from the U.S. and Mexico, while mortgage services improved 44%. We increased our market share in the U.S. investment sales and held the #1 position at midyear according to RCA. 
Leasing revenue grew at a double-digit clip for the eighth consecutive quarter. This reflects both improved productivity from our current brokers as well as contributions from new producers for migrating to CBRE at an impressive rate. Revenue for the quarter was up 11%. Combined fee revenue from Global Corporate Services and Asset Services improved 11%.
Please turn to Slide 8 regarding EMEA. EMEA's performance rebounded significantly, following a sluggish start to 2015. Fee revenue growth was robust across every service line and increased 33% overall to $409 million. Property sales revenue surged 62%. United Kingdom showed exceptionally strong growth with France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden also making notable gains. France recovered from a relatively low base in Q2 last year and remains a challenging macro environment. 
For the region, our growth markedly exceeded the estimated 19% volume growth recorded for the market as a whole. Growth in leasing was exceptional. Big gains in Germany, the United Kingdom and other countries resulted in a 33% increase in leasing revenue. Year-to-date, leasing is up 14%. Combined fee revenue from Global Corporate Services and Asset Services also achieved very strong growth, improving 25%. The United Kingdom accounted for the lion's share of this growth, with notable contributions from France, Germany and Spain.
Please turn to Slide 9, regarding Asia Pacific. This region achieved 17% growth in fee revenue to $200 million. Property sales revenue increased 24%, led by strong growth in Australia and Greater China. This was a notable improvement from a relatively soft Q1. 
Leasing revenue also rose solidly, increasing by 12%. Australia, India and Singapore all posted healthy gains. Combined fee revenue from Global Corporate Services and Asset Services rose 19%. China and India were key growth drivers as outsourcing continues to gain a firmer foothold in these emerging economies.
Please turn to Slide #10 regarding our occupier outsourcing business. Financial results for this business line, which we call Global Corporate Services, are reported within the 3 regional services segments. Global Corporate Services grew 15%, continuing its long-term record of solid secular growth, as we focus on extending our leadership position with deeper and broader services for our clients. The payoff can be seen in a growing roster of clients and the expansion of existing relationships. In Q2, we signed 83 total outsourcing contracts, one of our most productive quarters and nearly 40% entailed expanding services or geographies for existing customers. 
Mission critical facilities have provided further ground for growth since we added the Norland capabilities 18 months ago. To illustrate, we were awarded data center management contracts with 2 Fortune 50 companies and the global financial information company during the quarter. Adding Global Workplace Solutions' 16,000 people in more than 50 countries later this year will further broaden our reach and deepen our expertise.
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Revenue and normalized EBITDA in Global Investment Management decline in Q2 versus the prior year. This was driven disproportionately by minimal carried interest and incentive payments as well as the impact of the weak market in the quarter. The MSCI U.S. REIT Index declined 10% during Q2 2015 as compared to a 7% increase in the index during the prior year second quarter. As a result, we did not achieve anticipated incentive fees in our listed securities business, and we're impacted by the mark-to-market of our related co-investments. 
Overall, combined incentive fees and carried interests are expected to be more weighted at the second half of this year. We anticipate being on track with our Investment Management and Development Services combined guidance for the full year. Capital raise -- capital raising continued at a brisk pace. We raised $2.2 billion in the second quarter and $7.7 billion over trailing 4 quarters. The pipeline remains strong as we continue to produce solid returns for investors. 
Assets Under Management of $88.4 billion were up $2.1 billion over prior year Q2 in local currency, but down $4.4 billion when converted into U.S. dollars.
Please turn to Slide 12 regarding our Development Services segment. You will recall, we expected property sales and earnings in this business to be weighted to the second half of the year. Development projects in process totaled $6 billion, up $500 million over Q1 2015 and the pipeline totaled $3.7 billion, up over $100 million over Q1 2015.
Please turn to Slide 13, as I turn the call back over to Bob for closing remarks."

At the midpoint of 2015, CBRE is on course for another year of very strong financial performance. We are intensely focused on executing our strategy to sustain long-term secular growth and further extend our position as the industry leader.
During the first half of 2015, we completed 3 infill acquisitions that enhanced our service offering, and we continued to lay the groundwork for the smooth integration of Global WorkPlace Solutions later this year. This business is perfectly aligned with our strategy of helping large global clients to meet their objectives under long-term contractual relationships.
We also continued to selectively upgrade and expand our talent base. Brokerage recruiting is running at a brisk pace again this year. We are capitalizing on the growing recognition that CBRE affords the industry's top professionals the opportunity to better serve their clients and build their careers.
Finally, as Jim reviewed earlier, we are in a very strong position financially. As we start the second half, we are positive on our outlook for the remainder of 2015 and believe our full year performance is likely to be toward the upper end of our guidance range of $1.90 to $1.95 adjusted earnings per share.

So you never know where surprises might come from.

So I would say that they're feeling solid, but there's not the same enthusiasm about the relative movement in the market as there is in EMEA. And of course, the leasing, in general, is moving solid, not spectacular in Asia Pacific. Capital markets, a lot of capital wants to go there. There's a challenge around lack of product in some markets. So I think there's not a feeling of being threatened by the macro circumstances there.

And then that 17% swing resulted in us mark-to-market our co-investments, which was not immaterial with about $60 million or so of co-investments in that business. So the combination of those 3, I would say, was somewhat of an anomalistic impact. FX also hit the businesses.

CBRE's excellent start to 2015 extended into the second quarter. Our business exhibited broad strength around the world, and we continue to execute our strategy. And our people create real competitive advantag",357,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. CBRE's excellent start to 2015 extended into the second quarter. Our business exhibited broad strength around the world, and we continue to execute our strategy. And our people create real competitive advantages for our clients. We were pleased to, once again, produce double-digit growth rates on the top and bottom lines. Our growth was especially impressive coming at a time when foreign currency exchange rates worked against us significantly.
In local currency, our increases of 19% in revenue and 22% in normalized EBITDA are among our best on record. Adjusted earnings per share, while up strongly at 17%, would've increased by more than 30% but for the currency effects. Our regional services businesses, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific, drove our strong performance during the quarter.
We continue to invest prudently in recruiting, M&A, platform enhancements and strategic initiatives to ensure that we are always providing best-in-class service for our clients and driving profitable growth for our business. The benefits of these efforts were very clear in the second quarter. Each of our 3 regions turned in exceptional results with high teens or better revenue growth in local currency, positive operating leverage and strong margins.
While achieving robust growth and remaining riveted on client service, we continued our progress toward completing the acquisition of the Global WorkPlace Solutions business from Johnson Controls. We remain on course to complete this transaction later this quarter or early next quarter, and are very enthusiastic about the opportunities it will afford us to deepen our relationships with many of the world's largest corporations.
A final highlight of the quarter was CBRE's performance in the Barron's 500 ranking published in May. Barron's uses detailed analytics to evaluate the financial performance of the 500 largest U.S.-based corporations. We are extremely pleased to be #2 on this prestigious ranking this year, up from #7 last year. This is a great testament to the hard work our people are doing everyday to create value for our clients and our shareholders.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim, who will describe our second quarter performance in greater detail."

As Bob indicated, our Q2 results reflect sustained underlying momentum in our business. We are in a very good financial position with market-leading scale, strong margins, robust cash flow and a flexible investment-",1267,"Thank you, Bob. Please turn to Slide 5. As Bob indicated, our Q2 results reflect sustained underlying momentum in our business. We are in a very good financial position with market-leading scale, strong margins, robust cash flow and a flexible investment-grade balance sheet. Reflecting this, Standard & Poor's recently raised our investment-grade rating to BBB from BBB minus.
Revenue and earnings achieved strong double-digit growth, even after adverse foreign currency movement. Gross revenue and fee revenue both rose 12% or 19% in local currency. Normalized EBITDA increased 16% or 22% in local currency to $304 million.
We achieved a 17.1% normalized EBITDA margin on fee revenue, up 60 basis points from Q2 2014. Adjusted earnings per share improved 17% to $0.42 for the quarter after a $0.05 negative impact from adverse foreign currency movement. Adjusted earnings per share would've improved 31% without the effects of foreign currency.
Please turn to Slide 6 for a review of the performance of our major global lines of business in Q2. As a reminder, all percentage increases are in local currency unless noted otherwise. We achieved outstanding growth in our capital markets business. Property sales revenue surged 32% with growth in the vast majority of countries worldwide. Mortgage services revenue growth exceeded 40% for the second quarter in a row. Mortgage servicing rights on loan activity associated with the U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises, or GSEs, continue to grow rapidly with EBITDA up $14 million over last year's Q2. As we indicated last quarter, GSE activity is expected to moderate in the second half of the year due to regulatory caps.
Global Corporate Services, our occupier outsourcing business, was particularly strong overseas as clients increasingly require globally integrated solutions. Excluding the transaction revenues generated by this business, we are accounting -- which are accounted for in leasing and sales revenues, Global Corporate Services achieved a 15% increase in fee revenue.
Asset Services also showed robust growth around the world, with fee revenue up 24%. Property leasing revenue jumped 15%, as our focus on market share gains continued to pay dividends. The valuation business line had a very strong quarter, with revenue up 35%. Every region exhibited a double-digit growth even before accounting for acquisitions completed in the second half of last year.
Revenue fell in Global Investment Management, in part due to minimal carried interest and incentive fees in this year's Q2. Overall, contractual fee revenue plus leasing, which is largely recurring, totaled 68% of total fee revenue. Property sales accounted for 23% of total fee revenue.
Please turn to Slide #7, where we will review Q2 results for our 3 regional business services segments starting with the Americas. The Americas, again, displayed strength across the board as overall fee revenue increased 19% to $1.06 billion. Every business line in the region produced double-digit revenue growth for the fourth quarter in a row. Once again, capital markets turned in a very strong performance. Property sales rose 25% with major contributions from the U.S. and Mexico, while mortgage services improved 44%. We increased our market share in the U.S. investment sales and held the #1 position at midyear according to RCA. 
Leasing revenue grew at a double-digit clip for the eighth consecutive quarter. This reflects both improved productivity from our current brokers as well as contributions from new producers who are migrating to CBRE at an impressive rate. Revenue for the quarter was up 11%. Combined fee revenue from Global Corporate Services and Asset Services improved 11%.
Please turn to Slide 8 regarding EMEA. EMEA's performance rebounded significantly, following a sluggish start to 2015. Fee revenue growth was robust across every service line and increased 33% overall to $409 million. Property sales revenue surged 62%. The United Kingdom showed exceptionally strong growth with France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden also making notable gains. France recovered from a relatively low base in Q2 last year and remains a challenging macro environment. 
For the region, our growth markedly exceeded the estimated 19% volume growth recorded for the market as a whole. Growth in leasing was exceptional. Big gains in Germany, the United Kingdom and other countries resulted in a 33% increase in leasing revenue. Year-to-date, leasing is up 14%. Combined fee revenue from Global Corporate Services and Asset Services also achieved very strong growth, improving 25%. The United Kingdom accounted for the lion's share of this growth, with notable contributions from France, Germany and Spain.
Please turn to Slide 9, regarding Asia Pacific. This region achieved 17% growth in fee revenue to $200 million. Property sales revenue increased 24%, led by strong growth in Australia and Greater China. This was a notable improvement from a relatively soft Q1. 
Leasing revenue also rose solidly, increasing by 12%. Australia, India and Singapore all posted healthy gains. Combined fee revenue from Global Corporate Services and Asset Services rose 19%. China and India were key growth drivers as outsourcing continues to gain a firmer foothold in these emerging economies.
Please turn to Slide #10 regarding our occupier outsourcing business. Financial results for this business line, which we call Global Corporate Services, are reported within the 3 regional services segments. Global Corporate Services grew 15%, continuing its long-term record of solid secular growth, as we focus on extending our leadership position with deeper and broader services for our clients. The payoff can be seen in a growing roster of clients and the expansion of existing relationships. In Q2, we signed 83 total outsourcing contracts, one of our most productive quarters and nearly 40% entailed expanding services or geographies for existing customers. 
Mission critical facilities have provided fertile ground for growth since we added the Norland capabilities 18 months ago. To illustrate, we were awarded data center management contracts with 2 Fortune 50 companies and a global financial information company during the quarter. Adding Global Workplace Solutions' 16,000 people in more than 50 countries later this year will further broaden our reach and deepen our expertise.
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Revenue and normalized EBITDA in Global Investment Management declined in Q2 versus the prior year. This was driven disproportionately by minimal carried interest and incentive payments as well as the impact of the weak market in the quarter. The MSCI U.S. REIT Index declined 10% during Q2 2015 as compared to a 7% increase in the index during the prior year second quarter. As a result, we did not achieve anticipated incentive fees in our listed securities business, and we're impacted by the mark-to-market of our related co-investments. 
Overall, combined incentive fees and carried interests are expected to be more weighted at the second half of this year. We anticipate being on track with our Investment Management and Development Services combined guidance for the full year. Capital raise -- capital raising continued at a brisk pace. We raised $2.2 billion in the second quarter and $7.7 billion over trailing 4 quarters. The pipeline remains strong as we continue to produce solid returns for investors. 
Assets Under Management of $88.4 billion were up $2.1 billion over prior year Q2 in local currency, but down $4.4 billion when converted into U.S. dollars.
Please turn to Slide 12 regarding our Development Services segment. You will recall, we expected property sales and earnings in this business to be weighted to the second half of the year. Development projects in process totaled $6 billion, up $500 million over Q1 2015 and the pipeline totaled $3.7 billion, up over $100 million over Q1 2015.
Please turn to Slide 13, as I turn the call back over to Bob for closing remarks."

At the midpoint of 2015, CBRE is on course for another year of very strong financial performance. We are intensely focused on executing our strategy to sustain long-term secular growth and further extend our position as the industry leader.
During the first half of 2015, we completed 3 infill acquisitions that enhanced our service offering, and we continued to lay the groundwork for the smooth integration of Global WorkPlace Solutions later this year. This business is perfectly aligned with our strategy of helping large global clients to meet their objectives under long-term contractual relationships.
We also continued to selectively upgrade and expand our talent base. Brokerage recruiting is running at a brisk pace again this year. We are capitalizing on the growing recognition that CBRE affords the industry's top professionals the opportunity to better serve their clients and build their careers.
Finally, as Jim reviewed earlier, we are in a very strong position financially.

So that compare -- and that compare hits us in a few different places. It resulted in us not achieving some incentives that we had anticipated. It reduced some of the fees off the base business. And then that 17% swing resulted in us marking-to-market our co-investments, which was not immaterial. We have about $60 million or so of co-investments in that business. So the combination of those 3, I would say, was somewhat of an anomalistic impact. FX also hit the business as it's pretty heavily weighted to Europe.

We are seeing more wins in the, what I would call, technical area which makes the GWS acquisition even more appealing for us. We're seeing -- on the transaction services side of the business, we're seeing wins where they're demanding that we do things that we haven't been able to do historically and again, our GCS team and our brokerage team have worked together to put some capabilities in place to serve that requirement. So all of that is positive. And by the way, we really are seeing a lot of -- as Jim commented in the numbers, a high percentage of the wins we're having are add-on services or expansions of existing contracts. So the business is just getting bigger in part and all the things you see in a bigger business, more diversed types of services and contracts more global, all of that stuff is happening for us.

CBRE's excellent start to 2015 extended into the second quarter. Our business exhibited broad strength around the world, and we continue to execute our strategy. And our people create real competitive advantag",358,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. CBRE's excellent start to 2015 extended into the second quarter. Our business exhibited broad strength around the world, and we continue to execute our strategy. And our people create real competitive advantages for our clients. We were pleased to, once again, produce double-digit growth rates on the top and bottom lines. Our growth was especially impressive coming at a time when foreign currency exchange rates worked against us significantly.
In local currency, our increases of 19% in revenue and 22% in normalized EBITDA are among our best on record. Adjusted earnings per share, while up strongly at 17%, would've increased by more than 30% but for the currency effects. Our regional services businesses, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific, drove our strong performance during the quarter.
We continue to invest prudently in recruiting, M&A, platform enhancements and strategic initiatives to ensure that we are always providing best-in-class service for our clients and driving profitable growth for our business. The benefits of these efforts were very clear in the second quarter. Each of our 3 regions turned in exceptional results with high teens or better revenue growth in local currency, positive operating leverage and strong margins.
While achieving robust growth and remaining riveted on client service, we continued our progress toward completing the acquisition of the Global WorkPlace Solutions business from Johnson Controls. We remain on course to complete this transaction later this quarter or early next quarter, and are very enthusiastic about the opportunities it will afford us to deepen our relationships with many of the world's largest corporations.
A final highlight of the quarter was CBRE's performance in the Barron's 500 ranking published in May. Barron's uses detailed analytics to evaluate the financial performance of the 500 largest U.S.-based corporations. We are extremely pleased to be #2 on this prestigious ranking this year, up from #7 last year. This is a great testament to the hard work our people are doing every day to create value for our clients and our shareholders.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim, who will describe our second quarter performance in greater detail."

As Bob indicated, our Q2 results reflect sustained underlying momentum in our business. We are in a very good financial position with market-leading scale, strong margins, robust cash flow and a flexible investment-",1266,"Thank you, Bob. Please turn to Slide 5. As Bob indicated, our Q2 results reflect sustained underlying momentum in our business. We are in a very good financial position with market-leading scale, strong margins, robust cash flow and a flexible investment-grade balance sheet. Reflecting this, Standard & Poor's recently raised our investment-grade rating to BBB from BBB-.
Revenue and earnings achieved strong double-digit growth, even after adverse foreign currency movement. Gross revenue and fee revenue both rose 12% or 19% in local currency. Normalized EBITDA increased 16% or 22% in local currency to $304 million.
We achieved a 17.1% normalized EBITDA margin on fee revenue, up 60 basis points from Q2 2014. Adjusted earnings per share improved 17% to $0.42 for the quarter after a $0.05 negative impact from adverse foreign currency movement. Adjusted earnings per share would've improved 31% without the effects of foreign currency.
Please turn to Slide 6 for a review of the performance of our major global lines of business in Q2. As a reminder, all percentage increases are in local currency unless noted otherwise. We achieved outstanding growth in our capital markets business. Property sales revenue surged 32% with growth in the vast majority of countries worldwide. Mortgage services revenue growth exceeded 40% for the second quarter in a row. Mortgage servicing rights on loan activity associated with the U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises, or GSEs, continue to grow rapidly with EBITDA up $14 million over last year's Q2. As we indicated last quarter, GSE activity is expected to moderate in the second half of the year due to regulatory caps.
Global Corporate Services, our occupier outsourcing business, was particularly strong overseas as clients increasingly require globally integrated solutions. Excluding the transaction revenues generated by this business, we are accounting -- which are accounted for in leasing and sales revenues, Global Corporate Services achieved a 15% increase in fee revenue.
Asset Services also showed robust growth around the world, with fee revenue up 24%. Property leasing revenue jumped 15%, as our focus on market share gains continued to pay dividends. The valuation business line had a very strong quarter, with revenue up 35%. Every region exhibited a double-digit growth even before accounting for acquisitions completed in the second half of last year.
Revenue fell in Global Investment Management, in part due to minimal carried interest and incentive fees in this year's Q2. Overall, contractual fee revenue plus leasing, which is largely recurring, totaled 68% of total fee revenue. Property sales accounted for 23% of total fee revenue.
Please turn to Slide #7, where we will review Q2 results for our 3 regional business services segments starting with the Americas. The Americas, again, displayed strength across the board as overall fee revenue increased 19% to $1.06 billion. Every business line in the region produced double-digit revenue growth for the fourth quarter in a row. Once again, capital markets turned in a very strong performance. Property sales rose 25% with major contributions from the U.S. and Mexico, while mortgage services improved 44%. We increased our market share in the U.S. investment sales and held the #1 position at midyear according to RCA. 
Leasing revenue grew at a double-digit clip for the eighth consecutive quarter. This reflects both improved productivity from our current brokers as well as contributions from new producers who are migrating to CBRE at an impressive rate. Revenue for the quarter was up 11%. Combined fee revenue from Global Corporate Services and Asset Services improved 11%.
Please turn to Slide 8 regarding EMEA. EMEA's performance rebounded significantly, following a sluggish start to 2015. Fee revenue growth was robust across every service line and increased 33% overall to $409 million. Property sales revenue surged 62%. The United Kingdom showed exceptionally strong growth with France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden also making notable gains. France recovered from a relatively low base in Q2 last year and remains a challenging macro environment. 
For the region, our growth markedly exceeded the estimated 19% volume growth recorded for the market as a whole. Growth in leasing was exceptional. Big gains in Germany, the United Kingdom and other countries resulted in a 33% increase in leasing revenue. Year-to-date, leasing is up 14%. Combined fee revenue from Global Corporate Services and Asset Services also achieved very strong growth, improving 25%. The United Kingdom accounted for the lion's share of this growth, with notable contributions from France, Germany and Spain.
Please turn to Slide 9, regarding Asia Pacific. This region achieved 17% growth in fee revenue to $200 million. Property sales revenue increased 24%, led by strong growth in Australia and Greater China. This was a notable improvement from a relatively soft Q1. 
Leasing revenue also rose solidly, increasing by 12%. Australia, India and Singapore all posted healthy gains. Combined fee revenue from Global Corporate Services and Asset Services rose 19%. China and India were key growth drivers as outsourcing continues to gain a firmer foothold in these emerging economies.
Please turn to Slide #10 regarding our occupier outsourcing business. Financial results for this business line, which we call Global Corporate Services, are reported within the 3 regional services segments. Global Corporate Services grew 15%, continuing its long-term record of solid secular growth, as we focus on extending our leadership position with deeper and broader services for our clients. The payoff can be seen in a growing roster of clients and the expansion of existing relationships. In Q2, we signed 83 total outsourcing contracts, one of our most productive quarters and nearly 40% entailed expanding services or geographies for existing customers. 
Mission critical facilities have provided fertile ground for growth since we added the Norland capabilities 18 months ago. To illustrate, we were awarded data center management contracts with 2 Fortune 50 companies and a global financial information company during the quarter. Adding Global Workplace Solutions' 16,000 people in more than 50 countries later this year will further broaden our reach and deepen our expertise.
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Revenue and normalized EBITDA in Global Investment Management declined in Q2 versus the prior year. This was driven disproportionately by minimal carried interest and incentive payments as well as the impact of the REIT market in the quarter. The MSCI U.S. REIT Index declined 10% during Q2 2015 as compared to a 7% increase in the index during the prior year second quarter. As a result, we did not achieve anticipated incentive fees in our listed securities business, and we're impacted by the mark-to-market of our related co-investments. 
Overall, combined incentive fees and carried interests are expected to be more weighted at the second half of this year. We anticipate being on track with our Investment Management and Development Services combined guidance for the full year. Capital raise -- capital raising continued at a brisk pace. We raised $2.2 billion in the second quarter and $7.7 billion over trailing 4 quarters. The pipeline remains strong as we continue to produce solid returns for investors. 
Assets Under Management of $88.4 billion were up $2.1 billion over prior year Q2 in local currency, but down $4.4 billion when converted into U.S. dollars.
Please turn to Slide 12 regarding our Development Services segment. You will recall, we expected property sales and earnings in this business to be weighted to the second half of the year. Development projects in process totaled $6 billion, up $500 million over Q1 2015 and the pipeline totaled $3.7 billion, up over $100 million over Q1 2015.
Please turn to Slide 13, as I turn the call back over to Bob for closing remarks."

During the first half of 2015, we completed 3 infill acquisitions that enhanced our service offering, and we continued to lay the groundwork for the smooth integration of Global WorkPlace Solutions later this year. This business is perfectly aligned with our strategy of helping large global clients to meet their objectives under long-term contractual relationships.
We also continued to selectively upgrade and expand our talent base. Brokerage recruiting is running at a brisk pace again this year. We are capitalizing on the growing recognition that CBRE affords the industry's top professionals the opportunity to better serve their clients and build their careers.
Finally, as Jim reviewed earlier, we are in a very strong position financially.

So that compare -- and that compare hits us in a few different places. It resulted in us not achieving some incentives that we had anticipated. It reduced some of the fees off the base business. And then that 17% swing resulted in us marking-to-market our co-investments, which was not immaterial. We have about $60 million or so of co-investments in that business. So the combination of those 3, I would say, was somewhat of an anomalistic impact. FX also hit the business as it's pretty heavily weighted to Europe.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. The third quarter of 2015 was an eventful period for CBRE. As you saw in our press release, we posted excellent results with strong top and bottom line growth around the world, highlighted by a 28% increase in adjusted earnings per share.
We also moved decisively to fortify our market-leading occupier outsourcing business with the acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions on September 1. This is our largest acquisition in nearly a decade and one of the most compelling ever completed in our sector. The combination creates a platform unlike anything that has previously existed in our industry with highly complementary product offerings and common cultures around innovation and client service. It broadens our value proposition, creates true global scale, deepen our relationships with prominent global corporations and enriches our talent pool.
Our last 3 large strategic acquisitions are recurring revenue businesses that operate under contracts that are typically 5 years or longer. These acquisitions have helped to transform CBRE into a more resilient business. We now have a dramatically more powerful integrated service offering, while maintaining our core focus on commercial real estate services.
We also continue to make gains through investments in recruiting, training, technology, branding and research, all positioned to help us deliver great outcomes for clients and to drive growth. We saw the payoff from these investments across CBRE in the third quarter. Notably, our services business, comprised of the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions, again posted significant revenue in normalized EBITDA growth with solid margin expansion. Our Investment Management business also performed well.
Now Jim will provide you with more specific insight into our performance."

I will begin with an update on our overall performance and the expected contributions from our recent acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions.Please turn to Slide 5. In Q3, our business continued to exhibit excellent broad-based moment",1336,"Thank you, Bob. I will begin with an update on our overall performance and the expected contributions from our recent acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions.
Please turn to Slide 5. In Q3, our business continued to exhibit excellent broad-based momentum. Revenue and earnings growth for the quarter was very strong, and local currency gross revenue increased to 26%, while fee revenue rose 21%. Without the 1-month contribution from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business, gross and fee revenue were both up 16% in local currency. Normalized EBITDA totaled $345 million, an 18% improvement from last year's Q3, or a 24% improvement in local currency. Profitability was strong with a 17.8% normalized EBITDA margin on fee revenue, up approximately 60 basis points from Q3 2014. Adjusted earnings per share increased 28% to $0.51 for the quarter.
Please turn to Slide 6 for an update on the expected financial contributions from the newly acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. This acquisition greatly enhanced our ability to serve leading corporations around the world. We funded about 1/3 of the purchase price, price with cash and temporary revolver borrowings and 2/3 with attractively priced 5- and 7-year bank debt and 10-year bonds. Both Moody's and Standard & Poor's affirmed our investment-grade credit rating.
The integration of Global Workplace Solutions with our existing occupier outsourcing business is off to a great start. Morale is very high. Our organization structure for senior leadership, line of business leaders and geographic leadership is in place. Feedback from clients, their consultants and our shareholders has been overwhelmingly positive as the rationale for the acquisition and the value proposition is clear.
We have identified additional cost synergies and now expect run rate annual synergies of approximately $50 million, up from our initial estimate of $35 million in March 2015. We anticipate achieving approximately $30 million of the synergy in 2016, with the remaining run rate savings largely realized by year-end 2017.
When we announced the acquisition in March, we indicated expected material accretion to our adjusted 2015 EPS with a mid-single-digit percentage increase. We are now raising our estimate to high single-digit percentage increase accretion in 2016.
We closed the acquisition in the early part of our expected time frame and raised financing with minimal interest expense in advance of closing. In light of this, we now expect the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business to contribute $0.03 to $0.04 to adjusted earnings per share for the last 4 months of 2015.
Calendar year Q4 has typically been a seasonally slower period for the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business due to its fiscal year previously ending September 30. As a result, accretion from the last 4 months of 2015 is not indicative of the higher expected run rate contribution in 2016.
Please turn to Slide 7 for a review of the performance of our major global lines of business in Q3. As a reminder, I am referencing percentage increases in local currency, unless noted otherwise. For the company as a whole, contractual fee revenue plus leasing, which is largely recurring, totaled 68% of total fee revenue. Occupier outsourcing showed strong growth in all 3 regions, excluding transaction revenue generated by this business, which is accounted for in leasing and sales revenue. Occupier outsourcing achieved a 53% increase in fee revenue. Excluding the contribution from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business, fee revenue rose 14%.
Asset Services growth was moderate with fee revenue up 4%. Investment Management performed well. Fee revenue increased 19%, fueled by a higher carried interest tied to property dispositions. Valuation again grew nicely with global fee revenue up 14%. We benefited from higher volumes of appraisal and consulting work, which stem in part from acquisitions we made in 2014.
Property leasing revenue again rose by double digits with 12% growth globally led by Europe and Asia Pacific. The growth rate in the U.S. slowed modestly but remained strong at 9%. We are seeing less available -- availability in Class A office space in a few gateway markets with new development accelerating, but generally still lagging demand. This may extend the time it takes to complete certain larger lease transactions. However, we continue to reap the benefits of a very strong recruiting activity, higher productivity from our existing brokerage teams and modest rent growth.
Our capital markets business continue to perform exceptionally well amid gains in market share and strong capital flows into real estate. Property sales revenue rose 19% with every region producing markedly higher activity.
In the U.S., we logged impressive market share gains as confirmed by our CA at a time when the overall market activity was flat for the quarter. We continue to see activity broadening in the secondary markets in the U.S. and EMEA.  In Asia Pacific, Australia and Hong Kong accounted for the lion's share of the increase.
Mortgage services also remained robust with revenue up 33%. Even though as expected, loan volume with the U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises leveled off due to the regulatory caps. Banks, life companies and other debt capital sources stepped up their lending.
Please turn to Slide 8, where we will review Q3 results for our 3 regional services segments, all in local currency.
Fee revenue increased 18% in the Americas. In EMEA, fee revenue increased 29%. We saw healthy gains across the region, including France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. In Asia Pacific, fee revenue rose 22% with growth led by Australia, Greater China and India. Fee revenue growth, without the contribution from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business, was 14% in the Americas, 19% in EMEA and 17% in Asia Pacific. Normalized EBITDA increased 18% in the Americas, 70% in EMEA and 54% in Asia Pacific.
Please turn to Slide 9, regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which is reported within the 3 regional services segments. This business line, which we previously called Global Corporate Services, adopted the Global Workplace Solution name on September 1. This move reflects Global Workplace Solutions' high-brand value the management sector and the increasingly diverse workspaces in which we are serving clients, including hospitals, data centers, labs and manufacturing plants. Outsourcing continues to gain wider appeal, and existing customers are taking advantage of our deeper and broader platform. In Q3, we set a new quarterly record for the number of expansions of existing contractual relationships. We also signed 9 contracts with new or existing health care clients, reflecting the compelling and growing opportunity for CBRE in this sector. These numbers did not include contracts from the newly acquired Global Workplace Solutions business, which we will begin to reflect in our contract reporting in 2016.
Please turn to Slide 10, regarding our Global Investment Management segment. This business performed well with $19 million of carried interest tied to significant property disposition activity. Capital raising totaled $1.8 billion in Q3 and $7 billion over the trailing 4 quarters. We continue to attract significant equity commitments based on the solid performance of our investment programs within 75% of our AUM as outperformed its long-term industry benchmark.
At the end of Q3, Assets Under Management at $86 billion were up $1.6 billion over prior year Q3 in local currency, but down $2.6 billion when converted into U.S. dollars.
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding our Development Services segment. Pro forma revenue, which includes equity, earnings and gains on real estate sales and EBITDA, both declined reflecting fewer large property dispositions than in last year's highly active Q3 period. However, activity is very strong, and we expect most of this year's earnings to be achieved in Q4 from several large transactions. We now anticipate that our combined Investment Management and Development Services businesses for 2015 will moderately exceed 2014 performance. Development projects in process totaled $6.7 billion, up $1.3 billion since the end of 2014. The pipeline totaled $4 billion, flat with year-end 2014 as projects have been converted from pipeline to in-process.
Now please turn to Slide 12 as I turn the call back over to Bob for closing remarks."

As we enter Q4, 2015 is clearly emerging as another exceptional year for CBRE. The actions we have taken to upgrade our talent base, enhance our service offering, materially strengthen our operating platform, particularly around data and technology and fortify our financial position are yielding strong results for our clients and for our shareholders. We are mindful of the challenges to the global economy. However, in light of our performance through the third quarter and our strategic and financial momentum, we're raising our full year 2015 guidance for adjusted EPS by $0.10 to the $2 to $2.05 range. This new guidance implies 20% year-on-year growth in adjusted earnings per share at the midpoint of the range.
With that, operator, we'll go to questions."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. The third quarter of 2015 was an eventful period for CBRE. As you saw in our press release, we posted excellent results with strong top and bottom line growth around the world, highlighted by a 28% increase in adjusted earnings per share.
We also moved decisively to fortify our market-leading occupier outsourcing business with the acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions on September 1. This is our largest acquisition in nearly a decade and one of the most compelling ever completed in our sector. The combination creates a platform unlike anything that has previously existed in our industry with highly complementary product offerings and common cultures around innovation and client service. It broadens our value proposition, creates true global scale, deepens our relationships with prominent global corporations and enriches our talent pool.
Our last 3 large strategic acquisitions are recurring revenue businesses that operate under contracts that are typically 5 years or longer. These acquisitions have helped to transform CBRE into a more resilient business. We now have a dramatically more powerful integrated service offering, while maintaining our core focus on commercial real estate services.
We also continue to make gains through investments in recruiting, training, technology, branding and research, all positioned to help us deliver great outcomes for clients and to drive growth. We saw the payoff from these investments across CBRE in the third quarter. Notably, our services business, comprised of the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions, again posted significant revenue in normalized EBITDA growth with solid margin expansion. Our Investment Management business also performed well.
Now Jim will provide you with more specific insight into our performance."

I will begin with an update on our overall performance and the expected contributions from our recent acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions.Please turn to Slide 5. In Q3, our business continued to exhibit excellent broad-based moment",1338,"Thank you, Bob. I will begin with an update on our overall performance and the expected contributions from our recent acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions.
Please turn to Slide 5. In Q3, our business continued to exhibit excellent broad-based momentum. Revenue and earnings growth for the quarter was very strong. In local currency, gross revenue increased 26% while fee revenue rose 21%. Without the 1-month contribution from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business, gross and fee revenue were both up 16% in local currency. Normalized EBITDA totaled $345 million, an 18% improvement from last year's Q3, or a 24% improvement in local currency. Profitability was strong with a 17.8% normalized EBITDA margin on fee revenue, up approximately 60 basis points from Q3 2014. Adjusted earnings per share increased 28% to $0.51 for the quarter.
Please turn to Slide 6 for an update on the expected financial contributions from the newly acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. This acquisition greatly enhanced our ability to serve leading corporations around the world. We funded about 1/3 of the purchase price, price with cash and temporary revolver borrowings and 2/3 with attractively priced 5- and 7-year bank debt and 10-year bonds. Both Moody's and Standard & Poor's affirmed our investment-grade credit rating.
The integration of Global Workplace Solutions with our existing occupier outsourcing business is off to a great start. Morale is very high. Our organization structure for senior leadership, line of business leaders and geographic leadership is in place. Feedback from clients, their consultants and our shareholders has been overwhelmingly positive as the rationale for the acquisition and the value proposition is clear.
We have identified additional cost synergies and now expect run rate annual synergies of approximately $50 million, up from our initial estimate of $35 million in March 2015. We anticipate achieving approximately $30 million of the synergy in 2016, with the remaining run rate savings largely realized by year end 2017.
When we announced the acquisition in March, we indicated expected material accretion to our adjusted 2016 EPS with a mid-single-digit percentage increase. We are now raising our estimate to high single-digit percentage increase accretion in 2016.
We closed the acquisition in the early part of our expected time frame and raised financing with minimal interest expense in advance of closing. In light of this, we now expect the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business to contribute $0.03 to $0.04 to adjusted earnings per share for the last 4 months of 2015.
Calendar year Q4 has typically been a seasonally slower period for the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business due to its fiscal year previously ending September 30. As a result, accretion from the last 4 months of 2015 is not indicative of the higher expected run rate contribution in 2016.
Please turn to Slide 7 for a review of the performance of our major global lines of business in Q3. As a reminder, I am referencing percentage increases in local currency, unless noted otherwise. For the company as a whole, contractual fee revenue plus leasing, which is largely recurring, totaled 68% of total fee revenue. Occupier outsourcing showed strong growth in all 3 regions, excluding transaction revenue generated by this business, which is accounted for in leasing and sales revenue. Occupier outsourcing achieved a 53% increase in fee revenue. Excluding the contribution from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business, fee revenue rose 14%.
Asset Services growth was moderate with fee revenue up 4%. Investment Management performed well. Fee revenue increased 19%, fueled by a higher carried interest tied to property dispositions. Valuation again grew nicely with global fee revenue up 14%. We benefited from higher volumes of appraisal and consulting work, which stem in part from acquisitions we made in 2014.
Property leasing revenue again rose by double digits with 12% growth globally led by Europe and Asia Pacific. The growth rate in the U.S. slowed modestly but remained strong at 9%. We are seeing less available -- availability in Class A office space in a few gateway markets with new development accelerating, but generally still lagging demand. This may extend the time it takes to complete certain larger lease transactions. However, we continue to reap the benefits of a very strong recruiting activity, higher productivity from our existing brokerage teams and modest rent growth.
Our capital markets business continue to perform exceptionally well amid gains in market share and strong capital flows into real estate. Property sales revenue rose 19% with every region producing markedly higher activity.
In the U.S., we logged impressive market share gains as confirmed by our CA at a time when the overall market activity was flat for the quarter. We continue to see activity broadening in the secondary markets in the U.S. and EMEA. In Asia Pacific, Australia and Hong Kong accounted for the lion's share of the increase.
Mortgage services also remained robust with revenue up 33%. Even though as expected, loan volume with the U.S. government-sponsored Enterprises leveled off due to the regulatory caps. Banks, life companies and other debt capital sources stepped up their lending.
Please turn to Slide 8, where we will review Q3 results for our 3 regional services segments, all in local currency.
Fee revenue increased 18% in the Americas. In EMEA, fee revenue increased 29%. We saw healthy gains across the region, including France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. In Asia Pacific, fee revenue rose 22% with growth led by Australia, Greater China and India. Fee revenue growth, without the contribution from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business, was 14% in the Americas, 19% in EMEA and 17% in Asia Pacific. Normalized EBITDA increased 18% in the Americas, 70% in EMEA and 54% in Asia Pacific.
Please turn to Slide 9, regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which is reported within the 3 regional services segments. This business line, which we previously called Global Corporate Services, adopted the Global Workplace Solution name on September 1. This move reflects Global Workplace Solutions' high-brand value in the facility management sector and the increasingly diverse workspaces in which we are serving clients, including hospitals, data centers, labs and manufacturing plants. Outsourcing continues to gain wider appeal, and existing customers are taking advantage of our deeper and broader platform. In Q3, we set a new quarterly record for the number of expansions of existing contractual relationships. We also signed 9 contracts with new or existing health care clients, reflecting the compelling and growing opportunity for CBRE in this sector. These numbers did not include contracts from the newly acquired Global Workplace Solutions business, which we will begin to reflect in our contract reporting in 2016.
Please turn to Slide 10, regarding our Global Investment Management segment. This business performed well with $19 million of carried interest tied to significant property disposition activity. Capital raising totaled $1.8 billion in Q3 and $7 billion over the trailing 4 quarters. We continue to attract significant equity commitments based on the solid performance of our investment programs within 75% of our AUM as outperformed its long-term industry benchmark.
At the end of Q3, Assets Under Management of $86 billion were up $1.6 billion over prior year Q3 in local currency, but down $2.6 billion when converted into U.S. dollars.
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding our Development Services segment. Pro forma revenue, which includes equity, earnings and gains on real estate sales and EBITDA, both declined reflecting fewer large property dispositions than in last year's highly active Q3 period. However, activity is very strong, and we expect most of this year's earnings to be achieved in Q4 from several large transactions. We now anticipate that our combined Investment Management and Development Services businesses for 2015 will moderately exceed 2014 performance. Development projects in process totaled $6.7 billion, up $1.3 billion since the end of 2014. The pipeline totaled $4 billion, flat with year-end 2014 as projects have been converted from pipeline to in-process.
Now please turn to Slide 12 as I turn the call back over to Bob for closing remarks."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. The third quarter of 2015 was an eventful period for CBRE. As you saw in our press release, we posted excellent results with strong top and bottom line growth around the world, highlighted by a 28% increase in adjusted earnings per share.
We also moved decisively to fortify our market-leading occupier outsourcing business with the acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions on September 1. This is our largest acquisition in nearly a decade and one of the most compelling ever completed in our sector. The combination creates a platform unlike anything that has previously existed in our industry, with highly complementary product offerings and common cultures around innovation and client service. It broadens our value proposition, creates true global scale, deepens our relationships with prominent global corporations and enriches our talent pool.
Our last 3 large strategic acquisitions are recurring revenue businesses that operate under contracts that are typically 5 years or longer. These acquisitions have helped to transform CBRE into a more resilient business. We now have a dramatically more powerful integrated service offering, while maintaining our core focus on commercial real estate services.
We also continue to make gains through investments in recruiting, training, technology, branding and research, all positioned to help us deliver great outcomes for clients and to drive growth. We saw the payoff from these investments across CBRE in the third quarter. Notably, our services business, comprised of the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions, again posted significant revenue in normalized EBITDA growth with solid margin expansion. Our Investment Management business also performed well.
Now Jim will provide you with more specific insight into our performance."

I will begin with an update on our overall performance and the expected contributions from our recent acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions.Please turn to Slide 5. In Q3, our business continued to exhibit excellent broad-based moment",1338,"Thank you, Bob. I will begin with an update on our overall performance and the expected contributions from our recent acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions.
Please turn to Slide 5. In Q3, our business continued to exhibit excellent broad-based momentum. Revenue and earnings growth for the quarter was very strong. In local currency, gross revenue increased 26% while fee revenue rose 21%. Without the 1-month contribution from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business, gross and fee revenue were both up 16% in local currency. Normalized EBITDA totaled $345 million, an 18% improvement from last year's Q3, or a 24% improvement in local currency. Profitability was strong with a 17.8% normalized EBITDA margin on fee revenue, up approximately 60 basis points from Q3 2014. Adjusted earnings per share increased 28% to $0.51 for the quarter.
Please turn to Slide 6 for an update on the expected financial contributions from the newly acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. This acquisition greatly enhanced our ability to serve leading corporations around the world. We funded about 1/3 of the purchase price, price with cash and temporary revolver borrowings and 2/3 with attractively priced 5- and 7-year bank debt and 10-year bonds. Both Moody's and Standard & Poor's affirmed our investment-grade credit rating.
The integration of Global Workplace Solutions with our existing occupier outsourcing business is off to a great start. Morale is very high. Our organization structure for senior leadership, line of business leaders and geographic leadership is in place. Feedback from clients, their consultants and our shareholders has been overwhelmingly positive as the rationale for the acquisition and the value proposition is clear.
We have identified additional cost synergies and now expect run rate annual synergies of approximately $50 million, up from our initial estimate of $35 million in March 2015. We anticipate achieving approximately $30 million of the synergy in 2016, with the remaining run rate savings largely realized by year end 2017.
When we announced the acquisition in March, we indicated expected material accretion to our adjusted 2016 EPS with a mid-single-digit percentage increase. We are now raising our estimate to high single-digit percentage increase accretion in 2016.
We closed the acquisition in the early part of our expected time frame and raised financing with minimal interest expense in advance of closing. In light of this, we now expect the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business to contribute $0.03 to $0.04 to adjusted earnings per share for the last 4 months of 2015.
Calendar year Q4 has typically been a seasonally slower period for the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business due to its fiscal year previously ending September 30. As a result, accretion from the last 4 months of 2015 is not indicative of the higher expected run rate contribution in 2016.
Please turn to Slide 7 for a review of the performance of our major global lines of business in Q3. As a reminder, I am referencing percentage increases in local currency, unless noted otherwise. For the company as a whole, contractual fee revenue plus leasing, which is largely recurring, totaled 68% of total fee revenue. Occupier outsourcing showed strong growth in all 3 regions, excluding transaction revenue generated by this business, which is accounted for in leasing and sales revenue. Occupier outsourcing achieved a 53% increase in fee revenue. Excluding the contribution from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business, fee revenue rose 14%.
Asset Services growth was moderate with fee revenue up 4%. Investment Management performed well. Fee revenue increased 19%, fueled by a higher carried interest tied to property dispositions. Valuation again grew nicely with global fee revenue up 14%. We benefited from higher volumes of appraisal and consulting work, which stem in part from acquisitions we made in 2014.
Property leasing revenue again rose by double digits with 12% growth globally led by Europe and Asia Pacific. The growth rate in the U.S. slowed modestly but remained strong at 9%. We are seeing less available -- availability in Class A office space in a few gateway markets with new development accelerating, but generally still lagging demand. This may extend the time it takes to complete certain larger lease transactions. However, we continue to reap the benefits of a very strong recruiting activity, higher productivity from our existing brokerage teams and modest rent growth.
Our capital markets business continue to perform exceptionally well amid gains in market share and strong capital flows into real estate. Property sales revenue rose 19% with every region producing markedly higher activity.
In the U.S., we logged impressive market share gains as confirmed by RCA at a time when the overall market activity was flat for the quarter. We continue to see activity broadening in the secondary markets in the U.S. and EMEA. In Asia Pacific, Australia and Hong Kong accounted for the lion's share of the increase.
Mortgage services also remained robust with revenue up 33%. Even though as expected, loan volume with the U.S. government-sponsored Enterprises leveled off due to the regulatory caps. Banks, life companies and other debt capital sources stepped up their lending.
Please turn to Slide 8, where we will review Q3 results for our 3 regional services segments, all in local currency.
Fee revenue increased 18% in the Americas. In EMEA, fee revenue increased 29%. We saw healthy gains across the region, including France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. In Asia Pacific, fee revenue rose 22% with growth led by Australia, Greater China and India. Fee revenue growth, without the contribution from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business, was 14% in the Americas, 19% in EMEA and 17% in Asia Pacific. Normalized EBITDA increased 18% in the Americas, 70% in EMEA and 54% in Asia Pacific.
Please turn to Slide 9, regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which is reported within the 3 regional services segments. This business line, which we previously called Global Corporate Services, adopted the Global Workplace Solution name on September 1. This move reflects Global Workplace Solutions' high-brand value in the facility management sector and the increasingly diverse workspaces in which we are serving clients, including hospitals, data centers, labs and manufacturing plants. Outsourcing continues to gain wider appeal, and existing customers are taking advantage of our deeper and broader platform. In Q3, we set a new quarterly record for the number of expansions of existing contractual relationships. We also signed 9 contracts with new or existing health care clients, reflecting the compelling and growing opportunity for CBRE in this sector. These numbers did not include contracts from the newly acquired Global Workplace Solutions business, which we will begin to reflect in our contract reporting in 2016.
Please turn to Slide 10, regarding our Global Investment Management segment. This business performed well with $19 million of carried interest tied to significant property disposition activity. Capital raising totaled $1.8 billion in Q3 and $7 billion over the trailing 4 quarters. We continue to attract significant equity commitments based on the solid performance of our investment programs. More than 75% of our AUM has outperformed its long-term industry benchmark.
At the end of Q3, Assets Under Management of $86 billion were up $1.6 billion over prior year Q3 in local currency, but down $2.6 billion when converted into U.S. dollars.
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding our Development Services segment. Pro forma revenue, which includes equity, earnings and gains on real estate sales, and EBITDA both declined, reflecting fewer large property dispositions than in last year's highly active Q3 period. However, activity is very strong, and we expect most of this year's earnings to be achieved in Q4 from several large transactions. We now anticipate that our combined Investment Management and Development Services businesses for 2015 will moderately exceed 2014 performance. Development projects in process totaled $6.7 billion, up $1.3 billion since the end of 2014. The pipeline totaled $4 billion, flat with year-end 2014 as projects have been converted from pipeline to in-process.
Now please turn to Slide 12 as I turn the call back over to Bob for closing remarks."
