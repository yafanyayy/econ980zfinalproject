35000,280899937,756280,"Symantec Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Helyn. Separating our security and Information Management businesses has already began to improve both our strategic focus and operating discipline. Our employees, partners and customers are energized about our future and our momentum is accele",1902,"Thank you, Helyn. Separating our security and Information Management businesses has already began to improve both our strategic focus and operating discipline. Our employees, partners and customers are energized about our future and our momentum is accelerating. We continue to execute on our 5 key priorities especially in managing our businesses as a portfolio, which resulted in operating margin and EPS that exceeded guidance this quarter; achieving our operating margin target of 30%; implied billings growth of 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, marking our third consecutive quarter of implied billings growth; and year-over-year deferred revenue growth for the first time in 6 quarters. 
Now I'd like to discuss the progress we've made in more detail in each of our 3 segments, starting with our Veritas business. Revenue growth in our Information Management segment accelerated to 5% year-over-year from 3% in the September quarter, driven by double-digit revenue growth in NetBackup software, NetBackup Appliances and Enterprise Vault Cloud. Last week, we unveiled the new name of our standalone information management company, Veritas Technologies Corporation. Veritas remains a powerful brand that still has tremendous equity with our customers, partners and employees. The need for Information Management solutions continues to accelerate with growth in unstructured data projected to increase at 42% per year. This trend is underpinning the growth we are seeing in this business. We continue to outpace the market, with 15% year-over-year revenue growth in NetBackup software. Our NetBackup Appliances grew 22% year-over-year, driven by the October launch of our NetBackup 5330 appliance, which delivers twice the performance and capacity of prior models, making the management of information even simpler and less expensive. Similarly, in archiving, we have key releases that enabled our customers to access their archive content anywhere, including on mobile devices and to archive nearly any type of content. We are gaining share in all of these markets. Veritas will continue to aggressively enhance its industry-leading backup and recovery, storage management, clustering, disaster recovery, archiving and e-discovery core solutions with releases planned across all key products over the upcoming year. Those solutions would also create a foundation for new information availability and insight technologies that will help customers unlock the value of their data to help drive business productivity and profitability. By extending current product capabilities, leveraging IP and developing differentiated architectures, Veritas will bring next-generation solutions to market designed for the hybrid cloud throughout the upcoming year. 
Two examples of these solutions include the information map and the IT resiliency platform. First, the information map is a cloud-based service that provides a global view of all the information across an organization in a simple and rapidly deployed solution. The information map is the first application that will leverage our information fabric technology and the catalog from NetBackup, the most commonly installed backup platform in the world. Second, the IT Resiliency platform due out this summer is a new business continuity software solutions providing 1-click application recovery automation for complex enterprise hybrid clouds. Late last year, we announced the joint partnership to also deliver this capability as the complete service offering with HP services and the HP Helion Open Stack Cloud Platform. Both form factors reduce business risk and extent by bringing simplicity to complex enterprise operation. 
We shared our security strategy when announced the separation of our businesses on October 9. The 3 pillars of our unified security strategy are first, provide a unified security global analytics platform that leverages the intelligence of our enterprise and consumer offerings, augmented by third-party data to provide security outcomes to customers better than anyone else. Second, simplify our Enterprise Security Product portfolio by delivering newly develops integrated Advanced Threat Protection and information protection. We've already simplified our Norton offerings to a single product. And third grow our cyber-security service capabilities. We continue to make progress in realizing our strategy, particularly in leveraging our telemetry to deliver better threat protection for customers. 
Now let me discuss some of the progress we've made in our Consumer and Enterprise Security segment. As the largest provider of security for consumers, we continue to protect customers against increasingly sophisticated threats. As an example, we recently uncovered a 0 day vulnerability which affects several versions of Adobe Flash Player. Consumers with the latest Norton Security updates were protected against this threat. Our previous efforts to simplify our Norton product portfolio and exit unprofitable OEM products resulted in 1,055 basis points of year-over-year operating margin expansion. As we noted in our last earnings call, more transparency in automatic renewals in Norton, along with our decision to exit certain unprofitable OEM and retail channel arrangements, results in negative year-over-year revenue comparison in the Norton business over the next several quarters. Norton revenue was down 7% year-over-year to $461 million. However, the net impact of eliminating unprofitable revenue and lower operating expenses more than offset lower revenue resulting in 15% year-over-year growth in operating income. We believe we can mitigate the revenue declines in Norton by improving online customer acquisitions, enhancing the customer experience, transitioning Norton customers to a subscription service and by providing a virus removal guarantee to customers who opt in to auto renewal. Since Norton revenue is ratable, we expect the next 4 quarters of year-over-year declines to be at the magnitude we are seeing today. However, the rate of decline should start to moderate as revenue compare to these after that. Throughout this period, we expect to maintain operating margins above 50%. 
Moving to our Enterprise security segment, today, most advanced threats exploit endpoints to steal financial data and intellectual property. With our market-leading position at the Enterprise endpoint, we are well-positioned to help customers counter these trends. Symantec Endpoint Protection, or SEPs revenue wrote 5% year-over-year underscores our continued leadership in Endpoint Security, the largest segment of the security market. In a moment, I will discuss how we will further extend our endpoint leadership through our upcoming Advanced Threat Protection offerings. Unified security is our name for Symantec strategy to collect massive amounts of security relevant telemetry from the global footprint of our products, researchers and third parties in our Global Intelligence Network. To accelerate our efforts in harnessing this telemetry and building the next-generation analytics platform, we've hired 65 engineers and data scientists from Narrows, a Boeing subsidiary recognized as a leader in cybersecurity, Big Data analytics as well as acquire certain technology rights. Symantec will leverage Nars and expertise in data science, the data analytics and machine learning to deliver on our unified security strategy. 
Coupled with our efforts to enhance our analytics capability, we have organically developed a highly innovative Advanced Threat Protection, or ATP solution which consists of 3 modules. These modules cover the critical control points of network, email and endpoint. Our ATP network solution can scan our block malicious traffic using all of Symantec's industry-leading technologies and our new cynic virtual execution sandbox capabilities. ATP network will correlate suspicious traffic with endpoint and email activity monitored by other Symantec products. With this product we will provide a differentiated capability and prioritizing incidents for security professionals to help them cope with increasing number of false positives that occur with competitors' products. For example, when malware is detected on the network a security professional will able to see that SEP or emailsecurity.cloud has successfully blocked it, eliminating the need for further remediation. ATP Network will ship in the June quarter.  ATP Email extends our e-mailsecurity.cloud offering by providing additional visibility into targeted attacks delivered via email, a common attack vector for advance threats. ATP Email will also ship in June quarter. ATP Endpoint will collect endpoint activity data from our SEP agents and apply machine learning algorithms for detection and prioritization of suspicious files and behaviors. ATP Endpoint compares customer-specific data with our inside reputation global data and can submit files to Cynic to reduce false-positive and increase the confidence of detection. The security professional can then direct SEP to blacklist and eradicate these threats. ATP Endpoint will ship in the September quarter. Importantly, ATP Endpoint is not a SEP placement but a complimentary add-on product that makes customers' investment in over 100 million Symantec endpoints more valuable. 
With these ATP products, Symantec would be well-positioned to address not only better protection but also detection and response. Customers will be able to purchase any of our 3 ATP components together or may leverage investments they've already made in third-party's network solutions by purchasing any of our ATP offerings separately. 
Now I'd like to touch on our information protection product family where we're bringing 2 new cloud solutions to market. A comprehensive security solution not only keeps threats out of an organization, but it also keeps critical proprietary information in. Symantec's information protection products, including our flagship DLP offering, are the industry leaders with nearly twice the market share of our closest competitor. Our information protection solution will enhance advanced persistent threat detection intelligence by providing additional telemetry regarding location, access and movement of confidential information. This telemetry can then be profiled and correlated with our other products to better detect advanced threat activity. For example, in the case of a large network breach, since DLP knows which user machines actually store the most confidential information, security professionals can start at the source of greatest risk. We are well-positioned to leverage our DLP market leadership to protect Enterprise data stored in the crowd and on mobile devices. In the December quarter, we launched 2 new DLP cloud solutions. DLP for cloud email for Microsoft Office 365 Exchange, and DLP for Amazon Web Services. 
Finally, I'd like to discuss our cybersecurity services which address the $10 billion market opportunity by 2018 growing at a 30% compound annual growth rate. We are the only company in the world with the breadth of cybersecurity services that includes our market-leading security monitoring services, incident response services, managed adversary threat intelligence services and security simulation services. In the December quarter, we launched our managed adversary and threat intelligence annual subscription service, which provides clients with advanced warning and intelligence on key threat actors and their emerging tactics, techniques and procedures. This quarter, we are launching the cybersecurity simulation service, and we have already secured a large European government as a customer. This week, we launched our incident response retainer service in North America and the U.K. This service allows customers to take a more proactive approach by identifying gaps in their existing incident response program and deploying defense capabilities in advance of the security incident to reduce the time to identification and eradication of the threat. 
As the world's largest security company monitoring 4.3 trillion global threats in realtime, with more than 500 full time researchers, we continue to uncover new threats every day. We were the first to publish on Reagan, identifying the advanced spying tool that displays a degree of technical competence rarely seen, exhibiting traits reminiscent of other sophisticated malware families like stacksnet. He will continue to move quickly to making the changes required to ensure Symantec has a more successful future, and in doing so, we will stay focused on executing to deliver for customers, employees and shareholders. 
We look forward to outlining our business model targets for Veritas, Consumer Security and Enterprise security in more detail at our Financial Analyst Day on April 17. Now I'll turn it over to Thomas to provide a review of our financial results and guidance."
35000,280899937,756280,"Symantec Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon. Both Symantec's operating margin, earnings per share exceeding guidance which drove operating margin above our 30% target and its guided rates we delivered revenue within our guidance range. The U.S. dollar continue to",1191,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon. Both Symantec's operating margin, earnings per share exceeding guidance which drove operating margin above our 30% target and its guided rates we delivered revenue within our guidance range. The U.S. dollar continue to appreciate significantly against major currencies during the December quarter, creating a headwind of $60 million [ph] to our revenue and $183 million to deferred revenue on a year-over-year basis. 
Our implied billings were up 3% year-over-year, marking our third consecutive quarter of growth. The number of large deals greater than $300,000 grew 21%, with strength in financial services, insurance and information technology. On a constant currency basis, deferred revenue grew 1% to $3.5 billion. License revenue continued its improving trend from last quarter growing 20% year-over-year and 35% on a sequential basis. Strength in license revenues was driven by Enterprise Backup and appliances. Enterprise subscriptions increased 3% year-over-year, accounting for 15% of total revenue. 
Moving now to our business segments, in Consumer Security, we continue to drive operating margin higher, increasing 10.6 percentage points year-over-year to 53%. As Mike discussed, we exited certain unprofitable OEM and retail channel arrangements, as well as provided greater transparency on automatic renewals which are adversely affecting revenue and billings in Norton over the next several quarters. Revenue in the period was down 7% year-over-year to $461 million [ph]. Enterprise security revenue was flat year-over-year at $509 million. Our Endpoint Protection and DLP products grew 5% and 2% respectively. This was offset by weakness in Endpoint Management at Mail and Web Security. 
GAAP operating margin declined to 17% compared to 20% in the year-ago period, driven by higher support spend. Information Management revenue increased 5% year-over-year to $668 million [ph]. NetBackup Appliances and software generated strong year-over-year growth of 22% and 15% respectively. Strength in the backup was offset by weakness in Backup Exec. GAAP operating margin improved sequentially to 25% compared to 20% last quarter but was down versus 27% in the year-ago period due to higher commission. 
Gross margin decreased 30 basis point year-over-year to 84.1%, driven by growth in lower margin appliance business. We achieved an operating margin of 30.4%, 140 basis points expansion year-over-year through a combination of pricing optimization and improved renewals processes which drove enhanced top line performance, coupled with profit improvement programs such as optimizing the Norton business. We incurred restructuring costs of $39 million and separation costs of $29 million during the December quarter. As we noted last quarter, we are reducing our workforce and taking steps to improve our cost structure as we prepare for the separation. We expect the remainder of these charges to occur in the March and June quarter.  Net income of $367 million resulted in fully diluted earnings per share of $0.53, up 2% year-over-year. 
Now turning to cash flow and share purchases, cash flow from operating activities totaled $358 million, up 9% year-over-year, driven by the ongoing reductions in our cost structure. Sequentially, cash flow from operations was up 107% from $173 million. Capital expenditures were $101 million as we continue to build our ATP cloud infrastructure. We returned $229 million to shareholders during the December quarter via share repurchases and dividends, $104 million was in the form of cash dividends and $125 million was used to repurchase 4.9 million shares at an average share price of $25.63. We have $283 million remaining under the current stock repurchase authorization. We remain confident in the strength of our cash flow generation and continue to be committed to returning value to our shareholders. With this goal in mind, our Board of Directors has approved a new $1 billion share repurchase program. 
Now I'd like to briefly discuss some of our revenue and cost initiatives. We reached our fiscal year target for our renewals initiatives with a greater focus on value selling and process improvement. In license compliance, we've ramped the team to conduct more than 3x the number of audits here to date than we completed in fiscal year '14. In the fourth quarter, we expect to conduct more than 10x the number of fiscal year '14 audits. With our cost saving initiative for the second consecutive quarter, we've realized the benefits of optimizing the Norton segment. We are focusing our global footprint reduction efforts to optimize our lapse data centers and location for 2 standalone companies. 
Before I review our guidance, I'd like to discuss the progress we are making to complete the separation of the Veritas and security businesses by calendar year end. We finalized the planning phase of the separation and are advancing to the execution phase and our separation activities remain on track. Let me review some of the important milestones that we have achieved. First, we've chosen Veritas Technologies Corporation as the name for the Information Management company and plan to relaunch the Veritas brand in the face approach fast approaching come off. Second, we named key leaders as well as sales and product personnel for both businesses. The Veritas and Symantec sales organization will be operating independently as of the new fiscal year begins. Third, in the area of consumer and partner contracts, we've made significant progress in allocating products and services between Veritas and Symantec. Fourth, we have begun building an ERP solution for Veritas and are well underway towards separating IT infrastructure. And fifth, we finalized key real estate decision and made substantial progress in creating the appropriate legal entities and corporate infrastructure to separate the companies. And consequently, we're on track to make Veritas operational as a standalone company in October. Over the coming month, we'll complete carved out financials statements and prepare the Form 10 to be filed with the SEC by August. At our financial analyst event, we will provide more detailed information, including financial targets for each business. 
Now turning to guidance, at the beginning of the fiscal year, we set our guidance at an exchange rate of $1.38. At that rate, we expect to achieve revenue growth year-over-year as reported and exceed our original fiscal year '15 guidance on all metrics. We are now providing fiscal year 2015 guidance and the weighted average exchange rate of $1.28. Using the exchange rate, we expect fiscal year '15 revenue to be between $6.515 billion and $6.575 billion. Operating margin between $27.5 billion and 27.7% and EPS between $1.87 and $1.90. With the continuing strengthening of the dollar against other major currencies, we're expecting an FX headwind of approximately 5.5 percentage points for our year-over-year revenue growth in the March quarter. At an exchange rate of $1.15 [ph], we expect the March quarter revenue between $1.525 billion to $1.585 billion, with operating margin between 26.5% to 27.5% resulting in EPS of $0.42 to $0.45.  The company's operating margin would be lower in the March quarter compared to December quarter due to difficult seasonality and the FX impact. 
In conclusion, I am pleased with the progress the team in better aligning our cost structure and selling apostate growth. I look forward to sharing more details and more progress at Financial Analyst Day. And with this, I'll turn it over to Helyn to be taking your questions."

And then I think significantly, as you referred to, the ATP series is a set of modules that are really complementary products. So ATP endpoint obviously will be a complementary product that will better protect the endpoint, but it also drives strength from the modules that we'll be selling with that. And so ATP network, for example, will be attacking a completely new market for us to better protect incoming attacks that occur over network traffic. So we're excited about the continued growth we're seeing in the endpoint product. We're going to continue to enhance our product, but the ATP solution is something that would be additive to our revenue and enterprise security portfolio."

I mean, one of the things you point about the OEM placement fees is they should help pay for an ongoing stream, or if you think of it as annuity. But what you find when you look at the actual results from placing with OEMs is first of all, you're not assured that for that business they do that's not direct, for example, what they sell to retail, you can be replaced even before the consumer sees your product. And we were finding that with large retailers that many of them exert their own power to put whatever consumer protection product they would like depending on how they're paid. And then those in turn end up being a lower rate of renewals. So the business is driven off how well you can improve renewal rates. So rather than rely on this chain of very uncertain transaction, us, the OEM, the OEM to the retailer, the retailer to the consumer, we're choosing to focus on improving the online acquisitions going direct to the consumer, improving the customer experience and then improving the renewal rate. That's one of the reasons why we simplify the product line and have gone to subscription service. Now it will take us a number of quarters to be able to convert most of our Norton consumers to a subscription service, but when we do that, we believe we'll have very sustainable business and really get away from the headwind we're facing right now that relates to auto renewal policy changes."

So this is something where we made changes to the business recently, some of them in response to changes in consumer protection in EMEA, but was rolled out worldwide. And if you think about it, every time you present the customer with a renewal opportunity, they have to make a choice, there's an opportunity for leakage the in the business. If someone is a subscriber, they maintain their subscription until they opt out. So that's what we mean by going into a subscription basis. This is the second way to think about it. A customer benefits here because we're not waiting for a renewal and a download. So that means that rather than a 1 year cycle that at the end of that period and then I download a new version, we can provide more continuous updates to the customer in terms of functionality of the capability delivered from a cloud. So it's just a more modern way of protecting consumers, they get better protection, and we think there would be a better business model that results for Norton Symantec."

And that's because it needs to be qualified and tested. You not only have to replace perhaps an endpoint product with a new endpoint, but also the endpoint manager needs to be replaced at the server level. So rather than ask our customers to go through some kind of 2-year upgrade cycle, they're able to add this complementary product of ATP endpoint and get this advanced capability while leaving their current investment in SEP leveraged. So I think that -- and of course, that would be at a different price point because this would be a separate capability that we'll be offering from what people have traditionally bought with endpoints. As it relates to future packages down the road, it would be too early to say. We'll have to see what customer feedback we get as we launch this initial ATP solution with the 3 modules, we certainly are going to be looking for their feedback on what's the best way to buy security in addition to continuing to offer services for those customers that don't want to go through that process of trying to integrate products themselves, we view expanded services as another growth opportunity."

I think it's a tremendous advantage to be able to supply customers, not only with a range of products, but also the support that's required and the benefit of a historical ongoing relationship. So I think as it relates to size of vendor, if we can provide something that is competitive in the marketplace I think we have an advantage versus the many small companies, start ups out there, even though they've got something that could be interesting. It's very complex to be integrating all of these point solutions. So I'd say that if there's something that truly offers incredible advantage, the largest Enterprise customers are going to be willing to take a look at that. But even they have to be selective and takes up a lot of their resources to be able to understand all these products and integrate them. So we should have an advantage at Symantec given our size and scale. One of the things we're banking on as you can tell from our strategy is taking advantage of all the threat telemetry. So it's not that technology capability what we see of there in terms of the threats and our how we can make our customers smarter, we have ready interest improve point of customers been able to see more about what is going on and protect themselves better by taking advantage of that vast threat telemetry that we offer.

Separating our security and Information Management businesses has already began to improve both our strategic focus and operating discipline. Our employees, partners and customers are energized about our future and our momentum is accele",1909,"Thank you, Helyn. Separating our security and Information Management businesses has already began to improve both our strategic focus and operating discipline. Our employees, partners and customers are energized about our future and our momentum is accelerating. We continue to execute on our 5 key priorities especially in managing our businesses as a portfolio, which resulted in operating margin and EPS that exceeded guidance this quarter; achieving our operating margin target of 30%; implied billings growth of 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, marking our third consecutive quarter of implied billings growth; and year-over-year deferred revenue growth for the first time in 6 quarters. 
Now I'd like to discuss the progress we've made in more detail in each of our 3 segments, starting with our Veritas business. Revenue growth in our Information Management segment accelerated to 5% year-over-year from 3% in the September quarter, driven by double-digit revenue growth in NetBackup software, NetBackup Appliances and Enterprise Vault.cloud. 
Last week, we unveiled the new name of our standalone information management company, Veritas Technologies Corporation. Veritas remains a powerful brand that still has tremendous equity with our customers, partners and employees. 
The need for Information Management solutions continues to accelerate with growth in unstructured data projected to increase at 42% per year. This trend is underpinning the growth we are seeing in this business. We continue to outpace the market, with 15% year-over-year revenue growth in NetBackup software. Our NetBackup Appliances grew 22% year-over-year, driven by the October launch of our NetBackup 5330 appliance,  which delivers twice the performance and capacity of prior models, making the management of information even simpler and less expensive. 
Similarly, in archiving, we have key releases that enabled our customers to access their archived content anywhere, including on mobile devices and to archive nearly any type of content. We are gaining share in all of these markets. 
Veritas will continue to aggressively enhance its industry-leading backup and recovery, storage management, clustering, disaster recovery, archiving and eDiscovery core solutions with releases planned across all key products over the upcoming year. Those solutions would also create a foundation for new information availability and insight technologies that will help customers unlock the value of their data to help drive business productivity and profitability. 
By extending current product capabilities, leveraging IP and developing differentiated architectures, Veritas will bring next-generation solutions to market designed for the hybrid cloud throughout the upcoming year. Two examples of these solutions include the Information Map and the IT Resiliency Platform [ph] .
First, the Information Map is a cloud-based service that provides a global view of all the information across an organization in a simple and rapidly deployed solution. The Information Map is the first application that will leverage our information fabric technology and the catalog from NetBackup, the most commonly installed backup platform in the world. 
Second, the IT Resiliency Platform [ph]. Due out this summer is a new business continuity software solution providing one-click application recovery automation for complex enterprise hybrid clouds. Late last year, we announced the joint partnership to also deliver this capability as the complete service offering with HP services and the HP Helion OpenStack cloud platform. Both form factors reduce business risk and expense by bringing simplicity to complex enterprise operation. 
We shared our security strategy when we announced the separation of our businesses on October 9. The 3 pillars of our unified security strategy are first, provide a unified security global analytics platform that leverages the intelligence of our enterprise and consumer offerings, augmented by third-party data, to provide security outcomes to customers better than anyone else. 
Second, simplify our Enterprise Security Product portfolio by delivering newly developed integrated advanced threat protection and information protection. We've already simplified our Norton offerings to a single product. 
And third grow our cyber-security service capabilities. We continue to make progress in realizing our strategy, particularly in leveraging our telemetry to deliver better threat protection for customers. 
Now let me discuss some of the progress we've made in our Consumer and Enterprise Security segments. As the largest provider of security for consumers, we continue to protect customers against increasingly sophisticated threats. As an example, we recently uncovered a 0 day vulnerability which affects several versions of Adobe Flash Player. Consumers with the latest Norton Security updates were protected against this threat. 
Our previous efforts to simplify our Norton product portfolio and exit unprofitable OEM products resulted in 1,055 basis points of year-over-year operating margin expansion. As we noted in our last earnings call, more transparency in automatic renewals in Norton, along with our decision to exit certain unprofitable OEM  and retail channel arrangements, results in negative year-over-year revenue comparison in the Norton business over the next several quarters. Norton revenue was down 7% year-over-year to $461 million. However, the net impact of eliminating unprofitable revenue and lower operating expenses more than offset lower revenue, resulting in 15% year-over-year growth in operating income. 
We believe we can mitigate the revenue declines in Norton by improving online customer acquisitions, enhancing the customer experience, transitioning Norton customers to a subscription service and by providing a virus-removal guarantee to customers who opt in to auto renewal. Since Norton revenue is ratable, we expect the next 4 quarters of year-over-year declines to be at the magnitude we are seeing today. However, the rate of decline should start to moderate as revenue compares ease after that. Throughout this period, we expect to maintain operating margins above 50%. 
Moving to our Enterprise Security  segment. Today, most advanced threats exploit endpoints to steal financial data and intellectual property. With our market-leading position at the enterprise endpoint, we are well positioned to help customers counter these trends. Symantec Endpoint Protection or SEP's revenue growth of  5% year-over-year underscores our continued leadership in endpoint security, the largest segment of the security market. In a moment, I will discuss how we will further extend our endpoint leadership through our upcoming advanced threat protection offerings. 
Unified Security is our name for Symantec's strategy to collect massive amounts of security-relevant telemetry from the global footprint of our products, researchers and third parties in our Global Intelligence Network. To accelerate our efforts in harnessing this telemetry and building the next-generation analytics platform, we've hired 65 engineers and data scientists from Narus, a Boeing subsidiary recognized as a leader in cybersecurity, big data analytics as well as acquire certain technology rights. Symantec will leverage Narus's talent and expertise in data science, big data analytics and machine learning to deliver on our Unified Security strategy. 
Coupled with our efforts to enhance our analytics capability, we have organically developed a highly innovative Advanced Threat Protection, or ATP solution which consists of 3 modules. These modules cover the critical control points of network, email and endpoint. 
Our ATP network solution can scan our block malicious traffic using all of Symantec's industry-leading technologies and our new Cynic virtual execution sandbox capabilities. ATP network will correlate suspicious traffic with endpoint and email activity monitored by other Symantec products. With this product we will provide a differentiated capability in prioritizing incidents for security professionals to help them cope with the increasing number of false positives that occur with competitors' products. For example, when malware is detected on the network, a security professional will able to see that SEP or Email Security.cloud has successfully blocked it, eliminating the need for further remediation. ATP Network will ship in the June quarter. 
ATP Email extends our Email Security.cloud offering by providing additional visibility into targeted attacks delivered via email, a common attack vector for advance threats. ATP Email will also ship in June quarter. 
ATP Endpoint will collect endpoint activity data from our SEP agents and apply machine learning algorithms for detection and prioritization of suspicious files and behaviors. ATP Endpoint compares customer-specific data with our inside reputation global data and can submit files to Cynic to reduce false-positive and increase the confidence of detection. The security professional can then direct SEP to blacklist and eradicate these threats. ATP Endpoint will ship in the September quarter. Importantly, ATP Endpoint is not a SEP replacement but a complimentary add-on product that makes customers' investment in over 100 million Symantec endpoints more valuable. 
With these ATP products, Symantec would be well positioned to address not only better protection but also detection and response. Customers will be able to purchase any of our 3 ATP components together or may leverage investments they've already made in third-party's network solutions by purchasing any of our ATP offerings separately. 
Now I'd like to touch on our information protection product family, where we're bringing 2 new cloud solutions to market. A comprehensive security solution not only keeps threats out of an organization, but it also keeps critical proprietary information in. Symantec's information protection products, including our flagship DLP offering, are the industry leaders with nearly twice the market share of our closest competitor. 
Our information protection solution will enhance advanced persistent threat detection intelligence by providing additional telemetry regarding location, access and movement of confidential information. This telemetry can then be profiled and correlated with our other products to better detect advanced threat activity. For example, in the case of a large network breach, since DLP knows which user machines actually store the most confidential information, security professionals can start at the source of greatest risk. 
We are well positioned to leverage our DLP market leadership to protect enterprise data stored in the crowd and on mobile devices. In the December quarter, we launched 2 new DLP cloud solutions: DLP for cloud email for Microsoft Office 365 Exchange and DLP for Amazon Web Services. 
Finally, I'd like to discuss our cybersecurity services which address the $10 billion market opportunity by 2018, growing at a 30% compound annual growth rate. We are the only company in the world with the breadth of cybersecurity services that includes our market-leading security monitoring services, incident response services, managed adversary threat intelligence services and security simulation services. 
In the December quarter, we launched our managed adversary and threat intelligence annual subscription service, which provides clients with advanced warning and intelligence on key threat actors and their emerging tactics, techniques and procedures. This quarter we are launching the cybersecurity simulation service, and we have already secured a large European government as a customer. 
This week, we launched our Incident Response retainer service in North America and the U.K. This service allows customers to take a more proactive approach by identifying gaps in their existing incident response program and deploying defense capabilities in advance of the security incident to reduce the time to identification and eradication of the threat. 
As the world's largest security company monitoring 4.3 trillion global threats in realtime, with more than 500 full time researchers, we continue to uncover new threats every day. We were the first to publish on Regin, identifying the advanced spying tool that displays a degree of technical competence rarely seen, exhibiting traits reminiscent of other sophisticated malware families like Stuxnet. 
We will continue to move quickly in making the changes required to ensure Symantec has a more successful future, and in doing so, we will stay focused on executing to deliver for customers, employees and shareholders. 
We look forward to outlining our business model targets for Veritas, Consumer Security and Enterprise security in more detail at our Financial Analyst Day on April 17. Now I'll turn it over to Thomas to provide a review of our financial results and guidance."

The U.S. dollar continu",1190,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon. Both Symantec's operating margin and earnings per share exceeding guidance which drove operating margin above our 30% target. And at guided rates, we delivered revenue within our guidance range. The U.S. dollar continued to appreciate significantly against major currencies during the December quarter, creating a headwind of $60 million to our revenue and $183 million to deferred revenue on a year-over-year basis. 
Our implied billings were up 3% year-over-year, marking our third consecutive quarter of growth. The number of large deals greater than $300,000 grew 21%, with strength in financial services, insurance and information technology. On a constant currency basis, deferred revenue grew 1% to $3.5 billion. 
License revenue continued its improving trend from last quarter growing 20% year-over-year and 35% on a sequential basis. Strength in license revenues was driven by enterprise backup and appliances. Enterprise subscriptions increased 3% year-over-year, accounting for 15% of total revenue. 
Moving now to our business segments, in Consumer Security, we continue to drive operating margin higher, increasing 10.6 percentage points year-over-year to 53%. As Mike discussed, we exited certain unprofitable OEM and retail channel arrangements as well as provided greater transparency on automatic renewals, which are adversely affecting revenue and billings in Norton over the next several quarters. Revenue in the period was down 7% year-over-year to $461 million. 
Enterprise Security revenue was flat year-over-year at $509 million. Our Endpoint Protection and DLP products grew 5% and 2%, respectively. This was offset by weakness in Endpoint Management and Mail and Web Security. GAAP operating margin declined to 17% compared to 20% in the year-ago period, driven by higher support spend. 
Information Management revenue increased 5% year-over-year to $668 million.  NetBackup Appliances and software generated strong year-over-year growth of 22% and 15%, respectively. Strength in the NetBackup was offset by weakness in Backup Exec. GAAP operating margin improved sequentially to 25% compared to 20% last quarter but was down versus 27% in the year-ago period due to higher commissions. 
Gross margin decreased 30 basis points year-over-year to 84.1%, driven by growth in lower margin appliance business. We achieved an operating margin of 30.4%, 140 basis points expansion year-over-year, through a combination of pricing optimization and improved renewals processes which drove enhanced top line performance, coupled with profit improvement programs such as optimizing the Norton business. 
We incurred restructuring costs of $39 million and separation costs of $29 million during the December quarter. As we noted last quarter, we are reducing our workforce and taking steps to improve our cost structure as we prepare for the separation. We expect the remainder of these charges to occur in the March and June quarter.  
Net income of $367 million resulted in fully diluted earnings per share of $0.53, up 2% year-over-year. 
Now turning to cash flow and share purchases. Cash flow from operating activities totaled $358 million, up 9% year-over-year, driven by the ongoing reductions in our cost structure. Sequentially, cash flow from operations was up 107% from $173 million. 
Capital expenditures were $101 million as we continue to build our IT and cloud infrastructure. 
We returned $229 million to shareholders during the December quarter via share repurchases and dividends. $104 million was in the form of cash dividends and $125 million was used to repurchase 4.9 million shares at an average share price of $25.63. We have $283 million remaining under the current stock repurchase authorization. We remain confident in the strength of our cash flow generation and continue to be committed to returning value to our shareholders. With this goal in mind, our Board of Directors has approved a new $1 billion share repurchase program. 
Now I'd like to briefly discuss some of our revenue and cost initiatives. We reached our fiscal year target for our renewals initiatives with a greater focus on value selling and process improvement. In license compliance, we've ramped the team to conduct more than 3x the number of audits here to date than we completed in fiscal year '14. In the fourth quarter, we expect to conduct more than 10x the number of fiscal year '14 audits. 
With our cost saving initiatives, for the second consecutive quarter, we've realized the benefits of optimizing the Norton segment. We're focusing our global footprint reduction efforts to optimize our labs, data centers and location for 2 standalone companies. 
Before I review our guidance, I'd like to discuss the progress we are making to complete the separation of the Veritas and security businesses by calendar year end. We've finalized the planning phase of the separation and are advancing to the execution phase, and our separation activities remain on track. Let me review some of the important milestones that we have achieved. 
First, we've chosen Veritas Technologies Corporation as the name for the Information Management company and plan to relaunch the Veritas brand in a phased approach over the coming months. 
Second, we've named key leaders as well as sales and product personnel for both businesses. The Veritas and Symantec sales organization will be operating independently as the new fiscal year begins. 
Third, in the area of consumer and partner contracts, we've made significant progress in allocating products and services between Veritas and Symantec. 
Fourth, we have begun building an ERP solution for Veritas and are well underway towards separating IT infrastructure. 
And fifth, we've finalized key real estate decisions and made substantial progress in creating the appropriate legal entities and corporate infrastructure to separate the companies. And consequently, we're on track to make Veritas operational as a standalone company in October. 
Over the coming month, we'll complete carved-out financials statements and prepare the Form 10 to be filed with the SEC by August. At our financial analyst event, we will provide more detailed information, including financial targets for each business.  
Now turning to guidance. At the beginning of the fiscal year, we set our guidance at an exchange rate of $1.38. At that rate, we expect to achieve revenue growth year-over-year as reported and exceed our original fiscal year '15 guidance on all metrics. 
We are now providing fiscal year 2015 guidance at the weighted average exchange rate of $1.28. Using the exchange rate, we expect fiscal year '15 revenue to be between $6.515 billion and $6.575 billion, operating margin between $27.5 billion and 27.7% and EPS between $1.87 and $1.90. 
With the continuing strengthening of the dollar against other major currencies, we're expecting an FX headwind of approximately 5.5 percentage points to our year-over-year revenue growth in the March quarter. At an exchange rate of $1.16, we expect the March quarter revenue between $1.525 billion to $1.585 billion, with operating margin between 26.5% to 27.5% resulting in EPS of $0.42 to $0.45.  The company's operating margin will be lower in the March quarter compared to December quarter due to typical seasonality and the FX impact. 
In conclusion, I am pleased with the progress the team has made in better aligning our cost structure and setting the path to growth. I look forward to sharing more details on our progress at Financial Analyst Day. And with this, I'll turn it over to Helyn to begin taking your questions."

So ATP endpoint obviously will be a complementary product that will better protect the endpoint, but it also drives strength from the modules that we'll be selling with that. And so ATP network, for example, will be attacking a completely new market for us to better protect incoming attacks that occur over network traffic. So we're excited about the continued growth we're seeing in the endpoint product.

I mean, one of the things that you point about the OEM placement fees is they should help pay for an ongoing stream, or you can think of it as annuity. But what you find when you look at the actual results from placing with OEMs is first of all, you're not assured that for the business they do that's not direct, for example, what they sell through retail, you can be replaced even before the consumer sees your product. And we were finding that with large retailers that many of them exert their own power to put whatever consumer protection product they would like on there depending on how they're paid. And then those in turn end up being a lower rate of renewals. So the business is driven off how well you can improve renewal rates. So rather than rely on this chain of very uncertain transaction, us, the OEM, the OEM to the retailer, the retailer to the consumer, we're choosing to focus on improving the online acquisitions, going direct to the consumer, improving the customer experience and then improving the renewal rate. That's one of the reasons why we simplified the product line and have gone to subscription service. Now it will take us a number of quarters to be able to convert most of our Norton consumers to a subscription service. But when we do that, we believe we'll have very sustainable business and really get away from the headwind we're facing right now that relates to auto renewal policy changes."

And if you think about it, every time you present the customer with a renewal opportunity, they have to make a choice, there's an opportunity for leakage in the business. If someone is a subscriber, then they maintain their subscription until they opt out. So that's what we mean by going into a subscription basis. This is the second way to think about it. A customer benefits here because we're not waiting for a renewal and a download. So that means that rather than a 1-year cycle that at the end of that period and then I download a new version, we can provide more continuous updates to the customer in terms of functionality of the capability delivered from a cloud.

And actually it's designed with customer convenience in mind because it takes a large enterprise something on the order of 2 years to implement a new endpoint protection. And that's because it needs to be qualified and tested. You not only have to replace perhaps an endpoint product with a new endpoint, but also the endpoint manager needs to be replaced at the server level. So rather than ask our customers to go through some kind of a 2-year upgrade cycle, they're able to add this complementary product of ATP endpoint and get this advanced capability while leaving their current investment in SEP leveraged. So I think that -- and of course, that will be at a different price point because this will be a separate capability that we'll be offering from what people have traditionally bought with endpoints. As it relates to future packages down the road, it would be too early to say. We'll have to see what customer feedback we get as we launch this initial ATP solution with the 3 modules.

We're putting a lot of focus into productivity measures, getting faster doing HR [ph] deployment and more efficient development processes, but we are hardly touching R&D from an overall spend perspective in order to protect the innovation momentum. On the go-to-market side, we've accelerated the separation, as I've been talking about, getting operational separation for the 2 entities by October. We plan to enter the new fiscal year starting April. However, with 2 separate sales organization so the sales leadership has been dedicated. The coverage models have been defined. Sales compensation and quotas have been rolled out so we can make sure that we are not impacting that momentum during the year but are in the right starting positions with the first day of the new fiscal year."

So just in a nutshell, some of the key capabilities of that product. We will be able to, through the software, prioritize the incidents we see from the traffic that we're analyzing. That's key from a productivity standpoint, because one of the things that we've talked about before is the complex problem that security operations professionals have and they've got to look through a tremendous number of alerts and identify quickly what are false positives here and what's already been remediated. So the ATP network product, particularly in combination with our ATP endpoint product, you're going to be able to see some thing you're observing as a potential attack. It's already been remediated on the endpoint. So tremendous benefit by looking at these capabilities together and then the ability to prioritize this incident is a tremendous productivity improvement. Delivered from the cloud will be something we call Cynic that I referenced in my earlier remarks. So this is the virtual execution engine, the sandbox capability. And we believe this will be certainly best-in-class because we are now able to prevent attacks from what we're calling malware-aware threats. So the threats, or the malware has become more sophisticated in evolving to know if it's in a sandbox. We've got a way around that to force it to expose itself so that we can detonate that. And then of course, delivery from a cloud is the correlation with that telemetry data that we have. So we'll be able to -- that's a capability we call Synapse so we'll be able to see what are you seeing on the network and how does that correlate with our 4.3 million threats that we are monitoring.

I think it's a tremendous advantage to be able to supply customers, not only with a range of products but also the support that's required and the benefit of a historical ongoing relationship. So I think as it relates to size of vendor, if we can provide something that is competitive in the marketplace I think we have an advantage versus the many small companies, startups out there, even though they've got something that could be interesting. It's very complex to be integrating all of these point solutions. So I'd say that if there's something that truly offers incredible advantage, the largest enterprise customers are going to be willing to take a look at that. But even they have to be selective and it takes up a lot of their resources to be able to understand all these products and integrate them. So we should have an advantage at Symantec given our size and scale. One of the things that we're banking on, as you can tell from our strategy, is taking advantage of all the threat telemetry. So it's not just the technology capability but what do we see out there in terms of the threat and how can we make our customers smarter. We've already got some interesting proof points  of customers being able to see more about what's going on and protect themselves better by taking advantage of that vast threat telemetry that we offer.

Separating our security and Information Management businesses has already began to improve both our strategic focus and operational discipline.

Separating our security and Information Management businesses has already began to improve both our strategic focus and operational discipline. Our employees, partners and customers are energized about our future and our momentum is accelerating. We continue to execute on our 5 key priorities, especially in managing our businesses as a portfolio, which resulted in operating margin and EPS that exceeded guidance this quarter; achieving our operating margin target of 30%; implied billings growth of 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, marking our third consecutive quarter of implied billings growth; and year-over-year deferred revenue growth for the first time in 6 quarters. 
Now I'd like to discuss the progress we've made in more detail in each of our 3 segments, starting with our Veritas business. Revenue growth in our Information Management segment accelerated to 5% year-over-year from 3% in the September quarter, driven by double-digit revenue growth in NetBackup software, NetBackup Appliances and Enterprise Vault.cloud. 
Last week, we unveiled the new name of our standalone information management company, Veritas Technologies Corporation. Veritas remains a powerful brand that still has tremendous equity with our customers, partners and employees. 
The need for Information Management solutions continues to accelerate with growth in unstructured data projected to increase at 42% per year. This trend is underpinning the growth we are seeing in this business. We continue to outpace the market, with 15% year-over-year revenue growth in NetBackup software. Our NetBackup Appliances grew 22% year-over-year, driven by the October launch of our NetBackup 5330 appliance,  which delivers twice the performance and capacity of prior models, making the management of information even simpler and less expensive. 
Similarly, in archiving, we had key releases that enabled our customers to access their archived content anywhere, including on mobile devices and to archive nearly any type of content. We are gaining share in all of these markets. 
Veritas will continue to aggressively enhance its industry-leading backup and recovery, storage management, clustering, disaster recovery, archiving and eDiscovery core solutions with releases planned across all key products over the upcoming year. Those solutions will also create a foundation for new information availability and insight technologies that would help customers unlock the value of their data to help drive business productivity and profitability. 
By extending current product capabilities, leveraging IP and developing differentiated architectures, Veritas will bring next-generation solutions to market designed for the hybrid cloud throughout the upcoming year. Two examples of these solutions include the Information Map and the IT Resiliency Platform [ph] .
First, the Information Map is a cloud-based service that provides a global view of all the information across an organization in a simple and rapidly deployed solution. The Information Map is the first application that will leverage our information fabric technology and the catalog from NetBackup, the most commonly installed backup platform in the world. 
Second, the IT Resiliency Platform [ph], due out this summer is a new business continuity software solution providing one-click application recovery automation for complex enterprise hybrid clouds. Late last year, we announced the joint partnership to also deliver this capability as the complete service offering with HP services and the HP Helion OpenStack cloud platform. Both form factors reduce business risk and expense by bringing simplicity to complex enterprise operations. 
We shared our security strategy when we announced the separation of our businesses on October 9. The 3 pillars of our unified security strategy are first, provide a unified security global analytics platform that leverages the intelligence of our enterprise and consumer offerings, augmented by third-party data, to provide secure outcomes to customers better than anyone else. 
Second, simplify our Enterprise Security Product portfolio by delivering newly developed integrated advanced threat protection and information protection. We've already simplified our Norton offerings to a single product. 
And third, grow our cyber-security service capabilities. We continue to make progress in realizing our strategy, particularly in leveraging our telemetry to deliver better threat protection for customers. 
Now let me discuss some of the progress we've made in our Consumer and Enterprise Security segments. As the largest provider of security for consumers, we continue to protect customers against increasingly sophisticated threats. As an example, we recently uncovered a 0 day vulnerability which affects several versions of Adobe Flash Player. Consumers with the latest Norton Security updates were protected against this threat. 
Our previous efforts to simplify our Norton product portfolio and exit unprofitable OEM products resulted in 1,055 basis points of year-over-year operating margin expansion. As we noted in our last earnings call, more transparency in automatic renewals in Norton, along with our decision to exit certain unprofitable OEM and retail channel arrangements, results in negative year-over-year revenue comparisons in the Norton business over the next several quarters. Norton revenue was down 7% year-over-year to $461 million. However, the net impact of eliminating unprofitable revenue and lower operating expenses more than offset lower revenue, resulting in 15% year-over-year growth in operating income. 
We believe we can mitigate the revenue declines in Norton by improving online customer acquisitions, enhancing the customer experience, transitioning Norton customers to a subscription service and by providing a virus-removal guarantee to customers who opt in to auto renewal. Since Norton revenue is ratable, we expect the next 4 quarters of year-over-year declines to be at the magnitude we are seeing today. However, the rate of decline should start to moderate as revenue compares ease after that. Throughout this period, we expect to maintain operating margins above 50%. 
Moving to our Enterprise Security segment. Today, most advanced threats exploit endpoints to steal financial data and intellectual property. With our market-leading position at the enterprise endpoint, we are well positioned to help customers counter these trends. Symantec Endpoint Protection or SEP's revenue growth of 5% year-over-year underscores our continued leadership in endpoint security, the largest segment of the security market. In a moment, I will discuss how we will further extend our endpoint leadership through our upcoming advanced threat protection offerings. 
Unified Security is our name for Symantec's strategy to collect massive amounts of security-relevant telemetry from the global footprint of our products, researchers and third parties in our Global Intelligence Network. To accelerate our efforts in harnessing this telemetry and building the next-generation analytics platform, we've hired 65 engineers and data scientists from Narus, a Boeing subsidiary recognized as a leader in cybersecurity, Big Data analytics as well as acquire certain technology rights. Symantec will leverage Narus's talent and expertise in data science, Big Data analytics and machine learning to deliver on our Unified Security strategy. 
Coupled with our efforts to enhance our analytics capability, we have organically developed a highly innovative Advanced Threat Protection, or ATP solution, which consists of 3 modules. These modules cover the critical control points of network, email and endpoint. 
Our ATP network solution can scan or block malicious traffic using all of Symantec's industry-leading technologies and our new Cynic virtual execution sandbox capabilities. ATP network will correlate suspicious traffic with endpoint and email activity monitored by other Symantec products. With this product we will provide a differentiated capability in prioritizing incidents for security professionals to help them cope with the increasing number of false positives that occur with competitors' products. For example, when malware is detected on the network, a security professional will be able to see that SEP or Email Security.cloud has successfully blocked it, eliminating the need for further remediation. ATP Network will ship in the June quarter. 
ATP Email extends our Email Security.cloud offering by providing additional visibility into targeted attacks delivered via email, a common attack vector for advance threats. ATP Email will also ship in June quarter. 
ATP Endpoint will collect endpoint activity data from our SEP agents and apply machine learning algorithms for detection and prioritization of suspicious files and behaviors. ATP Endpoint compares customer-specific data with our Insight reputation global data and can submit files to Cynic to reduce false-positive and increase the confidence of detection. The security professional can then direct SEP to blacklist and eradicate these threats. ATP Endpoint will ship in the September quarter. Importantly, ATP Endpoint is not a SEP replacement but a complementary add-on product that makes customers' investment in over 100 million Symantec endpoints more valuable. 
With these ATP products, Symantec will be well positioned to address not only better protection but also detection and response. Customers will be able to purchase any of our 3 ATP components together or may leverage investments they've already made in third-party's network solutions by purchasing any of our ATP offerings separately. 
Now I'd like to touch on our information protection product family, where we're bringing 2 new cloud solutions to market. A comprehensive security solution not only keeps threats out of an organization, but it also keeps critical proprietary information in. Symantec's information protection products, including our flagship DLP offering, are the industry leaders with nearly twice the market share of our closest competitor. 
Our information protection solution will enhance advanced persistent threat detection intelligence by providing additional telemetry regarding location, access and movement of confidential information. This telemetry can then be profiled and correlated with our other products to better detect advanced threat activity. For example, in the case of a large network breach, since DLP knows which user machines actually store the most confidential information, security professionals can start at the source of greatest risk. 
We are well positioned to leverage our DLP market leadership to protect enterprise data stored in the cloud and on mobile devices. In the December quarter, we launched 2 new DLP cloud solutions: DLP for cloud email for Microsoft Office 365 Exchange and DLP for Amazon Web Services. 
Finally, I'd like to discuss our cybersecurity services which address a $10 billion market opportunity by 2018, growing at a 30% compound annual growth rate. We are the only company in the world with the breadth of cybersecurity services that includes our market-leading security monitoring services, incident response services, managed adversary threat intelligence services and security simulation services. 
In the December quarter, we launched our managed adversary and threat intelligence annual subscription service, which provides clients with advanced warning and intelligence on key threat actors and their emerging tactics, techniques and procedures. This quarter we are launching the cybersecurity simulation service, and we have already secured a large European government as a customer. 
This week, we launched our Incident Response retainer service in North America and the U.K. This service allows customers to take a more proactive approach by identifying gaps in their existing incident response programs and deploying defense capabilities in advance of a security incident to reduce the time to identification and eradication of the threat. 
As the world's largest security company monitoring 4.3 trillion global threats in real time, with more than 500 full time researchers, we continue to uncover new threats every day. We were the first to publish on Regin, identifying the advanced spying tool that displays a degree of technical competence rarely seen, exhibiting traits reminiscent of other sophisticated malware families like Stuxnet. 
We will continue to move quickly in making the changes required to ensure Symantec has a more successful future, and in doing so, we will stay focused on executing to deliver for customers, employees and shareholders. 
We look forward to outlining our business model targets for Veritas, Consumer Security and Enterprise security in more detail at our Financial Analyst Day on April 17. Now I'll turn it over to Thomas to provide a review of our financial results and guidance."
35000,280899937,756601,"Symantec Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2015",2015-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon. Both Symantec's operating margin and earnings per share exceeded guidance which drove operating margin above our 30% target. And at guided rates, we delivered revenue within our guidance range. The U.S. dollar continue",1188,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon. Both Symantec's operating margin and earnings per share exceeded guidance which drove operating margin above our 30% target. And at guided rates, we delivered revenue within our guidance range. The U.S. dollar continued to appreciate significantly against major currencies during the December quarter, creating a headwind of $60 million to our revenue and $183 million to deferred revenue on a year-over-year basis. 
Our implied billings were up 3% year-over-year, marking our third consecutive quarter of growth. The number of large deals greater than $300,000 grew 21%, with strength in financial services, insurance and information technology. On a constant currency basis, deferred revenue grew 1% to $3.5 billion. 
License revenue continued its improving trend from last quarter, growing 20% year-over-year and 35% on a sequential basis. Strength in license revenue was driven by enterprise backup and appliances. Enterprise subscriptions increased 3% year-over-year, accounting for 15% of total revenue. 
Moving now to our business segments, in Consumer Security, we continue to drive operating margin higher, increasing 10.6 percentage points year-over-year to 53%. As Mike discussed, we exited certain unprofitable OEM and retail channel arrangements as well as provided greater transparency on automatic renewals, which are adversely affecting revenue and billings in Norton over the next several quarters. Revenue in the period was down 7% year-over-year to $461 million. 
Enterprise Security revenue was flat year-over-year at $509 million. Our Endpoint Protection and DLP products grew 5% and 2%, respectively. This was offset by weakness in Endpoint Management and Mail and Web Security. GAAP operating margin declined to 17% compared to 20% in the year-ago period, driven by higher support spend. 
Information Management revenue increased 5% year-over-year to $668 million. NetBackup Appliances and software generated strong year-over-year growth of 22% and 15%, respectively. Strength in NetBackup was offset by weakness in Backup Exec. GAAP operating margin improved sequentially to 25% compared to 20% last quarter but was down versus 27% in the year-ago period due to higher commissions. 
Gross margin decreased 30 basis points year-over-year to 84.1%, driven by growth in our lower margin appliance business. We achieved an operating margin of 30.4%, 140 basis points expansion year-over-year, through a combination of pricing optimization and improved renewals processes which drove enhanced top line performance, coupled with profit improvement programs such as optimizing the Norton business. 
We incurred restructuring costs of $39 million and separation costs of $29 million during the December quarter. As we noted last quarter, we are reducing our workforce and taking steps to improve our cost structure as we prepare for the separation. We expect the remainder of these charges to occur in the March and June quarters.  
Net income of $367 million resulted in fully diluted earnings per share of $0.53, up 2% year-over-year. 
Now turning to cash flow and share purchases. Cash flow from operating activities totaled $358 million, up 9% year-over-year, driven by the ongoing reductions in our cost structure. Sequentially, cash flow from operations was up 107% from $173 million. 
Capital expenditures were $101 million as we continue to build our IT and cloud infrastructure. 
We returned $229 million to shareholders during the December quarter via share repurchases and dividends. $104 million was in the form of cash dividends and $125 million was used to repurchase 4.9 million shares at an average share price of $25.63. We have $283 million remaining under the current stock repurchase authorization. We remain confident in the strength of our cash flow generation and continue to be committed to returning value to our shareholders. With this goal in mind, our Board of Directors has approved a new $1 billion share repurchase program. 
Now I'd like to briefly discuss some of our revenue and cost initiatives. We reached our fiscal year target for our renewals initiatives with a greater focus on value selling and process improvement. In license compliance, we've ramped the team to conduct more than 3x the number of audits here to date than we completed in fiscal year '14. In the fourth quarter, we expect to conduct more than 10x the number of fiscal year '14 audits. 
With our cost saving initiatives, for the second consecutive quarter, we've realized the benefits of optimizing the Norton segment. We're focusing our global footprint reduction efforts to optimize our labs, data centers and location for 2 standalone companies. 
Before I review our guidance, I'd like to discuss the progress we are making to complete the separation of the Veritas and security businesses by calendar year end. We've finalized the planning phase of the separation and are advancing to the execution phase, and our separation activities remain on track. Let me review some of the important milestones that we have achieved. 
First, we've chosen Veritas Technologies Corporation as the name for the Information Management company and plan to relaunch the Veritas brand in a phased approach over the coming months. 
Second, we've named key leaders as well as sales and product personnel for both businesses. The Veritas and Symantec sales organization will be operating independently as the new fiscal year begins. 
Third, in the area of consumer and partner contracts, we've made significant progress in allocating products and services between Veritas and Symantec. 
Fourth, we have begun building an ERP solution for Veritas and are well underway towards separating IT infrastructure. 
And fifth, we've finalized key real estate decisions and made substantial progress in creating the appropriate legal entities and corporate infrastructure to separate the companies. And consequently, we're on track to make Veritas operational as a standalone company in October. 
Over the coming month, we'll complete carved-out financial statements and prepare the Form 10 to be filed with the SEC by August. At our financial analyst event, we will provide more detailed information, including financial targets for each business.  
Now turning to guidance. At the beginning of the fiscal year, we set our guidance at an exchange rate of $1.38. At that rate, we expect to achieve revenue growth year-over-year as reported and exceed our original fiscal year '15 guidance on all metrics. 
We are now providing fiscal year 2015 guidance at the weighted average exchange rate of $1.28. Using the exchange rate, we expect fiscal year '15 revenue to be between $6.515 billion and $6.575 billion, operating margin between 27.5% and 27.7% and EPS between $1.87 and $1.90. 
With the continuing strengthening of the dollar against other major currencies, we're expecting an FX headwind of approximately 5.5 percentage points to our year-over-year revenue growth in the March quarter. At an exchange rate of $1.16, we expect March quarter revenue between $1.525 billion to $1.585 billion, with operating margin between 26.5% to 27.5% resulting in EPS of $0.42 to $0.45.  The company's operating margin will be lower in the March quarter compared to December quarter due to typical seasonality and the FX impact. 
In conclusion, I am pleased with the progress the team has made in better aligning our cost structure and setting the path to growth. I look forward to sharing more details on our progress at Financial Analyst Day. And with this, I'll turn it over to Helyn to begin taking your questions."

So with continued releases, we would expect to keep up with some of the trends we need to, to better protect attacks. And then I think significantly, as you referred to, the ATP series is a set of modules that are really complementary products. So ATP endpoint obviously will be a complementary product that will better protect the endpoint, but it also drives strength from the modules that we'll be selling with that. And so ATP network, for example, will be attacking a completely new market for us to better protect incoming attacks that occur over network traffic. So we're excited about the continued growth we're seeing in the endpoint product. We're going to continue to enhance that product, but the ATP solution is something that will be additive to our revenue in the Enterprise Security portfolio."

And we were also public saying that some of these savings we are going to reinvest, especially in the security side, on the Symantec side, we're going to reinvest some of the efficiency gains into innovation and R&D spend.

I mean, one of the things that you point out about the OEM placement fees is they should help pay for an ongoing stream, or you can think of it as annuity. But what you find when you look at the actual results from placing with OEMs is first of all, you're not assured that for the business they do that's not direct, for example, what they sell through retail, you can be replaced even before the consumer sees your product. And we were finding that with large retailers that many of them exert their own power to put whatever consumer protection product they would like on there depending on how they're paid. And then those in turn end up being a lower rate of renewals. So the business is driven off how well you can improve renewal rates. So rather than rely on this chain of very uncertain transaction, us, the OEM, the OEM to the retailer, the retailer to the consumer, we're choosing to focus on improving the online acquisitions, going direct to the consumer, improving the customer experience and then improving the renewal rate. That's one of the reasons why we simplified the product line and have gone to subscription service. Now it will take us a number of quarters to be able to convert most of our Norton consumers to a subscription service. But when we do that, we believe we'll have very sustainable business and really get away from the headwind we're facing right now that relates to auto renewal policy changes."

And just really quickly, Michael, you mentioned north of a 50% operating margin you can maintain in the consumer business. I guess, it just blends into the next generation of endpoints you're seeing this new breed of solutions entering the market from a lot of competitors. And when you think about, clearly, there's been some inefficiencies in that business that you're addressing which is great to see. But the question I get a lot from investors is, are you putting enough in the innovation pipeline to get out with something here? So the question is just, can you continue to maintain that type of margin while blocking these next-generation vendors coming in with a new series of endpoints?"

So we're keeping consumers every bit as protected with advanced features, use of high capability analytical engines that we have and sourcing that vast telemetry that we like to talk about, that 4.3 trillion objects in real time that we're monitoring globally.

So one is that we are able to keep customers protected and avoid this question of an annual renewal cycle. So this is something where we made changes to the business recently, somewhat in response to changes in consumer protection in EMEA but was rolled out worldwide. And if you think about it, every time you present the customer with a renewal opportunity, they have to make a choice, there's an opportunity for leakage in the business. If someone is a subscriber, then they maintain their subscription until they opt out. So that's what we mean by going to a subscription basis. This is the second way to think about it. A customer benefits here because we're not waiting for a renewal and a download. So that means that rather than a 1-year cycle that at the end of that period and then I download a new version, we can provide more continuous updates to the customer in terms of functionality of the capability delivered from the cloud. So it's just a more modern way of protecting consumers. They get better protection, and we think there will be a better business model that results for Norton and Symantec."

And actually it's designed with customer convenience in mind because it takes a large enterprise something on the order of 2 years to implement a new endpoint protection. And that's because it needs to be qualified and tested. You not only have to replace perhaps an endpoint product with a new endpoint, but also the endpoint manager needs to be replaced at the server level. So rather than ask our customers to go through some kind of a 2-year upgrade cycle, they're able to add this complementary product of ATP endpoint and get this advanced capability while leaving their current investment in SEP leveraged. So I think that -- and of course, that will be at a different price point because this will be a separate capability that we'll be offering from what people have traditionally bought with endpoints. As it relates to future packages down the road, it would be too early to say. We'll have to see what customer feedback we get as we launch this initial ATP solution with the 3 modules. We'll certainly be looking for their feedback on what's the best way to buy security in addition to continuing to offer services for those customers that don't want to go through that process of trying to integrate products themselves, we view expanded services as another growth opportunity."

So I'd say that if there's something that truly offers incredible advantage, the largest enterprise customers are going to be willing to take a look at that. But even they have to be selective and it takes up a lot of their resources to be able to understand all these products and integrate them. So we should have an advantage at Symantec given our size and scale. One of the things that we're banking on, as you can tell from our strategy, is taking advantage of all that threat telemetry. So it's not just the technology capability but what do we see out there in terms of the threats and how can we make our customers smarter. We've already got some interesting proof points  of customers being able to see more about what's going on and protect themselves better by taking advantage of that vast threat telemetry that we offer. That's why we think the ATP solutions are going to be so powerful in the marketplace."

Fiscal '15 was a transformative year for Symantec as we improved our profitability and laid the foundation for future growth. We focused on returning to growth and rightsizing our cost structure, achieved our profitability targets and return significant cash to shareholders while preparing for the separation. We increased our R&D spending and shifted R&D dollars to focus on growth areas, delivering 41 Enterprise Security products and 17 Veritas products in fiscal '15. In the March quarter, Symantec achieved revenue growth for the first time in 3 quarters. Our confidence that this momentum will continue is underscored by leading indicators such as implied billings and deferred revenue. For the full year, implied billings increased 4% and grew in every quarter. In addition, differed revenue grew 1% for the year and posted 2 consecutive quarters of growth. 
Now let's review some key highlights for each segment starting with Information Management. Exponential data growth continues due to the increased use of mobile virtualization and hybrid cloud technology. These trends are creating opportunity for Veritas. At Veritas, we continue to make progress on our plan to accelerate growth and expand operating margin. Veritas returned to growth in fiscal '15 with revenue up 4% year-over-year and expanding operating margin from Q1 to Q4. We continue to build momentum in this business with 4 consecutive quarters of accelerating year-over-year revenue growth to 6% in the fourth quarter up from 5% in the third quarter. Enterprise backup continues to be the largest growth driver for Veritas. NetBackup Appliances grew 46% in fiscal '15, accelerating to 88% in the fourth quarter. This success was driven by the recent launch of our NetBackup 5330 appliance which more than doubled the capacity of the prior model, giving us the ability to expand into larger enterprise environments. As an example on the March quarter, we signed a $6 million Appliances deal with a major telco provider based on our backup appliances ease-of-use and lower total cost of ownership. While our appliance is the fastest growing in the market, we've only penetrated 10% of our install base. Our NetBackup software also grew above market, achieving growth of 11% in fiscal '15. Additionally, we saw strength in our archiving and eDiscovery products with enterprise growing 5% and eDiscovery accelerating its growth to 11% in the fourth quarter. We expect the momentum to continue in fiscal '16 driven by increased R&D investment which is leading to new releases in every one of our foundational enterprise products, as well as next-generation solutions which expand our addressable market and provide new capabilities such as information orchestration, IT Resiliency and Information Map. 
Moving to our Consumer Security segment, during fiscal '15, we expanded our Consumer Security operating margin to 53% by streamlining our operations through business simplification and cost reduction. In fiscal '16, we expect to maintain our normal operating margin between 52% and 54%. The Norton organization is also focused on key initiatives to mitigate revenue declines while maintaining our current profitability, which include increasing customer acquisition by refining our marketing messaging and optimizing our pricing for our premium service offering; migrating existing consumers from annual renewal to subscription offering; boosting retention by improving the user experience throughout the customer life cycle, including informing customers where Norton has blocked high-profile threats; and lastly, expanding distribution channel through telcos and other service providers. 
Moving to our Enterprise Security segment, the increasing complexity of threats, the scarcity of cybersecurity talent and the need for actionable intelligent security solutions are driving opportunities in our Enterprise Security business. During fiscal '15, we returned Endpoint Protection to market growth, continued to take share in data loss prevention, established a strong presence in Internet response services and reallocated investments to growth areas such as threat protection, information protection and cybersecurity services. And to better protect Symantec customers, we operate the largest civilian cyber intelligence threat network in the world, updated at a rate of 200,000 threats per second. This is the foundation for Symantec's Unified Security Analytics platform.  In fiscal '15, we experienced a strong resurgence in endpoint security which grew 5% during the full year and accelerated to 6% growth in the fourth quarter driven by increasing awareness of attacks on the endpoint where most unencrypted data resides. Our data loss prevention or DLP offering also experienced above market growth of 14% in fiscal '15 and is the undisputed leader in the market with double the share of the next largest competitor. DLP growth accelerated to 33% in the fourth quarter as we expanded DLP into cloud deployments such as Office 365. Another important part of our Enterprise Security business is Trust Services. We are the world's largest SSL certificate authentication provider with 44% market share. Trust Services had a record year reporting the highest revenue in its history growing 4% in fiscal '15 and driven primarily by our enterprise offering that solves for a comprehensive set of website security challenges. 
Our Cybersecurity Services also showed strong momentum in fiscal '15. We now have one of the broadest service offerings in the industry covering the full attack life cycle from before, during and after a breach. Our incident response service has engaged over 120 customers since its launch just a year ago. We expanded both the breadth and depth of our services by launching new Incident Response Retainer and simulation services. The retainer service, which launched in mid-February is already off to a strong start, signing up major global brands and government clients in multiple regions in the first few weeks of availability. In the area of Advanced Threat Protection, we have now entered the ATP market which is growing at 40% per year. Earlier this month, we shipped the first 2 of our advanced threat protection solutions, the ATP network appliance and ATP email. By early fall, we will deliver our ATP endpoint offering. Our key ATP solution has 2 key differentiators. One, integration of the endpoint, email and network control points and our ability to gather, correlate and analyze data across all 3; and two, it leverages the combined intelligence of our Unified Security Analytics platform. 
In conclusion, we're confident that the momentum we've established in fiscal '15 sets a strong foundation for future growth and improving profitability in fiscal '16. As we outlined at our financial Analyst Day, we expect Veritas to grow 4% to 7% in fiscal '16 and significantly expand operating margins of between 27% and 29% by growing our core portfolio and offering differentiated next-generation information availability and insight solutions that address an expanded market opportunity. In Consumer Security, we expect to maintain operating margins of 52% to 54% while executing on our initiatives to mitigate Norton's revenue decline to down 5% to 8% in fiscal '16. In Enterprise Security, we will leverage our global scale and unique assets to drive differentiated offerings in threat protection, information protection, cyber security services and Unified Security Analytics to accelerate revenue growth of between 1% and 6% in fiscal '16. 
Now I'll turn it over to Thomas to provide a review of our fourth quarter financial results and guidance for our fiscal first quarter. Thomas?"
35000,290267022,815557,"Symantec Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, May 14, 2015",2015-05-14,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon.

Increased focus we are returning to growth, rightsizing the cost structure and improving our profitability. We also returned more than $900 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. All of this was accomplished in the midst of executing the Veritas separation. Implied Billings grew 4% in fiscal year '15 compared to the 8% decline in fiscal year '14. Deferred revenue grew 1% to $3.7 billion compared to the 6% decline in fiscal year '14, giving us confidence in our growth trajectory. We reported non-GAAP operating margin of 27.3% for the year. We are pleased with this progress and the momentum as we enter fiscal year '16. 
Now let me provide some details on the fourth quarter financial results. We delivered non-GAAP revenue of $1.55 billion within our guided range. The U.S. dollar continue to appreciate significantly against major currencies, which created a headwind of $111 million to our fourth quarter revenue and $292 million to deferred revenue on a year-over-year basis. Our Implied Billings were up 2% year-over-year, now the fourth consecutive quarter of growth and deferred revenue accrued for the second consecutive quarter. License revenue continued its positive trend from last quarter growing 10% year-over-year driven by Appliances and DLP. The number of larger deals greater than $300,000 and larger than $1 million increased 35% and 82% respectively. We saw particular strength in banking, government and telecom. 
Moving now to our business segments, Information Management revenue increased 6% to $619 million. NetBackup Appliances and software-generated impressive double-digit year-over-year growth. Enterprise backup was offset by continued weakness in Backup Exec and storage management. Non-GAAP operating margin for the IIM segment increased by 120 basis points year-over-year. We drove non-GAAP operating margin for the Consumer Security segment to 55%, up 610 basis points year-over-year and 285 basis points sequentially. We accomplished this through continuing to reduce complexity in the business, streamlining product offerings and optimizing marketing spend. As expected, non-GAAP revenue declined 7% to $438 million due to the exit of OEM and retail channel arrangements. Enterprise Security revenue was flat year-over-year at $491 million, driven by double-digit growth in DLP and growth of 6% in Endpoint Protection. This growth was offset by weakness in endpoint management. Non-GAAP operating margin for the Enterprise Security segment was 10% compared to 15% in the year-ago period driven by the stronger U.S. dollar and increased R&D investment. Non-GAAP across margin decreased 100 basis points to 82.7% primarily due to substantial growth in our Appliance business. Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 25.6%, negatively affected by a true-up of $11 million through defined-benefit plans primarily in our EMEA region and an $8 million impact due to the strengthening U.S. dollar compared to our guided rate. Excluding these items, operating margin for the quarter would have been within the guided range. We incurred restructuring costs of $61 million [ph] and separation costs of $43 million during the March quarter. In fiscal year '16, we expect to incur restriction cost between $56 million to $86 million and separation costs between $89 million to $109 million.  Non-GAAP net income of $299 million resulted in fully diluted earnings per share of $0.43, down 10% year-over-year. The true-up of the defined benefit plan reduced EPS by roughly $0.01 per share. 
Now turning to cash flow and capital allocation, cash flow from operating activities for the March quarter totaled $488 million, bringing cash flow for the year to $1.3 billion, up 2% from fiscal '14, driven primarily by the increase in deferred revenue. Capital expenditures were $81 million, up 5% year-over-year as we continue to build out our AT infrastructure. We returned $227 million to shareholders during the March quarter via share repurchases and dividends. $102 million was in the form of cash dividends and the $125 million was used to repurchase 4.9 million shares at an average share price of $25.55. We have $1.2 billion remaining under the current stock repurchase authorization as of April 3, 2015 [ph].
 Now I'd like to briefly review our revenue and efficiency initiatives. Overall, these initiatives exceeded fiscal '15 targets, delivering over $150 million in incremental operational profit. Let me highlight several significant achievements. The renewals team exceeded its targets and improved the renewal rate. The license compliance team accelerated it's audit activity and meet its full year targets. Our pricing optimization efforts resulted in a significant improvement in price realization. And optimizing the Norton business, streamlining product support delivered cost savings and operating margin improvement. These initiatives continue to realize incremental benefit throughout the business and we are now tracking at a run rate of roughly $250 million in incremental operating profit into fiscal '16. 
Before I review our guidance, I'd like to briefly discuss the separation of the Veritas and the Security businesses. In April, we completed an important milestone with the separation of the 2 salesforces. We're on track to separate Veritas as a standalone company in January 2, 2016. Operationally, we'll be 2 separated companies on October 3, 2015. We expect to file the Form 10 in August, which will provide you more details on the business and Veritas' carve out financials. 
Now I would like to reiterate guidance for fiscal '16 which we previously provided at our financial Analyst Day. For fiscal '16, revenue is expected to be between $6.21 billion to $6.35 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 0% to 2% after adjusting for the extra week and foreign currency. Operating margin is expected to be between 29% and 30%, resulting in EPS in the range of $1.80 to $1.90. Our guidance for the year assumes an exchange rate of $1.13. We expect cash flow from operations to grow 12% in fiscal '16. For the June 2015 quarter, our guidance assumes an exchange rate of $1.10. It's important to note that the year ago June 2014 quarter included an extra week and the revenue for that extra week was $113 million, which we are excluding from our year-over-year calculations of growth rate. We expect revenue to be between $1.5 billion to $1.54 billion, representing growth of 1% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect operating margin to be between 27% and 28%, representing expansion of 685 basis points year-over-year at the midpoint and resulting in an EPS in the range of $0.41 to $0.44. Typically, our June revenue is down sequentially 1% to 2% on an as-reported basis. Our June 2015 revenue guidance reflects normal seasonality. 
In conclusion, I am pleased with all the progress the team has made in fiscal '15, and I'm excited about our growth prospects. And with that, I'll turn it over to Helen to begin taking your questions."

We expect on top of that continued operational improvement and an increase in deferred revenue and that would deliver the delta the $200 million improvement year-over-year."

So that is another  $117 million impact that you would have to correct for. And that would make the comparable revenue number about $1.505 billion. So we guided revenue for this quarter in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.54 billion so at the midpoint of $1.52 billion, that would be a year-over-year growth of 1%. So the math is a little bit tricky, but I think it shows that the momentum that we have been talking about is continuing.

We're going to be delivering that capability from the cloud. So we're not just leaving Endpoint Management to decline. We're going to be investing in that area because we see some opportunity. To your question, we've seen not only strength in endpoint and DLP going forward, but also ATP, our advanced threat protection, of course, we just introduced the first 2 parts of that three-pronged solution in this quarter and the current quarter that we're in. In fact, it was early May, but now we're going to add the third in the first half which is Endpoint and that we think it's going to give us the strongest capability for advanced threat position that exists in the marketplace, I would be happy to talk about what we feel that way. Our trust services businesses now is bigger and continues to grow and our cyber security services, we're seeing business activity there that is quite strong that we feel confident will lead to revenue growth in FY '16 [ph]. So not on the will be lost in endpoint management as you point out but strength from a broader cross-section of products FY '16. One of the things that we're enthused about too, if I could just add, Keith, of course is the dedicated sales focus. So this will be the first time and it just started this quarter, where you've got dedicated sales forces, one for security, one for Veritas. And on the security side, we have 40% more quota carrying reps in our sales force for security. So I think that's going to help us frankly on both Veritas and Symantec sides."

In addition, of course, we're going to be able to correlate what we are seeing with the threat intelligence base that Symantec has access to. That's clearly a strength where we will outshine the competitors. And added to that, we don't require you to install an expensive appliance which as you know could be up to $0.5 million per appliance.

We were very clear to apply the learnings from several years ago. Good example of that is there was no fifth quarter to drain the pipeline before we made that dramatic change in sales force September 2013 if I remember the date right. So that was not the way we approach that this time. You could argue that us a much more disruptive change in general because you're spitting new versus renewals. So the skill set you could say that this required and whether we got that right could be questioned. So not that type of change. Some of the focus by business line had partially begun, especially in the more mature markets, but now that's completed. We've begun the planning for this about 6 months ago, we named the sales leadership at the top level right around September. Even though we were not able to publicly announce of the separation at that time, we knew that announcement would be coming. And now we've had worldwide sales conferences for both Veritas and Symantec, which I think were very successful where we not only got those folks together, everybody knows which lane they're playing in, choose your language, to and what their quote is, territory, et cetera, their management, but also we're trained for very focused sales plays. If you look of evolution of the product line from 2 years ago to today, it's much more streamlined in terms of where our focus is by product area. And I want to make sure that our sales force is capable of running the sales plays in these focused areas. And then the point we just made a minute ago, we've increased the quota carrying reps 20% on the Veritas side, 40% on the Symantec  side. So many more quota carrying reps while we actually reduced the overall sales headcount. So we have a much more focused sales force not only in terms of product line but folks with a quota that they need to meet. I think we have made the key changes that we need to make. What we need to do from here is more of a fine tuning nature."

So the focus that we've achieved there I think has got a lot of numbers excited. Many of them attended our sales conferences that we just had. We just saw some interesting data from the channel saying Symantec continues to be the most recognized brand in terms of protecting customers for cyber threats which we saw was an interesting bit of data and gives us encouragement that as we go forward, the channel is still a very important part of our business and still very much believing that Symantec is the best supplier for them. As we talked about in previous calls, we have a new channel program which is very much in place giving the channel better economics for getting certified in key product lines. So as that has occurred, there are opportunity to get better economics from us as they focus on our products and learn more about them. Works both ways. We expect that to be able to help us build their volume as well as provide better economics for them as they get certified. I'd say overall we feel very good about where our channel program is and the enthusiasm we're seeing from the channel."

35000,290267022,815711,"Symantec Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, May 14, 2015",2015-05-14,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Helyn, and good afternoon. Fiscal '15 was a transformative year for Symantec as we improved our profitability and laid the foundation for future growth.

Fiscal '15 was a transformative year for Symantec as we improved our profitability and laid the foundation for future growth. We focused on returning to growth and rightsizing our cost structure, achieved our profitability targets and returned significant cash to shareholders while preparing for the separation. We increased our R&D spending and shifted R&D dollars to focus on growth areas, delivering 41 Enterprise Security products and 17 Veritas products in fiscal '15. In the March quarter, Symantec achieved revenue growth for the first time in 3 quarters. Our confidence that this momentum will continue is underscored by leading indicators such as implied billings and deferred revenue. For the full year, implied billings increased 4% and grew in every quarter. In addition, deferred revenue grew 1% for the year and posted 2 consecutive quarters of growth.
Now let's review some key highlights for each segment, starting with Information Management. Exponential data growth continues due to the increased use of mobile, virtualization and hybrid cloud technology. These trends are creating opportunity for Veritas. At Veritas, we continue to make progress on our plan to accelerate growth and expand operating margin. Veritas returned to growth in fiscal '15 with revenue up 4% year-over-year and expanding operating margin from Q1 to Q4. We continue to build momentum in this business with 4 consecutive quarters of accelerating year-over-year revenue growth to 6% in the fourth quarter, up from 5% in the third quarter. 
Enterprise backup continues to be the largest growth driver for Veritas. NetBackup appliances grew 46% in fiscal '15, accelerating to 88% in the fourth quarter. This success was driven by the recent launch of our NetBackup 5330 appliance, which more than doubled the capacity of the prior model, giving us the ability to expand into larger enterprise environments. As an example, on the March quarter, we signed a $6 million Appliances deal with a major telco provider based on our backup appliance's ease-of-use and lower total cost of ownership. While our appliance is the fastest growing in the market, we've only penetrated 10% of our installed base. 
Our NetBackup software also grew above market, achieving growth of 11% in fiscal '15. Additionally, we saw strength in our archiving and eDiscovery products with Enterprise Vault growing 5% and eDiscovery accelerating its growth to 11% in the fourth quarter. We expect the momentum to continue in fiscal '16 driven by increased R&D investment, which is leading to new releases in every one of our foundational enterprise products, as well as next-generation solutions, which expand our addressable market and provide new capabilities such as Information Orchestration, IT Resiliency and Information Map.
Moving to our Consumer Security segment. During fiscal '15, we expanded our Consumer Security operating margin to 53% by streamlining our operations through business simplification and cost reduction. In fiscal '16, we expect to maintain our Norton operating margin between 52% and 54%. The Norton organization is also focused on key initiatives to mitigate revenue declines while maintaining our current profitability, which include increasing customer acquisition by refining our marketing messaging and optimizing our pricing for our premium service offering; migrating existing consumers from an annual renewal to our subscription offering; boosting retention by improving the user experience throughout the customer life cycle, including informing customers where Norton has blocked high-profile threats; and lastly, expanding distribution channel through telcos and other service providers.
Moving to our Enterprise Security segment. The increasing complexity of threats, the scarcity of cybersecurity talent and the need for actionable, intelligent security solutions are driving opportunities in our Enterprise Security business. During fiscal '15, we returned Endpoint Protection to market growth, continued to take share in data loss prevention, established a strong presence in Internet response services and reallocated investments to growth areas such as threat protection, information protection and cybersecurity services. And to better protect Symantec customers, we operate the largest civilian cyber intelligence threat network in the world, updated at a rate of 200,000 threats per second. This is the foundation for Symantec's Unified Security Analytics platform.  
In fiscal '15, we experienced a strong resurgence in Endpoint Security, which grew 5% during the full year and accelerated to 6% growth in the fourth quarter, driven by increasing awareness of attacks on the endpoint where most unencrypted data resides. Our data loss prevention or DLP offering also experienced above-market growth of 14% in fiscal '15 and is the undisputed leader in the market with double the share of the next largest competitor. DLP growth accelerated to 33% in the fourth quarter as we expanded DLP into cloud deployments such as Office 365. 
Another important part of our Enterprise Security business is Trust Services. We are the world's largest SSL Certificate authentication provider with 44% market share. Trust Services had a record year, reporting the highest revenue in its history, growing 4% in fiscal '15 and driven primarily by our enterprise offering that solves for a comprehensive set of website security challenges.
Our cybersecurity services also showed strong momentum in fiscal '15. We now have one of the broadest service offerings in the industry, covering the full attack life cycle from before, during and after a breach. Our Incident Response service has engaged over 120 customers since its launch just a year ago. We expanded both the breadth and depth of our services by launching new Incident Response Retainer and Simulation services. The Retainer Service, which launched in mid-February is already off to a strong start, signing up major global brands and government clients in multiple regions in the first few weeks of availability. 
In the area of advanced threat protection, we have now entered the ATP market, which is growing at 40% per year. Earlier this month, we shipped the first 2 of our advanced threat protection solutions, the ATP Network appliance and ATP Email. By early fall, we will deliver our ATP Endpoint offering. Our key ATP solution has 2 key differentiators: one, integration of the endpoint, email and network control points and our ability to gather, correlate and analyze data across all 3; and two, it leverages the combined intelligence of our Unified Security Analytics platform.
In conclusion, we're confident that the momentum we've established in fiscal '15 sets a strong foundation for future growth and improving profitability in fiscal '16. As we outlined at Financial Analyst Day, we expect Veritas to grow 4% to 7% in fiscal '16 and significantly expand operating margin to between 27% and 29% by growing our core portfolio and offering differentiated next-generation information availability and insight solutions that address an expanded market opportunity. In Consumer Security, we expect to maintain operating margins of 52% to 54% while executing on our initiatives to mitigate Norton's revenue decline to down 5% to 8% in fiscal '16. In Enterprise Security, we will leverage our global scale and unique assets to drive differentiated offerings in threat protection, information protection, cybersecurity services and Unified Security Analytics to accelerate revenue growth to between 1% and 6% in fiscal '16.
Now I'll turn it over to Thomas to provide a review of our fourth quarter financial results and guidance for our fiscal first quarter. Thomas?"

Through increased focus, we are returning to growth, rightsizing the cost structure and improving our profitability. We also returned more than $900 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. All of this was accomplished in the midst of executing the Veritas separation. 
Implied billings grew 4% in fiscal year '15 compared to the 8% decline in fiscal year '14. Deferred revenue grew 1% to $3.7 billion compared to the 6% decline in fiscal year '14, giving us confidence in our growth trajectory. We reported non-GAAP operating margin of 27.3% for the year. We are pleased with this progress and the momentum as we enter fiscal year '16. 
Now let me provide some details on the fourth quarter financial results. We delivered non-GAAP revenue of $1.55 billion, within our guided range. The U.S. dollar continued to appreciate significantly against major currencies, which created a headwind of $111 million to our fourth quarter revenue and $292 million to deferred revenue on a year-over-year basis. Our implied billings were up 2% year-over-year, now the fourth consecutive quarter of growth, and deferred revenue accrued for the second consecutive quarter. License revenue continued its positive trend from last quarter, growing 10% year-over-year, driven by Appliances and DLP. The number of larger deals greater than $300,000 and larger than $1 million increased 35% and 82%, respectively. We saw particular strength in banking, government and telecom.
Moving now to our business segments. Information Management revenue increased 6% to $619 million. NetBackup appliances and software generated impressive double-digit year-over-year growth. Strength in enterprise backup was offset by continued weakness in Backup Exec and storage management. Non-GAAP operating margin for the IM segment increased by 120 basis points year-over-year. 
We drove non-GAAP operating margin for the Consumer Security segment to 55%, up 610 basis points year-over-year and 285 basis points sequentially. We accomplished this through continuing to reduce complexity in the business, streamlining product offerings and optimizing marketing spend. As expected, non-GAAP revenue declined 7% to $438 million due to the exit of OEM and retail channel arrangements. 
Enterprise Security revenue was flat year-over-year at $491 million, driven by double-digit growth in DLP and growth of 6% in Endpoint Protection. This growth was offset by weakness in Endpoint Management. Non-GAAP operating margin for the Enterprise Security segment was 10% compared to 15% in the year-ago period, driven by the stronger U.S. dollar and increased R&D investment. Non-GAAP gross margin decreased 100 basis points to 82.7%, primarily due to substantial growth in our Appliance business.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 25.6%, negatively affected by a true-up of $11 million to defined-benefit plans, primarily in our EMEA region, and an $8 million impact due to the strengthening U.S. dollar compared to our guided rate. Excluding these items, operating margin for the quarter would have been within the guided range. We incurred restructuring costs of $61 million and separation costs of $43 million during the March quarter. In fiscal year '16, we expect to incur restructuring costs between $56 million to $86 million and separation costs between $89 million to $109 million.  Non-GAAP net income of $299 million resulted in fully diluted earnings per share of $0.43, down 10% year-over-year. The true-up of the defined benefit plan reduced EPS by roughly $0.01 per share.
Now turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operating activities for the March quarter totaled $488 million, bringing cash flow for the year to $1.3 billion, up 2% from fiscal '14, driven primarily by the increase in deferred revenue. Capital expenditures were $81 million, up 5% year-over-year as we continue to build out our IT infrastructure. We returned $227 million to shareholders during the March quarter via share repurchases and dividends. $102 million was in the form of cash dividends, and the $125 million was used to repurchase 4.9 million shares at an average share price of $25.55. We have $1.2 billion remaining under the current stock repurchase authorization as of April 3, 2015.
Now I'd like to briefly review our revenue and efficiency initiatives. Overall, these initiatives exceeded fiscal '15 targets, delivering over $150 million in incremental operational profit. 
Let me highlight several significant achievements. The renewal team exceeded its targets and improved the renewal rates. The license compliance team accelerated its audit activity and beat its full year targets. Our pricing optimization efforts resulted in a significant improvement in price realization. And optimizing the Norton business and streamlining product support delivered cost savings and operating margin improvement. These initiatives continue to realize incremental benefit throughout the business, and we are now tracking at a run rate of roughly $250 million in incremental operating profit into fiscal '16.
Before I review our guidance, I'd like to briefly discuss the separation of the Veritas and the security businesses. In April, we completed an important milestone with the separation of the 2 sales forces. We are on track to separate Veritas as a standalone company on January 2, 2016. Operationally, we'll be 2 separated companies on October 3, 2015. We expect to file the Form 10 in August, which will provide you with more details on the business and Veritas' carve-out financials.
Now I would like to reiterate guidance for fiscal '16, which we previously provided at our Financial Analyst Day. For fiscal '16, revenue is expected to be between $6.21 billion to $6.35 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 0% to 2% after adjusting for the extra week and foreign currency. Operating margin is expected to be between 29% and 30%, resulting EPS in the range of $1.80 to $1.90. Our guidance for the year assumes an exchange rate of $1.13. We expect cash flow from operations to grow 12% in fiscal '16. For the June 2015 quarter, our guidance assumes an exchange rate of $1.10. It's important to note that the year-ago June 2014 quarter included an extra week and the revenue for that extra week was $113 million, which we are excluding from our year-over-year calculations of growth rate. We expect revenue to be between $1.5 billion to $1.54 billion, representing growth of 1% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect operating margin to be between 27% and 28%, representing expansion of 685 basis points year-over-year at the midpoint and resulting in an EPS in the range of $0.41 to $0.44. Typically, our June revenue is down sequentially 1% to 2% on an as-reported basis. Our June 2015 revenue guidance reflects normal seasonality.
In conclusion, I am pleased with all the progress the team has made in fiscal '15, and I'm excited about our growth prospects.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Helyn to begin taking your questions."

For operating cash flow, you've guided cash flow to grow 12% year-on-year. But if I look at that relative to your non-GAAP EPS guidance, you've actually guided non-GAAP EPS down a couple of percent.

We tried to be transparent at Analyst Day on how those come together. But their comparison revenue for the first quarter a year ago was about $1.735 billion. There's an extra week included in that number of about $113 million, and that revenue was delivered at an exchange rate of $1.37. So that is another $117 million impact that you would have to correct for. And that would make the comparable revenue number about $1.505 billion. So we guided revenue for this quarter in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.54 billion. So at the midpoint of $1.52 billion, that would be a year-over-year growth of 1%. So the math is a little bit tricky, but I think it shows that the momentum that we have been talking about is continuing. Unfortunately, there's some headwinds and difficult compares, but the trajectory is in the right direction."

Endpoint Management will be able to provide mobile capability going forward. We're going to be delivering that capability from the cloud. So we're not just leaving Endpoint Management to decline. We're going to be investing in that area because we see some opportunity. To your question, we've seen not only strength in Endpoint and DLP going forward but also ATP, our advanced threat protection. Of course, we just introduced the first 2 parts of that three-pronged solution in this quarter and the current quarter that we're in. And in fact, it was early May. But now we're going to add the third in the first half, which is Endpoint and that we think that's going to give us the strongest capability for advanced threat position that exists in the marketplace. I would be happy to talk about why we feel that way. Our Trust Services businesses now is bigger and continues to grow, and our cybersecurity services, we're seeing business activity there that is quite strong that we feel confident will lead to revenue growth in FY '16. So not only will the loss from Endpoint Management be smaller, as you pointed out, but strength from a broader cross-section of products in FY '16. One of the things that we're enthused about, too, if I could just add, Keith, is, of course, our dedicated sales focus. So this will be the first time, and it just started this quarter, where you've got dedicated sales forces, one for security, one for Veritas.

We were very clear to apply the learnings from several years ago. Good example of that is there was no fifth quarter to drain the pipeline that happened before we made that dramatic change in sales force September 2013, if I remember the date right. So that was not the way we approach that this time. And of course, you could argue, that was a much more disruptive change in general because you're splitting new versus renewals. So the skill set, you could say, that is required and whether we got that right could be questioned. So not that type of change. Some of the focus by business line had partially begun, especially in the more mature markets, but now that's completed. We've begun the planning for this about 6 months ago. We named the sales leadership at the top level right around September. Even though we were not able to publicly announce the separation at that time, we knew that announcement would be coming. And now we've had worldwide sales conferences for both Veritas and Symantec, which I think were very successful, where we not only got those folks together. Everybody knows which lane they're playing in, to use your language, and what their quota is and territory, et cetera, their management. But also, we're trained for very focused sales plays. If you looked at the evolution of the product line from 2 years ago to today, it's much more streamlined in terms of where our focus is by product area. And we want to make sure that our sales force is capable of running the sales plays in these focused areas. And then the point we just made a minute ago, we've increased the quota-carrying reps 20% on the Veritas side, 40% on the Symantec  side. So many more quota-carrying reps while we've actually reduced the overall sales headcount. So we have a much more focused sales force not only in terms of product line but folks with a quota that they need to meet. I think we have made the key changes that we need to make.

So that has higher margin, gross margin, than the Appliances we had shipped previously. And as we look through the year, we will have another doubling of that capacity for the 5330 coming later in the year. So there's a lot of opportunity to improve the margins in our Appliances business with the leadership and mix to the 5330 and moving up to the higher capacity later this year."

So one of the things that we're doing as we've streamlined the product line to one single subscription offering is now thinking about some merchandising or different segmentation of that. So it's still the same basic product, which means we get a lot of cost efficiency there but having a premium capability allows us to offer more for the customers who want more. So the premium offering has an MSRP of $89.99. That allows you to protect up to 10 devices, includes parental controls and online backup. So that's a lot more capability than what you get with the basic Norton Security. All of the offerings will have the same level of enterprise-grade security provided to the consumer. So that's what we're doing on the premium offering. In addition to that, obviously, we're focused on the Norton business and improving our online customer acquisition. So there are a lot of AB testing going on there, looking at keywords and other things to make sure we are making the most of acquiring online customers. We talked about the immigration to the subscription service. That's something that started in North America with the December quarter. We just announced the subscription and sort of launching that basically in the month of September. So that just started. So everyone in North America will be on a subscription service as we lap that by 4 quarters. We're now just launching that internationally, so that's happening now in April to June period internationally. And of course, that will take us another year to get everyone on subscription service internationally. In addition, the distribution partnerships, we have partnerships today with Comcast, Deutsche Telekom and SoftBank in Japan, so covering some of the major regions. We're looking at whether we can expand distribution through additional partnerships. And in fact, one that we just added is a company América Móvil, one of the largest carriers in Latin America. They have several hundred million customers in Latin America, which we would have not been able to access before. Through a partnership like this, we're pretty excited about what these partnerships can bring to the Norton business going forward. So a lot happening in Norton besides just focus on margin."

As we talked about in previous calls, we have a new channel program, which is very much in place, giving the channel better economics for getting certified in key product lines. So as that has occurred, there are opportunities to get better economics from us as they focus on our products and learn more about them. Works both ways. We expect that to be able to help us build their volume, as well as provide better economics for them as they get certified. So I'd say overall, we feel very good about where our channel program is and the enthusiasm we're seeing from the channel."

35000,290267022,815748,"Symantec Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, May 14, 2015",2015-05-14,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Helyn, and good afternoon.

Fiscal '15 was a transformative year for Symantec, as we improved our profitability and laid the foundation for future growth. We focused on returning to growth and rightsizing our cost structure, achieved our profitability targets and returned significant cash to shareholders while preparing for the separation. We increased our R&D spending and shifted R&D dollars to focus on growth areas, delivering 41 Enterprise Security products and 17 Veritas products in fiscal '15. In the March quarter, Symantec achieved revenue growth for the first time in 3 quarters. Our confidence that this momentum will continue is underscored by leading indicators such as implied billings and deferred revenue. For the full year, implied billings increased 4% and grew in every quarter. In addition, deferred revenue grew 1% for the year and posted 2 consecutive quarters of growth.
Now let's review some key highlights for each segment, starting with Information Management. Exponential data growth continues due to the increased use of mobile, virtualization and hybrid cloud technology. These trends are creating opportunity for Veritas. At Veritas, we continue to make progress on our plan to accelerate growth and expand operating margin. Veritas returned to growth in fiscal '15 with revenue up 4% year-over-year and expanding operating margin from Q1 to Q4. We continue to build momentum in this business with 4 consecutive quarters of accelerating year-over-year revenue growth to 6% in the fourth quarter, up from 5% in the third quarter. 
Enterprise backup continues to be the largest growth driver for Veritas. NetBackup appliances grew 46% in fiscal '15, accelerating to 88% in the fourth quarter. This success was driven by the recent launch of our NetBackup 5330 appliance, which more than doubled the capacity of the prior model, giving us the ability to expand into larger enterprise environments. As an example, in the March quarter, we signed a $6 million Appliances deal with a major telco provider based on our backup appliance's ease-of-use and lower total cost of ownership. While our appliance is the fastest growing in the market, we've only penetrated 10% of our installed base. 
Our NetBackup software also grew above market, achieving growth of 11% in fiscal '15. Additionally, we saw strength in our archiving and eDiscovery products with Enterprise Vault growing 5% and eDiscovery accelerating its growth to 11% in the fourth quarter. We expect our momentum to continue in fiscal '16 driven by increased R&D investment, which is leading to new releases in every one of our foundational enterprise products, as well as next-generation solutions, which expand our addressable market and provide new capabilities such as Information Orchestration, IT Resiliency and Information Map.
Moving to our Consumer Security segment. During fiscal '15, we expanded our Consumer Security operating margin to 53% by streamlining our operations through business simplification and cost reduction. In fiscal '16, we expect to maintain our Norton operating margin between 52% and 54%. The Norton organization is also focused on key initiatives to mitigate revenue declines while maintaining our current profitability, which include increasing customer acquisition by refining our marketing messaging and optimizing our pricing for our premium service offering; migrating existing consumers from an annual renewal to our subscription offering; boosting retention by improving the user experience throughout the customer life cycle, including informing customers where Norton has blocked high-profile threats; and lastly, expanding distribution channels through telcos and other service providers.
Moving to our Enterprise Security segment. The increasing complexity of threats, the scarcity of cybersecurity talent and the need for actionable, intelligent security solutions are driving opportunities in our Enterprise Security business. During fiscal '15, we returned Endpoint Protection to market growth, continued to take share in data loss prevention, established a strong presence in Internet response services and reallocated investments to growth areas such as threat protection, information protection and cybersecurity services. And to better protect Symantec customers, we operate the largest civilian cyber intelligence threat network in the world, updated at a rate of 200,000 threats per second. This is the foundation for Symantec's Unified Security Analytics platform.  
In fiscal '15, we experienced a strong resurgence in Endpoint Security, which grew 5% during the full year and accelerated to 6% growth in the fourth quarter, driven by increasing awareness of attacks on the endpoint, where most unencrypted data resides. Our data loss prevention or DLP offering also experienced above-market growth of 14% in fiscal '15 and is the undisputed leader in the market with double the share of the next largest competitor. DLP growth accelerated to 33% in the fourth quarter as we expanded DLP into cloud deployments such as Office 365. 
Another important part of our Enterprise Security business is Trust Services. We are the world's largest SSL Certificate authentication provider with 44% market share. Trust Services had a record year, reporting the highest revenue in its history, growing 4% in fiscal '15 and driven primarily by our enterprise offering that solves for a comprehensive set of website security challenges.
Our cybersecurity services also showed strong momentum in fiscal '15. We now have one of the broadest service offerings in the industry, covering the full attack life cycle from before, during and after a breach. Our Incident Response service has engaged over 120 customers since its launch just a year ago. We expanded both the breadth and depth of our services by launching new Incident Response Retainer and Simulation services. The Retainer Service, which launched in mid-February, is already off to a strong start, signing up major global brands and government clients in multiple regions in the first few weeks of availability. 
In the area of advanced threat protection, we have now entered the ATP market, which is growing at 40% per year. Earlier this month, we shipped the first 2 of our advanced threat protection solutions, the ATP Network appliance and ATP Email. By early fall, we will deliver our ATP Endpoint offering. Our key ATP solution has 2 key differentiators: one, integration of the endpoint, email and network control points and our ability to gather, correlate and analyze data across all 3; and two, it leverages the combined intelligence of our Unified Security Analytics platform.
In conclusion, we're confident that the momentum we've established in fiscal '15 sets a strong foundation for future growth and improving profitability in fiscal '16. As we outlined at Financial Analyst Day, we expect Veritas to grow 4% to 7% in fiscal '16 and significantly expand operating margin to between 27% and 29% by growing our core portfolio and offering differentiated next-generation information availability and insight solutions that address an expanded market opportunity. In Consumer Security, we expect to maintain operating margins of 52% to 54% while executing on our initiatives to mitigate Norton's revenue decline to down 5% to 8% in fiscal '16. In Enterprise Security, we will leverage our global scale and unique assets to drive differentiated offerings in threat protection, information protection, cybersecurity services and Unified Security Analytics to accelerate revenue growth to between 1% and 6% in fiscal '16.
Now I'll turn it over to Thomas to provide a review of our fourth quarter financial results and guidance for our fiscal first quarter. Thomas?"
35000,290267022,815748,"Symantec Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, May 14, 2015",2015-05-14,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon.

Through increased focus, we are returning to growth, rightsizing the cost structure and improving our profitability. We also returned more than $900 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. All of this was accomplished in the midst of executing the Veritas separation. 
Implied billings grew 4% in fiscal year '15 compared to the 8% decline in fiscal year '14. Deferred revenue grew 1% to $3.7 billion compared to the 6% decline in fiscal year '14, giving us confidence in our growth trajectory. We reported non-GAAP operating margin of 27.3% for the year. We are pleased with this progress and the momentum as we enter fiscal year '16. 
Now let me provide some details on the fourth quarter financial results. We delivered non-GAAP revenue of $1.55 billion, within our guided range. The U.S. dollar continued to appreciate significantly against major currencies, which created a headwind of $111 million to our fourth quarter revenue and $292 million to deferred revenue on a year-over-year basis. Our implied billings were up 2% year-over-year, now the fourth consecutive quarter of growth, and deferred revenue accrued for the second consecutive quarter. License revenue continued its positive trend from last quarter, growing 10% year-over-year, driven by Appliances and DLP. The number of larger deals greater than $300,000 and larger than $1 million increased 35% and 82%, respectively. We saw particular strength in banking, government and telecom.
Moving now to our business segments. Information Management revenue increased 6% to $619 million. NetBackup appliances and software generated impressive double-digit year-over-year growth. Strength in enterprise backup was offset by continued weakness in Backup Exec and Storage Management. Non-GAAP operating margin for the IM segment increased by 120 basis points year-over-year. 
We drove non-GAAP operating margin for the Consumer Security segment to 55%, up 610 basis points year-over-year and 285 basis points sequentially. We accomplished this through continuing to reduce complexity in the business, streamlining product offerings and optimizing marketing spend. As expected, non-GAAP revenue declined 7% to $438 million due to the exit of OEM and retail channel arrangements. 
Enterprise Security revenue was flat year-over-year at $491 million, driven by double-digit growth in DLP and growth of 6% in Endpoint Protection. This growth was offset by weakness in Endpoint Management. Non-GAAP operating margin for the Enterprise Security segment was 10% compared to 15% in the year-ago period, driven by the stronger U.S. dollar and increased R&D investment. Non-GAAP gross margin decreased 100 basis points to 82.7%, primarily due to substantial growth in our Appliance business.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 25.6%, negatively affected by a true-up of $11 million to defined benefit plans, primarily in our EMEA region, and an $8 million impact due to the strengthening U.S. dollar compared to our guided rate. Excluding these items, operating margin for the quarter would have been within the guided range. We incurred restructuring costs of $61 million and separation costs of $43 million during the March quarter. In fiscal year '16, we expect to incur restructuring costs between $56 million to $86 million and separation costs between $89 million to $109 million.  Non-GAAP net income of $299 million resulted in fully diluted earnings per share of $0.43, down 10% year-over-year. The true-up of the defined benefit plan reduced EPS by roughly $0.01 per share.
Now turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operating activities for the March quarter totaled $488 million, bringing cash flow for the year to $1.3 billion, up 2% from fiscal '14, driven primarily by the increase in deferred revenue. Capital expenditures were $81 million, up 5% year-over-year as we continue to build out our IT infrastructure. We returned $227 million to shareholders during the March quarter via share repurchases and dividends. $102 million was in the form of cash dividends, and the $125 million was used to repurchase 4.9 million shares at an average share price of $25.55. We have $1.2 billion remaining under the current stock repurchase authorization as of April 3, 2015.
Now I'd like to briefly review our revenue and efficiency initiatives. Overall, these initiatives exceeded fiscal '15 targets, delivering over $150 million in incremental operational profit. 
Let me highlight several significant achievements. The renewal team exceeded its targets and improved the renewal rates. The license compliance team accelerated its audit activity and beat its full year targets. Our pricing optimization efforts resulted in a significant improvement in price realization. And optimizing the Norton business and streamlining product support delivered cost savings and operating margin improvement. These initiatives continue to realize incremental benefit throughout the business, and we are now tracking at a run rate of roughly $250 million in incremental operating profit into fiscal '16.
Before I review our guidance, I'd like to briefly discuss the separation of the Veritas and the security businesses. In April, we completed an important milestone with the separation of the 2 sales forces. We are on track to separate Veritas as a standalone company on January 2, 2016. Operationally, we'll be 2 separated companies on October 3, 2015. We expect to file the Form 10 in August, which will provide you with more details on the business and Veritas' carve-out financials.
Now I would like to reiterate guidance for fiscal '16, which we previously provided at our Financial Analyst Day. For fiscal '16, revenue is expected to be between $6.21 billion to $6.35 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 0% to 2% after adjusting for the extra week and foreign currency. Operating margin is expected to be between 29% and 30%, resulting in EPS in the range of $1.80 to $1.90. Our guidance for the year assumes an exchange rate of $1.13. We expect cash flow from operations to grow 12% in fiscal '16. For the June 2015 quarter, our guidance assumes an exchange rate of $1.10. It's important to note that the year-ago June 2014 quarter included an extra week and the revenue for that extra week was $113 million, which we are excluding from our year-over-year calculations of growth rate. We expect revenue to be between $1.5 billion to $1.54 billion, representing growth of 1% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect operating margin to be between 27% and 28%, representing expansion of 685 basis points year-over-year at the midpoint and resulting in an EPS in the range of $0.41 to $0.44. Typically, our June revenue is down sequentially 1% to 2% on an as-reported basis. Our June 2015 revenue guidance reflects normal seasonality.
In conclusion, I am pleased with all the progress the team has made in fiscal '15, and I'm excited about our growth prospects.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Helyn to begin taking your questions."

Our restructuring costs in fiscal year '15 were about $206 million, and we forecast restructuring and separation costs at the midpoint of $150 million. So it's about $50 million to $60 million lighter. We expect on top of that continued operational improvement and an increase in deferred revenue, and that would deliver the delta and explains the $200 million improvement year-over-year."

So that is another $117 million impact that you would have to correct for. And that would make the comparable revenue number about $1.505 billion. So we guided revenue for this quarter in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.54 billion. So at the midpoint of $1.52 billion, that would be a year-over-year growth of 1%. So the math is a little bit tricky, but I think it shows that the momentum that we have been talking about is continuing.

Increased interest in the endpoint, which is allowing us to accelerate the growth of our SEP product, as we talk about that, it accelerated its growth in Q4 up to 6% year-over-year.

We're going to be investing in that area because we see some opportunity. To your question, we've seen not only strength in Endpoint and DLP going forward, but also ATP, our advanced threat protection. Of course, we just introduced the first 2 parts of that three-pronged solution in this quarter, in the current quarter that we're in. And in fact, it was early May. But now we're going to add the third in the first half, which is Endpoint, and that we think that's going to give us the strongest capability for advanced threat position that exists in the marketplace. I would be happy to talk about why we feel that way. Our Trust Services businesses now is bigger and continues to grow. And our cybersecurity services, we're seeing business activity there that is quite strong that we feel confident will lead to revenue growth in FY '16. So not only will the loss from Endpoint Management be smaller, as you pointed out, but strength from a broader cross-section of products in FY '16. One of the things that we're enthused about, too, if I could just add, Keith, is, of course, our dedicated sales focus. So this will be the first time, and it just started this quarter, where you've got dedicated sales forces, one for security, one for Veritas.

We were very clear to apply the learnings from several years ago. Good example of that is there was no fifth quarter to drain the pipeline that happened before we made that dramatic change in sales force September 2013, if I remember the date right. So that was not the way we approach that this time. And of course, you could argue, that was a much more disruptive change in general because you're splitting new versus renewals. So the skill set, you could say, that is required and whether we got that right could be questioned. So not that type of change. Some of the focus by business line had partially begun, especially in the more mature markets, but now that's completed. We began the planning for this about 6 months ago. We named the sales leadership at the top level right around September. Even though we were not able to publicly announce the separation at that time, we knew that announcement would be coming. And now we've had worldwide sales conferences for both Veritas and Symantec, which I think were very successful, where we not only got those folks together. Everybody knows which lane they're playing in, to use your language, and what their quota is and territory, et cetera, their management. But also, we're training for very focused sales plays. If you looked at the evolution of the product line from 2 years ago to today, it's much more streamlined in terms of where our focus is by product area. And we want to make sure that our sales force is capable of running the sales plays in these focused areas. And then the point we just made a minute ago, we've increased the quota-carrying reps 20% on the Veritas side, 40% on the Symantec side. So many more quota-carrying reps while we've actually reduced the overall sales headcount. So we have a much more focused sales force, not only in terms of product line but folks with a quota that they need to meet. I think we have made the key changes that we need to make. What we'll need to do from here is more of a fine-tuning nature."

I think we have been -- I'm trying to be clear on this topic. It was driven, of course, by currency headwinds to a certain extent, but also by the huge growth we have seen in the Appliance segment. Mike talked about their year-over-year compares. So this has diluted the margins to a certain extent. And if we look now forward, we are quite confident that we can recover that for a variety of reasons. So we will see margin improvement on the Veritas side just based on the higher revenue. We also see that the cost and efficiency momentum that Veritas is carrying is going to deliver significant improvement year-over-year. And the margin dilution effect of the Appliances is becoming smaller with the shipment of the new products addressing a higher-end market, and having to be very honest, by itself, a significantly higher margin compared to the current version of Appliances that we ship."

So one of the things that we're doing as we've streamlined the product line to one single subscription offering is now thinking about some merchandising or different segmentation of that. So it's still the same basic product, which means we get a lot of cost efficiency there, but having a premium capability allows us to offer more for the customers who want more. So the premium offering has an MSRP of $89.99. That allows you to protect up to 10 devices, includes parental controls and online backup. So that's a lot more capability than what you get with the basic Norton Security. All of the offerings will have the same level of enterprise-grade security provided to the consumer. So that's what we're doing on the premium offering. In addition to that, obviously, we're focused on the Norton business and improving our online customer acquisition. So there's a lot of A/B testing going on there, looking at keywords and other things to make sure that we are making the most of acquiring online customers. We talked about the migration to the subscription service. That's something that started in North America with the December quarter. We just announced the subscription and started launching that basically in the month of September. So that just started. So everyone in North America will be on a subscription service as we lap that by 4 quarters. We're now just launching that internationally, so that's happening now in the April to June period internationally. And of course, that will take us another year to get everyone on subscription service internationally. In addition, the distribution partnerships, we have partnerships today with Comcast, Deutsche Telekom and SoftBank in Japan, so covering some of the major regions. We're looking at whether we can expand distribution through additional partnerships. And in fact, one that we just added is a company, América Móvil, one of the largest carriers in Latin America. They have several hundred million customers in Latin America, which we would have not been able to access before through a partnership like this. We're pretty excited about what these partnerships can bring to the Norton business going forward. So a lot happening in Norton besides just the focus on margin."

As we talked about in previous calls, we have a new channel program, which is very much in place, giving the channel better economics for getting certified in key product lines.

Today, I'm pleased to announce that Symantec has entered into definitive agreement to sell the Veritas business to Carlyle for $8 billion in cash. The transaction is expected to close by the end of our third quarter of f",1611,"Thank you, Sean, and good morning. Today, I'm pleased to announce that Symantec has entered into definitive agreement to sell the Veritas business to Carlyle for $8 billion in cash. The transaction is expected to close by the end of our third quarter of fiscal '16. For Symantec, the proceeds of this all-cash transaction will further strengthen our financial foundation, allowing us to return significant cash to shareholders and enhance our portfolio of solutions as the world's largest cybersecurity company. As you know, in October 2014, we announced our decision to separate Symantec into 2 independent companies by spinning off our Veritas business. Consistent with its fiduciary duties, our board considered other options for our Veritas business and ultimately determined that a sale of Veritas to Carlyle is in the best interest of Symantec's shareholders because it delivers both an attractive and certain value. Given the large cash proceeds that we will receive at closing, we are committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy, one that is balanced and appropriately aligned with the size and structure of our go-forward business and allows Symantec to both invest in the business and return capital to shareholders. Accordingly, our Board of Directors authorized both increasing the stock buyback program by an additional $1.5 billion so that we now have the authorization to buy up to $2.6 billion and maintain our $0.15 quarterly dividend, substantially increasing our dividend payout ratio. 
In addition, our increased financial flexibility will allow Symantec to pursue organic and inorganic opportunities to accelerate our Unified Security strategy, which consists of 3 elements: First, a unified security analytics platform that leverages big data analytics of our vast telemetry to enhance visibility of realtime global threats and powers analytics applications; second, using this analytics platform to provide best-in-class consumer and Enterprise Security software; and third, Cybersecurity Services that provide a full suite of services from Monitoring to Incident Response to Threat Intelligence supported by over 500 cybersecurity experts and 9 global security response centers. This strategy is resonating well with our customers. 
The sale of Veritas marks a significant inflection point for Symantec. Upon closing of the transaction, Symantec will be focused as the world's largest cybersecurity company in a rapidly growing market. We will have substantial financial flexibility to accelerate our Unified Security strategy and capitalize on growth opportunities. Our ambition is to reshape the industry by harnessing our unique assets and unrivaled telemetry to lead in security analytics. 
Now I'd like to comment on Q1 results. As a focused cybersecurity business, we expect to build on our momentum from fiscal year '15. However, Q1 was disappointing as our revenue was flat in a quarter with significant complexity. First, we manage the major sales force transition, establishing dedicated and separate Veritas and Symantec sales and marketing organizations. With this transition, we formed a new management structure that affected the majority of our sales territories and sales people. Second, we continued our ongoing separation activities, namely, separating our IT infrastructure, including testing and new ERP system for Veritas, assigned dedicated personnel within HR, legal, finance and IT to support Veritas and allocating our real estate worldwide to support 2 stand-alone companies. Third, and what we didn't anticipate, was managing the Veritas sale process that involved extensive due diligence with multiple parties. The complexity of managing these 3 efforts simultaneously resulted in disappointing execution for both Symantec and Veritas from which we expect to recover in Q2 as our sales force transition and the due diligence associated with the Veritas sale are now behind us.
Moving on to Enterprise Security. Our Enterprise Security segment includes our Threat Protection products, Information Protection products, Trust Services, and Cybersecurity Services. In total, this segment grew 1% in Q1, it's first quarter of growth in 2 years. And we are building stronger momentum with a robust pipeline of new solutions in fiscal '16. We expect to strongly benefit from this product pipeline in the second half of fiscal '16 and through improved sales force execution as our global installed base of customers adopts these new solutions. As a result, we continue to see a path to sustained growth in the second half of fiscal '16 for our Enterprise Security business. 
Threat Protection, which includes our Endpoint Security, Endpoint Management, mail, web, and data security offerings, decline 1% in Q1. Excluding our Endpoint Management product line which declined this quarter, our threat protection offerings grew 2%. In particular, our flagship Endpoint Security product line continued to show strong momentum with 6% growth for the second consecutive quarter. 
In Q1, we released our ATP Network and ATP Email modules in limited availability to about 2 dozen customers in the financial services, telecom, consumer products and health care industries. We are working with these customers to ensure our solutions are delivering the highest value. To date, about half of these customers have already moved into production. And we also released a beta version of our ATP Endpoint module. With these introductions, we have entered the multibillion advanced threat protection market growing at 40% per year. All 3 Symantec ATP modules will be available in the second half of fiscal year '16. They will be highly differentiated from competitive products because they can detect, correlate, and prioritize incidents across the endpoint, e-mails and network threat vectors and leverage the combined intelligence of our Unified Security platform. In fact, in recent third-party efficacy testing, our ATP solutions outperformed competitive offerings from FireEye and Cisco. 
Information Protection, which includes our DLP, encryption, and identity and access management offerings grew 3% year-over-year in Q1. We launched DLP 14 in late Q1, which extends our on-premise DLP capabilities to cloud applications such as Box and Office 365. 
In Q1, Cybersecurity Services revenue grew between 2% and 3% as we continue to expand our offerings to meet growing customer needs to manage every phase of the attack life cycle. During the quarter, we introduced our CyberOne offering and signed our first multimillion deal for the offering. CyberOne combines our Intelligence, Monitoring and Incident Response Services into a single comprehensive offering. 
We also won several Incident Response deals across health care, oil and gas, telecommunications, government, media and technology. In particular, 40% of our new customers came from health care in the wake of recent breaches in that sector. 
Additionally, in Q1, our Cybersecurity Services team also released our ATP Monitoring Service, where our Cybersecurity Services organization combines our ATP technology and our Managed Services offering to monitor threats remotely, all powered by our global SOCs. 
Trust Services, which includes our SSL and PKI solutions, is the worlds largest SSL certificate authentication provider with greater than 40% market share, protecting the world's e-commerce. Trust Services had another solid quarter with 3% growth. And this quarter, Trust Services added further enhancements to SSL Assistant Plus, cutting the time it takes to secure websites down to minutes for small retailers. 
Now onto the Consumer Security segment. As a number of devices in the home continues to grow and hackers become increasingly sophisticated, we believe Norton is more relevant than ever for our customers and for Symantec. And just the last few weeks, we've seen new vulnerabilities that expose Mac and Android devices to attack. Norton's core security service offering includes protection for mobile and Mac devices as well as Windows, providing not only device protection but also capabilities to detect phishing and scams. In addition, our services for managing customer passwords, backing up data and supervising children's activities online continues to be important for our customers. And of course, the aggregated telemetry from our global footprint of Norton users powers our Unified Security analytics. In the future, we know that IoT-connected devices will also be vulnerable to attack, and we believe Norton can play a greater role in protecting all the devices in the homes of our customers. 
Our Consumer Security segment performed better than expected in Q1 as we continue to migrate our customers to a cloud-based subscription service. Revenue declined 6% versus a 7% decline in Q4, and operating margin expanded to a record 57% due to continued operational improvements. We're also seeing improvements in key levers of our Norton business such as online customer acquisition. Direct web acquisition of customers generated over 0.5 million new units of our core Norton security offering in Q1. More importantly, we believe the lifetime value of each of these customers is 25% higher with a subscription model.
Moving onto our Information Management segment. We expanded operating margin to 23% from 14% in the prior year and revenue grew by over 3% driven by continued strength in NetBackup and Appliances. Veritas continues to drive the transition to Integrated Backup Appliances. According to IDC, Veritas claimed the #1 share of the open systems integrated backup appliance submarket for the first time at 47% share in the March 2015 quarter. We are releasing several products this summer, which we believe will underpin additional growth for Veritas. 
First, NetBackup 7.7 provides enhanced data center integration across industry platforms, with significantly faster cloud performance than our previous release. Second, InfoScale provides availability and software-defined storage to address Enterprise business continuity needs. Third, the Veritas Resiliency Platform ensures critical data remain accessible across complex, multi-vendor physical and virtual environments. And fourth, Information Map is the first cloud application bolt-on our Information Fabric technology to enable customers to gain better visibility into their unstructured data. 
With its strong and broad product portfolio, Veritas is well positioned to compete in a growing market. 
Now I'll turn it over to Thomas to provide a review of our first quarter financial results and guidance for our second quarter fiscal quarter. Thomas?"
35000,301292864,858309,"Symantec Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 11, 2015",2015-08-11,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. The $8 billion sale price for Veritas delivers a certain and attractive valuation to Symantec, simplifies the separation process, and provides financial flexibility to invest in our future. This is an all-cash",1063,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. The $8 billion sale price for Veritas delivers a certain and attractive valuation to Symantec, simplifies the separation process, and provides financial flexibility to invest in our future. This is an all-cash transaction, which we expect to close by the end of the third quarter of this fiscal year. After certain closing adjustments and the payment of taxes at the rate of approximately 20%, we expect to receive net cash proceeds of $6.3 billion, all of which 35% will reside in the U.S. 
To demonstrate our commitment now and in the future to returning capital to shareholders, our Board of Directors immediately authorized an increase of the stock buyback program to $2.6 billion. This new authorization enables us to retain flexibility as we finalize our capital allocation strategy in the anticipation of the transactions closing by the end of our third fiscal quarter. We intend to repurchase the first $2 billion over the next 18 months. 
The board also decided to maintain our $0.15 quarterly dividend, thereby substantially increasing our dividend payout ratio post separation. Together, between dividends and buybacks, we expect to return about 120% of our after-tax domestic cash proceeds from the sale to our shareholders over the next 18 months. 
Now let me turn to first quarter financial results. Implied billings declined 7% year-over-year and revenue was flat at $1.5 billion. As Mike noted earlier, the complexity of managing our sales force transition and our ongoing separation effort in parallel with the extensive due diligence process associated with the Veritas sale resulted in disappointing top line execution during the quarter. We continue to expect our Enterprise Security business to grow in the second half of fiscal '16. 
The U.S. dollar strengthened against major currencies compared to the year-ago period, which created a headwind of $115 million to first quarter revenue and $266 million to deferred revenue on a year-over-year basis. However, currency effects had a $2 billion positive impact on revenue as compared to the guidance we provided on May 14.
In addition to foreign currency effects, we estimate the June 2014 period had approximately $113 million of additional revenue from an extra 14th week of activity versus 13 weeks in June 2015 period. 
Moving now to our business segments. Information Management revenue increased 3% to $587 million. NetBackup software and Appliances grew 10% and 19%, respectively. This strength was offset by weakness in our Backup Execu and in the Information Availability offerings. Non-GAAP operating margin for the IM segment increased by 11.4 percentage points year-over-year to 23% driven by cost reductions and an increase in revenue.
In the Consumer Security segment, revenue declined 6% to $430 million. We delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 57%, up 8.2 percentage points year-over-year and 2 percentage points sequentially. Our operating margin was higher than we anticipated, primarily as a result of continued operational improvements. We continue to expect Norton revenue to decline 5% to 8% for fiscal '16 and operating margin to return to our guided range of 52% to 54% as we invest in additional marketing initiatives to improve our customer experience in our growing online acquisition rate. 
Enterprise Security revenue grew 1% year-over-year the $482 million. Endpoint Security posted another solid quarter, growing 6% year-over-year. Continued weakness in our Endpoint Management offering was a significant headwind for this segment. Non-GAAP operating margin for Enterprise Security was 6% as we invested in R&D despite lower-than-expected revenue. 
Moving down to the income statement. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 27.4%, an increase of 480 basis points year-over-year, driven by lower spend as we aligned costs with lower revenue. We will continue to make operational improvements to our business to expand our operating margin as we approach our long-term target of 30%. Non-GAAP net income of $275 million resulted in fully diluted earnings per share of $0.40. 
Now turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operating activities for the June quarter totaled $300 million. We incurred restructuring costs of $22 million and separation costs of $63 million during the June quarter. The costs were higher than expected as we accelerated our separation activities to prepare for our sale of the Veritas business. However, we do not expect total separation costs to increase compared to our prior estimate.
Capital expenditures were $78 million. We expect second quarter CapEx to be higher as we work to complete the Veritas separation. 
During the quarter, we instituted a blackout period associated with the sale of Veritas, which limited us from repurchasing company shares. As a result, we returned $193 million to shareholders during the June quarter by our share repurchases and dividends. $103 million was in the form of cash dividends and $90 million was used to repurchase 4 million shares at an average share price of $24.39.
The 8 revenue and efficiency initiatives we undertook in fiscal year '15 continue to provide incremental benefits and operating profit in fiscal '16. Given the complexity of the first quarter, we are expanding our set of revenue and efficiency initiatives to help improve our top line and better optimize our cost base. Some of these initiatives will include accelerating our license compliance program and optimizing our end-of-life approach to better align with industry standards. Combined with our original fiscal '15 initiatives, we believe this expanded set will drive margin expansion and improve top line performance as they accelerate through the year.
Now moving on to guidance. For the September 2015 quarter, we are providing guidance for a combined Symantec that includes Veritas. We expect to move the Information Management business results and balance sheet to discontinued operations starting in the December quarter, and we will adjust our full year guidance during our November earnings call to reflect this change. 
Our September 2015 quarter guidance assumes an exchange rate of $1.11. We expect revenue to be between $1.485 billion to $1.525 billion, up slightly quarter-over-quarter at the mid-point. We expect operating margin to be between 26% to 28%, resulting in EPS in the range of $0.40 to $0.43. In conclusion, I am pleased with all the progress the team has made in making the sale of Veritas business happen, and I'm excited about our organic and inorganic growth opportunities as the world's largest cybersecurity company. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mike for some final comments."

So the basic endpoint technology that we use is shared across consumer and enterprise and the threat telemetry is also very important. One of the things that we're seeing in today's environment is that many of our Enterprise customers are interested in Norton capabilities to help protect the folks, their customers, who come to their websites and access corporate data. So we think going forward, there's probably a lot more opportunity for the Norton business and the Enterprise Security business to be working together."

There are some synergies -- these synergies, I should say, that we avoid by not having a standard Veritas as a public company.

So that was an indication to us that this really is a short-term execution issue as opposed to something that is can be problematic in 1 particular part of the business. As it relates to our geographic performance, I think that we had my frankly, a relatively stronger performance in the APJ region, and to a lesser extent, Europe. So we feel like those businesses were performing fine for us. We just need to execute better in Q2 and we believe we will. As it relates to regulatory changes that might occur, yes, those can potentially be a stimulus for the business. But in general, we do not favor regulatory changes that create mandatory responses. What's going on in a threat environment is so complex it's pretty difficult to prescribe something that works in every situation. So we would prefer that there'd be flexibility in terms of the regulatory environment, so that we can adapt to threats more rapidly and create the right response for customers depending on the situation."

Yes, we decided that what made sense for us in terms of launching ATP, and as you know network and e-mail are out today with our endpoint product really in beta, but coming in the September quarter. We decided what made sense is that kind of a controlled availability that would allow us to work very closely with some key customers up front and make sure they were getting the value from the product. And that's been a very successful strategy for us. Not only have our customers seen that we have a higher efficacy rate relative to what they have with ATP solutions in place today, meaning we're finding more things than some of the ATP solutions that have been on the market. But a good portion of those customers have now moved from that controlled availability into production. So we expect that when we get the full power of the solution, which will include the endpoint module, we'll really be capturing a lot more of the threats and helping customers to prioritize those relative to where they have, with the technology that they have today. So I think the key advantages as we've talked about, Pat, the ability to prioritize incidents rather than just flood security upside with lots of alerts. The fact that we're doing a lot of our detection from the cloud, our payroll detonation is cloud-based. And therefore, we do not need to sell customers an expensive appliance for them to have advanced threat protection capability. And then most importantly, the ability to correlate what they're seeing in their own environment with the Unified Security analytics platform, which gives access to all of that threat telemetry that we see at Symantec. So we think those 3 advantages are absolutely critical and really resonating with customers."

Obviously, being a focused security company now, it's really about how do we continue to make progress on the consumer business. We've seen that a lot of the fundamentals are improving now having actually gone through the transition of shedding the unprofitable revenue. We're focused now from a consumer standpoint on online acquisition and also the relationships we have with major telcos. So as we talked about before, there's an opportunity to partner with major telcos and cable companies. So Comcast, Deutsche Telekom, Softbank. We've talked about America Movil in Latin America. So the partnering we're doing there plus what we're changing in terms of the way we're attracting consumers gives us not only a more profitable business going forward, but one that in the future as we expand to Internet of Things and other opportunities there, gives us an opportunity to get that business back to flat if not growing again. And then, if we combine that with the Enterprise space, which is already growing as we talked about that business on a constant currency basis growing for the first time in 2 years, I think strengths -- speaks to the strength of the product that we have in the portfolio as well as the customer base. So as we look out for the rest of this year, we're very excited about our ATP offerings. We just talked about that with Pat, the fact that we believe you're going to have perhaps the most competitive differentiated ATP offering that puts Symantec into a multibillion dollar market growing at 40% per year that we now participated in before and we feel like we've got a great product there. For information protection, our DLP offerings, so we're going to continue to make DLP available to protect cloud-based workloads, and our DLP 14 offering really extends the DLP capability for our cloud workloads. Box, Office 365 we talked about, and we've got plans to expand that further. In addition, a product area that's been weaker for us, Endpoint Management, is one where we are putting some increased focus as we're going to have a new cloud-based, endpoint Management product coming later this year. And then unified security analytics platform that underpins this strategy. We're making great progress on that in some of the applications for that analytics platform are going to be available by the end of the year, which has received tremendous reception from financial services firms. So I'm pretty excited about the portfolio, the progress we're making on the consumer side and the customer reception to the new offerings. So that's what gives us confidence that the second half of fiscal '16 is going to be some -- new territory for us as we begin growing this business again."

I'd say the key difference is we started with a strategy here. So the Unified Security strategy, which we've laid out in some detail, gives us a very clear road map as to where acquisitions can fit in. So while security is such a broad fragmented space, we are not looking at the entire space. We got a question earlier in the call today about network security as an example. So it's not about what we do to bolt on things in security? It's about how do we accelerate this Unified Security strategy that we've talked about.

People now have some experience with their pipeline, their product lines that they need to be covering. We did pretty extensive training with our sales force to make sure that they could run what we call key sales plays in their areas. So if you're on the Symantec Security side, you know that you need to be able to sell DLP for cloud-based applications, the ATP modules and so forth. So we think over a longer period of time, we're going to have a more productive focused sales force. But obviously, we didn't see the benefits of that in the first quarter. So I think this is a onetime transition. I think the performance that we saw was reflected some weakness across product lines that had been doing very well, geographies that had been doing well.

As we talked about before, we introduced a new channel program last year, and the key elements of that channel program were to focus on those partners who were able to create high value versus high volume. What we mean by that is those who are actually investing in Symantec or Veritas, they were required to get certified in certain product lines so that we had a channel sales force that was focused on what are the key benefits that we're bringing into the marketplace versus just focused on volume and price. And I think that's something that has resonated with the channel partners that we want to continue with going forward. We have gone through a transition now where those partners are getting aligned across the 2 different businesses, Symantec and Veritas. And I'd say that we have some additional work to do, especially on the security side. If I had to look at the channel programs that we've had, I think they favor the higher value transactions that tended to come with our Veritas portfolio. So we have a little more work to do on the Symantec side in terms of recruiting some additional partners. And in fact, we're intending to fast track about 150 additional partners for the Symantec channel as we continue through the rest of this year.

But as we go forward, there's going to be some change in the configuration of partners on the Symantec Security side to be able to allow us to have the right coverage worldwide with the channel program."

35000,301292864,858358,"Symantec Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 11, 2015",2015-08-11,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Sean, and good morning. Today, I am pleased to announce that Symantec has entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Veritas business to Carlyle for $8 billion in cash.

Today, I am pleased to announce that Symantec has entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Veritas business to Carlyle for $8 billion in cash. The transaction is expected to close by the end of our third quarter of fiscal '16. For Symantec, the proceeds of this all-cash transaction will further strengthen our financial foundation, allowing us to return significant cash to shareholders and enhance our portfolio of solutions as the world's largest cybersecurity company.
As you know, in October 2014, we announced our decision to separate Symantec into 2 independent companies by spinning off our Veritas business. Consistent with its fiduciary duties, our board considered other options for our Veritas business and ultimately determined that a sale of Veritas to Carlyle is in the best interest of Symantec shareholders because it delivers both an attractive and certain value.
Given the large cash proceeds that we will receive at closing, we are committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy, one that is balanced and appropriately aligned with the size and structure of our go-forward business, and that allows Symantec to both invest in the business and return capital to shareholders. Accordingly, our Board of Directors authorized both increasing the stock buyback program by an additional $1.5 billion so that we now have the authorization to buy up to $2.6 billion, and maintain our $0.15 quarterly dividend, substantially increasing our dividend payout ratio. 
In addition, our increased financial flexibility will allow Symantec to pursue organic and inorganic opportunities to accelerate our Unified Security strategy, which consists of 3 elements: First, a unified security analytics platform that leverages big data analytics of our vast telemetry to enhance visibility of realtime global threats, and powers analytics applications; second, using this analytics platform to provide best-in-class consumer and enterprise security software; and third, Cybersecurity Services that provide a full suite of services from Monitoring to Incident Response to Threat Intelligence, supported by over 500 cybersecurity experts and 9 global security response centers. This strategy is resonating well with our customers. 
The sale of Veritas marks a significant inflection point for Symantec. Upon closing of the transaction, Symantec will be focused as the world's largest cybersecurity company in a rapidly growing market. We will have substantial financial flexibility to accelerate our Unified Security strategy and capitalize on growth opportunities. Our ambition is to reshape the industry by harnessing our unique assets and unrivaled telemetry to lead in security analytics. 
Now I'd like to comment on Q1 results. As a focused cybersecurity business, we expect to build on our momentum from fiscal year '15. However, Q1 was disappointing as our revenue was flat in a quarter with significant complexity.
First, we managed a major sales force transition, establishing dedicated and separate Veritas and Symantec sales and marketing organizations. With this transition, we formed a new management structure that affected the majority of our sales territories and salespeople.
Second, we continued our ongoing separation activities, namely, separating our IT infrastructure, including testing a new ERP system for Veritas; assigned dedicated personnel within HR, legal, finance and IT to support Veritas; and allocating our real estate worldwide to support 2 standalone companies.
Third, and what we didn't anticipate, was managing a Veritas sale process that involved extensive due diligence with multiple parties. The complexity of managing these 3 efforts simultaneously resulted in disappointing execution for both Symantec and Veritas from which we expect to recover in Q2 as our sales force transition and the due diligence associated with the Veritas sale are now behind us.
Moving on to Enterprise Security. Our Enterprise Security segment includes our Threat Protection products, Information Protection products, Trust Services and Cybersecurity Services. In total, this segment grew 1% in Q1, its first quarter of growth in 2 years. And we are building stronger momentum with a robust pipeline of new solutions in fiscal '16. We expect to strongly benefit from this product pipeline in the second half of fiscal '16 and through improved sales force execution as our global installed base of customers adopts these new solutions. As a result, we continue to see a path to sustained growth in the second half of fiscal '16 for our Enterprise Security business. 
Threat Protection, which includes our Endpoint Security, Endpoint Management, mail, web and data center security offerings, declined 1% in Q1. Excluding our Endpoint Management product line, which declined this quarter, our Threat Protection offerings grew 2%. In particular, our flagship Endpoint Security product line continued to show strong momentum, with 6% growth for the second consecutive quarter. 
In Q1, we released our ATP Network and ATP Email modules in limited availability to about 2 dozen customers in the financial services, telecom, consumer products and health care industries. We are working with these customers to ensure our solutions are delivering the highest value. To date, about half of these customers have already moved into production. And we also released a beta version of our ATP Endpoint module. With these introductions, we have entered the multibillion-dollar advanced threat protection market growing at 40% per year.
All 3 Symantec ATP modules will be available in the second half of fiscal year '16. They will be highly differentiated from competitive products because they can detect, correlate and prioritize incidents across the endpoint, email and network threat vectors, and leverage the combined intelligence of our Unified Security Platform. In fact, in recent third-party efficacy testing, our ATP solutions outperformed competitive offerings from FireEye and Cisco. 
Information Protection, which includes our DLP, encryption, and identity and access management offerings, grew 3% year-over-year in Q1. We launched DLP 14 in late Q1, which extends our on-premise DLP capabilities to cloud applications such as Box and Office 365. 
In Q1, Cybersecurity Services revenue grew between 2% and 3% as we continued to expand our offerings to meet growing customer needs to manage every phase of the attack life cycle. During the quarter, we introduced our CyberOne offering and signed our first multimillion-dollar deal for the offering. CyberOne combines our Intelligence, Monitoring and Incident Response services into a single comprehensive offering. 
We also won several Incident Response deals across health care, oil and gas, telecommunications, government, media and technology. In particular, 40% of our new customers came from health care in the wake of recent breaches in that sector. 
Additionally, in Q1, our Cybersecurity Services team also released our ATP Monitoring Service, where our Cybersecurity Services organization combines our ATP Technology and our Managed Services offering to monitor threats remotely, all powered by our global SOCs. 
Trust Services, which includes our SSL and PKI solutions, is the world's largest SSL certificate authentication provider with greater than 40% market share, protecting the world's e-commerce. Trust Services had another solid quarter, with 3% growth. And this quarter, Trust Services added further enhancements to SSL Assistant Plus, cutting the time it takes to secure websites down to minutes for small retailers. 
Now onto the Consumer Security segment. As a number of devices in the home continues to grow and hackers become increasingly sophisticated, we believe Norton is more relevant than ever for our customers and for Symantec. In just the last few weeks, we've seen new vulnerabilities that expose Mac and Android devices to attack. Norton's core security service offering includes protection for mobile and Mac devices as well as Windows, providing not only device protection, but also capabilities to detect phishing and scams.
In addition, our services for managing customer passwords, backing up data and supervising children's activities online continues to be important for our customers. And of course, the aggregated telemetry from our global footprint of Norton users powers our Unified Security analytics. In the future, we know that IoT-connected devices will also be vulnerable to attack, and we believe Norton can play a greater role in protecting all the devices in the homes of our customers. 
Our Consumer Security segment performed better than expected in Q1 as we continue to migrate our customers to a cloud-based subscription service. Revenue declined 6% versus a 7% decline in Q4, and operating margin expanded to a record 57% due to continued operational improvements.
We're also seeing improvements in key levers of our Norton business, such as online customer acquisition. Direct web acquisition of customers generated over 0.5 million new units of our core Norton Security offering in Q1. More importantly, we believe the lifetime value of each of these customers is 25% higher with the subscription model.
Moving to our Information Management segment. We expanded operating margin to 23% from 14% in the prior year; and revenue grew by over 3%, driven by continued strength in NetBackup and Appliances. Veritas continues to drive the transition to Integrated Backup appliances. According to IDC, Veritas claimed the #1 share of the open systems integrated backup appliance submarket for the first time at 47% share in the March 2015 quarter.
We're releasing several products this summer, which we believe will underpin additional growth for Veritas.
First, NetBackup 7.7 provides enhanced data center integration across industry platforms, with significantly faster cloud performance than our previous release.
Second, InfoScale provides availability and software-defined storage to address enterprise business continuity needs.
Third, the Veritas Resiliency Platform ensures critical data remain accessible across complex, multi-vendor physical and virtual environments.
And fourth, Information Map is the first cloud application built on our Information Fabric technology to enable customers to gain better visibility into their unstructured data. 
With its strong and broad product portfolio, Veritas is well-positioned to compete in a growing market. 
Now I'll turn it over to Thomas to provide a review of our first quarter financial results and guidance for our second fiscal quarter. Thomas?"
35000,301292864,858358,"Symantec Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 11, 2015",2015-08-11,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. The $8 billion sale price for Veritas delivers a certain and attractive valuation to Symantec, simplifies the separation process and provides financial flexibility to invest in our future.This is an all-cash",1059,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. The $8 billion sale price for Veritas delivers a certain and attractive valuation to Symantec, simplifies the separation process and provides financial flexibility to invest in our future.
This is an all-cash transaction, which we expect to close by the end of the third quarter of this fiscal year. After certain closing adjustments and the payment of taxes at the rate of approximately 20%, we expect to receive net cash proceeds of $6.3 billion, of which 35% will reside in the U.S. 
To demonstrate our commitment now and in the future to returning capital to shareholders, our Board of Directors immediately authorized an increase of the stock buyback program to $2.6 billion. This new authorization enables us to retain flexibility as we finalize our capital allocation strategy in anticipation of the transaction's closing by the end of our third fiscal quarter. We intend to repurchase the first $2 billion over the next 18 months. 
The board also decided to maintain our $0.15 quarterly dividend, thereby substantially increasing our dividend payout ratio post separation. Together, between dividends and buybacks, we expect to return about 120% of our after-tax domestic cash proceeds from the sale to our shareholders over the next 18 months. 
Now let me turn to first quarter financial results. Implied billings declined 7% year-over-year, and revenue was flat at $1.5 billion. As Mike noted earlier, the complexity of managing our sales force transition and our ongoing separation effort, in parallel with the extensive due diligence process associated with the Veritas sale, resulted in disappointing top line execution during the quarter. We continue to expect our Enterprise Security business to grow in the second half of fiscal '16. 
The U.S. dollar strengthened against major currencies compared to the year-ago period, which created a headwind of $115 million to first quarter revenue and $266 million to deferred revenue on a year-over-year basis. However, currency effects had a $2 billion positive impact on revenue as compared to the guidance we provided on May 14.
In addition to foreign currency effects, we estimate the June 2014 period had approximately $113 million of additional revenue from an extra 14th week of activity versus 13 weeks in June 2015 period. 
Moving now to our business segments. Information Management revenue increased 3% to $587 million. NetBackup software and Appliances grew 10% and 19%, respectively. This strength was offset by weakness in our Backup Exec and Information Availability offerings. Non-GAAP operating margin for the IM segment increased by 11.4 percentage points year-over-year to 23%, driven by cost reductions and an increase in revenue.
In the Consumer Security segment, revenue declined 6% to $430 million. We delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 57%, up 8.2 percentage points year-over-year and 2 percentage points sequentially. Our operating margin was higher than we anticipated, primarily as a result of continued operational improvements. We continue to expect Norton revenue to decline 5% to 8% for fiscal '16, and operating margin to return to our guided range of 52% to 54% as we invest in additional marketing initiatives to improve our customer experience and our growing online acquisition rate. 
Enterprise Security revenue grew 1% year-over-year to $482 million. Endpoint Security posted another solid quarter, growing 6% year-over-year. Continued weakness in our Endpoint Management offering was a significant headwind for this segment. Non-GAAP operating margin for Enterprise Security was 6% as we invested in R&D despite lower-than-expected revenue. 
Moving down to the income statement. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 27.4%, an increase of 480 basis points year-over-year, driven by lower spend as we aligned costs with lower revenue. We will continue to make operational improvements to our business to expand our operating margin as we approach our long-term target of 30%. Non-GAAP net income of $275 million resulted in fully diluted earnings per share of $0.40. 
Now turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operating activities for the June quarter totaled $300 million. We incurred restructuring costs of $22 million and separation costs of $63 million during the June quarter. The costs were higher than expected as we accelerated our separation activities to prepare for our sale of the Veritas business. However, we do not expect total separation costs to increase compared to our prior estimate.
Capital expenditures were $78 million. We expect second quarter CapEx to be higher as we work to complete the Veritas separation. 
During the quarter, we instituted a blackout period associated with the sale of Veritas, which limited us from repurchasing company shares. As a result, we returned $193 million to shareholders during the June quarter via share repurchases and dividends. $103 million was in the form of cash dividends and $90 million was used to repurchase 4 million shares at an average share price of $24.39.
The eight revenue and efficiency initiatives we undertook in fiscal year '15 continue to provide incremental benefits and operating profit in fiscal year '16.
Given the complexity of the first quarter, we are expanding our set of revenue and efficiency initiatives to help improve our top line and better optimize our cost base. Some of these initiatives will include accelerating our license compliance program and optimizing our end-of-life approach to better align with industry standards. Combined with our original fiscal '15 initiatives, we believe this expanded set will drive margin expansion and improve top line performance as they accelerate through the year.
Now moving on to guidance. For the September 2015 quarter, we are providing guidance for a combined Symantec that includes Veritas. We expect to move the Information Management business results and balance sheet to discontinued operations starting in the December quarter, and we will adjust our full year guidance during our November earnings call to reflect this change. 
Our September 2015 quarter guidance assumes an exchange rate of $1.11. We expect revenue to be between $1.485 billion to $1.525 billion, up slightly quarter-over-quarter at the midpoint. We expect operating margin to be between 26% to 28%, resulting in EPS in the range of $0.40 to $0.43.
In conclusion, I am pleased with all the progress the team has made in making the sale of Veritas business happen, and I'm excited about our organic and inorganic growth opportunities as the world's largest cybersecurity company.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mike for some final comments."

So the basic endpoint technology that we use is shared across consumer and enterprise, and the threat telemetry is also very important. One of the things that we're seeing in today's environment is that many of our enterprise customers are interested in Norton capabilities to help protect the folks, their customers, who come to their websites and access corporate data.

And given the strong product pipeline, we believe that we have good momentum going into the back half of the year. We are expecting that the Enterprise Security business will continue and will grow to the second half -- in the second half of '16, getting us to the guidance that we put out. Maybe for the full year, slightly lower than the midpoint, but we fully expect the momentum on the Enterprise Security side to take us to growth in the second half."

Getting the $8 billion price was a critical factor, obviously, in the decision to sell versus spin. Other things that this does, as I'm sure you're aware of, is this provides certainty for shareholders as to the value rather than the ongoing execution and market risk associated with a public offering that would be later in time. And from the standpoint of separation, it really simplifies the separation process and derisks that. There are some synergies -- dyssynergies, I should say, that we avoid by not having to stand up Veritas as a public company. So I think when you put that entire equation together, we feel very good about what this does for shareholders, especially combined with our return of capital to shareholders, as we described through maintaining the dividends and the increased authorization that we have to buy up to $2.6 billion worth of stock."

That's certainly not tightly aligned with the strategy that we've outlined. And I'd say further, we are seeing a lessening of the importance of the perimeter, which also affects our thinking on network security. What I mean by that is more and more workloads are moving into the cloud. That's the basis for our Information Protection strategy, DLP, encryption, identity and access management. So we're seeing, as more workloads move to the cloud, that doesn't mean there aren't going to be a lot of next-generation firewalls sold, but architectures are changing, and we want our strategy to adapt to that."

So we feel like those businesses were performing fine for us. We just need to execute better in Q2, and we believe we will. As it relates to regulatory changes that might occur, yes, those can potentially be a stimulus for the business. But in general, we do not favor regulatory changes that create mandatory responses. What's going on in a threat environment is so complex, it's pretty difficult to prescribe something that works in every situation.

Yes, we decided that what made sense for us in terms of launching ATP, and as you know network and e-mail are out today with our Endpoint product really in beta, but coming in the September quarter. We decided what made sense is that kind of a controlled availability that would allow us to work very closely with some key customers up front and make sure they were getting the value from the product. And that's been a very successful strategy for us. Not only have our customers seen that we have a higher efficacy rate relative to what they have with ATP solutions in place today, meaning we're finding more things than some of the ATP solutions that have been in the market. But a good portion of those customers have now moved from that controlled availability into production. So we expect that when we get the full power of this solution, which will include the Endpoint module, we'll really be capturing a lot more of the threats and helping customers prioritize those relative to what they have -- with the technologies that they have today. So I think the key advantages, as we've talked about, Pat, are the ability to prioritize incidents rather than just flood a security ops center with lots of alerts. The fact that we're doing a lot of our detection from the cloud, our payload detonation is cloud-based and, therefore, we do not need to sell customers an expensive appliance for them to have advanced threat protection capability. And then most importantly, the ability to correlate what they're seeing in their own environment with the Unified Security analytics platform, which gives access to all of that threat telemetry that we see at Symantec. So we think those 3 advantages are absolutely critical and really resonating with customers."

So the partnering we're doing there, plus what we're changing in terms of the way we're attracting consumers, gives us not only a more profitable business going forward, but one that in the future, as we expand to Internet of Things and other opportunities there, gives us an opportunity to get that business back to flat, if not, growing again.

We're making great progress on that, and some of the applications for that analytics platform are going to be available by the end of the year, which has received tremendous reception from financial services firms. So I'm pretty excited about the portfolio, the progress we're making on the consumer side and the customer reception to the new offerings. So that's what gives us confidence that the second half of fiscal '16 is going to be some new territory for us as we begin growing this business again."

Well, I think we would also acknowledge that our history has been a bit mixed, but we've had some great acquisitions as well. I'd just point to you our Vontu acquisition that brought us DLP that we've created into a flagship product line for Symantec being a prime example. I'd say the key difference is we started with a strategy here, so the Unified Security strategy, which we've laid out in some detail, gives us a very clear roadmap as to where acquisitions can fit in. So while security is such a broad fragmented space, we are not looking at the entire space. We got a question earlier in the call today about network security as an example. So it's not about what do we do to bolt on things in security. It's about how do we accelerate this Unified Security strategy that we've talked about. That really gives us a great deal of focus in terms of what we're looking for. And it's very important that, as we look at potential acquisitions, we see the opportunity to accelerate that company's progress as part of our strategy and that it makes financial sense. Assets in this space are quite expensive, so we need to be very careful and make sure that whatever we look at can really deliver return for shareholders."

Well, Mike, on the sales force transition, it's very complex from a standpoint of the number of territories that were changed, but it's pretty straightforward from the standpoint of what actually happened. So you can imagine a sales force that is globally covering both Veritas business as well as Symantec Security now having to be completely separated into dedicated capability on sales and marketing, so that on April 1, folks are either working on the Veritas side on that set of products or on the Symantec Security side. So you can imagine the number of territories that changed and, of course, the management structure that was involved there. Quotas that needed to be set, pipeline that needed to be transferred, so a lot of transition activity there in this first quarter. Now as we've talked about before, that is behind us now, so we're not making any changes. People now have some experience with their pipeline, their product lines that they need to be covering. We did pretty extensive training with our sales force to make sure that they could run what we call key sales plays in their areas. So if you're on the Symantec Security side, you know that you need to be able to sell DLP for cloud-based applications, the ATP modules and so forth. So we think over a longer period of time, we're going to have a more productive-focused sales force. But obviously, we didn't see the benefits of that in the first quarter. So I think this is a onetime transition. I think the performance that we saw, which reflected some weakness across product lines, it has been doing very well. Geographies that had been doing well is further indication that it's a short-term bump in the road for us. So as we look to Q2, we believe we'll recover and get back to our plan. And then, as we talked about, there's a great opportunity to be able to see much better performance as we combine the now experienced sales force in their new configuration combined with the new offerings that are coming."

As we talked about before, we introduced a new channel program last year, and the key elements of that channel program were to focus on those partners who were able to create high value versus high volume. What we mean by that is those who are actually investing in Symantec or Veritas, they were required to get certified in certain product lines so that we had a channel sales force that was focused on what are the key benefits that we're bringing into the marketplace versus just focused on volume and price. And I think that's something that has resonated with the channel partners that we want to continue with going forward. We have gone through a transition now where those partners are getting aligned across the 2 different businesses, Symantec and Veritas. And I'd say that we have some additional work to do, especially on the security side. If I had to look at the channel programs that we've had, I think they favor the higher-value transactions that tended to come with our Veritas portfolio. So we have a little more work to do on the Symantec side in terms of recruiting some additional partners. And in fact, we're intending to fast-track about 150 additional partners for the Symantec channel as we continue through the rest of this year. So we're keeping the features of what we did with the new channel program we introduced last year, this focus on high value, the certifications, working with partners who really want to focus on our product line. But as we go forward, there's going to be some change in the configuration of partners on the Symantec Security side to be able to allow us to have the right coverage worldwide with the channel program."

35000,301292864,858396,"Symantec Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 11, 2015",2015-08-11,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Sean, and good morning. Today, I am pleased to announce that Symantec has entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Veritas business to Carlyle for $8 billion in cash. The transaction is expected to close by the end of our third quarter o",1612,"Thank you, Sean, and good morning. Today, I am pleased to announce that Symantec has entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Veritas business to Carlyle for $8 billion in cash. The transaction is expected to close by the end of our third quarter of fiscal '16. For Symantec, the proceeds of this all-cash transaction will further strengthen our financial foundation, allowing us to return significant cash to shareholders and enhance our portfolio of solutions as the world's largest cybersecurity company.
As you know, in October 2014, we announced our decision to separate Symantec into 2 independent companies by spinning off our Veritas business. Consistent with its fiduciary duties, our board considered other options for our Veritas business and ultimately determined that a sale of Veritas to Carlyle is in the best interest of Symantec shareholders because it delivers both an attractive and certain value.
Given the large cash proceeds that we will receive at closing, we are committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy, one that is balanced and appropriately aligned with the size and structure of our go-forward business, and that allows Symantec to both invest in the business and return capital to shareholders. Accordingly, our Board of Directors authorized both increasing the stock buyback program by an additional $1.5 billion so that we now have the authorization to buy up to $2.6 billion, and maintain our $0.15 quarterly dividend, substantially increasing our dividend payout ratio. 
In addition, our increased financial flexibility will allow Symantec to pursue organic and inorganic opportunities to accelerate our Unified Security strategy, which consists of 3 elements: First, a unified security analytics platform that leverages big data analytics of our vast telemetry to enhance visibility of realtime global threats, and powers analytics applications; second, using this analytics platform to provide best-in-class consumer and enterprise security software; and third, Cybersecurity Services that provide a full suite of services from Monitoring to Incident Response to Threat Intelligence, supported by over 500 cybersecurity experts and 9 global security response centers. This strategy is resonating well with our customers. 
The sale of Veritas marks a significant inflection point for Symantec. Upon closing of the transaction, Symantec will be focused as the world's largest cybersecurity company in a rapidly growing market. We will have substantial financial flexibility to accelerate our Unified Security strategy and capitalize on growth opportunities. Our ambition is to reshape the industry by harnessing our unique assets and unrivaled telemetry to lead in security analytics. 
Now I'd like to comment on Q1 results. As a focused cybersecurity business, we expect to build on our momentum from fiscal year '15. However, Q1 was disappointing as our revenue was flat in a quarter with significant complexity.
First, we managed a major sales force transition, establishing dedicated and separate Veritas and Symantec sales and marketing organizations. With this transition, we formed a new management structure that affected the majority of our sales territories and salespeople.
Second, we continued our ongoing separation activities, namely, separating our IT infrastructure, including testing a new ERP system for Veritas; assigned dedicated personnel within HR, legal, finance and IT to support Veritas; and allocating our real estate worldwide to support 2 standalone companies.
Third, and what we didn't anticipate, was managing a Veritas sale process that involved extensive due diligence with multiple parties. The complexity of managing these 3 efforts simultaneously resulted in disappointing execution for both Symantec and Veritas from which we expect to recover in Q2 as our sales force transition and the due diligence associated with the Veritas sale are now behind us.
Moving on to Enterprise Security. Our Enterprise Security segment includes our Threat Protection products, Information Protection products, Trust Services and Cybersecurity Services. In total, this segment grew 1% in Q1, its first quarter of growth in 2 years. And we are building stronger momentum with a robust pipeline of new solutions in fiscal '16. We expect to strongly benefit from this product pipeline in the second half of fiscal '16 and through improved sales force execution as our global installed base of customers adopts these new solutions. As a result, we continue to see a path to sustained growth in the second half of fiscal '16 for our Enterprise Security business. 
Threat Protection, which includes our Endpoint Security, Endpoint Management, mail, web and data center security offerings, declined 1% in Q1. Excluding our Endpoint Management product line, which declined this quarter, our Threat Protection offerings grew 2%. In particular, our flagship Endpoint Security product line continued to show strong momentum, with 6% growth for the second consecutive quarter. 
In Q1, we released our ATP Network and ATP Email modules in limited availability to about 2 dozen customers in the financial services, telecom, consumer products and health care industries. We are working with these customers to ensure our solutions are delivering the highest value. To date, about half of these customers have already moved into production. And we also released a beta version of our ATP Endpoint module. With these introductions, we have entered the multibillion-dollar advanced threat protection market growing at 40% per year.
All 3 Symantec ATP modules will be available in the second half of fiscal year '16. They will be highly differentiated from competitive products because they can detect, correlate and prioritize incidents across the endpoint, email and network threat vectors, and leverage the combined intelligence of our Unified Security Platform. In fact, in recent third-party efficacy testing, our ATP solutions outperformed competitive offerings from FireEye and Cisco. 
Information Protection, which includes our DLP, encryption, and identity and access management offerings, grew 3% year-over-year in Q1. We launched DLP 14 in late Q1, which extends our on-premise DLP capabilities to cloud applications such as Box and Office 365. 
In Q1, Cybersecurity Services revenue grew between 2% and 3% as we continued to expand our offerings to meet growing customer needs to manage every phase of the attack life cycle. During the quarter, we introduced our CyberOne offering and signed our first multimillion-dollar deal for the offering. CyberOne combines our Intelligence, Monitoring and Incident Response services into a single comprehensive offering. 
We also won several Incident Response deals across health care, oil and gas, telecommunications, government, media and technology. In particular, 40% of our new customers came from health care in the wake of recent breaches in that sector. 
Additionally, in Q1, our Cybersecurity Services team also released our ATP Monitoring Service, where our Cybersecurity Services organization combines our ATP Technology and our Managed Services offering to monitor threats remotely, all powered by our global SOCs. 
Trust Services, which includes our SSL and PKI solutions, is the world's largest SSL certificate authentication provider with greater than 40% market share, protecting the world's e-commerce. Trust Services had another solid quarter, with 3% growth. And this quarter, Trust Services added further enhancements to SSL Assistant Plus, cutting the time it takes to secure websites down to minutes for small retailers. 
Now onto the Consumer Security segment. As a number of devices in the home continues to grow and hackers become increasingly sophisticated, we believe Norton is more relevant than ever for our customers and for Symantec. In just the last few weeks, we've seen new vulnerabilities that expose Mac and Android devices to attack. Norton's core security service offering includes protection for mobile and Mac devices as well as Windows, providing not only device protection, but also capabilities to detect phishing and scams.
In addition, our services for managing customer passwords, backing up data and supervising children's activities online continues to be important for our customers. And of course, the aggregated telemetry from our global footprint of Norton users powers our Unified Security analytics. In the future, we know that IoT-connected devices will also be vulnerable to attack, and we believe Norton can play a greater role in protecting all the devices in the homes of our customers. 
Our Consumer Security segment performed better than expected in Q1 as we continued to migrate our customers to a cloud-based subscription service. Revenue declined 6% versus a 7% decline in Q4, and operating margin expanded to a record 57% due to continued operational improvements.
We're also seeing improvements in key levers of our Norton business, such as online customer acquisition. Direct web acquisition of customers generated over 0.5 million new units of our core Norton Security offering in Q1. More importantly, we believe the lifetime value of each of these customers is 25% higher with the subscription model.
Moving to our Information Management segment. We expanded operating margin to 23% from 14% in the prior year; and revenue grew by over 3%, driven by continued strength in NetBackup and Appliances. Veritas continues to drive the transition to Integrated Backup appliances. According to IDC, Veritas claimed the #1 share of the open systems integrated backup appliance submarket for the first time at 47% share in the March 2015 quarter.
We're releasing several products this summer, which we believe will underpin additional growth for Veritas.
First, NetBackup 7.7 provides enhanced data center integration across industry platforms, with significantly faster cloud performance than our previous release.
Second, InfoScale provides availability and software-defined storage to address enterprise business continuity needs.
Third, the Veritas Resiliency Platform ensures critical data remain accessible across complex, multi-vendor physical and virtual environments.
And fourth, Information Map is the first cloud application built on our Information Fabric technology to enable customers to gain better visibility into their unstructured data. 
With its strong and broad product portfolio, Veritas is well-positioned to compete in a growing market. 
Now I'll turn it over to Thomas to provide a review of our first quarter financial results and guidance for our second fiscal quarter. Thomas?"
35000,301292864,858396,"Symantec Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 11, 2015",2015-08-11,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. The $8 billion sale price for Veritas delivers a certain and attractive valuation to Symantec, simplifies the separation process and provides financial flexibility to invest in our future.This is an all-cash",1059,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. The $8 billion sale price for Veritas delivers a certain and attractive valuation to Symantec, simplifies the separation process and provides financial flexibility to invest in our future.
This is an all-cash transaction, which we expect to close by the end of the third quarter of this fiscal year. After certain closing adjustments and the payment of taxes at the rate of approximately 20%, we expect to receive net cash proceeds of $6.3 billion, of which 35% will reside in the U.S. 
To demonstrate our commitment now and in the future to returning capital to shareholders, our Board of Directors immediately authorized an increase of the stock buyback program to $2.6 billion. This new authorization enables us to retain flexibility as we finalize our capital allocation strategy in anticipation of the transaction's closing by the end of our third fiscal quarter. We intend to repurchase the first $2 billion over the next 18 months. 
The board also decided to maintain our $0.15 quarterly dividend, thereby substantially increasing our dividend payout ratio post separation. Together, between dividends and buybacks, we expect to return about 120% of our after-tax domestic cash proceeds from the sale to our shareholders over the next 18 months. 
Now let me turn to first quarter financial results. Implied billings declined 7% year-over-year, and revenue was flat at $1.5 billion. As Mike noted earlier, the complexity of managing our sales force transition and our ongoing separation effort, in parallel with the extensive due diligence process associated with the Veritas sale, resulted in disappointing top line execution during the quarter. We continue to expect our Enterprise Security business to grow in the second half of fiscal '16. 
The U.S. dollar strengthened against major currencies compared to the year-ago period, which created a headwind of $115 million to first quarter revenue and $266 million to deferred revenue on a year-over-year basis. However, currency effects had a $2 billion positive impact on revenue as compared to the guidance we provided on May 14.
In addition to foreign currency effects, we estimate the June 2014 period had approximately $113 million of additional revenue from an extra 14th week of activity versus 13 weeks in June 2015 period. 
Moving now to our business segments. Information Management revenue increased 3% to $587 million. NetBackup software and Appliances grew 10% and 19%, respectively. This strength was offset by weakness in our Backup Exec and Information Availability offerings. Non-GAAP operating margin for the IM segment increased by 11.4 percentage points year-over-year to 23%, driven by cost reductions and an increase in revenue.
In the Consumer Security segment, revenue declined 6% to $430 million. We delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 57%, up 8.2 percentage points year-over-year and 2 percentage points sequentially. Our operating margin was higher than we anticipated, primarily as a result of continued operational improvements. We continue to expect Norton revenue to decline 5% to 8% for fiscal '16, and operating margin to return to our guided range of 52% to 54% as we invest in additional marketing initiatives to improve our customer experience and our growing online acquisition rate. 
Enterprise Security revenue grew 1% year-over-year to $482 million. Endpoint Security posted another solid quarter, growing 6% year-over-year. Continued weakness in our Endpoint Management offering was a significant headwind for this segment. Non-GAAP operating margin for Enterprise Security was 6% as we invested in R&D despite lower-than-expected revenue. 
Moving down to the income statement. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 27.4%, an increase of 480 basis points year-over-year, driven by lower spend as we aligned costs with lower revenue. We will continue to make operational improvements to our business to expand our operating margin as we approach our long-term target of 30%. Non-GAAP net income of $275 million resulted in fully diluted earnings per share of $0.40. 
Now turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operating activities for the June quarter totaled $300 million. We incurred restructuring costs of $22 million and separation costs of $63 million during the June quarter. The costs were higher than expected as we accelerated our separation activities to prepare for our sale of the Veritas business. However, we do not expect total separation costs to increase compared to our prior estimate.
Capital expenditures were $78 million. We expect second quarter CapEx to be higher as we work to complete the Veritas separation. 
During the quarter, we instituted a blackout period associated with the sale of Veritas, which limited us from repurchasing company shares. As a result, we returned $193 million to shareholders during the June quarter via share repurchases and dividends. $103 million was in the form of cash dividends and $90 million was used to repurchase 4 million shares at an average share price of $24.39.
The eight revenue and efficiency initiatives we undertook in fiscal year '15 continue to provide incremental benefits and operating profit in fiscal year '16.
Given the complexity of the first quarter, we are expanding our set of revenue and efficiency initiatives to help improve our top line and better optimize our cost base. Some of these initiatives will include accelerating our license compliance program and optimizing our end-of-life approach to better align with industry standards. Combined with our original fiscal '15 initiatives, we believe this expanded set will drive margin expansion and improve top line performance as they accelerate through the year.
Now moving on to guidance. For the September 2015 quarter, we are providing guidance for a combined Symantec that includes Veritas. We expect to move the Information Management business results and balance sheet to discontinued operations starting in the December quarter, and we will adjust our full year guidance during our November earnings call to reflect this change. 
Our September 2015 quarter guidance assumes an exchange rate of $1.11. We expect revenue to be between $1.485 billion to $1.525 billion, up slightly quarter-over-quarter at the midpoint. We expect operating margin to be between 26% to 28%, resulting in EPS in the range of $0.40 to $0.43.
In conclusion, I am pleased with all the progress the team has made in making the sale of Veritas business happen, and I'm excited about our organic and inorganic growth opportunities as the world's largest cybersecurity company.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mike for some final comments."

The sale of Veritas delivers an attractive and certain value for shareholders. Importantly, it also helps us simplify the separation process.
This transaction is a major milestone for the company, and we couldn't have achieved this without the incredible effort and dedication of our employees, who have been working diligently to ensure a successful separation for a year now.
Going forward, our balanced capital return policy will also drive long-term value for our shareholders. As a focused cybersecurity company, we are poised to extend our lead in the security industry. Our robust product pipeline, new product adoption by our global installed base and improving sales force execution make us confident that we'll grow our Enterprise Security business in the second half of fiscal '16.

A lot of threats for consumers, I talked about some of them a few minutes ago, where we feel the Norton product is the premium product in the marketplace. And we see opportunity going forward, not only to expand what we're doing for consumers from the standpoint of Internet of Things, but also to use that threat telemetry that we gain, we get threat telemetry from some 65 million consumers, to help us with what's happening on the enterprise as well. So the basic endpoint technology that we use is shared across consumer and enterprise, and the threat telemetry is also very important. One of the things that we're seeing in today's environment is that many of our enterprise customers are interested in Norton capabilities to help protect the folks, their customers, who come to their websites and access corporate data. So we think, going forward, there's probably a lot more opportunity for the Norton business and the Enterprise Security business to be working together."

We are expecting that the Enterprise Security business will continue and will grow to the second half -- in the second half of '16, getting us to the guidance that we put out.

Other things that this does, as I'm sure you're aware of, is this provides certainty for shareholders as to the value rather than the ongoing execution and market risk associated with a public offering that would be later in time. And from the standpoint of separation, it really simplifies the separation process and derisks that. There are some synergies -- dyssynergies, I should say, that we avoid by not having to stand up Veritas as a public company. So I think when you put that entire equation together, we feel very good about what this does for shareholders, especially combined with our return of capital to shareholders, as we described through maintaining the dividends and the increased authorization that we have to buy up to $2.6 billion worth of stock."

So that was an indication to us that this really is a short-term execution issue as opposed to something that is going to be problematic in one particular part of the business. As it relates to our geographic performance, I think that we had, frankly, a relatively stronger performance in the APJ region and, to a lesser extent, Europe. So we feel like those businesses were performing fine for us. We just need to execute better in Q2, and we believe we will. As it relates to regulatory changes that might occur, yes, those can potentially be a stimulus for the business. But in general, we do not favor regulatory changes that create mandatory responses. What's going on in a threat environment is so complex, it's pretty difficult to prescribe something that works in every situation. So we would prefer that there be flexibility in terms of the regulatory environment so that we can adapt to threats more rapidly and create the right response for customers depending on the situation."

Yes, we decided that what made sense for us in terms of launching ATP, and as you know network and e-mail are out today with our Endpoint product really in beta, but coming in the September quarter. We decided what made sense is that kind of a controlled availability that would allow us to work very closely with some key customers up front and make sure they were getting the value from the product. And that's been a very successful strategy for us. Not only have our customers seen that we have a higher efficacy rate relative to what they have with ATP solutions in place today, meaning we're finding more things than some of the ATP solutions that have been in the market. But a good portion of those customers have now moved from that controlled availability into production. So we expect that when we get the full power of this solution, which will include the Endpoint module, we'll really be capturing a lot more of the threats and helping customers prioritize those relative to what they have -- with the technologies that they have today. So I think the key advantages, as we've talked about, Pat, are the ability to prioritize incidents rather than just flood a security ops center with lots of alerts. The fact that we're doing a lot of our detection from the cloud, our payload detonation is cloud-based and, therefore, we do not need to sell customers an expensive appliance for them to have advanced threat protection capability. And then most importantly, the ability to correlate what they're seeing in their own environment with the Unified Security analytics platform, which gives access to all of that threat telemetry that we see at Symantec. So we think those 3 advantages are absolutely critical and really resonating with customers."

Obviously, being a focused security company now, it's really all about how do we continue to make progress on the consumer business. We've seen that a lot of the fundamentals are improving. Now having actually gone through the transition of shedding the unprofitable revenue, we're focused now, from a consumer standpoint, on online acquisition and also the relationships we have with major telcos. So as we've talked about before, there's an opportunity to partner with major telcos and cable companies, so Comcast, Deutsche Telekom, Softbank. We talked about America Movil in Latin America. So the partnering we're doing there, plus what we're changing in terms of the way we're attracting consumers, gives us not only a more profitable business going forward, but one that in the future, as we expand to Internet of Things and other opportunities there, gives us an opportunity to get that business back to flat, if not, growing again. And then we combine that with the enterprise space, which is already growing, as we talked about, that business on a constant-currency basis growing for the first time in 2 years, I think strengths -- speaks to the strength of the products that we have in the portfolio as well as the customer base. So as we look out for the rest of this year, we're very excited about our ATP offerings. We just talked about that with Pat, the fact that we believe we're going to have perhaps the most competitive differentiated ATP offering that puts Symantec into a multibillion-dollar market growing at 40% per year that we've not participated in before and we feel like we've got a great product there. For Information Protection, our DLP offerings, we're going to continue to make DLP available to protect cloud-based workloads. And our DLP 14 offering really extends DLP capability for our cloud workloads. Box, Office 365, we talked about, and we've got plans to expand that further. In addition, a product area that's been weaker for us, Endpoint Management, is one where we are putting some increased focus as we're going to have a new cloud-based Endpoint Management product coming later this year. And then Unified Security Analytics platform that underpins this strategy. We're making great progress on that, and some of the applications for that analytics platform are going to be available by the end of the year, which has received tremendous reception from financial services firms. So I'm pretty excited about the portfolio, the progress we're making on the consumer side and the customer reception to the new offerings. So that's what gives us confidence that the second half of fiscal '16 is going to be some new territory for us as we begin growing this business again."

I'd say the key difference is we started with a strategy here, so the Unified Security strategy, which we've laid out in some detail, gives us a very clear roadmap as to where acquisitions can fit in. So while security is such a broad fragmented space, we are not looking at the entire space. We got a question earlier in the call today about network security as an example. So it's not about what do we do to bolt on things in security. It's about how do we accelerate this Unified Security strategy that we've talked about.

Well, Mike, on the sales force transition, it's very complex from a standpoint of the number of territories that were changed, but it's pretty straightforward from the standpoint of what actually happened. So you can imagine a sales force that is globally covering both Veritas business as well as Symantec Security now having to be completely separated into dedicated capability on sales and marketing, so that on April 1, folks are either working on the Veritas side on that set of products or on the Symantec Security side. So you can imagine the number of territories that changed and, of course, the management structure that was involved there. Quotas that needed to be set, pipeline that needed to be transferred, so a lot of transition activity there in this first quarter. Now as we've talked about before, that is behind us now, so we're not making any changes. People now have some experience with their pipeline, their product lines that they need to be covering. We did pretty extensive training with our sales force to make sure that they could run what we call key sales plays in their areas. So if you're on the Symantec Security side, you know that you need to be able to sell DLP for cloud-based applications, the ATP modules and so forth. So we think over a longer period of time, we're going to have a more productive-focused sales force. But obviously, we didn't see the benefits of that in the first quarter. So I think this is a onetime transition. I think the performance that we saw, which reflected some weakness across product lines, it has been doing very well. Geographies that had been doing well are a further indication that it's a short-term bump in the road for us. So as we look to Q2, we believe we'll recover and get back to our plan.

And I think that's something that has resonated with the channel partners that we want to continue with going forward. We have gone through a transition now where those partners are getting aligned across the 2 different businesses, Symantec and Veritas. And I'd say that we have some additional work to do, especially on the security side. If I had to look at the channel programs that we've had, I think they favor the higher-value transactions that tended to come with our Veritas portfolio. So we have a little more work to do on the Symantec side in terms of recruiting some additional partners. And in fact, we're intending to fast-track about 150 additional partners for the Symantec channel as we continue through the rest of this year. So we're keeping the features of what we did with the new channel program we introduced last year, this focus on high value, the certifications, working with partners who really want to focus on our product line. But as we go forward, there's going to be some change in the configuration of partners on the Symantec Security side to be able to allow us to have the right coverage worldwide with the channel program."

35000,301292864,859101,"Symantec Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 11, 2015",2015-08-11,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Sean, and good morning.

Today, I am pleased to announce that Symantec has entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Veritas business to Carlyle for $8 billion in cash. The transaction is expected to close by the end of our third quarter of fiscal '16. For Symantec, the proceeds of this all-cash transaction will further strengthen our financial foundation, allowing us to return significant cash to shareholders and enhance our portfolio of solutions as the world's largest cybersecurity company.
As you know, in October 2014, we announced our decision to separate Symantec into 2 independent companies by spinning off our Veritas business. Consistent with its fiduciary duties, our board considered other options for our Veritas business and ultimately determined that a sale of Veritas to Carlyle is in the best interest of Symantec shareholders because it delivers both an attractive and certain value.
Given the large cash proceeds that we will receive at closing, we are committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy, one that is balanced and appropriately aligned with the size and structure of our go-forward business, and that allows Symantec to both invest in the business and return capital to shareholders. Accordingly, our Board of Directors authorized both increasing the stock buyback program by an additional $1.5 billion so that we now have the authorization to buy up to $2.6 billion, and maintain our $0.15 quarterly dividend, substantially increasing our dividend payout ratio. 
In addition, our increased financial flexibility will allow Symantec to pursue organic and inorganic opportunities to accelerate our Unified Security strategy, which consists of 3 elements: First, a unified security analytics platform that leverages big data analytics of our vast telemetry to enhance visibility of realtime global threats, and powers analytics applications; second, using this analytics platform to provide best-in-class consumer and enterprise security software; and third, Cybersecurity Services that provide a full suite of services from Monitoring to Incident Response to Threat Intelligence, supported by over 500 cybersecurity experts and 9 global security response centers. This strategy is resonating well with our customers. 
The sale of Veritas marks a significant inflection point for Symantec. Upon closing of the transaction, Symantec will be focused as the world's largest cybersecurity company in a rapidly growing market. We will have substantial financial flexibility to accelerate our Unified Security strategy and capitalize on growth opportunities. Our ambition is to reshape the industry by harnessing our unique assets and unrivaled telemetry to lead in security analytics. 
Now I'd like to comment on Q1 results. As a focused cybersecurity business, we expect to build on our momentum from fiscal year '15. However, Q1 was disappointing as our revenue was flat in a quarter with significant complexity.
First, we managed a major sales force transition, establishing dedicated and separate Veritas and Symantec sales and marketing organizations. With this transition, we formed a new management structure that affected the majority of our sales territories and salespeople.
Second, we continued our ongoing separation activities, namely, separating our IT infrastructure, including testing a new ERP system for Veritas; assigned dedicated personnel within HR, legal, finance and IT to support Veritas; and allocating our real estate worldwide to support 2 standalone companies.
Third, and what we didn't anticipate, was managing a Veritas sale process that involved extensive due diligence with multiple parties. The complexity of managing these 3 efforts simultaneously resulted in disappointing execution for both Symantec and Veritas from which we expect to recover in Q2 as our sales force transition and the due diligence associated with the Veritas sale are now behind us.
Moving on to Enterprise Security. Our Enterprise Security segment includes our Threat Protection products, Information Protection products, Trust Services and Cybersecurity Services. In total, this segment grew 1% in Q1, its first quarter of growth in 2 years. And we are building stronger momentum with a robust pipeline of new solutions in fiscal '16. We expect to strongly benefit from this product pipeline in the second half of fiscal '16 and through improved sales force execution as our global installed base of customers adopts these new solutions. As a result, we continue to see a path to sustained growth in the second half of fiscal '16 for our Enterprise Security business. 
Threat Protection, which includes our Endpoint Security, Endpoint Management, mail, web and data center security offerings, declined 1% in Q1. Excluding our Endpoint Management product line, which declined this quarter, our Threat Protection offerings grew 2%. In particular, our flagship Endpoint Security product line continued to show strong momentum, with 6% growth for the second consecutive quarter. 
In Q1, we released our ATP Network and ATP Email modules in limited availability to about 2 dozen customers in the financial services, telecom, consumer products and health care industries. We are working with these customers to ensure our solutions are delivering the highest value. To date, about half of these customers have already moved into production. And we also released a beta version of our ATP Endpoint module. With these introductions, we have entered the multibillion-dollar advanced threat protection market growing at 40% per year.
All 3 Symantec ATP modules will be available in the second half of fiscal year '16. They will be highly differentiated from competitive products because they can detect, correlate and prioritize incidents across the endpoint, email and network threat vectors, and leverage the combined intelligence of our Unified Security Platform. In fact, in recent third-party efficacy testing, our ATP solutions outperformed competitive offerings from FireEye and Cisco. 
Information Protection, which includes our DLP, encryption, and identity and access management offerings, grew 3% year-over-year in Q1. We launched DLP 14 in late Q1, which extends our on-premise DLP capabilities to cloud applications such as Box and Office 365. 
In Q1, Cybersecurity Services revenue grew between 2% and 3% as we continued to expand our offerings to meet growing customer needs to manage every phase of the attack life cycle. During the quarter, we introduced our CyberOne offering and signed our first multimillion-dollar deal for the offering. CyberOne combines our Intelligence, Monitoring and Incident Response services into a single comprehensive offering. 
We also won several Incident Response deals across health care, oil and gas, telecommunications, government, media and technology. In particular, 40% of our new customers came from health care in the wake of recent breaches in that sector. 
Additionally, in Q1, our Cybersecurity Services team also released our ATP Monitoring Service, where our Cybersecurity Services organization combines our ATP Technology and our Managed Services offering to monitor threats remotely, all powered by our global SOCs. 
Trust Services, which includes our SSL and PKI solutions, is the world's largest SSL certificate authentication provider with greater than 40% market share, protecting the world's e-commerce. Trust Services had another solid quarter, with 3% growth. And this quarter, Trust Services added further enhancements to SSL Assistant Plus, cutting the time it takes to secure websites down to minutes for small retailers. 
Now onto the Consumer Security segment. As a number of devices in the home continues to grow and hackers become increasingly sophisticated, we believe Norton is more relevant than ever for our customers and for Symantec. In just the last few weeks, we've seen new vulnerabilities that expose Mac and Android devices to attack. Norton's core security service offering includes protection for mobile and Mac devices as well as Windows, providing not only device protection, but also capabilities to detect phishing and scams.
In addition, our services for managing customer passwords, backing up data and supervising children's activities online continues to be important for our customers. And of course, the aggregated telemetry from our global footprint of Norton users powers our Unified Security analytics. In the future, we know that IoT-connected devices will also be vulnerable to attack, and we believe Norton can play a greater role in protecting all the devices in the homes of our customers. 
Our Consumer Security segment performed better than expected in Q1 as we continued to migrate our customers to a cloud-based subscription service. Revenue declined 6% versus a 7% decline in Q4, and operating margin expanded to a record 57% due to continued operational improvements.
We're also seeing improvements in key levers of our Norton business, such as online customer acquisition. Direct web acquisition of customers generated over 0.5 million new units of our core Norton Security offering in Q1. More importantly, we believe the lifetime value of each of these customers is 25% higher with the subscription model.
Moving to our Information Management segment. We expanded operating margin to 23% from 14% in the prior year; and revenue grew by over 3%, driven by continued strength in NetBackup and Appliances. Veritas continues to drive the transition to Integrated Backup appliances. According to IDC, Veritas claimed the #1 share of the open systems integrated backup appliance submarket for the first time at 47% share in the March 2015 quarter.
We're releasing several products this summer, which we believe will underpin additional growth for Veritas.
First, NetBackup 7.7 provides enhanced data center integration across industry platforms, with significantly faster cloud performance than our previous release.
Second, InfoScale provides availability and software-defined storage to address enterprise business continuity needs.
Third, the Veritas Resiliency Platform ensures critical data remain accessible across complex, multi-vendor physical and virtual environments.
And fourth, Information Map is the first cloud application built on our Information Fabric technology to enable customers to gain better visibility into their unstructured data. 
With its strong and broad product portfolio, Veritas is well-positioned to compete in a growing market. 
Now I'll turn it over to Thomas to provide a review of our first quarter financial results and guidance for our second fiscal quarter. Thomas?"
35000,301292864,859101,"Symantec Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 11, 2015",2015-08-11,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. The $8 billion sale price for Veritas delivers a certain and attractive valuation to Symantec, simplifies the separation process and provides financial flexibility to invest in our future.This is an all-cash",1059,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. The $8 billion sale price for Veritas delivers a certain and attractive valuation to Symantec, simplifies the separation process and provides financial flexibility to invest in our future.
This is an all-cash transaction, which we expect to close by the end of the third quarter of this fiscal year. After certain closing adjustments and the payment of taxes at the rate of approximately 20%, we expect to receive net cash proceeds of $6.3 billion, of which 35% will reside in the U.S. 
To demonstrate our commitment now and in the future to returning capital to shareholders, our Board of Directors immediately authorized an increase of the stock buyback program to $2.6 billion. This new authorization enables us to retain flexibility as we finalize our capital allocation strategy in anticipation of the transaction's closing by the end of our third fiscal quarter. We intend to repurchase the first $2 billion over the next 18 months. 
The board also decided to maintain our $0.15 quarterly dividend, thereby substantially increasing our dividend payout ratio post separation. Together, between dividends and buybacks, we expect to return about 120% of our after-tax domestic cash proceeds from the sale to our shareholders over the next 18 months. 
Now let me turn to first quarter financial results. Implied billings declined 7% year-over-year, and revenue was flat at $1.5 billion. As Mike noted earlier, the complexity of managing our sales force transition and our ongoing separation effort, in parallel with the extensive due diligence process associated with the Veritas sale, resulted in disappointing top line execution during the quarter. We continue to expect our Enterprise Security business to grow in the second half of fiscal '16. 
The U.S. dollar strengthened against major currencies compared to the year-ago period, which created a headwind of $115 million to first quarter revenue and $266 million to deferred revenue on a year-over-year basis. However, currency effects had a $2 billion positive impact on revenue as compared to the guidance we provided on May 14.
In addition to foreign currency effects, we estimate the June 2014 period had approximately $113 million of additional revenue from an extra 14th week of activity versus 13 weeks in June 2015 period. 
Moving now to our business segments. Information Management revenue increased 3% to $587 million. NetBackup software and Appliances grew 10% and 19%, respectively. This strength was offset by weakness in our Backup Exec and Information Availability offerings. Non-GAAP operating margin for the IM segment increased by 11.4 percentage points year-over-year to 23%, driven by cost reductions and an increase in revenue.
In the Consumer Security segment, revenue declined 6% to $430 million. We delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 57%, up 8.2 percentage points year-over-year and 2 percentage points sequentially. Our operating margin was higher than we anticipated, primarily as a result of continued operational improvements. We continue to expect Norton revenue to decline 5% to 8% for fiscal '16, and operating margin to return to our guided range of 52% to 54% as we invest in additional marketing initiatives to improve our customer experience and our growing online acquisition rate. 
Enterprise Security revenue grew 1% year-over-year to $482 million. Endpoint Security posted another solid quarter, growing 6% year-over-year. Continued weakness in our Endpoint Management offering was a significant headwind for this segment. Non-GAAP operating margin for Enterprise Security was 6% as we invested in R&D despite lower-than-expected revenue. 
Moving down to the income statement. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 27.4%, an increase of 480 basis points year-over-year, driven by lower spend as we aligned costs with lower revenue. We will continue to make operational improvements to our business to expand our operating margin as we approach our long-term target of 30%. Non-GAAP net income of $275 million resulted in fully diluted earnings per share of $0.40. 
Now turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operating activities for the June quarter totaled $300 million. We incurred restructuring costs of $22 million and separation costs of $63 million during the June quarter. The costs were higher than expected as we accelerated our separation activities to prepare for our sale of the Veritas business. However, we do not expect total separation costs to increase compared to our prior estimate.
Capital expenditures were $78 million. We expect second quarter CapEx to be higher as we work to complete the Veritas separation. 
During the quarter, we instituted a blackout period associated with the sale of Veritas, which limited us from repurchasing company shares. As a result, we returned $193 million to shareholders during the June quarter via share repurchases and dividends. $103 million was in the form of cash dividends and $90 million was used to repurchase 4 million shares at an average share price of $24.39.
The eight revenue and efficiency initiatives we undertook in fiscal year '15 continue to provide incremental benefits and operating profit in fiscal year '16.
Given the complexity of the first quarter, we are expanding our set of revenue and efficiency initiatives to help improve our top line and better optimize our cost base. Some of these initiatives will include accelerating our license compliance program and optimizing our end-of-life approach to better align with industry standards. Combined with our original fiscal '15 initiatives, we believe this expanded set will drive margin expansion and improve top line performance as they accelerate through the year.
Now moving on to guidance. For the September 2015 quarter, we are providing guidance for a combined Symantec that includes Veritas. We expect to move the Information Management business results and balance sheet to discontinued operations starting in the December quarter, and we will adjust our full year guidance during our November earnings call to reflect this change. 
Our September 2015 quarter guidance assumes an exchange rate of $1.11. We expect revenue to be between $1.485 billion to $1.525 billion, up slightly quarter-over-quarter at the midpoint. We expect operating margin to be between 26% to 28%, resulting in EPS in the range of $0.40 to $0.43.
In conclusion, I am pleased with all the progress the team has made in making the sale of Veritas business happen, and I'm excited about our organic and inorganic growth opportunities as the world's largest cybersecurity company.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mike for some final comments."

So the basic endpoint technology that we use is shared across consumer and enterprise, and the threat telemetry is also very important.

Can you maybe just talk a little bit about how you see Enterprise Security for the year and some more detail on those 2 initiatives?"

We have the due diligence behind us, and the separation of the sales force has also happened. We already have visibility. That linearity for the second quarter is a lot better than what we saw in Q1. And given the strong product pipeline, we believe that we have good momentum going into the back half of the year. We are expecting that the Enterprise Security business will continue and will grow to the second half -- in the second half of '16, getting us to the guidance that we put out. Maybe for the full year, slightly lower than the midpoint, but we fully expect the momentum on the Enterprise Security side to take us to growth in the second half."

Other things that this does, as I'm sure you're aware of, is this provides certainty for shareholders as to the value rather than the ongoing execution and market risk associated with a public offering that would be later in time. And from the standpoint of separation, it really simplifies the separation process and derisks that. There are some synergies -- dyssynergies, I should say, that we avoid by not having to stand up Veritas as a public company. So I think when you put that entire equation together, we feel very good about what this does for shareholders, especially combined with our return of capital to shareholders, as we described through maintaining the dividends and the increased authorization that we have to buy up to $2.6 billion worth of stock."

And I'd say further, we are seeing a lessening of the importance of the perimeter, which also affects our thinking on network security. What I mean by that is more and more workloads are moving into the cloud. That's the basis for our Information Protection strategy, DLP, encryption, identity and access management. So we're seeing, as more workloads move to the cloud, that doesn't mean there aren't going to be a lot of next-generation firewalls sold, but architectures are changing, and we want our strategy to adapt to that."

As it relates to our geographic performance, I think that we had, frankly, a relatively stronger performance in the APJ region and, to a lesser extent, Europe. So we feel like those businesses were performing fine for us. We just need to execute better in Q2, and we believe we will. As it relates to regulatory changes that might occur, yes, those can potentially be a stimulus for the business. But in general, we do not favor regulatory changes that create mandatory responses. What's going on in a threat environment is so complex, it's pretty difficult to prescribe something that works in every situation.

Yes, we decided that what made sense for us in terms of launching ATP, and as you know network and e-mail are out today with our Endpoint product really in beta, but coming in the September quarter. We decided what made sense is that kind of a controlled availability that would allow us to work very closely with some key customers up front and make sure they were getting the value from the product. And that's been a very successful strategy for us. Not only have our customers seen that we have a higher efficacy rate relative to what they have with ATP solutions in place today, meaning we're finding more things than some of the ATP solutions that have been in the market. But a good portion of those customers have now moved from that controlled availability into production. So we expect that when we get the full power of this solution, which will include the Endpoint module, we'll really be capturing a lot more of the threats and helping customers prioritize those relative to what they have -- with the technologies that they have today. So I think the key advantages, as we've talked about, Pat, are the ability to prioritize incidents rather than just flood a security ops center with lots of alerts. The fact that we're doing a lot of our detection from the cloud, our payload detonation is cloud-based and, therefore, we do not need to sell customers an expensive appliance for them to have advanced threat protection capability. And then most importantly, the ability to correlate what they're seeing in their own environment with the Unified Security analytics platform, which gives access to all of that threat telemetry that we see at Symantec. So we think those 3 advantages are absolutely critical and really resonating with customers."

So as we look out for the rest of this year, we're very excited about our ATP offerings. We just talked about that with Pat, the fact that we believe we're going to have perhaps the most competitive differentiated ATP offering that puts Symantec into a multibillion-dollar market growing at 40% per year that we've not participated in before and we feel like we've got a great product there. For Information Protection, our DLP offerings, we're going to continue to make DLP available to protect cloud-based workloads. And our DLP 14 offering really extends DLP capability for our cloud workloads. Box, Office 365, we talked about, and we've got plans to expand that further. In addition, a product area that's been weaker for us, Endpoint Management, is one where we are putting some increased focus as we're going to have a new cloud-based Endpoint Management product coming later this year. And then Unified Security Analytics platform that underpins this strategy. We're making great progress on that, and some of the applications for that analytics platform are going to be available by the end of the year, which has received tremendous reception from financial services firms. So I'm pretty excited about the portfolio, the progress we're making on the consumer side and the customer reception to the new offerings. So that's what gives us confidence that the second half of fiscal '16 is going to be some new territory for us as we begin growing this business again."

Well, I think we would also acknowledge that our history has been a bit mixed, but we've had some great acquisitions as well. I'd just point to you our Vontu acquisition that brought us DLP that we've created into a flagship product line for Symantec being a prime example. I'd say the key difference is we started with a strategy here, so the Unified Security strategy, which we've laid out in some detail, gives us a very clear roadmap as to where acquisitions can fit in. So while security is such a broad fragmented space, we are not looking at the entire space. We got a question earlier in the call today about network security as an example. So it's not about what do we do to bolt on things in security. It's about how do we accelerate this Unified Security strategy that we've talked about. That really gives us a great deal of focus in terms of what we're looking for. And it's very important that, as we look at potential acquisitions, we see the opportunity to accelerate that company's progress as part of our strategy and that it makes financial sense. Assets in this space are quite expensive, so we need to be very careful and make sure that whatever we look at can really deliver return for shareholders."

Well, Mike, on the sales force transition, it's very complex from a standpoint of the number of territories that were changed, but it's pretty straightforward from the standpoint of what actually happened. So you can imagine a sales force that is globally covering both Veritas business as well as Symantec Security now having to be completely separated into dedicated capability on sales and marketing, so that on April 1, folks are either working on the Veritas side on that set of products or on the Symantec Security side. So you can imagine the number of territories that changed and, of course, the management structure that was involved there. Quotas that needed to be set, pipeline that needed to be transferred, so a lot of transition activity there in this first quarter. Now as we've talked about before, that is behind us now, so we're not making any changes. People now have some experience with their pipeline, their product lines that they need to be covering. We did pretty extensive training with our sales force to make sure that they could run what we call key sales plays in their areas. So if you're on the Symantec Security side, you know that you need to be able to sell DLP for cloud-based applications, the ATP modules and so forth. So we think over a longer period of time, we're going to have a more productive-focused sales force. But obviously, we didn't see the benefits of that in the first quarter. So I think this is a onetime transition. I think the performance that we saw, which reflected some weakness across product lines, it has been doing very well. Geographies that had been doing well are a further indication that it's a short-term bump in the road for us. So as we look to Q2, we believe we'll recover and get back to our plan. And then, as we talked about, there's a great opportunity to be able to see much better performance as we combine the now experienced sales force in their new configuration combined with the new offerings that are coming."

As we talked about before, we introduced a new channel program last year, and the key elements of that channel program were to focus on those partners who were able to create high value versus high volume. What we mean by that is those who are actually investing in Symantec or Veritas, they were required to get certified in certain product lines so that we had a channel sales force that was focused on what are the key benefits that we're bringing into the marketplace versus just focused on volume and price. And I think that's something that has resonated with the channel partners that we want to continue with going forward. We have gone through a transition now where those partners are getting aligned across the 2 different businesses, Symantec and Veritas. And I'd say that we have some additional work to do, especially on the security side. If I had to look at the channel programs that we've had, I think they favor the higher-value transactions that tended to come with our Veritas portfolio. So we have a little more work to do on the Symantec side in terms of recruiting some additional partners. And in fact, we're intending to fast-track about 150 additional partners for the Symantec channel as we continue through the rest of this year. So we're keeping the features of what we did with the new channel program we introduced last year, this focus on high value, the certifications, working with partners who really want to focus on our product line. But as we go forward, there's going to be some change in the configuration of partners on the Symantec Security side to be able to allow us to have the right coverage worldwide with the channel program."

Over that period, we adv",1824,"Thank you, Jon, and good morning. 18 months ago, we embarked on a 3-year transformation to refocus Symantec's product strategy, improve our cost structure, rebuild executive talent and deploy capital to maximize shareholder value. Over that period, we advanced our long-term strategy by separating Symantec into an information management provider, Veritas, and a pure play cybersecurity company focused on delivering upon our unified security strategy. We remain on track to close the Veritas transaction by January 1. We have added executive leadership across Symantec to complement an already talented employee base. During this transformation, we improved our cost structure resulting in our non-GAAP operating margin increasing from 25% in the first quarter of fiscal '15 to 28% in the second quarter of fiscal '16. We also returned $1.4 billion of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  Now that we are entering the next stage of our transformation, we are focus on 4 priorities that include realizing our Unified Security strategy; building our Enterprise Security pipeline and go-to-market capabilities; improving our cost structure; and efficiently allocating capital. 
Let's start with why our Unified Security strategy is the right approach for today's complex and evolving threat landscape. Cyber attacks are damaging the ability of enterprises across the world to conduct business efficiently. Today's leaders, including CSOs, CEOs and governments are looking at Symantec to be their trusted cybersecurity partner. Symantec's current set of Enterprise Security solutions provide our more than 370,000 customers actionable visibility into the security control points across their on-premise data and in the cloud. In an environment where hacking has evolved into a highly funded cyber espionage, we must not only create better solutions, but we must think differently in order to stay ahead of 0 day attacks. Our Unified Security strategy does just this by harnessing our vast telemetry, including that from our 175 million endpoints to provide customers with insights on the next generations of threats, and as a result, more secured outcomes. The first of our 4 priorities is centered on new product development and increased product integration. We are bringing to market applications which run on top of our analytics platform, a core tenet of our Unified Security strategy. As an example, one of these new offerings is our risk insight application, which is a risk assessment benchmarking offering that combines data across set and Norton, as well as other external data sources. The solution provides a realtime assessment to both internal and external risk using the latest techniques in machine learning and data analytics and has been well-received by several large banks. We expect to release this application by the June quarter. Including risk insight, we have a pipeline of a dozen new Enterprise Security Products for release in the next 3 quarters across Threat Protection, Information Protection and Cybersecurity Services. 
The second of our 4 priorities is improving our Enterprise Security sales pipeline and go-to-market capabilities. Symantec has trusted brand recognition in cybersecurity. We have deep thought leadership in the world's most influential security experts and we have a focused global enterprise sales force and channel partners to address this opportunity. Now we need to better leverage these competitive advantages and to do so, we recently hired a new chief marketing executive, Dan Rodgers. A key part of improving this go-to-market strategy involves renewed focus on the channel. In our October partner event, the feedback was overwhelmingly positive as we laid out our strategy with the launch of Secure 1, an enhanced channel partner program tailored specifically for security-focused channel partners. The new program consists of training, deal registration, technology support and incentives to drive the results for successful long-term relationships. 
Our third priority is optimizing our cost structure now that we are a pure play cybersecurity company. We remain committed toward reaching our long-term operating margin target of 30%. However, after we separate Veritas, there will be a number of remaining costs related to corporate overhead expenses that we previously shared with the Information Management segment. We are focused on rightsizing our cost structure to properly position the company for the next stage of our growth. Thomas will provide more detail in his prepared remarks. 
That brings me to our fourth priority which is to continue to allocate capital to maximize shareholder value. As we previously stated, we remain committed to our aggressive share repurchase program. The Board of Directors has authorized us to pursue a $500 million accelerated share repurchase to be executed as soon as possible. While returning capital to shareholders will be a core pillar of our capital allocation strategy, we also see opportunities to deploy capital toward acquisitions that we expect to result in an appropriate risk-adjusted return for shareholders. I'm confident we have the appropriate strategy, product development team and distribution capability that can successfully acquire, integrate and accelerate acquisitions. 
Next, I'd like to provide an overview of Q2 results and outlook for the remainder of the year. Our Q2 top line performance improved from Q1, which is evident in the strong sequential improvement of our year-over-year implied billings in Q2. Enterprise Security revenue grew year-over-year for the second consecutive quarter. Operating margin of 28% was at the high end of our guidance range as we remain disciplined with our investments across the business. While we are making progress in building our enterprise security sales pipeline for the second half of fiscal year '16, it is not at a rate to offset the shortfall we saw in Q1. As a result, we now expect full year revenue to be at the low end of our previous guidance for Symantec Security, which includes Enterprise Security and Consumer Security. Thomas will provide additional detail in his prepared remarks. 
Now let me provide an update on each of our major product areas in Enterprise Security. It includes Threat Protection, Information Protection, Cybersecurity Services and website security, a more descriptive name for our Trust Services solutions. In threat protection, the end point and email control points continue to be Ground Zero for targeted attacks within the enterprise. Compared to competitive solutions, our sub solutions, Symantec Endpoint Protection, offers the most complete and scalable set of technologies in a lightweight agent. Veritas, our largest is the deployment covers a footprint of approximately 600,000 endpoints, orders of magnitude larger than most, if not all, of our competitors. Endpoint Protection grew again in the second quarter, driven by continued strength in our sub offerings. Additive to this growth in fiscal year '17 will be our recently introduced advanced threat protection solution which consists of 3 integrated module, endpoint, email and network. Our comprehensive ATP solution addresses the increased complexity of managing security and the only product in the market that uncovers, prioritizes and remediates advanced threats across multiple control points, all from a single console with just a click and no new endpoint agents to deploy. Proving to information protection, with more data moving to the cloud and the shared increase in mobile users, Information Protection that spans across cloud and mobile combined with behavioral analytics is a critical imperative for organizations. The strongest performing part of our portfolio today is Information Protection, where revenue for our offerings grew 10% year-over-year in the second quarter, driven by robust customer traction for DLP 14. A number of our large DLP deals included new DLP 14 capabilities, to secure information stored in the cloud for box and Office 365. Combination of our DLP, encryption and identity and access management assets puts us in a unique position to capture this expanding market opportunity. 
Moving onto Cybersecurity Services. Most companies around the world do not have the in-house security skills needed to address the changing threat landscape especially once compromised. Our monitored security incident response, Threat Intelligence and Security Simulation services provide customers with a broad set of offerings to manage every phase of the attack life cycle. During Q2, Cybersecurity Services revenue grew 3%, which is below what this business is capable of achieving. We accelerate our cybersecurity simulation service offering, we recently acquired the company Black Sand. Within 45 days of the acquisition, our team brought a new service called Fishing Simulation to market and announced its availability in October. 
Now, onto website security. Website security is an essential component of Unified Security and it's not just about SSL certificates. Symantec takes a more holistic approach to offering complete website security and management tools in discovery and automation. Additionally, we offer the Norton Shopping Guarantee, which increases consumer confidence through our Symantec trusted endorsement. Shoppers know they're dealing with a retailer they can trust, they're likely to become loyal buyers, who purchase more and come back more often. Norton Shopping Guarantee has proven to deliver 7% higher conversion rates and 5% more repeat purchases for our retail customers. Website security revenue grew 5% this quarter and acceleration from 3% in Q1. 
Now, onto the Consumer Security segment. There's been no let up in the threat that attack consumers, and increase in crypto ransomware and continued discovery of new vulnerabilities in the commonly used operating systems reinforce the need for Consumer Security and data protection. The Norton Security Subscription Service supports Microsoft Windows, Apple OSx, iOS and Google Android, enabling our customers to protect their devices from malware, phishing, scams, as well as manage passwords, backup data and supervise children's Internet browsing. In converting customers to our subscription service, we are shifting away from unprofitable channels, focusing on reducing churn and acquiring customers directly online and through our growing list of service provider partners. Our Consumer Security segment performed in line with expectation as we continue to convert all of our millions of customers with cloud based subscription service. We're about halfway through this conversion which we expect to be complete in the summer of 2016. We're also seeing continued improvements in key levers of our Norton business such as online customer acquisition, our most profitable channel, which generated over 600,000 new units of our core Norton security offering in Q2, up 8% year-over-year. More importantly, we believe the lifetime value for these customers is 30% higher with the subscription model. The anonymous telemetry from the large Norton customer base continues to provide Symantec with a new perspective in 2 global threat patterns. Last quarter, we saw several high-profile attacks on a broader set of IoT devices such as cars, but we continue to believe Norton can play a bigger role in protecting our customers in the future. As the global leader in cyber security, we operate one of the world's largest cyber intelligence networks. We see more threats and protect more customers from the next generation of attacks. We help companies, governments and individuals secure their most important data wherever it lives.  I couldn't be more excited about the opportunities ahead. 
Now I'll turn it over to Thomas to provide a review of our second quarter financial results and guidance for our third and fourth fiscal quarters. Thomas?"
35000,309075611,893202,"Symantec Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2015",2015-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Before I get started, let me point out that given that the Veritas transaction has increased the complexity of our results and guidance which included a CFO commentary document on our website this time which wi",1500,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Before I get started, let me point out that given that the Veritas transaction has increased the complexity of our results and guidance which included a CFO commentary document on our website this time which will provide additional detail to my prepared remarks. On October 3, we completed an important milestone with the operational separation of Veritas. This is a substantial accomplishment that would not have been possible without the hard work and commitment of our employees. We remain on track to close the Veritas transaction by the end of the fiscal third quarter. In conjunction with the separation, we have committed to returning significant cash to shareholders. We previously announced our intention to return $2 billion to shareholders over 18 months after the closing of the Veritas transaction. I am pleased to announce that we are going to commence this $2 billion capital return ahead of the expected generic close of the Veritas sale. The Board of Directors has authorized us to pursue a $500 million accelerated share repurchase to be executed as soon as possible. We expect that $500 million AFR will be an addition to our normal repurchase activity of approximately $125 million of shares for the third fiscal quarter of which about $105 million have been completed to date. The AFR and our ongoing open market repurchases reflect the Board of Directors and Symantec's confidence in our ability to achieve significantly improved performance and create sustainable value for shareholders, while it allows us to retain flexibility as we finalize our capital allocation strategy in anticipation of the transaction's closing. 
Now let me turn to second quarter financial results. Total revenue declined 1% year-over-year to $1.5 billion and was in line with our guided range. As expected, growth in Enterprise Security and Information Management substantially offset declines in Consumer Security. Deferred revenue was flat year-over-year to $3.3 billion, an improvement from the 1% decline in our June quarter. As a result implied billings reflect also an improvement from last quarter. The U.S. dollar strengthened against most major currencies compared to the year-ago period, which created a headwind of $99 million to second quarter revenue and $144 million to deferred revenue on a year-over-year basis. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 28.1%, an increase of 50 basis points year-over-year and at the high end of our guidance range if we continue to seek our efficiency opportunities throughout the organization. I'll provide more detail in regards to efficiency initiatives later in my remarks. Non-GAAP net income of $301 million resulted in fully diluted earnings per share of $0.44. 
Moving now to our business segments, Enterprise Security revenue grew 1% year-over-year to $485 million, the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. We saw revenue outperformance from our DLP products, which grew 37% year-over-year, Endpoint Security also had another solid quarter, increasing 2% year-over-year. This strength was offset by weakness in Endpoint Management, mail and data center security. Non-GAAP operating margin for the Enterprise Security segment was 10%, which was in line with our expectations. We continue to carefully manage our investment in the business as we shift more resources for higher Enterprise Security growth opportunities. In the Consumer Security segment, revenue declined 8%, as expected to $420 million. We delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 55%, up 357 basis points year-over-year. Our operating margin was higher primarily as a result of continuing operational improvements in areas such as tech support and lower OEM royalty payments. We continue to expect Norton revenue to decline in the range of 5% to 8% for fiscal year '16 and operating margin to return to our guidance range of 52% to 54% as we invest in additional marketing initiatives to improve our growing online acquisition rate and our customer experience. Information Management revenue increased 2% to $593 million. Non-GAAP operating margin for the IM segment increased by 489 basis points year-over-year to 23%. 
Now turning to cash flow and capital allocation, cash flow from operating activities for the September quarter totaled $134 million. We made separation payments of $64 million and restructuring payments of $26 million during the September quarter. Capital expenditure was $71 million in Q2 and a total of $149 million in the first half of fiscal year '16. We returned $262 million [ph] to shareholders during the September quarter, $102 million was in the form of cash dividends and the $160 million was used to repurchase 8 million shares at an average share price of $21.13. The expanded set of revenue and efficiency initiatives continues to improve our top line and optimize our customer share for fiscal year '16. Let me provide an update on 3 of these initiatives. First, our license compliance initiative, which we put in place to ensure customers are current on their subscription and maintenance agreements, is on track to deliver total revenue of $17 million for the security business for fiscal year 2016. Second, within the Symantec Security business, we've implemented a plan of action to upgrade customers to the latest version of all our products. This allows us to shift support in development spending to higher growth initiatives, but even more importantly, it allows our customers to take advantage of the technology improvements in our latest releases. Finally, we are in the planning phase of leveraging and optimizing our existing data center cloud strategy to  improve the overall cost of our IT infrastructure. I'll update you more on the progress of this initiative in the coming quarters. 
Now let me provide you with a high-level overview of Symantec Security standalone financial profile for fiscal year 2016. As a reminder, our growth rates are year-over-year and in constant currency. Our revenue, operating margin and non-GAAP EPS guidance for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 represents standalone Symantec Security and do not include Veritas formerly our information management segment. The impact from Veritas will be included in GAAP EPS as discontinued operations for the third quarter. We are lowering second half fiscal '16 revenue outlook. While our Enterprise Security sales pipeline is growing, it is not enough to compensate for Q1 shortfall, similarly we're adjusting our non-GAAP operating margin guidance. Selling the Veritas business will result in transaction service agreements, TSAs, and stranded costs which our overhead expenses once shared with Veritas. These expenses include IT-related infrastructure and services, real estate, litigation, and to a lesser extent, headcount. On an annualized basis, we expect to have approximately $130 million in TSAs and stranded costs. Our TSA costs, which represent about 1/3 of the total, will need to be place over the next year as we support the Veritas business transition. One these TSAs are a headwind to our operating margin, Veritas will reimburse us for these costs in discontinued operations. Starting now and through fiscal year 2017, we expect to take aggressive action to rightsize our cost structure by this amount. This will help us to move toward our 30% operating margin target. 
Moving onto our Q3 guidance for the standalone semantic security company. Our December 2015 quarter guidance assumes an exchange rate of $1.13. We expect Symantec Security revenue for our third fiscal quarter to be between $890 million and $920 million. Our Consumer Security segment, we expect our revenue to decline year-over-year in the range of between 6% and 8%. We expect revenue for our Enterprise Security segment to grow 0.5% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to be between 25.5% and 27.5%. Excluding the impact from stranded costs and TSAs, our operating margin guidance would have been 30% at the midpoint. We expect third fiscal quarter non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.22 to $0.25, which assumes a share count of $665 million. Without the Veritas sale, we estimate that the Information Management business would have contributed an additional $0.23 per share to non-GAAP EPS. 
Moving onto our Q4 guidance for the standalone Symantec Security company, our March 2016 quarter guidance assumes an exchange rate of $1.13. We expect fourth fiscal quarter Symantec Security revenue to be between $885 million and $915 million. Our Consumer Security segment, we expect our revenue guidance to remain unchanged from a year-over-year decline in a range of between 5% and 8%. We expect revenue for our Enterprise Security segment to grow 1% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to be between 26.5% and 28.5%, resulting in an EPS in the range of $0.24 to $0.27. Excluding the impact from stranded costs in TSAs, our operating margin guidance would've been 30.3% at the midpoint. Our guidance assumes a share count of $653 million. 
In conclusion, our team has made a lot of progress in achieving operational separation, and I'm confident to be on the right track in moving our business forward. As we enter the next stage of our transformation, we are well-positioned to return to Symantec to growth in both organic and inorganic opportunities. And with that, I'll turn it over to John to begin taking your questions."

[Audio Gap]
so if you think about the 2 components of the business, Consumer Security and Enterprise Security, our expectations for up our '17 would be unchanged from what we have talked about at Financial Analyst Day. In other words, to refresh everybody's memory, the decline that we're seeing in Norton should moderate in FY '17, and the guidance we gave for FY '17 is a decline of between 3% and 6%, an improvement of the range of 5% to 8% we're operating within this year. The Consumer Security remains unchanged. So the change from the revenue standpoint for FY '17 would really be around Enterprise Security. We're clearly pleased with the momentum that we're seeing in Enterprise Security, in particular the recovery from the 4 [ph] Q1 performance. So we can see that in some of the numbers we talked about. We're seeing particular strength in a couple of product areas today, DLP, Endpoint, Cybersecurity Services. As I talked about during my prepared remarks, we have a host of new products, in fact, a dozen new products in enterprise security. However, it will take time for customers to integrate those and for those to be contributing materially to our financial results. So the guidance we gave a year ago for FY '17 was that we would be in a range of 1% to 6% for revenue growth this year FY '16, and as you can see from the guidance that Thomas just provided, will be at the very low end of that range, closer to 1%. As we look forward to FY '17, it would be -- it would not be conservative to think that we'll grow at the rate that we previously gave, which 6% to 10%. So while it's too early to give specific guidance on what we would see for Enterprise Security, we'll do that as we get closer to the end of this fiscal year '16. I think we have to say that it's going to be somewhere in between where we gave for FY '17 from our ending rate this year and the rate that we gave at Financial Analyst Day. On the margin side, we have a lot of work to do as Thomas mentioned to reduce our cost structure, taking account of the TSAs and stranded cost as a result of the Veritas sale. In fact if you take the guidance that Thomas gave and you add about 3 points which would account for these costs, you can see we're operating very close, if not at, the guidance we gave at Financial Analyst Day which was a range for the security business of 30% to 31% operating margin. So we have a lot of confidence that we'll be able to get back to the earnings potential of the business which will be our target of 30% operating margin. But it will take us through FY '17 to take out those costs and have that show through"

As you know, it's 3 modules, it's network, email and endpoint. Network is available today, email is also available, but our endpoint comes at the very end of the quarter. So we're in a controlled availability at this point and general availability comes at the end of the quarter. The real power of these 3 solutions come when you work with all 3 together, because the key differentiation here with Symantec's advanced threat protection is that we are able to operate across these 3 multiple control points and then prioritize more the stock analysts what are the threats they should be worried about which really improves the signal-to-noise ratio. You don't have to worry about threats that have already been remediated by our endpoint as an example. And then we're also allowing stock analysts to remediate either quarantine or eliminate threats with 1 click from a single console across those multiple control points. This is a huge productivity improvement for stock analysts. The other key benefits obviously are from a cost standpoint, these capabilities available in a virtual plant as opposed to a physical plants that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, and we're correlating that threat information you're seeing in your local environment across your enterprise with what we're seeing globally. So you get advanced notice of whatever is happening in your industry as an example from around the globe. So really key advantages. And that's why the pricing is a multiple of what we're seeing today with our set products. The customer reaction has been enthusiastic, as you'd imagine, given those productivity benefits that I talked about, because one of the big expenses when security staffs are maintaining their environment or protecting their environment is of course the labor costs. It's not the cost of the technology that we're providing. So if we can make those folks more productive, we save a lot of money. So the reaction that we've seen even from the controlled availability of the other modules that are available and what the beta has shown us from endpoint is that this is going to be one of our most successful products. So already in use in beta at a number of customers that our global, financial institutions, health care really across the board. So we're pretty enthused, but it is early, obviously without having the product and general availability, it would be too soon to be predicting what does that mean financially for us. And as I mentioned, when I talk about FY '17 guidance, it's going to take, you pick the number, 6 to 9 months, for customers to really do their own testing, integrate this and start buying a sufficient quantity that would affect the financials."

There's 5 or 6 engines in our subproducts today, including things like file reputation, intrusion prevention, behavioral analysis to understand what files are really doing. So we want to make sure that our customers have all of those engines turned on. And when they do, we're blocking more threats than anyone else. And we have proof of that in third-party testing.

One was the acquisition which was getting a select group of data scientists who can really help us accelerate the Unified Security analytics platform that we're building, and as we talked about earlier in my prepared remarks, we're getting the first application, something called risk insight, that will be available basically in the second half of fiscal year '16. And then more recently, Black Sand which was a complementary technology to add to Cybersecurity Services specifically in the simulation services area. So we've already begun the looking for one of the complementary targets out there. They need to be tightly aligned with the strategy, one of the things I can be critical about our past is perhaps we haven't gone after acquisitions that were tightly aligned with our articulated strategy. And then as we've also talked about in the past, we really are going to be able to bring value if we look for a complimentary technology where we can use our distribution capability to grow that dramatically. Perhaps the most successful example of that was our DLP business, which today is a flagship in the industry in terms of its performance. So I would say, we're not in a hurry, I can't remember the words we used. But no, we're not in a hurry. There's a lot of opportunity out there but we need to be very selective.

The other is our primary means of acquiring customers which shifted from OEM and retail to online. So we talk about that being up 8% year-over-year, we have 600,000 new customers for Norton this past quarter. So about half of our business now is online customers, and those tend to be the stickiest because they made the positive decision to go with the best. I think we have been awarded the PC Editor's Choice Award 37 times at this point. So they're making a positive choice to go with the premium offering security and we find that those customers have a larger lifetime value, 30% more relative to that customer that comes in through OEM or retail. So that's what we're excited about in terms of driving some improved numbers for this business and getting back to a top line that's flat, if not growing. The market for a paid customer security is growing at low single digits, then no reason why this business, once its transformed, all subscription primarily acquisition of online customers can't get to that level, and as I mentioned previously, we're looking at ways to leverage the Norton brand to get into some new areas. I talked about Internet of Things as an example, more and more consumer devices in the home exposed to security threats. So we're looking at some ways to drive the business to grow faster, that will be separate from kind of the offerings that are available today. So it's that's combination of things that gives us confidence that this business should continue to improve not just next year but in the foreseeable future. Then the margin structure, we said that our margin target is 52% to 54%. We've been a little bit better than that recently, 57% at first quarter; this quarter, 55%. We do expect to operate in a more normalized range and part of the reason we're saying that is because we are making some investments in the business improving the customer experience, investing in that acquisition channel, getting customer, more customers online and then obviously some investment going to what can we do in new areas to leverage the Norton brand as I mentioned. That will drive the margin a little bit lower than what we've seen in the last 2 quarters as we look further out."

So we're going to transition because the business is ratable, we're talking about customers rolling off a download model into a subscription model. That's why it's taking so long for this transition. That's compounded by the change in how we're acquiring customers moving from primarily OEM and retail into primarily online. So that's the dynamic that you're looking at. The 600,000 customers that we added were exclusively online acquisitions. So obviously, that's being offset by continued declines in retail and OEM. But, of course, as we start to get the millions of customers as we talked about before, we protect $65 million consumer endpoints out there. So as we began to reach the second half here of that migration to the subscription service, the numbers began to look better. And what we're really excited about is when we get through that complete transition as we talked about summer of 2016, it will be very significant obviously what the year-over-year comparisons look like that, but we have to wait awhile to get to that point. And by that point the business should be primarily customers that we've acquired online. Maybe obvious to everyone is the fact that why do we feel that way, it's because retail customers tend to be shopping for the lowest price. They're doing that comparison. And OEM consumers don't necessarily renew at all. So you pay those fees upfront. A year later, that customer may not renew with you at all. You pay the placement fee, you get no value for that.

35000,309075611,893630,"Symantec Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2015",2015-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jon, and good morning. 18 months ago, we embarked on a 3-year transformation to refocus Symantec's product strategy, improve our cost structure, rebuild executive talent, and deploy capital to maximize shareholder value. Over that period, w",1823,"Thank you, Jon, and good morning. 
18 months ago, we embarked on a 3-year transformation to refocus Symantec's product strategy, improve our cost structure, rebuild executive talent, and deploy capital to maximize shareholder value. 
Over that period, we advanced our long-term strategy by separating Symantec into an information management provider, Veritas, and a pure-play cybersecurity company focused on delivering upon our Unified Security strategy. 
We remain on track to close the Veritas transaction by January 1. We have added new executive leadership across Symantec to complement an already talented employee base. During this transformation, we improved our cost structure, resulting in our non-GAAP operating margin increasing from 25% in the first quarter of fiscal '15 to 28% in the second quarter of fiscal '16. We also returned $1.4 billion of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  
Now that we are entering the next stage of our transformation, we are focused on 4 priorities that include: realizing our Unified Security strategy; building our Enterprise Security pipeline and go-to-market capabilities; improving our cost structure; and efficiently allocating capital. 
Let's start with why our Unified Security strategy is the right approach for today's complex and evolving threat landscape. Cyber attacks are damaging the ability of enterprises across the world to conduct business efficiently. Today's leaders, including CISOs, CEOs and governments are looking to Symantec to be their trusted cybersecurity partner. Symantec's current set of Enterprise Security solutions provide our more than 370,000 customers actionable visibility into the security control points across their on-premise data and in the cloud. In an environment where hacking has evolved into highly funded cyber espionage, we must not only create better solutions, but we must think differently in order to stay ahead of 0 day attacks. Our Unified Security strategy does just this by harnessing our vast telemetry, including that from our 175 million endpoints, to provide customers with insights on the next generations of threats, and as a result, more secured outcomes. 
The first of our 4 priorities is centered on new product development and increased product integration. We are bringing to market applications which run on top of our analytics platform, a core tenet of our Unified Security strategy. As an example, one of these new offerings is our Risk Insight application, which is a risk assessment benchmarking offering that combines data across SEP and Norton, as well as other external data sources. The solution provides a real-time assessment of both internal and external risk using the latest techniques in machine learning and data analytics, and has been well-received by several large banks. We expect to release this application by the June quarter. 
Including risk insight, we have a pipeline of a dozen new Enterprise Security Products set for release in the next 3 quarters across Threat Protection, Information Protection, and Cybersecurity Services. 
The second of our 4 priorities is improving our Enterprise Security sales pipeline and go-to-market capabilities. Symantec has trusted brand recognition in cybersecurity, we have deep thought leadership in the world's most influential security experts, and we have a focused global enterprise sales force and channel partners to address this opportunity. Now we need to better leverage these competitive advantages and to do so, we recently hired a new chief marketing executive, Dan Rodgers. A key part of improving this go-to-market strategy involves renewed focus on the channel. In our October partner event, the feedback was overwhelmingly positive as we laid out our strategy with the launch of Secure One, an enhanced channel partner program tailored specifically for security-focused channel partners. The new program consists of training, deal registration, technology support, and incentives to drive the results for successful long-term relationships. 
Our third priority is optimizing our cost structure now that we are a pure-play cybersecurity company. We remain committed toward reaching our long-term operating margin target of 30%. However, after we separate Veritas, there will be a number of remaining costs related to corporate overhead expenses that we'd shared with the Information Management segment. We are focused on rightsizing our cost structure to properly position the company for the next stage of our growth. Thomas will provide more detail in his prepared remarks. 
That brings me to our fourth priority, which is to continue to allocate capital to maximize shareholder value. As we previously stated, we remain committed to our aggressive share repurchase program. The Board of Directors has authorized us to pursue a $500 million accelerated share repurchase to be executed as soon as possible. While returning capital to shareholders will be a core pillar of our capital allocation strategy, we also see opportunities to deploy capital toward acquisitions that we expect to result in an appropriate risk-adjusted return for shareholders. I'm confident we have the appropriate strategy, product development team, and distribution capability that can successfully acquire, integrate, and accelerate acquisitions. 
Next, I'd like to provide an overview of Q2 results and outlook for the remainder of the year. Our Q2 top line performance improved from Q1, which is evident in the strong sequential improvement of our year-over-year implied billings in Q2. Enterprise Security revenue grew year-over-year for the second consecutive quarter. Operating margin of 28% was at the high end of our guidance range, as we remain disciplined with our investments across the business. 
While we are making progress in building our enterprise security sales pipeline for the second half of fiscal year '16, it is not at a rate to offset the shortfall we saw in Q1. As a result, we now expect full year revenue to be at the low end of our previous guidance for Symantec Security, which includes Enterprise Security and Consumer Security. Thomas will provide additional detail in his prepared remarks. 
Now let me provide an update on each of our major product areas in Enterprise Security that includes Threat Protection, Information Protection, Cybersecurity Services, and website security, a more descriptive name for our Trust Services solutions. In threat protection, the endpoint and email control points continue to be ground zero for targeted attacks within the enterprise. Compared to competitive solutions, our sub solutions, Symantec Endpoint Protection, offers the most complete and scalable set of technologies in a lightweight agent. For instance, our largest SEP deployment covers a footprint of approximately 600,000 endpoints, orders of magnitude larger than most, if not all, of our competitors. Endpoint Protection grew again in the second quarter, driven by continued strength in our SEP offerings. Additive to this growth in fiscal year '17 will be our recently introduced advanced threat protection solution, which consists of 3 integrated modules: endpoint, email and network. In fact, our comprehensive ATP solution addresses the increased complexity of managing security as the only product in the market that uncovers, prioritizes and remediates advanced threats across multiple control points all from a single console with just a click and no new endpoint agents to deploy. 
Moving to Information Protection, with more data moving to the cloud and the sheer increase in mobile users, Information Protection that spans across cloud and mobile combined with behavioral analytics is a critical imperative for organizations. The strongest performing part of our portfolio today is Information Protection, where revenue for our offerings grew 10% year-over-year in the second quarter, driven by robust customer traction for DLP 14. A number of our large DLP deals included new DLP 14 capabilities to secure information stored in the cloud for Box and Office 365. Combination of our DLP, encryption, and identity and access management assets puts us in a unique position to capture this expanding market opportunity. 
Moving onto Cybersecurity Services. Most companies around the world do not have the in-house security skills needed to address the changing threat landscape, especially once compromised. Our Monitored Security, Incident Response, Threat Intelligence, and Security Simulation services provide customers with a broad set of offerings to manage every phase of the attack lifecycle. During Q2, Cybersecurity Services revenue grew 3%, which is below what this business is capable of achieving. To accelerate our cybersecurity simulation service offerings, we recently acquired the company, BlackFin. Within 45 days of the acquisition, our team brought a new service called Phishing Simulation to market and announced its availability in October. 
Now onto Website Security. Website security is an essential component of Unified Security, and it's not just about SSL certificates. Symantec takes a more holistic approach through offering complete website security and management tools in discovery and automation. Additionally, we offer the Norton Shopping Guarantee, which increases consumer confidence through our Symantec trusted endorsement. Shoppers know they're dealing with a retailer they can trust, so they're likely to become loyal buyers, who purchase more and come back more often. Norton Shopping Guarantee has proven to deliver 7% higher conversion rates and 5% more repeat purchases for our retail customers. Website Security revenue grew 5% this quarter, an acceleration from 3% in Q1. 
Now, onto the Consumer Security segment. There's been no let up in the threats that attack consumers. An increase in Crypto-ransomware continual discovery of new vulnerabilities in the commonly used operating systems reinforce the need for Consumer Security and data protection. The Norton Security subscription service supports Microsoft Windows, Apple OSX, iOS and Google Android, enabling our customers to protect their devices from malware, phishing and scams as well as manage passwords, backup data and supervise children's internet browsing. In converting customers to our subscription service, we are shifting away from unprofitable channels, focusing on reducing churn, and acquiring customers directly online and through our growing list of service provider partners. Our Consumer Security segment performed in line with expectation as we continue to convert all of our millions of customers to a cloud based subscription service. We are about halfway through this conversion, which we expect to be complete in the summer of 2016. We're also seeing continued improvements in key levers of our Norton business such as online customer acquisition, our most profitable channel, which generated over 600,000 new units of our core Norton Security offering in Q2, up 8% year-over-year. More importantly, we believe the lifetime value for these customers is 30% higher with the subscription model. The anonymous telemetry gleaned from the large Norton customer base continues to provide Symantec with a new perspective into global threat patterns. Last quarter, we saw several high profile attacks on a broader set of IoT devices such as cars, so we continue to believe Norton can play a bigger role in protecting our customers in the future. 
As the global leader in cybersecurity, we operate one of the world's largest cyber intelligence networks, we see more threats, and protect more customers from the next generation of attacks. We help companies, governments and individuals secure their most important data wherever it lives.  I couldn't be more excited about the opportunities ahead. 
Now I'll turn it over to Thomas to provide a review of our second quarter financial results and guidance for our third and fourth fiscal quarters. Thomas?"

Before I get started, let me point out that given that the Veritas transaction has increased the complexity of our results and guidance, we've included a CFO commentary document on our website this time which will provide additional detail to my prepared remarks. 
On October 3, we completed an important milestone with the operational separation of Veritas. This is a substantial accomplishment that would not have been possible without the hard work and commitment of our employees. We remain on track to close the Veritas transaction by the end of the fiscal third quarter. In conjunction with the separation, we have committed to returning significant cash to shareholders. We previously announced our intention to return $2 billion to shareholders over 18 months after the closing of the Veritas transaction. I am pleased to announce that we are going to commence this $2 billion capital return ahead of the expected January close of the Veritas sale. The Board of Directors has authorized us to pursue a $500 million accelerated share repurchase to be executed as soon as possible. We expected $500 million ASR will be in addition to our normal repurchase activity of approximately $125 million of shares for the third fiscal quarter, of which about $105 million have been completed to date. The ASR and our ongoing open market repurchases reflect the Board of Directors' and Symantec's confidence in our ability to achieve significantly improved performance and create sustainable value for shareholders, while it allows us to retain flexibility as we finalize our capital allocation strategy in anticipation of the transaction's closing. 
Now let me turn to second quarter financial results. Total revenue declined 1% year-over-year to $1.5 billion and was in line with our guided range. As expected, growth in Enterprise Security and Information Management substantially offset declines in Consumer Security. 
Deferred revenue was flat year-over-year to $3.3 billion, an improvement from the 1% decline in our June quarter. As a result, implied billings were flat, also an improvement from last quarter. 
The U.S. dollar strengthened against most major currencies compared to the year-ago period, which created a headwind of $99 million to second quarter revenue and $144 million to deferred revenue on a year-over-year basis. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 28.1%, an increase of 50 basis points year-over-year and at the high end of our guidance range, as we continue to seek our efficiency opportunities throughout the organization. I'll provide more detail in regards to efficiency initiatives later in my remarks. 
Non-GAAP net income of $301 million resulted in fully diluted earnings per share of $0.44. 
Moving now to our business segments. Enterprise Security revenue grew 1% year-over-year to $485 million, the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. We saw revenue outperformance from our DLP products, which grew 37% year-over-year, Endpoint Security also had another solid quarter, increasing 2% year-over-year. This strength was offset by weakness in endpoint management, mail, and data center security. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the Enterprise Security segment was 10%, which was in line with our expectations. We continue to carefully manage our investment in the business, as we shift more resources for higher enterprise security growth opportunities. 
In the Consumer Security segment, revenue declined 8% as expected to $420 million. We delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 55%, up 357 basis points year-over-year. Our operating margin was higher primarily as a result of continuing operational improvements in areas such as tech support and lower OEM royalty payments. 
We continue to expect Norton revenue to decline in the range of 5% to 8% for fiscal year '16, and operating margin to return to our guided range of 52% to 54% as we invest in additional marketing initiatives to improve our growing online acquisition rate and our customer experience. 
Information Management revenue increased 2% to $593 million. Non-GAAP operating margin for the IM segment increased by 489 basis points year-over-year to 23%. 
Now turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operating activities for the September quarter totaled $134 million. We made separation payments of $64 million and restructuring payments of $26 million during the September quarter. Capital expenditure was $71 million in Q2 and a total of $149 million in the first half of fiscal year '16. We returned $262 million to shareholders during the September quarter. $102 million was in the form of cash dividends and $160 million was used to repurchase 8 million shares at an average share price of $21.13. 
The expanded set of revenue and efficiency initiatives continues to improve our top line and optimize our cost structure for fiscal year '16. Let me provide an update on 3 of these initiatives. First, our license compliance initiative, which we put in place to ensure customers are current on their subscription and maintenance agreements, is on track to deliver total revenue of $17 million for the security business for fiscal year 2016. Second, within the Symantec Security business, we've implemented a plan of action to upgrade customers to the latest version of all our products. This allows us to shift support and development spending to higher growth initiatives, but even more importantly, it allows our customers to take advantage of the technology improvements in our latest releases. Finally, we are in the planning phase of leveraging and optimizing our existing data center cloud strategy to  improve the overall cost of our IT infrastructure. I'll update you more on the progress of this initiative in the coming quarters. 
Now let me provide you with a high-level overview of Symantec Security's standalone financial profile for fiscal year 2016. As a reminder, all growth rates are year-over-year and in constant currency. Our revenue, operating margin, and non-GAAP EPS guidance for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 represent standalone Symantec security and do not include Veritas, formerly our Information Management segment. The impact from Veritas will be included in GAAP EPS as discontinued operations for the third quarter. 
We are lowering second half fiscal '16 revenue outlook. While our enterprise security sales pipeline is growing, it is not enough to compensate for Q1 shortfall. Similarly we're adjusting our non-GAAP operating margin guidance. Selling the Veritas business will result in transaction service agreements, TSAs, and stranded costs which our overhead expenses once shared with Veritas. These expenses include IT-related infrastructure and services, real estate, litigation, and to a lesser extent, headcount. On an annualized basis, we expect to have approximately $130 million in TSAs and stranded costs. Our TSA costs, which represent about 1/3 of the total, will need to be in place over the next year as we support the Veritas business transition. While these TSAs are a headwind to our operating margin, Veritas will reimburse us for these costs in discontinued operations. Starting now and through fiscal year 2017, we expect to take aggressive action to rightsize our cost structure by this amount. This will help us to move toward our 30% operating margin target. 
Moving onto our Q3 guidance for the standalone Symantic security company. Our December 2015 quarter guidance assumes an exchange rate of $1.13. We expect Symantec security revenue for our third fiscal quarter to be between $890 million and $920 million. For our Consumer Security segment, we expect our revenue to decline year-over-year in the range of between 6% and 8%. We expect revenue for our Enterprise Security segment to grow 0.5% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to be between 25.5% and 27.5%. Excluding the impact from stranded costs and TSAs, our operating margin guidance would have been 30% at the midpoint. We expect third fiscal quarter non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.22 to $0.25, which assumes a share count of $665 million. Without the Veritas sale, we estimate that the Information Management business would have contributed an additional $0.23 per share to non-GAAP EPS. 
Moving onto our Q4 guidance for the standalone Symantec security company. Our March 2016 quarter guidance assumes an exchange rate of $1.13. We expect fourth fiscal quarter Symantec Security revenue to be between $885 million and $915 million. For our Consumer Security segment, we expect our revenue guidance to remain unchanged from a year-over-year decline in a range of between 5% and 8%. We expect revenue for our Enterprise Security segment to grow 1% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to be between 26.5% and 28.5%, resulting in an EPS in the range of $0.24 to $0.27. Excluding the impact from stranded costs in TSAs, our operating margin guidance would've been 30.3% at the midpoint. Our guidance assumes a share count of $653 million. 
In conclusion, our team has made a lot of progress in achieving operational separation and I'm confident we're on the right track in moving our business forward. As we enter the next stage of our transformation, we are well positioned to return to Symantec to growth in both organic and inorganic opportunities. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to John to begin taking your questions."

So if you think about the 2 components of the business, Consumer Security and Enterprise Security, our expectations for FY '17 would be unchanged from what we've talked about at Financial Analyst Day. In other words, to refresh everybody's memory, the decline that we're seeing in Norton should moderate in FY '17, and the guidance we gave for FY '17 is a decline of between 3% and 6%, an improvement of the range of 5% to 8% that we're operating within this year. The Consumer Security remains unchanged. So the change from the revenue standpoint for FY '17 would really be around Enterprise Security. We're clearly pleased with the momentum that we're seeing in Enterprise Security, in particular, the recovery from the 4 Q1 performance. So we could see that in some of the numbers we talked about. We're seeing particular strength in a couple of product areas today, DLP, Endpoint, Cybersecurity Services. As I've talked about in my prepared remarks, we have a host of new products, in fact, a dozen new products in enterprise security. However, it will take time for customers to integrate those and for those to be contributing materially to our financial results. So the guidance we gave a year ago for FY '17 was that we would be in a range of 1% to 6% for revenue growth this year FY '16, and as you can see from the guidance that Thomas just provided, we'll be at the very low end of that range, closer to 1%. As we look forward to FY '17, it would be -- it would not be conservative to think that we'll grow at the rate that we previously gave, which was 6% to 10%. So while it's too early to give specific guidance on what we would see for Enterprise Security, we'll do that as we get closer to the end of this fiscal year '16. I think we've to say that it's going to be somewhere in between where we gave for FY '17 from our ending rate this year and the rate that we gave at Financial Analyst Day. On the margin side, we have a lot of work to do as Thomas mentioned to reduce our cost structure, taking account of the TSAs and stranded cost as a result of the Veritas sale. In fact if you take the guidance that Thomas gave and you add about 3 points which would account for these costs, you can see we're operating very close, if not at the guidance we gave at Financial Analyst Day, which was a range for the security business of 30% to 31% operating margin. So we have a lot of confidence that we'll be able to get back to the earnings potential of business, which will be our target of 30% operating margin. But it will take us through FY '17 to take out those costs and have that show through"

As you know, it's 3 modules, it's network, email and endpoint. Network is available today, email is also available, but our endpoint comes at the very end of the quarter. So we're in a controlled availability at this point and general availability comes at the end of the quarter. The real power of these 3 solutions come when you work with all 3 together, because the key differentiation here with Symantec's advanced threat protection is that we are able to operate across these 3 multiple control points and then prioritize for the stock analysts what are the threats they should be worried about which really improves the signal-to-noise ratio. You don't have to worry about threats that have already been remediated by our endpoint as an example. And then we're also allowing stock analysts to remediate either quarantine or eliminate threats with 1 click from a single console across those multiple control points. This is a huge productivity improvement for stock analysts. The other key benefits obviously are from a cost standpoint, these capabilities are available in a virtual plant as opposed to a physical plants that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, and we're correlating that threat information you're seeing in your local environment across your enterprise, with what we're seeing globally. So you get advanced notice of whatever is happening in your industry as an example, from around the globe. So really key advantages. And that's why the pricing is a multiple of what we're seeing today with our set products. The customer reaction has been enthusiastic, as you'd imagine, given those productivity benefits that I've talked about, because one of the big expenses when security staffs are maintaining their environment or protecting their environment is of course the labor costs. It's not the cost of the technology that we're providing. So if we can make those folks more productive, we save a whole lot of money. So the reaction that we've seen even from the controlled availability of the other modules that are available, and what the beta has shown us from endpoint is that this is going to be one of our most successful products. So already in use in beta at a number of customers that are global, financial institutions, healthcare, really across the board. So we're pretty enthused, but it is early, obviously without having the product in general availability, it would be too soon to start predicting what does that mean financially for us. And as I mentioned, when I talk about FY '17 guidance, it's going to take, you pick the number, 6 to 9 months, for customers to really do their own testing, integrate this and start buying in sufficient quantity to give affect to financials."

For example, SEP today is, in my view, by far, the best protection you can have on the endpoint, and I think that's why we're the leader in our market, it's because we have so many protection engines in place beyond what you get from AV, which I know a lot of folks in the market like to say that's the only engine that we have. There's 5 or 6 engines in our  SEP product today, including things like file reputation, intrusion prevention, behavioral analysis to understand what files are really doing. So we want to make sure that our customers have all of those engines turned on. And when they do, we're blocking more threats than anyone else. And we have proof of that in third-party testing. So again, I'm not sure what I said, that made you think we were doing a wholesale upgrade all our enterprise customers, but we are trying to make sure that SEP  customers as an example, has turned on all the features of the product they bought."

I mean, is it just looking for the right situation, or do you feel like there's, from a timing perspective, more urgency to get fuel in the tank in terms of the right acquisition? That would be my first question.
Okay, well and I think, as we've said, we believe the M&A is a key part of the strategy, but let's look back at what we've done so far this fiscal year, and even go back to last year. We've made 2 acquisitions, so we're being highly selective in terms of looking at these targets. One was an Narus acquisition, which was getting a select group of data scientists who can really help us accelerate the Unified Security and Analytics platform that we're building, and as we talked about earlier in my prepared remarks, we're getting the first application, something called Risk Insight, that will be available basically in the second half of fiscal year '16. And then more recently, BlackFin which was a complementary technology to add to Cybersecurity Services specifically in the simulation services area. So we've already begun the looking for one of the complementary targets out there. They need to be tightly aligned with the strategy, one of the things that I could be critical about our past is that, perhaps we haven't gone after acquisitions that were tightly aligned with the articulated strategy. And then as we've also talked about in the past, we really are going to be able to bring value if we look for a complimentary technology where we can use our distribution capability to grow that dramatically. Perhaps the most successful example of that was our DLP business, which today is a flagship in the industry in terms of its performance. So I would say, we're not in a hurry, I can't remember the words you used, but no, we're not in a hurry. There's a lot of opportunity out there but we need to be very selective. It's not lost on us that most of these companies are trading in a multiple of revenue, and obviously, our multiple of revenue is quite low. So we're going to be very selective about choosing the right targets that sit with the strategy, that we can grow dramatically and then have the appropriate risk-adjusted return for shareholders."

The other is our primary means of acquiring customers which shifted from OEM and retail to online. So we talk about that being up 8% year-over-year, we added 600,000 new customers for Norton this past quarter. So about half of our business now is online customers, and those tend to be the stickiest because they made the positive decision to go with the best. I think we've been awarded the PC Editor's Choice Award 37 times at this point. So they're making a positive choice to go with the premium offering for security, and we find that those customers have a larger lifetime value, 30% more relative to if that customer that comes in through OEM or retail. So that's what we're excited about in terms of driving some improved numbers for this business and getting back to a top line that's flat, if not growing. The market for paid customer security is growing at low single digits, then no reason why this business, once its transformed, all subscription, primarily acquisition of online customers can't get to that level, and as I mentioned previously, we're looking at ways to leverage the Norton brand to get into some new areas. I talked about Internet of Things as an example, more and more consumer devices in the home exposed to security threats. So we're looking at some ways to drive the business to grow faster, that will be separate from kind of the offerings that are available today. So it's that combination of things that gives us confidence that this business should continue to improve not just next year but in the foreseeable future. Then the margin structure, we've said that our margin target is 52% to 54%. We've been a little bit better than that recently, 57% in the first quarter; this quarter, 55%. We do expect to operate in that more normalized range, and part of the reason we're saying that is because we are making some investments in the business, improving the customer experience, investing in that acquisition channel, getting customer, more customers online and then obviously some investment going to what can we do in new areas to leverage the Norton brand as I mentioned. That will drive the margin a little bit lower than what we've seen in the last 2 quarters as we look further out."

So that's the dynamic that you're looking at. The 600,000 customers that we added were exclusively online acquisitions. So obviously, that's being offset by continued declines in retail and OEM. But, of course, as we start to get the millions of customers as we talked of before, we protect $65 million consumer endpoints out there. So as we begin to reach the second half here of that migration to the subscription service, the numbers begin to look better. And what we're really excited about is when we get through that complete transition, as we talked about summer of 2016, it will be very interesting to see obviously what the year-over-year comparisons look like that, but we have to wait awhile to get to that point. And by that point the business should be primarily customers that we've acquired online. Maybe obvious to everyone is the fact that why do we feel that way? It's because retail customers tend to be shopping for the lowest price. They're doing that comparison. And OEM consumers don't necessarily renew at all. So you pay those fees upfront. A year later, that customer may not renew with you at all. You paid that placement fee, you get no value for that. That's why we're so excited about this transition."

I mean, to be honest, our channel was previously more geared towards our Veritas business, some of the larger deals that were storage deals versus security. So it gives us a chance to work with those partners who're focused on security, and now we've got incentives in place so that as they get really trained on our products or certified, there's better economics or incentives for them.

Over that period, w",1827,"Thank you, Jon, and good morning. 
18 months ago, we embarked on a 3-year transformation to refocus Symantec's product strategy, improve our cost structure, rebuild executive talent, and deploy capital to maximize shareholder value. 
Over that period, we advanced our long-term strategy by separating Symantec into an information management provider, Veritas, and a pure-play cybersecurity company focused on delivering upon our Unified Security strategy. 
We remain on track to close the Veritas transaction by January 1. We have added new executive leadership across Symantec to complement an already talented employee base. During this transformation, we improved our cost structure, resulting in our non-GAAP operating margin increasing from 25% in the first quarter of fiscal '15 to 28% in the second quarter of fiscal '16. We also returned $1.4 billion of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  
Now that we are entering the next stage of our transformation, we are focused on 4 priorities that include: realizing our Unified Security strategy; building our Enterprise Security pipeline and go-to-market capabilities; improving our cost structure; and efficiently allocating capital. 
Let's start with why our Unified Security strategy is the right approach for today's complex and evolving threat landscape. Cyber attacks are damaging the ability of enterprises across the world to conduct business efficiently. Today's leaders, including CISOs, CEOs and governments are looking to Symantec to be their trusted cybersecurity partner. Symantec's current set of Enterprise Security solutions provide our more than 370,000 customers actionable visibility into the security control points across their on-premise data and in the cloud. In an environment where hacking has evolved into highly funded cyber espionage, we must not only create better solutions, but we must think differently in order to stay ahead of 0 day attacks. Our Unified Security strategy does just this by harnessing our vast telemetry, including that from our 175 million endpoints, to provide customers with insights on the next generations of threats, and as a result, more secure outcomes. 
The first of our 4 priorities is centered on new product development and increased product integration. We are bringing to market applications which run on top of our analytics platform, a core tenet of our Unified Security strategy. As an example, one of these new offerings is our Risk Insight application, which is a risk assessment benchmarking offering that combines data across SEP and Norton, as well as other external data sources. The solution provides a real-time assessment of both internal and external risk using the latest techniques in machine learning and data analytics, and has been well-received by several large banks. We expect to release this application by the June quarter. 
Including risk insight, we have a pipeline of a dozen new Enterprise Security Products set for release in the next 3 quarters across Threat Protection, Information Protection, and Cybersecurity Services. 
The second of our 4 priorities is improving our Enterprise Security sales pipeline and go-to-market capabilities. Symantec has trusted brand recognition in cybersecurity, we have deep thought leadership in the world's most influential security experts, and we have a focused global enterprise sales force and channel partners to address this opportunity. Now we need to better leverage these competitive advantages and to do so, we recently hired a new chief marketing executive, Dan Rogers. A key part of improving this go-to-market strategy involves renewed focus on the channel. At our October partner event, the feedback was overwhelmingly positive as we laid out our strategy with the launch of Secure One, an enhanced channel partner program tailored specifically for security-focused channel partners. The new program consists of training, deal registration, technology support, and incentives to drive the results for successful long-term relationships. 
Our third priority is optimizing our cost structure now that we are a pure-play cybersecurity company. We remain committed toward reaching our long-term operating margin target of 30%. However, after we separate Veritas, there will be a number of remaining costs related to corporate overhead expenses that we'd previously shared with the Information Management segment. We are focused on right sizing our cost structure to properly position the company for the next stage of our growth. Thomas will provide more detail in his prepared remarks. 
That brings me to our fourth priority, which is to continue to allocate capital to maximize shareholder value. As we previously stated, we remain committed to our aggressive share repurchase program. The Board of Directors has authorized us to pursue a $500 million accelerated share repurchase to be executed as soon as possible. While returning capital to shareholders will be a core pillar of our capital allocation strategy, we also see opportunities to deploy capital toward acquisitions that we expect to result in an appropriate risk-adjusted return for shareholders. I'm confident we have the appropriate strategy, product development team, and distribution capability that can successfully acquire, integrate, and accelerate acquisitions. 
Next, I'd like to provide an overview of Q2 results and outlook for the remainder of the year. Our Q2 top line performance improved from Q1, which is evident in the strong sequential improvement of our year-over-year implied billings in Q2. Enterprise Security revenue grew year-over-year for the second consecutive quarter. Operating margin of 28% was at the high end of our guidance range, as we remain disciplined with our investments across the business. 
While we are making progress in building our enterprise security sales pipeline for the second half of fiscal year '16, it is not at a rate to offset the shortfall we saw in Q1. As a result, we now expect full year revenue to be at the low end of our previous guidance for Symantec Security, which includes Enterprise Security and Consumer Security. Thomas will provide additional detail in his prepared remarks. 
Now let me provide an update on each of our major product areas in Enterprise Security that includes Threat Protection, Information Protection, Cybersecurity Services, and website security, a more descriptive name for our Trust Services solutions. In threat protection, the endpoint and email control points continue to be ground zero for targeted attacks within the enterprise. Compared to competitive solutions, our sub solutions, Symantec Endpoint Protection, offers the most complete and scalable set of technologies in a lightweight agent. For instance, our largest SEP deployment covers a footprint of approximately 600,000 endpoints, orders of magnitude larger than most, if not all, of our competitors. Endpoint Protection grew again in the second quarter, driven by continued strength in our SEP offerings. Additive to this growth in fiscal year '17 will be our recently introduced advanced threat protection solution, which consists of 3 integrated modules: endpoint, email and network. In fact, our comprehensive ATP solution addresses the increased complexity of managing security as the only product in the market that uncovers, prioritizes and remediates advanced threats across multiple control points all from a single console with just a click and no new endpoint agents to deploy. 
Moving to Information Protection. With more data moving to the cloud and the sheer increase in mobile users, Information Protection that spans across cloud and mobile, combined with behavioral analytics, is a critical imperative for organizations. The strongest performing part of our portfolio today is Information Protection, where revenue for our offerings grew 10% year-over-year in the second quarter, driven by robust customer traction for DLP 14. A number of our large DLP deals included new DLP 14 capabilities to secure information stored in the cloud for Box and Office 365. Combination of our DLP, encryption, and identity and access management assets puts us in a unique position to capture this expanding market opportunity. 
Moving onto Cybersecurity Services. Most companies around the world do not have the in-house security skills needed to address the changing threat landscape, especially once compromised. Our Monitored Security, Incident Response, Threat Intelligence, and Security Simulation services provide customers with a broad set of offerings to manage every phase of the attack lifecycle. During Q2, Cybersecurity Services revenue grew 3%, which is below what this business is capable of achieving. To accelerate our cybersecurity simulation service offerings, we recently acquired the company, Blackfin. Within 45 days of the acquisition, our team brought a new service called Phishing Simulation to market and announced its availability in October. 
Now onto Website Security. Website security is an essential component of Unified Security, and it's not just about SSL certificates. Symantec takes a more holistic approach through offering complete website security and management tools in discovery and automation. Additionally, we offer the Norton Shopping Guarantee, which increases consumer confidence through our Symantec trusted endorsement. Shoppers know they're dealing with a retailer they can trust, so they're likely to become loyal buyers, who purchase more and come back more often. Norton Shopping Guarantee has proven to deliver 7% higher conversion rates and 5% more repeat purchases for our retail customers. Website Security revenue grew 5% this quarter, an acceleration from 3% in Q1. 
Now, onto the Consumer Security segment. There's been no let up in the threats that attack consumers. An increase in Crypto-ransomware and a continual discovery of new vulnerabilities in the commonly used operating systems reinforce the need for Consumer Security and data protection. The Norton Security subscription service supports Microsoft Windows, Apple OSX, iOS and Google Android, enabling our customers to protect their devices from malware, phishing and scams as well as manage passwords, backup data and supervise children's internet browsing. In converting customers to our subscription service, we are shifting away from unprofitable channels, focusing on reducing churn, and acquiring customers directly online and through our growing list of service provider partners. Our Consumer Security segment performed in line with expectation as we continue to convert all of our millions of customers to a cloud based subscription service. We are about halfway through this conversion, which we expect to be complete in the summer of 2016. We're also seeing continued improvements in key levers of our Norton business such as online customer acquisition, our most profitable channel, which generated over 600,000 new units of our core Norton Security offering in Q2, up 8% year-over-year. More importantly, we believe the lifetime value for these customers is 30% higher with the subscription model. The anonymous telemetry gleaned from the large Norton customer base continues to provide Symantec with a unique perspective into global threat patterns. Last quarter, we saw several high profile attacks on a broader set of IoT devices such as cars, so we continue to believe Norton can play a bigger role in protecting our customers in the future. 
As the global leader in cybersecurity, we operate one of the world's largest cyber intelligence networks, we see more threats, and protect more customers from the next generation of attacks. We help companies, governments and individuals secure their most important data wherever it lives. I couldn't be more excited about the opportunities ahead. 
Now I'll turn it over to Thomas to provide a review of our second quarter financial results and guidance for our third and fourth fiscal quarters. Thomas?"

Before I get started, let me point out that given that the Veritas transaction has increased the complexity of our results and guidance, we've included a CFO commentary document on our website this time which will provide additional detail to my prepared remarks. 
On October 3, we completed an important milestone with the operational separation of Veritas. This is a substantial accomplishment that would not have been possible without the hard work and commitment of our employees. We remain on track to close the Veritas transaction by the end of the fiscal third quarter. In conjunction with the separation, we have committed to returning significant cash to shareholders. We had previously announced our intention to return $2 billion to shareholders over 18 months after the closing of the Veritas transaction. I am pleased to announce that we are going to commence this $2 billion capital return ahead of the expected January close of the Veritas sale. The Board of Directors has authorized us to pursue a $500 million accelerated share repurchase to be executed as soon as possible. We expected $500 million ASR will be in addition to our normal repurchase activity of approximately $125 million of shares for the third fiscal quarter, of which about $105 million have been completed to date. The ASR and our ongoing open market repurchases reflect the Board of Directors' and Symantec's confidence in our ability to achieve significantly improved performance and create sustainable value for shareholders, while it allows us to retain flexibility as we finalize our capital allocation strategy in anticipation of the transaction's closing. 
Now let me turn to second quarter financial results. Total revenue declined 1% year-over-year to $1.5 billion and was in line with our guided range. As expected, growth in Enterprise Security and Information Management substantially offset declines in Consumer Security. 
Deferred revenue was flat year-over-year at $3.3 billion, an improvement from a 1% decline in our June quarter. As a result, implied billings were flat, also an improvement from last quarter. 
The U.S. dollar strengthened against most major currencies compared to the year-ago period, which created a headwind of $99 million to second quarter revenue and $144 million to deferred revenue on a year-over-year basis. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 28.1%, an increase of 50 basis points year-over-year and at the high end of our guidance range, as we continue to seek our efficiency opportunities throughout the organization. I'll provide more detail in regards to efficiency initiatives later in my remarks. 
Non-GAAP net income of $301 million resulted in fully diluted earnings per share of $0.44. 
Moving now to our business segments. Enterprise Security revenue grew 1% year-over-year to $485 million, the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. We saw revenue outperformance from our DLP products, which grew 37% year-over-year, Endpoint Security also had another solid quarter, increasing 2% year-over-year. This strength was offset by weakness in endpoint management, mail, and data center security. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the Enterprise Security segment was 10%, which was in line with our expectations. We continue to carefully manage our investment in the business, as we shift more resources to higher enterprise security growth opportunities. 
In the Consumer Security segment, revenue declined 8%, as expected, to $420 million. We delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 55%, up 357 basis points year-over-year. Our operating margin was higher primarily as a result of continuing operational improvements in areas such as tech support and lower OEM royalty payments. 
We continue to expect Norton revenue to decline in the range of 5% to 8% for fiscal year '16, and operating margin to return to our guided range of 52% to 54% as we invest in additional marketing initiatives to improve our growing online acquisition rate and our customer experience. 
Information Management revenue increased 2% to $593 million. Non-GAAP operating margin for the IM segment increased by 489 basis points year-over-year to 23%. 
Now turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operating activities for the September quarter totaled $134 million. We made separation payments of $64 million and restructuring payments of $26 million during the September quarter. Capital expenditure was $71 million in Q2 and a total of $149 million in the first half of fiscal year '16. We returned $262 million to shareholders during the September quarter. $102 million was in the form of cash dividends and $160 million was used to repurchase 8 million shares at an average share price of $21.13. 
The expanded set of revenue and efficiency initiatives continues to improve our top line and optimize our cost structure for fiscal year '16. Let me provide an update on 3 of these initiatives. First, our license compliance initiative, which we put in place to ensure customers are current on their subscription and maintenance agreements, is on track to deliver total revenue of $17 million for the security business for fiscal year 2016. Second, within the Symantec Security business, we've implemented a plan of action to upgrade customers to the latest version of all our products. This allows us to shift support and development spending to higher growth initiatives, but even more importantly, it allows our customers to take advantage of the technology improvements in our latest releases. Finally, we are in the planning phase of leveraging and optimizing our existing data center cloud strategy to improve the overall cost of our IT infrastructure. I'll update you more on the progress of this initiative in the coming quarters. 
Now let me provide you with a high-level overview of Symantec Security's standalone financial profile for fiscal year 2016. As a reminder, all growth rates are year-over-year and in constant currency. Our revenue, operating margin, and non-GAAP EPS guidance for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 represent standalone Symantec security and do not include Veritas, formerly our Information Management segment. The impact from Veritas will be included in GAAP EPS as discontinued operations for the third quarter. 
We are lowering second half fiscal '16 revenue outlook. While our enterprise security sales pipeline is growing, it is not enough to compensate for Q1 shortfall. Similarly, we're adjusting our non-GAAP operating margin guidance. Selling the Veritas business will result in transaction service agreements, TSAs, and stranded costs which our overhead expenses once shared with Veritas. These expenses include IT-related infrastructure and services, real estate, litigation, and to a lesser extent, headcount. On an annualized basis, we expect to have approximately $130 million in TSAs and stranded costs. Our TSA costs, which represent about 1/3 of the total, will need to be in place over the next year as we support the Veritas business transition. While these TSAs are a headwind to our operating margin, Veritas will reimburse us for these costs in discontinued operations. Starting now and through fiscal year 2017, we expect to take aggressive action to right size our cost structure by this amount. This will help us to move toward our 30% operating margin target. 
Moving onto our Q3 guidance for the standalone Symantec security company. Our December 2015 quarter guidance assumes an exchange rate of $1.13. We expect Symantec security revenue for our third fiscal quarter to be between $890 million and $920 million. For our Consumer Security segment, we expect our revenue to decline year-over-year in the range of between 6% and 8%. We expect revenue for our Enterprise Security segment to grow 0.5% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to be between 25.5% and 27.5%. Excluding the impact from stranded costs and TSAs, our operating margin guidance would have been 30% at the midpoint. We expect third fiscal quarter non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.22 to $0.25, which assumes a share count of $665 million. Without the Veritas sale, we estimate that the Information Management business would have contributed an additional $0.23 per share to non-GAAP EPS. 
Moving onto our Q4 guidance for the standalone Symantec security company. Our March 2016 quarter guidance assumes an exchange rate of $1.13. We expect fourth fiscal quarter Symantec Security revenue to be between $885 million and $915 million. For our Consumer Security segment, we expect our revenue guidance to remain unchanged from a year-over-year decline in a range of between 5% and 8%. We expect revenue for our Enterprise Security segment to grow 1% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to be between 26.5% and 28.5%, resulting in an EPS in the range of $0.24 to $0.27. Excluding the impact from stranded costs in TSAs, our operating margin guidance would have been 30.3% at the midpoint. Our guidance assumes a share count of $653 million. 
In conclusion, our team has made a lot of progress in achieving operational separation and I'm confident we're on the right track in moving our business forward. As we enter the next stage of our transformation, we are well positioned to return Symantec to growth through both organic and inorganic opportunities. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to John to begin taking your questions."

So if you think about the 2 components of the business, Consumer Security and Enterprise Security, our expectations for FY '17 would be unchanged from what we've talked about at Financial Analyst Day. In other words, to refresh everybody's memory, the decline that we're seeing in Norton should moderate in FY '17, and the guidance we gave for FY '17 is a decline of between 3% and 6%, an improvement of the range of 5% to 8% that we're operating within this year. The Consumer Security remains unchanged. So the change from the revenue standpoint for FY '17 would really be around Enterprise Security. We're clearly pleased with the momentum that we're seeing in Enterprise Security, in particular, the recovery from the 4 Q1 performance. So we could see that in some of the numbers that we talked about. We're seeing particular strength in a couple of product areas today, DLP, Endpoint, Cybersecurity Services. As I talked about in my prepared remarks, we have a host of new products, in fact, a dozen new products in enterprise security. However, it will take time for customers to integrate those and for those to be contributing materially to our financial results. So the guidance we gave a year ago for FY '17 was that we would be in a range of 1% to 6% for revenue growth this year FY '16, and as you can see from the guidance that Thomas just provided, we'll be at the very low end of that range, closer to 1%. As we look forward to FY '17, it would be -- it would not be conservative to think that we'll grow at the rate that we previously gave, which was 6% to 10%. So while it's too early to give specific guidance on what we would see for Enterprise Security, we'll do that as we get closer to the end of this fiscal year '16. I think we have to say that it's going to be somewhere in between where we gave for FY '17 from our ending rate this year and the rate that we gave at Financial Analyst Day. On the margin side, we have a lot of work to do, as Thomas mentioned, to reduce our cost structure, taking account of the TSAs and stranded costs as a result of the Veritas sale. In fact if you take the guidance that Thomas gave and you add about 3 points which would account for these costs, you can see we're operating very close, if not at the guidance we gave at Financial Analyst Day, which was a range for the security business of 30% to 31% operating margin. So we have a lot of confidence that we'll be able to get back to the earnings potential of business, which will be our target of 30% operating margin.

As you know, it's 3 modules, it's network, email and endpoint. Network is available today, email is also available, but our endpoint comes at the very end of the quarter. So we're in a controlled availability at this point and general availability comes at the end of the quarter. The real power of these 3 solutions come when you work with all 3 together, because the key differentiation here with Symantec's advanced threat protection is that we are able to operate across these 3 multiple control points and then prioritize for the stock analysts what are the threats that they should be worried about which really improves the signal-to-noise ratio. You don't have to worry about threats that have already been remediated by our endpoint, as an example. And then we're also allowing stock analysts to remediate, either quarantine or eliminate threats with 1 click from a single console across those multiple control points. This is a huge productivity improvement for stock analysts. The other key benefits obviously are, from a cost standpoint, these capabilities are available in a virtual appliance as opposed to a physical appliance that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, and we're correlating that threat information you're seeing in your local environment across your enterprise, with what we're seeing globally. So you get advanced notice of whatever is happening in your industry, as an example, from around the globe. So really key advantages. And that's why the pricing is a multiple of what we're seeing today with our set products. The customer reaction has been enthusiastic, as you'd imagine, given those productivity benefits that I talked about. Because one of the big expenses when security staffs are maintaining their environment or protecting their environment, is of course, the labor costs. It's not the cost of the technology that we're providing. So if we can make those folks more productive, we've saved a whole lot of money. So the reaction that we've seen even from the controlled availability of the other modules that are available, and what the beta has shown us from endpoint is that this is going to be one of our most successful products. So already in use in beta at a number of customers that are global, financial institutions, healthcare, really across the board. So we're pretty enthused, but it is early, obviously, without having the product in general availability, it would be too soon to start predicting what does that mean financially for us. And as I mentioned, when I talked about FY '17 guidance, it's going to take, you pick the number, 6 to 9 months, for customers to really do their own testing, integrate this and start buying in sufficient quantity to affect the financials."

There's 5 or 6 engines in our  SEP product today, including things like file reputation, intrusion prevention, behavioral analysis to understand what files are really doing. So we want to make sure that our customers have all of those engines turned on. And when they do, we're blocking more threats than anyone else. And we have proof of that in third-party testing.

We've made 2 acquisitions, so we're being highly selective in terms of looking at these targets. One was a Narus acquisition, which was getting a select group of data scientists who can really help us accelerate the Unified Security Analytics platform that we're building, and as we talked about earlier in my prepared remarks, we're getting the first application, something called Risk Insight, that will be available basically in the second half of fiscal year '16. And then more recently, Blackfin, which was a complementary technology to add to Cybersecurity Services specifically in the simulation services area. So we've already begun the looking for what are the complementary targets out there. They need to be tightly aligned with the strategy. One of the things that I could be critical about our past is that, perhaps we haven't gone after acquisitions that were tightly aligned with the articulated strategy. And then as we've also talked about in the past, we really are going to be able to bring value if we look for a complementary technology where we can use our distribution capability to grow that dramatically. Perhaps the most successful example of that was our DLP business, which today is a flagship in the industry in terms of its performance. So I would say, we're not in a hurry, I can't remember the words you used, but no, we're not in a hurry. There's a lot of opportunity out there but we need to be very selective. It's not lost on us that most of these companies are trading in a multiple of revenue, and obviously, our multiple of revenue is quite low. So we're going to be very selective about choosing the right targets that fit with the strategy, that we can grow dramatically and then have the appropriate risk-adjusted return for shareholders."

The other is our primary means of acquiring customers which shifted from OEM and retail to online. So we talk about that being up 8% year-over-year, we added 600,000 new customers for Norton this past quarter. So about half of our business now is online customers, and those tend to be the stickiest because they've made the positive decision to go with the best. And I think we've been awarded the PC Editor's Choice Award 37 times at this point. So they're making a positive choice to go with the premium offering for security, and we find that those customers have a larger lifetime value, 30% more relative to if that customer that comes in through OEM or retail. So that's what we're excited about in terms of driving some improved numbers for this business and getting back to a top line that's flat, if not growing. The market for paid consumer security is growing at low single digits, then no reason why this business, once it's transformed, all subscription, primarily acquisition of online customers, can't get to that level, and as I've mentioned previously, we're looking at ways to leverage the Norton brand to get into some new areas. I talked about Internet of Things as an example, more and more consumer devices in the home exposed to security threats. So we're looking at some ways to drive the business to grow faster, that will be separate from kind of the offerings that are available today. So it's that combination of things that gives us confidence that this business should continue to improve not just next year but in the foreseeable future. Then the margin structure, we've said that our margin target is 52% to 54%. We've been a little bit better than that recently, 57% in the first quarter; this quarter, 55%. We do expect to operate in that more normalized range, and part of the reason we're saying that is because we are making some investments in the business, improving the customer experience, investing in that acquisition channel, getting customer -- more customers online and then obviously some investment going to what can we do in new areas to leverage the Norton brand, as I mentioned.

So we're in a transition and because the business is ratable, we're talking about customers rolling off a download model into a subscription model. That's why it's taking so long for this transition. That's compounded by the change in how we're acquiring customers moving from primarily OEM and retail into primarily online. So that's the dynamic that you're looking at. The 600,000 customers that we added were exclusively online acquisitions. So obviously, that's being offset by continued declines in retail and OEM. But, of course, as we start to get the millions of customers as we talked about before, we protect $65 million consumer endpoints out there. So as we begin to reach the second half here of that migration to the subscription service, the numbers begin to look better. And what we're really excited about is when we get through that complete transition, which we talked about summer of 2016, it will be very interesting to see obviously what the year-over-year comparisons look like then. But we have to wait awhile to get to that point. And by that point the business should be primarily customers that we've acquired online. And then maybe obvious to everyone is the fact that why do we feel that way? It's because retail customers tend to be shopping for the lowest price. They're doing that comparison. And OEM consumers don't necessarily renew at all. So you pay those fees upfront. A year later, that customer may not renew with you at all. You've paid that placement fee, you get no value for that. That's why we're so excited about this transition."

35000,309075611,894713,"Symantec Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2015",2015-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Gen Digital Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jon, and good morning. 18 months ago, we embarked on a 3-year transformation to refocus Symantec's product strategy, improve our cost structure, rebuild executive talent, and deploy capital to maximize shareholder value. Over that period, w",1826,"Thank you, Jon, and good morning. 
18 months ago, we embarked on a 3-year transformation to refocus Symantec's product strategy, improve our cost structure, rebuild executive talent, and deploy capital to maximize shareholder value. 
Over that period, we advanced our long-term strategy by separating Symantec into an information management provider, Veritas, and a pure-play cybersecurity company focused on delivering upon our Unified Security strategy. 
We remain on track to close the Veritas transaction by January 1. We have added new executive leadership across Symantec to complement an already talented employee base. During this transformation, we improved our cost structure, resulting in our non-GAAP operating margin increasing from 25% in the first quarter of fiscal '15 to 28% in the second quarter of fiscal '16. We also returned $1.4 billion of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  
Now that we are entering the next stage of our transformation, we are focused on 4 priorities that include: realizing our Unified Security strategy; building our Enterprise Security pipeline and go-to-market capabilities; improving our cost structure; and efficiently allocating capital. 
Let's start with why our Unified Security strategy is the right approach for today's complex and evolving threat landscape. Cyber attacks are damaging the ability of enterprises across the world to conduct business efficiently. Today's leaders, including CISOs, CEOs and governments are looking to Symantec to be their trusted cybersecurity partner. Symantec's current set of Enterprise Security solutions provide our more than 370,000 customers actionable visibility into the security control points across their on-premise data and in the cloud. In an environment where hacking has evolved into highly funded cyber espionage, we must not only create better solutions, but we must think differently in order to stay ahead of 0 day attacks. Our Unified Security strategy does just this by harnessing our vast telemetry, including that from our 175 million endpoints, to provide customers with insights on the next generations of threats, and as a result, more secure outcomes. 
The first of our 4 priorities is centered on new product development and increased product integration. We are bringing to market applications which run on top of our analytics platform, a core tenet of our Unified Security strategy. As an example, one of these new offerings is our Risk Insight application, which is a risk assessment benchmarking offering that combines data across SEP and Norton, as well as other external data sources. The solution provides a real-time assessment of both internal and external risk using the latest techniques in machine learning and data analytics, and has been well-received by several large banks. We expect to release this application by the June quarter. 
Including risk insight, we have a pipeline of a dozen new Enterprise Security Products set for release in the next 3 quarters across Threat Protection, Information Protection, and Cybersecurity Services. 
The second of our 4 priorities is improving our Enterprise Security sales pipeline and go-to-market capabilities. Symantec has trusted brand recognition in cybersecurity, we have deep thought leadership in the world's most influential security experts, and we have a focused global enterprise sales force and channel partners to address this opportunity. Now we need to better leverage these competitive advantages and to do so, we recently hired a new chief marketing executive, Dan Rogers. A key part of improving this go-to-market strategy involves renewed focus on the channel. At our October partner event, the feedback was overwhelmingly positive as we laid out our strategy with the launch of Secure One, an enhanced channel partner program tailored specifically for security-focused channel partners. The new program consists of training, deal registration, technology support, and incentives to drive the results for successful long-term relationships. 
Our third priority is optimizing our cost structure now that we are a pure-play cybersecurity company. We remain committed toward reaching our long-term operating margin target of 30%. However, after we separate Veritas, there will be a number of remaining costs related to corporate overhead expenses that we'd previously shared with the Information Management segment. We are focused on right sizing our cost structure to properly position the company for the next stage of our growth. Thomas will provide more detail in his prepared remarks. 
That brings me to our fourth priority, which is to continue to allocate capital to maximize shareholder value. As we previously stated, we remain committed to our aggressive share repurchase program. The Board of Directors has authorized us to pursue a $500 million accelerated share repurchase to be executed as soon as possible. While returning capital to shareholders will be a core pillar of our capital allocation strategy, we also see opportunities to deploy capital toward acquisitions that we expect to result in an appropriate risk-adjusted return for shareholders. I'm confident we have the appropriate strategy, product development team, and distribution capability that can successfully acquire, integrate, and accelerate acquisitions. 
Next, I'd like to provide an overview of Q2 results and outlook for the remainder of the year. Our Q2 top line performance improved from Q1, which is evident in the strong sequential improvement of our year-over-year implied billings in Q2. Enterprise Security revenue grew year-over-year for the second consecutive quarter. Operating margin of 28% was at the high end of our guidance range, as we remain disciplined with our investments across the business. 
While we are making progress in building our enterprise security sales pipeline for the second half of fiscal year '16, it is not at a rate to offset the shortfall we saw in Q1. As a result, we now expect full year revenue to be at the low end of our previous guidance for Symantec Security, which includes Enterprise Security and Consumer Security. Thomas will provide additional detail in his prepared remarks. 
Now let me provide an update on each of our major product areas in Enterprise Security that includes Threat Protection, Information Protection, Cybersecurity Services, and website security, a more descriptive name for our Trust Services solutions. In threat protection, the endpoint and email control points continue to be ground zero for targeted attacks within the enterprise. Compared to competitive solutions, our sub solutions, Symantec Endpoint Protection, offers the most complete and scalable set of technologies in a lightweight agent. For instance, our largest SEP deployment covers a footprint of approximately 600,000 endpoints, orders of magnitude larger than most, if not all, of our competitors. Endpoint Protection grew again in the second quarter, driven by continued strength in our SEP offerings. Additive to this growth in fiscal year '17 will be our recently introduced advanced threat protection solution, which consists of 3 integrated modules: endpoint, email and network. In fact, our comprehensive ATP solution addresses the increased complexity of managing security as the only product in the market that uncovers, prioritizes and remediates advanced threats across multiple control points all from a single console with just a click and no new endpoint agents to deploy. 
Moving to Information Protection. With more data moving to the cloud and the sheer increase in mobile users, Information Protection that spans across cloud and mobile, combined with behavioral analytics, is a critical imperative for organizations. The strongest performing part of our portfolio today is Information Protection, where revenue for our offerings grew 10% year-over-year in the second quarter, driven by robust customer traction for DLP 14. A number of our large DLP deals included new DLP 14 capabilities to secure information stored in the cloud for Box and Office 365. Combination of our DLP, encryption, and identity and access management assets puts us in a unique position to capture this expanding market opportunity. 
Moving onto Cybersecurity Services. Most companies around the world do not have the in-house security skills needed to address the changing threat landscape, especially once compromised. Our Monitored Security, Incident Response, Threat Intelligence, and Security Simulation services provide customers with a broad set of offerings to manage every phase of the attack lifecycle. During Q2, Cybersecurity Services revenue grew 3%, which is below what this business is capable of achieving. To accelerate our cybersecurity simulation service offerings, we recently acquired the company, Blackfin. Within 45 days of the acquisition, our team brought a new service called Phishing Simulation to market and announced its availability in October. 
Now onto Website Security. Website security is an essential component of Unified Security, and it's not just about SSL certificates. Symantec takes a more holistic approach through offering complete website security and management tools in discovery and automation. Additionally, we offer the Norton Shopping Guarantee, which increases consumer confidence through our Symantec trusted endorsement. Shoppers know they're dealing with a retailer they can trust, so they're likely to become loyal buyers, who purchase more and come back more often. Norton Shopping Guarantee has proven to deliver 7% higher conversion rates and 5% more repeat purchases for our retail customers. Website Security revenue grew 5% this quarter, an acceleration from 3% in Q1. 
Now, onto the Consumer Security segment. There's been no letup in the threats that attack consumers. An increase in Crypto-ransomware and a continual discovery of new vulnerabilities in the commonly used operating systems reinforce the need for Consumer Security and data protection. The Norton Security subscription service supports Microsoft Windows, Apple OSX, iOS and Google Android, enabling our customers to protect their devices from malware, phishing and scams as well as manage passwords, backup data and supervise children's internet browsing. In converting customers to our subscription service, we are shifting away from unprofitable channels, focusing on reducing churn, and acquiring customers directly online and through our growing list of service provider partners. Our Consumer Security segment performed in line with expectation as we continue to convert all of our millions of customers to a cloud based subscription service. We are about halfway through this conversion, which we expect to be complete in the summer of 2016. We're also seeing continued improvements in key levers of our Norton business such as online customer acquisition, our most profitable channel, which generated over 600,000 new units of our core Norton Security offering in Q2, up 8% year-over-year. More importantly, we believe the lifetime value for these customers is 30% higher with the subscription model. The anonymous telemetry gleaned from the large Norton customer base continues to provide Symantec with a unique perspective into global threat patterns. Last quarter, we saw several high profile attacks on a broader set of IoT devices such as cars, so we continue to believe Norton can play a bigger role in protecting our customers in the future. 
As the global leader in cybersecurity, we operate one of the world's largest cyber intelligence networks, we see more threats, and protect more customers from the next generation of attacks. We help companies, governments and individuals secure their most important data wherever it lives. I couldn't be more excited about the opportunities ahead. 
Now I'll turn it over to Thomas to provide a review of our second quarter financial results and guidance for our third and fourth fiscal quarters. Thomas?"

Before I get started, let me point out that given that the Veritas transaction has increased the complexity of our results and guidance, we've included a CFO commentary document on our website this time which will provide additional detail to my prepared remarks. 
On October 3, we completed an important milestone with the operational separation of Veritas. This is a substantial accomplishment that would not have been possible without the hard work and commitment of our employees. We remain on track to close the Veritas transaction by the end of the fiscal third quarter. In conjunction with the separation, we have committed to returning significant cash to shareholders. We had previously announced our intention to return $2 billion to shareholders over 18 months after the closing of the Veritas transaction. I am pleased to announce that we are going to commence this $2 billion capital return ahead of the expected January close of the Veritas sale. The Board of Directors has authorized us to pursue a $500 million accelerated share repurchase to be executed as soon as possible. We expected $500 million ASR will be in addition to our normal repurchase activity of approximately $125 million of shares for the third fiscal quarter, of which about $105 million have been completed to date. The ASR and our ongoing open market repurchases reflect the Board of Directors' and Symantec's confidence in our ability to achieve significantly improved performance and create sustainable value for shareholders, while it allows us to retain flexibility as we finalize our capital allocation strategy in anticipation of the transaction's closing. 
Now let me turn to second quarter financial results. Total revenue declined 1% year-over-year to $1.5 billion and was in line with our guided range. As expected, growth in Enterprise Security and Information Management substantially offset declines in Consumer Security. 
Deferred revenue was flat year-over-year at $3.3 billion, an improvement from a 1% decline in our June quarter. As a result, implied billings were flat, also an improvement from last quarter. 
The U.S. dollar strengthened against most major currencies compared to the year-ago period, which created a headwind of $99 million to second quarter revenue and $144 million to deferred revenue on a year-over-year basis. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 28.1%, an increase of 50 basis points year-over-year and at the high end of our guidance range, as we continue to seek our efficiency opportunities throughout the organization. I'll provide more detail in regards to efficiency initiatives later in my remarks. 
Non-GAAP net income of $301 million resulted in fully diluted earnings per share of $0.44. 
Moving now to our business segments. Enterprise Security revenue grew 1% year-over-year to $485 million, the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. We saw revenue outperformance from our DLP products, which grew 37% year-over-year, Endpoint Security also had another solid quarter, increasing 2% year-over-year. This strength was offset by weakness in endpoint management, mail, and data center security. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the Enterprise Security segment was 10%, which was in line with our expectations. We continue to carefully manage our investment in the business, as we shift more resources to higher enterprise security growth opportunities. 
In the Consumer Security segment, revenue declined 8%, as expected, to $420 million. We delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 55%, up 357 basis points year-over-year. Our operating margin was higher primarily as a result of continuing operational improvements in areas such as tech support and lower OEM royalty payments. 
We continue to expect Norton revenue to decline in the range of 5% to 8% for fiscal year '16, and operating margin to return to our guided range of 52% to 54% as we invest in additional marketing initiatives to improve our growing online acquisition rate and our customer experience. 
Information Management revenue increased 2% to $593 million. Non-GAAP operating margin for the IM segment increased by 489 basis points year-over-year to 23%. 
Now turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operating activities for the September quarter totaled $134 million. We made separation payments of $64 million and restructuring payments of $26 million during the September quarter. Capital expenditure was $71 million in Q2 and a total of $149 million in the first half of fiscal year '16. We returned $262 million to shareholders during the September quarter. $102 million was in the form of cash dividends and $160 million was used to repurchase 8 million shares at an average share price of $21.13. 
The expanded set of revenue and efficiency initiatives continues to improve our top line and optimize our cost structure for fiscal year '16. Let me provide an update on 3 of these initiatives. First, our license compliance initiative, which we put in place to ensure customers are current on their subscription and maintenance agreements, is on track to deliver total revenue of $17 million for the security business for fiscal year 2016. Second, within the Symantec Security business, we've implemented a plan of action to upgrade customers to the latest version of all our products. This allows us to shift support and development spending to higher growth initiatives, but even more importantly, it allows our customers to take advantage of the technology improvements in our latest releases. Finally, we are in the planning phase of leveraging and optimizing our existing data center cloud strategy to improve the overall cost of our IT infrastructure. I'll update you more on the progress of this initiative in the coming quarters. 
Now let me provide you with a high-level overview of Symantec Security's standalone financial profile for fiscal year 2016. As a reminder, all growth rates are year-over-year and in constant currency. Our revenue, operating margin, and non-GAAP EPS guidance for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 represent standalone Symantec security and do not include Veritas, formerly our Information Management segment. The impact from Veritas will be included in GAAP EPS as discontinued operations for the third quarter. 
We are lowering second half fiscal '16 revenue outlook. While our enterprise security sales pipeline is growing, it is not enough to compensate for Q1 shortfall. Similarly, we're adjusting our non-GAAP operating margin guidance. Selling the Veritas business will result in transaction service agreements, TSAs, and stranded costs which our overhead expenses once shared with Veritas. These expenses include IT-related infrastructure and services, real estate, litigation, and to a lesser extent, headcount. On an annualized basis, we expect to have approximately $130 million in TSAs and stranded costs. Our TSA costs, which represent about 1/3 of the total, will need to be in place over the next year as we support the Veritas business transition. While these TSAs are a headwind to our operating margin, Veritas will reimburse us for these costs in discontinued operations. Starting now and through fiscal year 2017, we expect to take aggressive action to right size our cost structure by this amount. This will help us to move toward our 30% operating margin target. 
Moving onto our Q3 guidance for the standalone Symantec security company. Our December 2015 quarter guidance assumes an exchange rate of $1.13. We expect Symantec security revenue for our third fiscal quarter to be between $890 million and $920 million. For our Consumer Security segment, we expect our revenue to decline year-over-year in the range of between 6% and 8%. We expect revenue for our Enterprise Security segment to grow 0.5% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to be between 25.5% and 27.5%. Excluding the impact from stranded costs and TSAs, our operating margin guidance would have been 30% at the midpoint. We expect third fiscal quarter non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.22 to $0.25, which assumes a share count of $665 million. Without the Veritas sale, we estimate that the Information Management business would have contributed an additional $0.23 per share to non-GAAP EPS. 
Moving onto our Q4 guidance for the standalone Symantec security company. Our March 2016 quarter guidance assumes an exchange rate of $1.13. We expect fourth fiscal quarter Symantec Security revenue to be between $885 million and $915 million. For our Consumer Security segment, we expect our revenue guidance to remain unchanged from a year-over-year decline in a range of between 5% and 8%. We expect revenue for our Enterprise Security segment to grow 1% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to be between 26.5% and 28.5%, resulting in an EPS in the range of $0.24 to $0.27. Excluding the impact from stranded costs in TSAs, our operating margin guidance would have been 30.3% at the midpoint. Our guidance assumes a share count of $653 million. 
In conclusion, our team has made a lot of progress in achieving operational separation and I'm confident we're on the right track in moving our business forward. As we enter the next stage of our transformation, we are well positioned to return Symantec to growth through both organic and inorganic opportunities.

So if you think about the 2 components of the business, Consumer Security and Enterprise Security, our expectations for FY '17 would be unchanged from what we've talked about at Financial Analyst Day. In other words, to refresh everybody's memory, the decline that we're seeing in Norton should moderate in FY '17, and the guidance we gave for FY '17 is a decline of between 3% and 6%, an improvement of the range of 5% to 8% that we're operating within this year. The Consumer Security remains unchanged. So the change from the revenue standpoint for FY '17 would really be around Enterprise Security. We're clearly pleased with the momentum that we're seeing in Enterprise Security, in particular, the recovery from the 4 Q1 performance. So we could see that in some of the numbers that we talked about. We're seeing particular strength in a couple of product areas today, DLP, Endpoint, Cybersecurity Services. As I talked about in my prepared remarks, we have a host of new products, in fact, a dozen new products in enterprise security. However, it will take time for customers to integrate those and for those to be contributing materially to our financial results. So the guidance we gave a year ago for FY '17 was that we would be in a range of 1% to 6% for revenue growth this year FY '16, and as you can see from the guidance that Thomas just provided, we'll be at the very low end of that range, closer to 1%. As we look forward to FY '17, it would be -- it would not be conservative to think that we'll grow at the rate that we previously gave, which was 6% to 10%. So while it's too early to give specific guidance on what we would see for Enterprise Security, we'll do that as we get closer to the end of this fiscal year '16. I think we have to say that it's going to be somewhere in between where we gave for FY '17 from our ending rate this year and the rate that we gave at Financial Analyst Day. On the margin side, we have a lot of work to do, as Thomas mentioned, to reduce our cost structure, taking account of the TSAs and stranded costs as a result of the Veritas sale. In fact if you take the guidance that Thomas gave and you add about 3 points which would account for these costs, you can see we're operating very close, if not at the guidance we gave at Financial Analyst Day, which was a range for the security business of 30% to 31% operating margin. So we have a lot of confidence that we'll be able to get back to the earnings potential of business, which will be our target of 30% operating margin. But it will take us through FY '17 to take out those costs and have that show through"

As you know, it's 3 modules, it's network, email and endpoint. Network is available today, email is also available, but our endpoint comes at the very end of the quarter. So we're in a controlled availability at this point and general availability comes at the end of the quarter. The real power of these 3 solutions come when you work with all 3 together, because the key differentiation here with Symantec's advanced threat protection is that we are able to operate across these 3 multiple control points and then prioritize for the stock analysts what are the threats that they should be worried about which really improves the signal-to-noise ratio. You don't have to worry about threats that have already been remediated by our endpoint, as an example. And then we're also allowing stock analysts to remediate, either quarantine or eliminate threats with 1 click from a single console across those multiple control points. This is a huge productivity improvement for stock analysts. The other key benefits obviously are, from a cost standpoint, these capabilities are available in a virtual appliance as opposed to a physical appliance that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, and we're correlating that threat information you're seeing in your local environment across your enterprise, with what we're seeing globally. So you get advanced notice of whatever is happening in your industry, as an example, from around the globe. So really key advantages. And that's why the pricing is a multiple of what we're seeing today with our set products. The customer reaction has been enthusiastic, as you'd imagine, given those productivity benefits that I talked about. Because one of the big expenses when security staffs are maintaining their environment or protecting their environment, is of course, the labor costs. It's not the cost of the technology that we're providing. So if we can make those folks more productive, we've saved a whole lot of money. So the reaction that we've seen even from the controlled availability of the other modules that are available, and what the beta has shown us from endpoint is that this is going to be one of our most successful products. So already in use in beta at a number of customers that are global, financial institutions, healthcare, really across the board. So we're pretty enthused, but it is early, obviously, without having the product in general availability, it would be too soon to start predicting what does that mean financially for us. And as I mentioned, when I talked about FY '17 guidance, it's going to take, you pick the number, 6 to 9 months, for customers to really do their own testing, integrate this and start buying in sufficient quantity to affect the financials."

There's 5 or 6 engines in our  SEP product today, including things like file reputation, intrusion prevention, behavioral analysis to understand what files are really doing. So we want to make sure that our customers have all of those engines turned on. And when they do, we're blocking more threats than anyone else. And we have proof of that in third-party testing.

We've made 2 acquisitions, so we're being highly selective in terms of looking at these targets. One was a Narus acquisition, which was getting a select group of data scientists who can really help us accelerate the Unified Security Analytics platform that we're building, and as we talked about earlier in my prepared remarks, we're getting the first application, something called Risk Insight, that will be available basically in the second half of fiscal year '16. And then more recently, Blackfin, which was a complementary technology to add to Cybersecurity Services specifically in the simulation services area. So we've already begun the looking for what are the complementary targets out there. They need to be tightly aligned with the strategy. One of the things that I could be critical about our past is that, perhaps we haven't gone after acquisitions that were tightly aligned with the articulated strategy. And then as we've also talked about in the past, we really are going to be able to bring value if we look for a complementary technology where we can use our distribution capability to grow that dramatically. Perhaps the most successful example of that was our DLP business, which today is a flagship in the industry in terms of its performance. So I would say, we're not in a hurry, I can't remember the words you used, but no, we're not in a hurry. There's a lot of opportunity out there but we need to be very selective. It's not lost on us that most of these companies are trading in a multiple of revenue, and obviously, our multiple of revenue is quite low. So we're going to be very selective about choosing the right targets that fit with the strategy, that we can grow dramatically and then have the appropriate risk-adjusted return for shareholders."

If you think about, if your question really is related to FireEye's comments, they're clearly focused on advanced threat protection, that's a market we don't even have exposure to yet in any material way, and of course, the other area of competitive overlap for us is services with Mandiant, which is so successful in the service arena. Our answer to response business is newer than theirs, we're at capacity, we're trying to grow that as fast as we can, but obviously, they have a much larger position in incident response than we do. So we don't overlap as much. So my comments really are related to our business, and obviously, I don't see what they're seeing."

The other is our primary means of acquiring customers which shifted from OEM and retail to online. So we talk about that being up 8% year-over-year, we added 600,000 new customers for Norton this past quarter. So about half of our business now is online customers, and those tend to be the stickiest because they've made the positive decision to go with the best. And I think we've been awarded the PC Editor's Choice Award 37 times at this point. So they're making a positive choice to go with the premium offering for security, and we find that those customers have a larger lifetime value, 30% more relative to if that customer that comes in through OEM or retail. So that's what we're excited about in terms of driving some improved numbers for this business and getting back to a top line that's flat, if not growing. The market for paid consumer security is growing at low single digits, then no reason why this business, once it's transformed, all subscription, primarily acquisition of online customers, can't get to that level, and as I've mentioned previously, we're looking at ways to leverage the Norton brand to get into some new areas. I talked about Internet of Things as an example, more and more consumer devices in the home exposed to security threats. So we're looking at some ways to drive the business to grow faster, that will be separate from kind of the offerings that are available today. So it's that combination of things that gives us confidence that this business should continue to improve not just next year but in the foreseeable future. Then the margin structure, we've said that our margin target is 52% to 54%. We've been a little bit better than that recently, 57% in the first quarter; this quarter, 55%. We do expect to operate in that more normalized range, and part of the reason we're saying that is because we are making some investments in the business, improving the customer experience, investing in that acquisition channel, getting customer -- more customers online and then obviously some investment going to what can we do in new areas to leverage the Norton brand, as I mentioned. So that will drive the margin a little bit lower than what we've seen in the last 2 quarters as we look further out."

So we're in a transition and because the business is ratable, we're talking about customers rolling off a download model into a subscription model. That's why it's taking so long for this transition. That's compounded by the change in how we're acquiring customers moving from primarily OEM and retail into primarily online. So that's the dynamic that you're looking at. The 600,000 customers that we added were exclusively online acquisitions. So obviously, that's being offset by continued declines in retail and OEM. But, of course, as we start to get the millions of customers as we talked about before, we protect $65 million consumer endpoints out there. So as we begin to reach the second half here of that migration to the subscription service, the numbers begin to look better. And what we're really excited about is when we get through that complete transition, which we talked about summer of 2016, it will be very interesting to see obviously what the year-over-year comparisons look like then. But we have to wait awhile to get to that point. And by that point the business should be primarily customers that we've acquired online. And then maybe obvious to everyone is the fact that why do we feel that way? It's because retail customers tend to be shopping for the lowest price. They're doing that comparison. And OEM consumers don't necessarily renew at all. So you pay those fees upfront. A year later, that customer may not renew with you at all. You've paid that placement fee, you get no value for that. That's why we're so excited about this transition."
