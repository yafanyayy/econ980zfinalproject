GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com in our earnings release and our quarterly financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.
Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer.
After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas;   Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Chris Townsend, President of Asia.

185648,281573239,760781,"MetLife, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2015",2015-02-12,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report solid results for the fourth quarter of 2014. Operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up 2% from the fourth quarter of 2013, and operating earnings per share were $1.38, a 1% increase over",1263,"Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report solid results for the fourth quarter of 2014. Operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up 2% from the fourth quarter of 2013, and operating earnings per share were $1.38, a 1% increase over the prior year period. 
Full year 2014 operating earnings were $6.6 billion, a 5% increase over 2013, and operating earnings per share were up 2% from the prior year period. Operating return on equity was 12% for the full year 2014. Intangible operating ROE was 15.2%. We believe tangible ROE is a better measure of the business returns for MetLife because it excludes purchase accounting adjustments, primarily goodwill. 
Our strong 2014 operating earnings came on top of above-planned results for 2013, and we once again achieved an operating ROE at the low end of our 2016 target of 12% to 14%. 
I'm even more pleased with MetLife's multiyear performance, which is a better measure of success in our long-term business. MetLife's operating earnings increased at a compound annual rate of 12.1% from 2011 to 2014. Over the same period, operating EPS grew at a compound annual rate of 9.6%. 
Operating return on equity averaged 11.8% from 2012 through 2014, only slightly below the low end of the 2016 target range. Close to double-digit operating EPS growth and a 12% operating ROE during the past 3 years are noteworthy accomplishments, given that the 10-year Treasury yield has averaged 2.2% since the summer of 2011, and our capital management actions have been conservative due to regulatory uncertainty. 
With the 10-year Treasury yield now at 2%, the low-interest rate environment remains a challenge for life insurance business. Over the long term, we believe the 10-year Treasury yield should be 4% to 4.5% based on the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target and expectations for long-term economic growth. However, if interest rates remain low indefinitely, there would likely be a downward reset in return expectations across asset classes. Because equity returns are measured against the risk-free rate, the spread between MetLife's operating ROE and the 10-year Treasury yield is a key metric. 
From 2012 to 2014, the spread between MetLife's ROE and the 10-year Treasury yield has averaged 9.6%. This compares favorably to an average spread of 6.9% from 2000, the year of MetLife's initial public offering, to 2011. 
I would now like to comment on capital management. We repurchased $557 million of stock in the fourth quarter, completing the $1 billion share repurchase program we announced in June. For the year-to-date, we have taken advantage of share price weakness and repurchased $693 million of the $1 billion program we announced on December. 
Given where the stock is trading today, it is likely that we will complete this $1 billion program soon. While we continue to believe that MetLife is well capitalized, uncertainty surrounding potential capital rules makes us cautious about share repurchases in excess of $1 billion in 2015. 
Turning to strategy. In 2014, we achieved 2 key elements of the strategy that we announced in May of 2012. We have de-risked the Retail business, which was a large part of our refocus the U.S. business cornerstone of our strategy, and we achieved net expense savings of $600 million pretax. 
Our Retail business has undergone a transformation during the past few years as we have worked to reduce risk, create a more efficient operation and improve the productivity of our distribution force. De-risking meant pulling back from the variable annuity market and exiting the lifetime secondary guarantee universal life market. Both of these initiatives had a material negative impact on sales. We believe that 2014 will prove to be an inflection point for annuity sales and anticipate profitable growth in 2015 and beyond. 
In variable annuities, I am pleased to announce that we will launch a new guaranteed lifetime minimum withdrawal benefit product, Flex Choice, on February 17. The income benefit for this product meets the current expectations of the marketplace. As we communicated on our December outlook call, we anticipate more than a 50% increase in total annuity sales in 2015. However, a projected rebound in annuity sales does not mean we are changing our overall strategy, which is to emphasize growth in less capital-intensive, protection-oriented product lines. 
First, the projected sales increase is from a low base. Variable annuity sales were $6.3 billion in 2014, down dramatically from $28.4 billion in 2011. 
Second, we estimate that Retail annuities will account for a smaller percentage of enterprise capital over time. 
Another key strategy milestone in 2014 was achieving our net expense savings targets of $600 million pretax. Our gross expense savings were $910 million last year, close to the $1 billion strategy target. We are highly confident that we will realize the $1 billion gross savings target in 2015. 
The difference between gross and net savings in 2014 was a combination of onetime costs and reinvestment in the business. Onetime costs will fade, but there will be a substantial increase in the reinvestment spend, which is largely technology-related. Expenditures that represent an investment in the future, including much of the work we are doing to update our technology, may reduce current period earnings but are necessary to drive profitable growth over time. 
Turning to regulatory issues. As you know, MetLife has filed a legal challenge to its designation as a systemically important financial institution by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. As I said when we filed the challenge last month, MetLife had hoped to avoid litigation in light of the substantial and compelling evidence we presented to FSOC, demonstrating the company is not systemically important. 
The Dodd–Frank Act is clear that size alone does not make a company systemic, and we believe FSOC erred in designating MetLife. We believe we have a strong deal case to present to the courts and look forward to its eventual decision. As a former regulator, I want to emphasize that MetLife has always supported robust regulation in the life insurance industry. It has operated under a stringent state regulatory system for decades. 
However, adding a new federal standard for just the largest life insurers while retaining a different standard for everyone else will harm competition. This will drive up the cost of financial protection for consumers without making the financial systems safer. We believe the government should preserve a level playing field in the life insurance industry. If additional regulation is necessary, the government has a superior tool at its disposal and approach that focuses on potentially systemic activities regardless of the size of the firm. 
FSOC has already embraced this activities-based approach for the asset management industry. Litigation takes time to resolve. In the meantime, the Federal Reserve is now one of MetLife's regulators. We are cooperating fully with representatives from the New York Fed as they carry out their supervisory duties. At the same time, we continue to discuss with regulators and lawmakers in Washington the need for capital rules that reflect the business of insurance. 
With the enactment of the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act in December, the Federal Reserve now has the flexibility it needs to appropriately tailor capital rules for life insurers. 
In closing, let me reiterate MetLife's commitment to creating long-term value for shareholders. We are focused on maintaining the appropriate risk profile, selling business at attractive rates of return relative to our cost of capital and most important, improving free cash flow so MetLife can return additional capital to shareholders. 
With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?"

Today, I'll cover our fourth quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. 
Operating earnings in the fourth quarter were $1.6 billion, up 2% from the prior year period, and operating earnings per share were $1.38, up 1%. This quarter included 4 notable items, which were disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our quarterly financial supplement or QFS. 
First, consistent with guidance from our December outlook call, we have strengthened our asbestos legal reserves in the quarter to reflect higher frequency and severity of claims. This resulted in an after-tax charge of $117 million or $0.10 per share. 
Second, we had favorable onetime tax adjustments in Latin America and EMEA, which increased operating earnings by $27 million or $0.02 per share. 
Third, we had lower-than-budgeted catastrophe experience and favorable prior year development, which increased operating earnings by $16 million or $0.01 per share. 
Finally, we had 3 actuarial-related items that increased operating earnings by a net $5 million or less than $0.01 per share. The first actuarial-related item, a $66 million reduction in operating earnings, was related to interest on unclaimed funds from life policies where we cannot locate the beneficiaries. These unclaimed funds are held by state governments and a multistate audit determined that MetLife owed interest on these policies. The impact was a $57 million in Retail life and other and $9 million in Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits. 
The second, a $48 million benefit to operating earnings, was a reserve adjustment to correct the treatment of the disability premium waiver writer in a number of term life contracts in Retail life and other. You may recall, we had a positive adjustment for this item in the second quarter of 2014 as well. 
The third, a $23 million benefit to operating earnings in Asia, was unlocking the deferred acquisition cost or DAC. This unlocking resulted from a lower expense assumption for certain life products in Japan. 
Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 5% year-over-year and 9% on a constant-currency basis. The key drivers on a constant-currency basis were underwriting improvement, business growth and lower taxes, which were partially offset by less favorable equity market performance. 
Turning to our bottom line results. Fourth quarter net income was $1.5 billion or $1.30 per share. Net income was $93 million, below operating earnings in the quarter. 
Four items that explain most of this difference are: number one, charges of $140 million after-tax associated with asymmetrical accounting treatment for insurance contracts and other market value adjustments; number two, derivative net losses of $40 million after-tax, which reflects changes in foreign currencies, partially offset by gains from lower interest rates in the quarter; number three, a loss of $25 million after-tax related to certain variable annuity guarantees where the hedged assets are more sensitive to market fluctuations than the GAAP treatment for guarantee liabilities; and these were partially offset by number four, investment portfolio net gains of $129 million after-tax as credit-related losses continue to be modest in the portfolio. 
Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $49.53 as of December 30, up 5% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $40.36 at year-end, up 9% year-over-year. 
In the fourth quarter, operating ROE was 11.3%, and tangible operating ROE was 14.1%. As Steve noted, we believe tangible operating ROE provides a better measure of the underlying business returns for MetLife. 
Turning to fourth quarter margins. Underwriting results improved sequentially and year-over-year by approximately $0.06 after adjusting for notable items in both periods. 
Year-over-year highlights include improvement in mortality and morbidity experienced in the U.S. as well as strong results in property and casualty. Retail life interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 53.9% in the fourth quarter and 53.0% after adjusting for the net impact of the notable items discussed earlier. This result compared favorably to the prior year quarter of 54.2% and within our targeted range of 50% to 55%. 
This marked the second consecutive quarter of normal claim activity for Retail life after 4 volatile quarters. The mortality ratio in Group Life was 88.4% and 87.4% after adjusting for the interest in unclaimed funds. The adjusted ratio was favorable to 87.9% in the prior year quarter as well -- and well within the targeted range of 85% to 90%. 
The non-medical health interest-adjusted loss ratio was 77.4%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 80.9% and the low end of the targeted range of 77% to 82%. Disability underwriting improved while dental margins were favorable to the prior year as utilization returned to a normal level. 
In our P&C business, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 85.8% in Retail and 92.3% in group. The combined ratios, excluding catastrophes, were 81.5% in Retail and 90.8% in group. 
Overall, P&C underwriting results were favorable versus the prior year due to lower non-cat losses and expenses as well as favorable prior year reserve development. 
Moving to fourth quarter investment margins. The average of the 4 U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 215 basis points, down 26 basis points year-over-year and 21 sequentially. Product spreads, excluding variable investment income, were 186 basis points, down 13 basis points versus the prior year and 5 sequentially. 
The sequential decline in spreads can be attributed to 3 primary factors. First, pretax variable investment income was $325 million, at the top end of our 2014 quarterly guidance range. After taxes and the impact of DAC, VII was $211 million, down $62 million sequentially due to weaker private equity and hedge fund returns. 
Second, core yields declined as a result of the low-interest rate environment. Average new money yields are running roughly 100 to 150 basis points below the average roll-off yield on the portfolio. 
And third, there was a transfer of cash into Retail annuity upon the completion of the 4-way  merger November, which accounts for the majority of the 20 basis points declined in deferred annuity spreads in the quarter. We would expect to reinvest this cash in longer-dated securities over time. 
With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 25.0% in the fourth quarter as compared to 25.3% in the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for asbestos and other legal reserves in both quarters, the operating expense ratio was 23.7% in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 23.6% in the prior year period. 
Gross expense saves were $259 million in the fourth quarter and net saves were $163 million after adjusting for reinvestment of $33 million and onetime costs of $63 million. 
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $683 million, up 4% versus the prior year quarter and up 7% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. 
Growth in Retail was driven by life and other, which reported operating earnings of $321 million, up 13% versus the prior year quarter and 14% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were lower expenses and favorable underwriting. 
Life and other PFOs were $2.2 billion, up 2% year-over-year, primarily due to growth in the open block and P&C, partially offset by the runoff of the closed block. Annuities reported operating earnings of $362 million, down 3% versus the prior year quarter and essentially flat after adjusting for excess variable investment in the prior year. Annuities PFOs were $1.2 billion, up 7% year-over-year, primarily due to higher income annuity sales. 
Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits or GVWB reported operating earnings of $235 million, up 2% versus the prior year quarter and 9% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Underwriting was a key driver with improved results in disability, dental, Group Life and P&C. GVWB PFOs were $4.2 billion, up 3% year-over-year, and sales increased 17% due to strong growth across all products. 
Corporate benefit funding reported operating earnings of $374 million, up 5% versus the prior year quarter and 10% after adjusting for notable items. The key drivers were favorable underwriting and business growth. CBF PFOs were $1.5 billion, down 5% year-over-year due to lower income annuities and pension closeouts. 
On closeouts, we remain active but disciplined and continue to see a good pipeline of small to midsized cases. Latin America reported operating earnings of $187 million, up 8% from the prior year quarter and 26% on a constant-currency basis. 
Adjusting for the notable tax items this quarter, operating earnings were up 17% on a constant-currency basis driven by business growth across the region, partially offset by higher expenses. Overall, Latin American taxes were unusually low in the quarter even after adjusting for the notable tax item. Latin America PFOs were $1 billion, down 5% from the prior year quarter and up 6% on a constant-currency basis, driven by growth across the region. 
Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $335 million, up 3% from the prior year quarter and 9% on a constant-currency basis. After adjusting for notable items in both quarters, operating earnings were up 7% on a constant-currency basis. Improvement in investment margins and business growth in the region were the primary drivers. Asia PFOs were $2.3 billion, down 3% from the prior year quarter but up 6% on a constant-currency basis, primarily due to growth in Japan, Korea and Australia. 
Asia sales were down 30% from the fourth quarter of 2013. The decline was expected as the prior year quarter had a large group employee benefit sale in Australia and elevated life sales in Japan in advance of pricing changes. Adjusting for these items, Asia's sales were up 1%. 
In Japan, total A&H sales were up 28% year-over-year and 52% sequentially. We have seen good traction from our 2 new medical products launched in September, which we announced during the 2014 Asia Investor Day. 
In EMEA, operating earnings were $85 million, down 4% but up 9% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. Adjusting for notable tax items in both periods, operating earnings were up 7% on a constant-currency basis due to business growth in the Middle East and a $7 million from the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting. EMEA PFOs were $671 million, down 4% from the prior year period but up 3% on a constant-currency basis. 
Total sales increased 22% with 40% growth in emerging markets, including strong employee benefit sales in the Middle East and A&H across the region. 
Finally, the operating loss in Corporate & Other was $316 million as compared to an operating loss of $278 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusting for the increase in asbestos legal reserves this quarter, the operating loss was $199 million, which was within the $175 million to $225 million operating loss range that we guided to during the third quarter earnings call. 
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $6.1 billion at December 31. In addition, our 2014 free cash flow ratio was 44%, better than our updated December estimates of approximately 40%. 
Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. While we have not yet completed our risk-based capital calculations for 2014, we estimate our combined RBC ratio will be in a range of 400% to 420%. Our Japan solvency margin ratio, which we file quarterly, was 1,003% as of the third quarter, and we estimate that our fourth quarter ratio will be comparable. 
For our U.S. insurance companies, preliminary fourth quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $2.4 billion, and statutory net income was approximately $1.7 billion. For the full year of 2014, statutory operating earnings were approximately $5.2 billion, and U.S. statutory net income was approximately $3.8 billion. 
U.S. statutory operating earnings on a comparable basis were down $1.2 billion versus the prior year, primarily due to a less favorable equity markets and reserve strengthening. We said in our December outlook call that we thought statutory insurance reserve increases at our New York subsidiary would be $400 million to $600 million more than we had initially contemplated. Although we are still finalizing year-end statutory statements, we anticipate the increase in reserves will be in line with this revised expectation even though the assumptions for cash flow testing reflected the lower interest rate environment since the December outlook call. 
The year-end financials will also show capital contributed to our life insurance captives driven by low interest rates. This increase in capital will be funded by $670 million of cash from the holding company with a $225 million contribution last year and a planned $445 million contribution in 2015. 
Despite these cash contributions from the holding company, free cash flow was better than our forecast in 2014, and we still believe a 45% to 55% ratio is a reasonable expectation for 2015. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $28 billion as of December 31, up 13% on a comparable basis to the prior year. 
In conclusion, MetLife had a good fourth quarter to close out a strong year. Investment margins remain healthy despite pressure from low rates. Expenses are well controlled, and underwriting improved for the second consecutive quarter. In addition, our cash and capital position remain strong, and we continue to successfully execute on our strategy as we seek to maximize shareholder value. 
And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions."

The -- but we do this across all of our businesses. We use the New York 7 scenarios, not only in all non-New York companies but even our life insurance captives, and that again I mentioned some more capital that we are putting up there for lower interest rates. We did use rates that were actually lower than where we saw year-end 10-year Treasuries, but it's a little more complex than that because it's not just a 10-year Treasury. It's the shape of the yield curve and the reinvestment curve and actually, compared to a few years ago, we actually have a flatter curve with the 30-year treasury is actually lower than we saw even a couple of years ago when we saw low interest rates prior. So that has impacted the asset testing because these long-dated contracts, it's a very long reinvestment fund. So it does have an impact. So as we mentioned, the testing that we've now just completed for year-end does reflect some more recent conditions, and it's within the range that we have talked about in December."

We are pleased to report solid results for the fourth quarter of 2014. Operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up 2% from the fourth quarter of 2013, and operating earnings per share were $1.38, a 1% increase over",1263,"Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report solid results for the fourth quarter of 2014. Operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up 2% from the fourth quarter of 2013, and operating earnings per share were $1.38, a 1% increase over the prior year period. 
Full year 2014 operating earnings were $6.6 billion, a 5% increase over 2013, and operating earnings per share were up 2% from the prior year period. Operating return on equity was 12% for the full year 2014. Intangible operating ROE was 15.2%. We believe tangible ROE is a better measure of the business returns for MetLife because it excludes purchase accounting adjustments, primarily goodwill.
Our strong 2014 operating earnings came on top of above-planned results for 2013, and we once again achieved an operating ROE at the low end of our 2016 target of 12% to 14%.
I'm even more pleased with MetLife's multiyear performance, which is a better measure of success in a long-term business. MetLife's operating earnings increased at a compound annual rate of 12.1% from 2011 to 2014. Over the same period, operating EPS grew at a compound annual rate of 9.6%.
Operating return on equity averaged 11.8% from 2012 through 2014, only slightly below the low end of the 2016 target range. Close to double-digit operating EPS growth and a 12% operating ROE during the past 3 years are noteworthy accomplishments, given the 10-year Treasury yield has averaged 2.2% since the summer of 2011, and our capital management actions have been conservative due to regulatory uncertainty. 
With the 10-year Treasury yield now at 2%, the low-interest rate environment remains a challenge for life insurance business. Over the long term, we believe the 10-year Treasury yield should be 4% to 4.5% based on the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target and expectations for long-term economic growth. However, if interest rates remain low indefinitely, there would likely be a downward reset in return expectations across asset classes. Because equity returns are measured against the risk-free rate, the spread between MetLife's operating ROE and the 10-year Treasury yield is a key metric. 
From 2012 to 2014, the spread between MetLife's ROE and the 10-year Treasury yield has averaged 9.6%. This compares favorably to an average spread of 6.9% from 2000, the year of MetLife's initial public offering, to 2011. 
I would now like to comment on capital management. We repurchased $557 million of stock in the fourth quarter, completing the $1 billion share repurchase program we announced in June. For the year-to-date, we have taken advantage of share price weakness and repurchased $693 million of the $1 billion program we announced in December. 
Given where the stock is trading today, it is likely that we will complete this $1 billion program soon. While we continue to believe that MetLife is well capitalized, uncertainty surrounding potential capital rules makes us cautious about share repurchases in excess of $1 billion in 2015.
Turning to strategy. In 2014, we achieved 2 key elements of the strategy that we announced in May of 2012. We have de-risked the Retail business, which was a large part of our refocus the U.S. business cornerstone of our strategy, and we achieved net expense savings of $600 million pretax. 
Our Retail business has undergone a transformation during the past few years as we have worked to reduce risk, create a more efficient operation and improve the productivity of our distribution force. De-risking meant pulling back from the variable annuity market and exiting the lifetime secondary guarantee universal life market. Both of these initiatives had a material negative impact on sales. We believe that 2014 will prove to be an inflection point for annuity sales and anticipate profitable growth in 2015 and beyond. 
In variable annuities, I am pleased to announce that we will launch a new guaranteed lifetime minimum withdrawal benefit product, Flex Choice, on February 17. The income benefit for this product meets the current expectations of the marketplace. As we communicated on our December outlook call, we anticipate more than a 50% increase in total annuity sales in 2015. However, a projected rebound in annuity sales does not mean we are changing our overall strategy, which is to emphasize growth in less capital-intensive, protection-oriented product lines. 
First, the projected sales increase is from a low base. Variable annuity sales were $6.3 billion in 2014, down dramatically from $28.4 billion in 2011.
Second, we estimate that Retail annuities will account for a smaller percentage of enterprise capital over time.
Another key strategy milestone in 2014 was achieving our net expense savings targets of $600 million pretax. Our gross expense savings were $910 million last year, close to the $1 billion strategy target. We are highly confident that we will realize the $1 billion gross savings target in 2015.
The difference between gross and net savings in 2014 was a combination of onetime costs and reinvestment in the business. Onetime costs will fade, but there will be a substantial increase in the reinvestment spend, which is largely technology related. Expenditures that represent an investment in the future, including much of the work we are doing to update our technology, may reduce current period earnings but are necessary to drive profitable growth over time. 
Turning to regulatory issues. As you know, MetLife has filed a legal challenge to its designation as a systemically important financial institution by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. As I said when we filed the challenge last month, MetLife had hoped to avoid litigation in light of the substantial and compelling evidence we presented to FSOC, demonstrating the company is not systemically important. 
The Dodd–Frank Act is clear that size alone does not make a company systemic, and we believe FSOC erred in designating MetLife. We believe we have a strong legal case to present to the court and look forward to its eventual decision. As a former regulator, I want to emphasize that MetLife has always supported robust regulation in the life insurance industry. It has operated under a stringent state regulatory system for decades.
However, adding a new federal standard for just the largest life insurers while retaining a different standard for everyone else will harm competition. This will drive up the cost of financial protection for consumers without making the financial systems safer. We believe the government should preserve a level playing field in the life insurance industry. If additional regulation is necessary, the government has a superior tool at its disposal, an approach that focuses on potentially systemic activities regardless of the size of the firm.
FSOC has already embraced this activities-based approach for the asset management industry. Litigation takes time to resolve. In the meantime, the Federal Reserve is now one of MetLife's regulators. We are cooperating fully with representatives from the New York Fed as they carry out their supervisory duties. At the same time, we continue to discuss with regulators and lawmakers in Washington the need for capital rules that reflect the business of insurance. 
With the enactment of the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act in December, the Federal Reserve now has the flexibility it needs to appropriately tailor capital rules for life insurers.
In closing, let me reiterate MetLife's commitment to creating long-term value for shareholders. We are focused on maintaining the appropriate risk profile, compelling business at attractive rates of return relative to our cost of capital and most important, improving free cash flow so MetLife can return additional capital to shareholders.
With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?"

Today, I'll cover our fourth quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital.
Operating earnings in the fourth quarter were $1.6 billion, up 2% from the prior year period, and operating earnings per share were $1.38, up 1%. This quarter included 4 notable items, which were disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our quarterly financial supplement or QFS.
First, consistent with the guidance from our December outlook call, we have strengthened our asbestos legal reserves in the quarter to reflect higher frequency and severity of claims. This resulted in an after-tax charge of $117 million or $0.10 per share. 
Second, we had favorable onetime tax adjustments in Latin America and EMEA, which increased operating earnings by $27 million or $0.02 per share.
Third, we had lower-than-budgeted catastrophe experience and favorable prior year development, which increased operating earnings by $16 million or $0.01 per share.
Finally, we had 3 actuarial-related items that increased operating earnings by a net $5 million or less than $0.01 per share. The first actuarial-related item, a $66 million reduction in operating earnings, was related to interest on unclaimed funds from life policies where we cannot locate the beneficiaries. These unclaimed funds are held by state governments and a multistate audit determined that MetLife owed interest on these policies. The impact was a $57 million in Retail life and other and $9 million in Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefit. 
The second, a $48 million benefit to operating earnings, was a reserve adjustment to correct the treatment of the disability premium waiver writer in a number of term life contracts in Retail life and other. You may recall, we had a positive adjustment for this item in the second quarter of 2014 as well.
The third, a $23 million benefit to operating earnings in Asia, was unlocking the deferred acquisition cost or DAC. This unlocking resulted from a lower expense assumption for certain life products in Japan.
Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 5% year-over-year and 9% on a constant-currency basis. The key drivers on a constant-currency basis were underwriting improvement, business growth and lower taxes, which were partially offset by less favorable equity market performance.
Turning to our bottom line results. Fourth quarter net income was $1.5 billion or $1.30 per share. Net income was $93 million, below operating earnings in the quarter. 
Four items that explain most of this difference are: number one, charges of $140 million after tax associated with asymmetrical accounting treatment for insurance contracts and other market value adjustments; number two, derivative net losses of $40 million after tax, which reflects changes in foreign currencies, partially offset by gains from lower interest rates in the quarter; number three, a loss of $25 million after tax related to certain variable annuity guarantees where the hedged assets are more sensitive to market fluctuations than the GAAP treatment for guarantee liabilities; and these were partially offset by number four, investment portfolio net gains of $129 million after tax as credit-related losses continue to be modest in the portfolio. 
Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $49.53 as of December 30, up 5% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $40.36 at year end, up 9% year-over-year. 
In the fourth quarter, operating ROE was 11.3%, and tangible operating ROE was 14.1%. As Steve noted, we believe tangible operating ROE provides a better measure of the underlying business returns for MetLife.
Turning to fourth quarter margins. Underwriting results improved sequentially and year-over-year by approximately $0.06 after adjusting for notable items in both periods.
Year-over-year highlights include improvement in mortality and morbidity experienced in the U.S. as well as strong results in property and casualty. Retail life interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 53.9% in the fourth quarter and 53.0% after adjusting for the net impact of the notable items discussed earlier. This result compared favorably to the prior year quarter of 54.2% and within our targeted range of 50% to 55%.
This marked the second consecutive quarter of normal claim activity for Retail life after 4 volatile quarters. The mortality ratio in Group Life was 88.4% and 87.4% after adjusting for the interest in unclaimed funds. The adjusted ratio was favorable to 87.9% in the prior year quarter as well and well within the targeted range of 85% to 90%.
The non-medical health interest-adjusted loss ratio was 77.4%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 80.9% and the low end of the targeted range of 77% to 82%. Disability underwriting improved while dental margins were favorable to the prior year as utilization returned to a normal level.
In our P&C business, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 85.8% in Retail and 92.3% in group. The combined ratios, excluding catastrophes, were 81.5% in Retail and 90.8% in group.
Overall, P&C underwriting results are favorable versus the prior year due to lower non-cat  losses and expenses as well as favorable prior year reserve development.
Moving to fourth quarter investment margins. The average of the 4 U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 215 basis points, down 26 basis points year-over-year and 21 sequentially. Product spreads, excluding variable investment income, were 186 basis points, down 13 basis points versus the prior year and 5 sequentially.
The sequential decline in spreads can be attributed to 3 primary factors. First, pretax variable investment income was $325 million, at the top end of our 2014 quarterly guidance range. After taxes and the impact of DAC, VII was $211 million, down $62 million sequentially due to weaker private equity and hedge fund returns.
Second, core yields declined as a result of the low-interest rate environment. Average new money yields are running roughly 100 to 150 basis points below the average roll-off yield on the portfolio. 
And third, there was a transfer of cash into Retail annuity upon the completion of the 4-way  merger in November, which accounts for the majority of the 20 basis points declined in deferred annuity spreads in the quarter. We would expect to reinvest this cash in longer-dated securities over time. 
With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 25.0% in the fourth quarter as compared to 25.3% in the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for asbestos and other legal reserves in both quarters, the operating expense ratio was 23.7% in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 23.6% in the prior year period.
Gross expense saves were $259 million in the fourth quarter and net saves were $163 million after adjusting for reinvestment of $33 million and onetime cost of $63 million.
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $683 million, up 4% versus the prior year quarter and up 7% after adjusting for notable items in both periods.
Growth in Retail was driven by life and other, which reported operating earnings of $321 million, up 13% versus the prior year quarter and 14% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were lower expenses and favorable underwriting.
Life and other PFOs were $2.2 billion, up 2% year-over-year, primarily due to growth in the open block and P&C, partially offset by the runoff of the closed block. Annuities reported operating earnings of $362 million, down 3% versus the prior year quarter and essentially flat after adjusting for excess variable investment in the prior year. Annuities PFOs were $1.2 billion, up 7% year-over-year, primarily due to higher income annuity sales.
Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits or GVWB reported operating earnings of $235 million, up 2% versus the prior year quarter and 9% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Underwriting was a key driver with improved results in disability, dental, Group Life and P&C. GVWB PFOs were $4.2 billion, up 3% year-over-year, and sales increased 17% due to strong growth across all products.
Corporate benefit funding reported operating earnings of $374 million, up 5% versus the prior year quarter and 10% after adjusting for notable items. The key drivers were favorable underwriting and business growth. CBF PFOs were $1.5 billion, down 5% year-over-year due to lower income annuities and pension closeouts.
On closeouts, we remain active but disciplined and continue to see a good pipeline of small to midsized cases. Latin America reported operating earnings of $187 million, up 8% from the prior year quarter and 26% on a constant-currency basis.
Adjusting for the notable tax items this quarter, operating earnings were up 17% on a constant-currency basis driven by business growth across the region, partially offset by higher expenses. Overall, Latin American taxes were unusually low in the quarter even after adjusting for the notable tax item. Latin America PFOs were $1 billion, down 5% from the prior year quarter and up 6% on a constant-currency basis, driven by growth across the region.
Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $335 million, up 3% from the prior year quarter and 9% on a constant-currency basis. After adjusting for notable items in both quarters, operating earnings were up 7% on a constant-currency basis. Improvement in investment margins and business growth in the region were the primary drivers. Asia PFOs were $2.3 billion, down 3% from the prior year quarter but up 6% on a constant-currency basis, primarily due to growth in Japan, Korea and Australia. 
Asia sales were down 30% from the fourth quarter of 2013. The decline was expected as the prior year quarter had a large group employee benefit sale in Australia and elevated yen life sales in Japan in advance of pricing changes. Adjusting for these items, Asia's sales were up 1%.
In Japan, total A&H sales were up 28% year-over-year and 52% sequentially. We have seen good traction from our 2 new medical products launched in September, which we announced during the 2014 Asia Investor Day.
In EMEA, operating earnings were $85 million, down 4% but up 9% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. Adjusting for notable tax items in both periods, operating earnings were up 7% on a constant-currency basis due to business growth in the Middle East and a $7 million from the conversion of certain operations to calendar-year reporting. EMEA PFOs were $671 million, down 4% from the prior year period but up 3% on a constant-currency basis. 
Total sales increased 22% with 40% growth in emerging market, including strong employee benefit sales in the Middle East and A&H across the region. 
Finally, the operating loss in Corporate & Other was $316 million as compared to an operating loss of $278 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusting for the increase in asbestos legal reserves this quarter, the operating loss was $199 million, which was within the $175 million to $225 million operating loss range that we guided to during the third quarter earnings call.
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $6.1 billion at December 31. In addition, our 2014 free cash flow ratio was 44%, better than our updated December estimate of approximately 40%. 
Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. While we have not yet completed our risk-based capital calculations for 2014, we estimate our combined RBC ratio will be in a range of 400% to 420%. Our Japan solvency margin ratio, which we file quarterly, was 1,003% as of the third quarter, and we estimate that our fourth quarter ratio will be comparable. 
For our U.S. insurance companies, preliminary fourth quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $2.4 billion, and statutory net income was approximately $1.7 billion. For the full year of 2014, statutory operating earnings were approximately $5.2 billion, and U.S. statutory net income was approximately $3.8 billion. 
U.S. statutory operating earnings on a comparable basis were down $1.2 billion versus the prior year, primarily due to a less favorable equity markets and reserve strengthening. We said in our December outlook call that we thought statutory insurance reserve increases at our New York subsidiary would be $400 million to $600 million more than we had initially contemplated. Although we are still finalizing year-end statutory statements, we anticipate the increase in reserves will be in line with this revised expectation even though the assumptions for cash flow testing reflected the lower interest rate environment since the December outlook call. 
The year-end financials will also show capital contributed to our life insurance captives driven by low interest rates. This increase in capital will be funded by $670 million of cash from the holding company, with the $225 million contribution last year and a planned $445 million contribution in 2015. 
Despite these cash contributions from the holding company, free cash flow was better than our forecast in 2014, and we still believe a 45% to 55% ratio is a reasonable expectation for 2015. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $28 billion as of December 31, up 13% on a comparable basis to the prior year.
In conclusion, MetLife had a good fourth quarter to close out a strong year. Investment margins remain healthy despite pressure from low rates. Expenses are well controlled, and underwriting improved for the second consecutive quarter. In addition, our cash and capital position remain strong, and we continue to successfully execute on our strategy as we seek to maximize shareholder value.

And I guess I would describe the pieces of it are incident is stable, claims resolution is much improved as you would hope, given our -- the changes we've put in place regarding our claims operations, which I think I talked about a couple of quarters ago, and so that's good news. It's somewhat offset by -- social security offsets are soft, and they've been soft for a while now. And I think that has a lot to do with what's going on with Social Security Administration more than it does with MetLife, but they're -- so those kind of it that I would say the big pieces that are moving around but the net result is it's -- it was a good number this quarter."

We did use rates that were actually lower than where we saw a year-end 10-year Treasuries, but it's a little more complex than that because it's not just a 10-year Treasury. It's the shape of the yield curve and the reinvestment curve and actually, compared to a few years ago, we actually have a flatter curve and the 30-year treasury is actually lower than we saw even a couple of years ago when we saw low interest rates prior. So that has impacted the asset testing because these long-dated contracts, it's a very long reinvestment fund. So it does have an impact.

We are pleased to report solid results for the fourth quarter of 2014. Operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up 2% from the fourth quarter of 2013, and operating earnings per share were $1.38, a 1% increase over",1265,"Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report solid results for the fourth quarter of 2014. Operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up 2% from the fourth quarter of 2013, and operating earnings per share were $1.38, a 1% increase over the prior year period. 
Full year 2014 operating earnings were $6.6 billion, a 5% increase over 2013, and operating earnings per share were up 2% from the prior year period. Operating return on equity was 12% for the full year 2014. Intangible operating ROE was 15.2%. We believe tangible ROE is a better measure of the business returns for MetLife because it excludes purchase accounting adjustments, primarily goodwill.
Our strong 2014 operating earnings came on top of above-planned results for 2013, and we once again achieved an operating ROE at the low end of our 2016 target of 12% to 14%.
I'm even more pleased with MetLife's multiyear performance, which is a better measure of success in a long-term business. MetLife's operating earnings increased at a compound annual rate of 12.1% from 2011 to 2014. Over the same period, operating EPS grew at a compound annual rate of 9.6%.
Operating return on equity averaged 11.8% from 2012 through 2014, only slightly below the low end of the 2016 target range. Close to double-digit operating EPS growth and a 12% operating ROE during the past 3 years are noteworthy accomplishments, given that the 10-year Treasury yield has averaged 2.2% since the summer of 2011, and our capital management actions have been conservative due to regulatory uncertainty. 
With the 10-year Treasury yield now at 2%, the low-interest rate environment remains a challenge for life insurance business. Over the long term, we believe the 10-year Treasury yield should be 4% to 4.5% based on the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target and expectations for long-term economic growth. However, if interest rates remain low indefinitely, there would likely be a downward reset in return expectations across asset classes. Because equity returns are measured against the risk-free rate, the spread between MetLife's operating ROE and the 10-year Treasury yield is a key metric. 
From 2012 to 2014, the spread between MetLife's ROE and the 10-year Treasury yield has averaged 9.6%. This compares favorably to an average spread of 6.9% from 2000, the year of MetLife's initial public offering, to 2011. 
I would now like to comment on capital management. We repurchased $557 million of stock in the fourth quarter, completing the $1 billion share repurchase program we announced in June. For the year-to-date, we have taken advantage of share price weakness and repurchased $693 million of the $1 billion program we announced in December. 
Given where the stock is trading today, it is likely that we will complete this $1 billion program soon. While we continue to believe that MetLife is well capitalized, uncertainty surrounding potential capital rules makes us cautious about share repurchases in excess of $1 billion in 2015.
Turning to strategy. In 2014, we achieved 2 key elements of the strategy that we announced in May of 2012. We have de-risked the Retail business, which was a large part of our refocus the U.S. business cornerstone of our strategy, and we achieved net expense savings of $600 million pretax. 
Our Retail business has undergone a transformation during the past few years as we have worked to reduce risk, create a more efficient operation and improve the productivity of our distribution force. De-risking meant pulling back from the variable annuity market and exiting the lifetime secondary guarantee universal life market. Both of these initiatives had a material negative impact on sales. We believe that 2014 will prove to be an inflection point for annuity sales and anticipate profitable growth in 2015 and beyond. 
In variable annuities, I am pleased to announce that we will launch a new guaranteed lifetime minimum withdrawal benefit product, Flex Choice [ph], on February 17. The income benefit for this product meets the current expectations of the marketplace. As we communicated on our December outlook call, we anticipate more than a 50% increase in total annuity sales in 2015. However, a projected rebound in annuity sales does not mean we are changing our overall strategy, which is to emphasize growth in less capital-intensive, protection-oriented product lines. 
First, the projected sales increase is from a low base. Variable annuity sales were $6.3 billion in 2014, down dramatically from $28.4 billion in 2011.
Second, we estimate that Retail annuities will account for a smaller percentage of enterprise capital over time.
Another key strategy milestone in 2014 was achieving our net expense savings targets of $600 million pretax. Our gross expense savings were $910 million last year, close to the $1 billion strategy target. We are highly confident that we will realize the $1 billion gross savings target in 2015.
The difference between gross and net savings in 2014 was a combination of onetime costs and reinvestment in the business. Onetime costs will fade, but there will be a substantial increase in the reinvestment spend, which is largely technology related. Expenditures that represent an investment in the future, including much of the work we are doing to update our technology, may reduce current period earnings but are necessary to drive profitable growth over time. 
Turning to regulatory issues. As you know, MetLife has filed a legal challenge to its designation as a systemically important financial institution by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. As I said when we filed the challenge last month, MetLife had hoped to avoid litigation in light of the substantial and compelling evidence we presented to FSOC demonstrating the company is not systemically important. 
The Dodd–Frank Act is clear that size alone does not make a company systemic, and we believe FSOC erred in designating MetLife. We believe we have a strong legal case to present to the court and look forward to its eventual decision. As a former regulator, I want to emphasize that MetLife has always supported robust regulation in the life insurance industry. It has operated under a stringent state regulatory system for decades.
However, adding a new federal standard for just the largest life insurers while retaining a different standard for everyone else will harm competition. This will drive up the cost of financial protection for consumers without making the financial system safer. We believe the government should preserve a level playing field in the life insurance industry. If additional regulation is necessary, the government has a superior tool at its disposal, an approach that focuses on potentially systemic activities regardless of the size of the firm.
FSOC has already embraced this activities-based approach for the asset management industry. Litigation takes time to resolve. In the meantime, the Federal Reserve is now one of MetLife's regulators. We are cooperating fully with representatives from the New York Fed as they carry out their supervisory duties. At the same time, we continue to discuss with regulators and lawmakers in Washington the need for capital rules that reflect the business of insurance. 
With the enactment of the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act in December, the Federal Reserve now has the flexibility it needs to appropriately tailor capital rules for life insurers.
In closing, let me reiterate MetLife's commitment to creating long-term value for shareholders. We are focused on maintaining the appropriate risk profile, selling business at attractive rates of return relative to our cost of capital and, most important, improving free cash flow so MetLife can return additional capital to shareholders.
With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?"

Today, I'll cover our fourth quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital.
Operating earnings in the fourth quarter were $1.6 billion, up 2% from the prior year period, and operating earnings per share were $1.38, up 1%. This quarter included 4 notable items, which were disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our quarterly financial supplement or QFS.
First, consistent with the guidance from our December outlook call, we have strengthened our asbestos legal reserves in the quarter to reflect higher frequency and severity of claims. This resulted in an after-tax charge of $117 million or $0.10 per share. 
Second, we had favorable onetime tax adjustments in Latin America and EMEA, which increased operating earnings by $27 million or $0.02 per share.
Third, we had lower-than-budgeted catastrophe experience and favorable prior year development, which increased operating earnings by $16 million or $0.01 per share.
Finally, we had 3 actuarial-related items that increased operating earnings by a net $5 million or less than $0.01 per share. The first actuarial-related item, a $66 million reduction in operating earnings, was related to interest on unclaimed funds from life policies where we cannot locate the beneficiaries. These unclaimed funds are held by state governments and a multistate audit determined that MetLife owed interest on these policies. The impact was a $57 million in Retail Life & Other and $9 million in Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits. 
The second, a $48 million benefit to operating earnings, was a reserve adjustment to correct the treatment of the disability premium waiver rider in a number of term life contracts in Retail Life & Other. You may recall we had a positive adjustment for this item in the second quarter of 2014 as well.
The third, a $23 million benefit to operating earnings in Asia, was an unlocking of deferred acquisition cost or DAC. This unlocking resulted from a lower expense assumption for certain life products in Japan.
Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 5% year-over-year and 9% on a constant-currency basis. The key drivers on a constant-currency basis were underwriting improvement, business growth and lower taxes, which were partially offset by less favorable equity market performance.
Turning to our bottom line results. Fourth quarter net income was $1.5 billion or $1.30 per share. Net income was $93 million, below operating earnings in the quarter. 
Four items that explain most of this difference are: number one, charges of $140 million after tax associated with asymmetrical accounting treatment for insurance contracts and other market value adjustments; number two, derivative net losses of $40 million after tax, which reflects changes in foreign currencies, partially offset by gains from lower interest rates in the quarter; number three, a loss of $25 million after tax related to certain variable annuity guarantees where the hedged assets are more sensitive to market fluctuations than the GAAP treatment for guarantee liabilities; and these were partially offset by number four, investment portfolio net gains of $129 million after tax as credit-related losses continue to be modest in the portfolio. 
Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $49.53 as of December 30, up 5% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $40.36 at year end, up 9% year-over-year. 
In the fourth quarter, operating ROE was 11.3%, and tangible operating ROE was 14.1%. As Steve noted, we believe tangible operating ROE provides a better measure of the underlying business returns for MetLife.
Turning to fourth quarter margins. Underwriting results improved sequentially and year-over-year by approximately $0.06 after adjusting for notable items in both periods.
Year-over-year highlights include improvement in mortality and morbidity experienced in the U.S. as well as strong results in property and casualty. Retail life's interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 53.9% in the fourth quarter and 53.0% after adjusting for the net impact of the notable items discussed earlier. This result compared favorably to the prior year quarter of 54.2% and within our targeted range of 50% to 55%.
This marked the second consecutive quarter of normal claim activity for Retail life after 4 volatile quarters. The mortality ratio in Group Life was 88.4% and 87.4% after adjusting for the interest in unclaimed funds. The adjusted ratio was favorable to 87.9% in the prior year quarter as well -- and well within the targeted range of 85% to 90%.
The non-medical health interest-adjusted loss ratio was 77.4%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 80.9% and the low end of the targeted range of 77% to 82%. Disability underwriting improved while dental margins were favorable to the prior year as utilization returned to a normal level.
In our P&C business, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 85.8% in Retail and 92.3% in group. The combined ratios, excluding catastrophes, were 81.5% in Retail and 90.8% in group.
Overall, P&C underwriting results were favorable versus the prior year due to lower non-cat  losses and expenses as well as favorable prior year reserve development.
Moving to fourth quarter investment margins. The average of the 4 U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 215 basis points, down 26 basis points year-over-year and 21 sequentially. Product spreads, excluding variable investment income, were 186 basis points, down 13 basis points versus the prior year and 5 sequentially.
The sequential decline in spreads can be attributed to 3 primary factors. First, pretax variable investment income was $325 million, at the top end of our 2014 quarterly guidance range. After taxes and the impact of DAC, VII was $211 million, down $62 million sequentially due to weaker private equity and hedge fund returns.
Second, core yields declined as a result of the low-interest rate environment. Average new money yields are running roughly 100 to 150 basis points below the average roll-off yield on the portfolio. 
And third, there was a transfer of cash into Retail annuity upon the completion of the 4-way  merger in November, which accounts for the majority of the 20 basis points decline in deferred annuity spreads in the quarter. We would expect to reinvest this cash in longer-dated securities over time. 
With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 25.0% in the fourth quarter as compared to 25.3% in the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for asbestos and other legal reserves in both quarters, the operating expense ratio was 23.7% in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 23.6% in the prior year period.
Gross expense saves were $259 million in the fourth quarter and net saves were $163 million after adjusting for reinvestment of $33 million and onetime costs of $63 million.
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $683 million, up 4% versus the prior year quarter and up 7% after adjusting for notable items in both periods.
Growth in Retail was driven by Life & Other, which reported operating earnings of $321 million, up 13% versus the prior year quarter and 14% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were lower expenses and favorable underwriting.
Life & Other PFOs were $2.2 billion, up 2% year-over-year, primarily due to growth in the open block and P&C, partially offset by the runoff of the closed block. Annuities reported operating earnings of $362 million, down 3% versus the prior year quarter and essentially flat after adjusting for excess variable investment in the prior year. Annuities PFOs were $1.2 billion, up 7% year-over-year, primarily due to higher income annuity sales.
Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits or GVWB reported operating earnings of $235 million, up 2% versus the prior year quarter and 9% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Underwriting was the key driver with improved results in disability, dental, Group Life and P&C. GVWB PFOs were $4.2 billion, up 3% year-over-year, and sales increased 17% due to strong growth across all products.
Corporate Benefit Funding reported operating earnings of $374 million, up 5% versus the prior year quarter and 10% after adjusting for notable items. The key drivers were favorable underwriting and business growth. CBF PFOs were $1.5 billion, down 5% year-over-year due to lower income annuities and pension closeouts.
On closeouts, we remain active but disciplined and continue to see a good pipeline of small to midsized cases. Latin America reported operating earnings of $187 million, up 8% from the prior year quarter and 26% on a constant-currency basis.
Adjusting for the notable tax items this quarter, operating earnings were up 17% on a constant-currency basis driven by business growth across the region, partially offset by higher expenses. Overall, Latin American taxes were unusually low in the quarter even after adjusting for the notable tax item. Latin America PFOs were $1 billion, down 5% from the prior year quarter and up 6% on a constant-currency basis, driven by growth across the region.
Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $335 million, up 3% from the prior year quarter and 9% on a constant-currency basis. After adjusting for notable items in both quarters, operating earnings were up 7% on a constant-currency basis. Improvement in investment margins and business growth in the region were the primary drivers. Asia PFOs were $2.3 billion, down 3% from the prior year quarter but up 6% on a constant-currency basis, primarily due to growth in Japan, Korea and Australia. 
Asia sales were down 30% from the fourth quarter of 2013. The decline was expected as the prior year quarter had a large group employee benefit sale in Australia and elevated Yen life sales in Japan in advance of pricing changes. Adjusting for these items, Asia sales were up 1%.
In Japan, total A&H sales were up 21% year-over-year and 52% sequentially. We have seen good traction from our 2 new medical products launched in September, which we announced during the 2014 Asia Investor Day.
In EMEA, operating earnings were $85 million, down 4% but up 9% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. Adjusting for notable tax items in both periods, operating earnings were up 7% on a constant-currency basis due to business growth in the Middle East and a $7 million from the conversion of certain operations to calendar-year reporting. EMEA PFOs were $671 million, down 4% from the prior year period but up 3% on a constant-currency basis. 
Total sales increased 22% with 40% growth in emerging markets, including strong employee benefit sales in the Middle East and A&H across the region. 
Finally, the operating loss in Corporate & Other was $316 million as compared to an operating loss of $278 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusting for the increase in asbestos legal reserves this quarter, the operating loss was $199 million, which was within the $175 million to $225 million operating loss range that we guided to during the third quarter earnings call.
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $6.1 billion at December 31. In addition, our 2014 free cash flow ratio was 44%, better than our updated December estimate of approximately 40%. 
Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. While we have not yet completed our risk-based capital calculations for 2014, we estimate our combined RBC ratio will be in a range of 400% to 420%. Our Japan solvency margin ratio, which we file quarterly, was 1,003% as of the third quarter, and we estimate that our fourth quarter ratio will be comparable. 
For our U.S. insurance companies, preliminary fourth quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $2.4 billion, and statutory net income was approximately $1.7 billion. For the full year of 2014, statutory operating earnings were approximately $5.2 billion, and U.S. statutory net income was approximately $3.8 billion. 
U.S. statutory operating earnings on a comparable basis were down $1.2 billion versus the prior year, primarily due to less favorable equity markets and reserve strengthening. We said in our December outlook call that we thought statutory insurance reserve increases at our New York subsidiary would be $400 million to $600 million more than we had initially contemplated. Although we are still finalizing year-end statutory statements, we anticipate the increase in reserves will be in line with this revised expectation even though the assumptions for cash flow testing reflected the lower interest rate environment since the December outlook call. 
The year-end financials will also show capital contributed to our life insurance captives driven by low interest rates. This increase in capital will be funded by $670 million of cash from the holding company, with a $225 million contribution last year and a planned $445 million contribution in 2015. 
Despite these cash contributions from the holding company, free cash flow was better than our forecast in 2014, and we still believe a 45% to 55% ratio is a reasonable expectation for 2015. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $28 billion as of December 31, up 13% on a comparable basis to the prior year.
In conclusion, MetLife had a good fourth quarter to close out a strong year. Investment margins remain healthy despite pressure from low rates, expenses are well controlled, and underwriting improved for the second consecutive quarter. In addition, our cash and capital position remain strong, and we continue to successfully execute on our strategy as we seek to maximize shareholder value. 
And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions."

So that does impact it. It impacts it the following year though because our dividend capacity is based on your earnings in a year and that's how much you can take out the next year, just kind of a bit of a delayed item. So in any one year, interest rate moves will have an impact on the following year. That's why we give you a range around this. But over a 2- or 3-year period we believe these things average out once you have the derivative gain or loss. If rates stay the same then you don't have that repeating, but as we've seen rates have gone up and gone down in the past few years, so there'll always be some fluctuation with regard to this, and that's why we give you a range."

We did use rates that were actually lower than where we saw year-end 10-year Treasuries, but it's a little more complex than that because it's not just a 10-year Treasury. It's the shape of the yield curve and the reinvestment curve, and actually, compared to a few years ago, we actually have a flatter curve and the 30-year Treasury is actually lower than we saw even a couple of years ago when we saw low interest rates prior. So that has impacted the asset testing because these long-dated contracts, it's a very long reinvestment fund. So it does have an impact. So as we mentioned, the testing that we've now just completed for year end does reflect some more recent conditions, and it's within the range that we had talked about in December."

A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.

First, expenses and sales for our non-U.S. businesses, Latin America, Asia and EMEA; second, business segment returns on both allocated and tangible equity as discussed on our December outlook call; third, operating earnings and premiums fees and other revenues on a constant currency basis; and four, an earnings and table for corporate and other which was previously only available in our 10-K and 10-Q filings.

We are pleased to report good results for the first quarter of 2015. Operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up 4.8% from the first quarter of 2014, and operating earnings per share were $1.44, a 5.1% increase over",1323,"Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report good results for the first quarter of 2015. Operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up 4.8% from the first quarter of 2014, and operating earnings per share were $1.44, a 5.1% increase over the prior-year period. Growth in the quarter was dampened by broad-based weakness in foreign currencies. Premiums fees and other revenues, or PFOs, were essentially flat versus the prior year, but up 4% on a constant currency basis. In Latin America, reported PFOs were flat versus the prior year but up 13% on a constant currency basis. Indonesia reported PFOs were down 6% but up 6% on a constant currency basis.
Earnings were also negatively impacted by the strong dollar. Operating earnings grew 5% on a reported basis and 10% on a constant currency basis. We believe MetLife's global platform should deliver attractive growth and returns over time, but currency translation can be a source of volatility. The increase in operating earnings in the quarter was driven by business growth and a rebound in underwriting margins. As you may recall, underwriting margins were below normal in the prior-year period.
Investor margins remained healthy in the quarter with an average investment spread of 211 basis points for U.S. product lines. However, the spread was at the low-end of a 210 to 240 basis point range of the past few years. Margin pressure from low interest rates was only partially offset by variable investment income.
Expenses as a percentage of PFOs continued to trend downward. The operating expense ratio was 23.5% in the first quarter versus 24.1% in the prior-year period. Our goal is to grow overall revenues at a faster rate than expenses, and we have sharpened our focus on expense control to help offset the drag on earnings from the current economic environment. However, we will not forgo the investments necessary to become a more customer-centric company simply to boost GAAP earnings in the near term. Accordingly, we plan to reinvest $225 million this year to modernize the company's infrastructure and make it easier for customers to do business with us. We believe these improvements will generate additional savings and make customers more willing to recommend us to others.
Just as becoming customer-centric is the key element of our strategy, so too is growing sales of capital efficient, protection-oriented products. We made good progress on this initiative in the first quarter. For example, accident health sales outside the U.S. increased by 24%. Involuntary accident health and nonlife product sales in the U.S. grew by 57%.
I would now like to discuss return on equity. Operating ROE was 11.7% in the quarter and tangible ROE was 14.4%. However, low interest rates and the impact of regulatory uncertainty and capital management are challenges for ROE going forward. I want to remind you what we have said over the past 3 years about return on equity and provide you an updated outlook.
We introduced our new strategic plan in may 2012 with a 2016 operating ROE goal of 12% to 14%. Since that time, we have provided sensitivities for ROE related to interest rates and share repurchases. We have said that persistent low interest rates would bring down our 2016 operating ROE to low-end of our 12% to 14% range. Unfortunately, the 10-year Treasury yield has averaged 2.2% since May 2012 and our current plan assumes rates rising less than we initially assumed. We have also said that our strategic plan contemplated $8 billion of share repurchases from 2012 to 2016 and that no buybacks over this period would reduce ROE by 100 basis points. We have been cautious on share repurchases because capital requirements remain unknown for non-bank systemically important financial institutions. We have not yet seen draft capital rules and there is no clarity on when those rules will be issued. As a result, it is likely that share repurchases will be substantially lower than we had assumed in our strategic plan.
In the first quarter, we completed the $1 billion buyback program announced in December 2014. As an opportunistic buyer, we took advantage of price weakness to aggressively repurchase shares at an average price of $49.56 per share. Given the regulatory uncertainty, our overall approach to share repurchases remains conservative. Since May 2012, buybacks have totaled $2 billion or 1/4 of the total contemplated in our 2016 ROE target.
Below planned M&A activity has also had a negative impact on returns. The acquisitions we have made have contributed approximately $200 million to earnings or 1/2 of what was contemplated in our strategic plan. MetLife has consistently been a disciplined buyer, and we will not relax our acquisition standards simply to boost ROE in the short-term.
The 10-year Treasury yield has been hovering around 2%. The regulatory environment remains uncertain and it is unlikely that M&A will contribute as much to earnings as we had hoped. With only 8 months to go until 2016, we believe it is appropriate to reflect these realities in the ROE outlook. As the result, we estimate that MetLife's operating ROE will be approximately 11% next year.
An 11% operating ROE would mean a return that is approximately 9 percentage points above the current 10-year Treasury yield. A 9% point spread over the 10 year will be close to the pre-financial crisis levels, while the quality of MetLife's ROE has improved, largely due to lower leverage and de-risking in the U.S. Business.
Despite macro and regulatory challenges, we are optimistic about MetLife's prospects. This optimism is underscored by our board's willingness to increase the common stock dividend. As you know, on April 28, we announced a 7% increase in the quarterly common stock dividend per share. With this increase, our annual common stock dividend will be $1.50 per share and based on MetLife's current share price, the dividend yield will be 2.9%. We have now raised the common stock dividend for 3 consecutive years resulting in a cumulative increase of 103%. Going forward, it is our goal to increase the common stock dividend as our earnings grow.
Turning to regulatory issues. I would like to begin by restating one of the core principles that guides our thinking on these matters. Simply put, it is that regulators should preserve a level playing field for all of the companies in a life insurance industry. Regulators in the United States and Europe correctly point out the virtues of competition in an antitrust context. We believe that same commitment to robust competition should apply to insurance regulation and for the same reason, competition provides consumers with a best products at the best prices. We were pleased when the Federal Reserve recently made clear that it will develop a simple capital -- single capital standard for all of the insurance companies it supervises through a formal rulemaking process. If the fed had elected to establish prudential standards for insurers by order rather than by rule, the result could have been different orders for different companies with potentially harmful effects on competition. Developing capital standards through a rulemaking process will address one threat to competition by holding all federally-regulated insurance companies to the same standard.
However, there is still a risk that these additional capital rules for federally regulated insurers would put them at a competitive disadvantage to companies regulated exclusively at the state level. So it would be important for regulators to ensure consistency across multiple and potentially conflicting capital regimes.
In closing, MetLife had a good quarter, especially considering the pressure from low rates and a strong dollar. Looking forward, we believe MetLife will continue to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns on equity. Finally, I am pleased that we have been able to offer higher current income to shareholders by more than doubling our common stock dividend over the past 3 years.
With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?"

Today, I'll cover our first quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investments spreads, expenses and business highlights.

Today, I'll cover our first quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investments spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital.
Operating earnings in the first quarter were $1.6 billion and $1.44 per share, both up 5% from the prior-year period and 10% on a constant currency basis. This quarter included one notable item in our P&C business. We had higher than budgeted catastrophe experience, partially offset by a favorable prior year development which decreased operating earnings by $16 million or $0.01 per share. Adjusting for the notable items in both periods as disclosed in the appendix of our quarterly financial supplement, or QFS, operating earnings were up 6% year-over-year and 11% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were business growth and underwriting improvement partially offset by lower variable and recurring investment income.
Turning to our bottom line results. First quarter net income was $2.1 billion or $1.87 per share. Net income was $490 million above operating earnings in the quarter. Three items that explain most of this difference are: Number one, derivative net gains of $394 million after-tax, which reflects changes in foreign currencies and gains from lower interest rates; number two, investment portfolio net gains of $113 million after-tax as credit-related losses continue to be modest in the portfolio, and these were partially offset by; number 3, charges of $35 million after-tax associated with insurance contracts and other market value adjustments. Of the total $490 million difference between operating earnings and net income, we attribute $455 million to asymmetrical accounting and noneconomic adjustments.
Book value per share, excluding AOCI FCTA, was $50.45 at March 31, up 6% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $41.32 at March 31, up 9% year-over-year.
With respect to first quarter margins, underwriting results improved year-over-year by approximately $0.05 per share after adjusting for notable items in both periods. This was primarily due to improve mortality and morbidity experienced in group voluntary and worksite benefits, or GVWB, as well as better underwriting in Corporate Benefit Funding. These favorable results were partially offset by adverse claims experienced in Retail Life.
Retail Life's interest adjusted benefit ratio was 59.3%, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 56.9%. Results this quarter were negatively impacted by higher than normal accidental death, particularly early accidental falls, which we believe is related to this adverse winter weather.
The Group Life mortality ratio which now includes AD&D was 90.7% in the quarter. This is favorable to the prior year quarter of 91.9% driven primarily by lower term life claim severity. The Group Life mortality ratio is seasonally high in the first quarter. Therefore, we would expect the mortality ratio to be toward the top end of the 85% to 90% annual range.
The nonmedical health interest adjusted loss ratio which now excludes AD&D was 77.0%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 79.9% and at the low end of the targeted 77% to 82% range.
Dental had favorable margins compared to the prior year and plan due to lower utilization. We believe lower utilization was a function of adverse winter weather and anticipate some increase in utilization similar to what we saw last year. This ability was in line with the prior-year period and we expect improvement for the balance of the year.
In Property and Casualty, the combined ratio including catastrophes was 89.3% in Retail and 101.2% in group. The combined ratios, excluding catastrophes, was 79.4% in Retail and 89.7% in group. The more favorable Retail P&C combined ratio reflects less exposure to the Northeast, which experienced particularly severe winter weather. Overall, P&C underwriting results were favorable versus the prior year due to lower noncat losses partially offset by higher cats.
Turning to investment margins, please note annuity spreads in the QFS are now based on total annuities. The total annuity spread, which includes deferred annuities and single premium immediate annuities, better depicts investment margins for the business than our prior disclosure deferred annuities only. While investment margins have been resilient, we have seen some modest decline in spreads. The average of the 4 U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 211 basis points in the quarter, down 17 basis points year-over-year and 1 basis point sequentially. Product spreads, excluding variable investment income, were 181 basis points, down 6 basis points versus the prior year and 2 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to lower variable investment income and core yields.
Pretax variable investment income was $371 million, within our 2015 quarterly guidance range of $325 million to $425 million. After taxes and the impact of DAC, VII was $241 million, down $33 million versus the prior year due to weaker private equity returns, partial offset by higher prepaid.
Core yields declined as a result of the low-interest rate environment. Average new money yields are running roughly 100 to 150 basis points below the average yield on assets rolling off the portfolio. 
With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 23.5%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 24.1% and slightly favorable to 23.6% after adjusting for a legal settlement with New York in the first quarter of 2014. Gross expense saves were $244 million in the first quarter and net saves were $180 million after adjusting for reinvestment of $31 million and onetime cost of $33 million.
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Please note that our segment earnings in the current and prior-year period reflect the changes discussed on our December outlook call. 
Retail operating earnings were $653 million, up 3% versus the prior year quarter and up 8% after adjusting for notable items. Growth in Retail was driven by favorable separate account performance Annuities and partially offset by unfavorable underwriting in life.
Life & Other reported operating earnings of $203 million, down 20% versus the prior year quarter and 14% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were tighter core spreads, higher corporate expenses and lower closed block earnings. Underwriting, while below expectations, was only modestly unfavorable to the prior year quarter as adverse mortality in life was mostly offset by favorable P&C experience.
Life & Other PFOs were $2.0 billion, essentially flat year-over-year as growth in the open block was partially offset by the runoff of the closed block. 
Core Retail Life sales were up 23% year-over-year driven by increases in Whole Life and term. The performance this quarter supports our view that Life sales bottomed in 2014.
Annuities reported operating earnings of $450 million, up 18% versus the prior year quarter and 22% after adjusting for excess variable investment income in the prior year. This strong performance was primarily due to separate account returns, which were 2.7% in the quarter and lower expenses.
[indiscernible] annuity sales were flat year-over-year. As you know, we introduced our new VA guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider, Flex Choice, on February 17. As the application process is typical for 1 month VAs, Flex Choice had little impact on first quarter results.
GVWB reported operating earnings of $228 million, up 20% versus the prior year quarter and 27% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Growth in the quarter was driven by underwriting improvement in most products.
GVWB PFOs were $4.4 billion, up 3% year-over-year and sales increased 5% due to strong growth in voluntary products. Voluntary sales accounted for 16% of GVWB sales in the first quarter 2015, and we would expect this percentage to grow from this level.
Corporate Benefit Funding reported operating earnings of $369 million, up 9% versus the prior year quarter and 14% after adjusting for notable items. The key drivers are favorable underwriting and business growth. CBF PFOs were $543 million, up 27% year-over-year due to pension closeouts and structured settlements. On closeouts, we continue to see a good pipeline of small to midsized cases.
Latin America reported operating earnings of $131 million, down 17% from the prior year quarter and 3% on a constant currency basis. Business growth and underwriting improvement were offset by lower inflation, higher taxes and higher expenses in U.S. Direct. Latin America PFOs were $1 billion, essentially unchanged from the prior year quarter and up 13% on a constant currency basis driven by business growth across the region. Sales were up 11% on a constant currency basis driven by Brazil, Mexico and U.S. Direct.
Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $327 million, down 2% from the prior year quarter and up 8% on a constant currency basis driven by business growth. Additionally, effective April 1, 2015, the government of Japan enacted a tax reform plan that would lower the Japanese tax rate by approximately 2%. As a result, the company expects to record a onetime benefit of $170 million to $180 million, which includes an increase in Asia's second quarter operating earnings by approximately $60 million. In addition, we expect this tax law change will favorably affect our estimated annual effective tax rate for 2015 by approximately 0.2% as compared to 2014.
Asia PFOs were $2.2 billion, down 6% from the prior year quarter but up 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by business growth and solid persistency in core markets. Asia sales were 4% on a constant currency basis driven by a 32% increase in accident health sales in Japan.
In EMEA, operating earnings were $70 million, down 1% but up 35% year-over-year on a constant currency basis driven by business growth as well as favorable underwriting and lower expenses, both of which were better than expected for the quarter. Going forward, we believe underwriting margins and expenses would be closer to expectations.
The EMEA PFOs were $620 million, down 14% from the prior-year period but up 2% on a constant currency basis. PFO growth was dampened by certain product and accounting reclassifications in 2014, which had no bottom line impact to earnings but did impact the growth rate. Adjusting for that, underlying PFO was approximately -- growth was approximately 8% on a constant currency basis driven by strong employee benefit sales in the last 2 quarters. Total EMEA sales increased 14% on a constant currency basis due to strong growth in employee benefits and A&H sales.
As Steve noted, we had strong growth in A&H. In the quarter, A&H sales outside the U.S. were $1.2 billion, which was 23% of total combined sales in Latin America, Asia and EMEA.
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.7 billion at March 31. This amount reflects the completion of our buyback program, the issuance of senior debt to fund an upcoming debt maturity, cash contributions to our life insurance captives, which we discussed on our Fourth Quarter Earnings Call, and the payment of our quarterly common dividend.
Turning to our capital position, the combined risk-based capital ratio for principal U.S. insurance companies, excluding ALICO at year end 2014 was 410%. Also, our Japan solvency ratio was 1,036% as of December 31. For our U.S. companies, preliminary's first quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.2 billion and statutory net income was approximately $1.3 billion. Statutory operating earnings were up 53% from the restated prior year quarter primarily due to separate account returns and improved underwriting. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $30 billion as of March 31, up 7% from December 31.
In conclusion, MetLife had a good first quarter. Investment margins remain healthy despite pressure from low rates. Expenses are well controlled. And underwriting improved for the third consecutive quarter. In addition, our cash and capital position remain strong and we continue to successfully execute on our strategy as we seek to maximize shareholder value.
And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions."

We review a number of transactions that are of interest to us, but the pricing that's us attractive to us to move forward on do not ultimately end up being the pricing that the transactions went for, went for higher numbers.

Remember, big percentage of our assets now in the separate accounts are actually fixed income. So separate account performance was 2.4% and that obviously helped. The second thing is investment spread. You noticed that actually ticked up a little bit this quarter and there were some I would say some more unusual investment income, which we don't think is repeatable. But there's also part of the reason investment margins went up is when we collapsed our variable annuity captive, or Bermuda captive last year, there was a pool of cash which is now being redeployed in the longer-term investments. So yields are up. That's part of the reason, but the other part is investment earnings which are not sustainable. So I think the number -- the right run rate is a little lower than $450 million.

Obviously, certain Latin America economies, historically, have been prone to high levels of inflation. And it's a risk that we need to take into account when we develop an investment strategy in those countries. Because in a couple of countries, we do sell longer-term immediate Annuities, especially Chile. And so, in Chile, there is a portfolio of assets where the yield on the bonds is linked to the official inflation rate. And the inflation right now in Chile is quite low. And so that means that the yield on those bonds is near 0. And the overall impact, it was actually probably the biggest driver of under earning performance months in Latin America was this low inflation phenomenon. Trying to get the exact number here, it's roughly $8 million after-tax is what it cost us in terms of the inflation rate in Latin America. So this isn't just a Chile issue, but it's mainly in Chile."

And the other thing that's going on there, which you'll see in the segment sensitivity is compared to our plan, which assumes a more flattening of the yield curve which reduces SEC lending earnings, the scenario that given assumes a steeper yield curve, so the long end stays down, but so is the short end. And so that caused a net benefit compared to the plan. So you'll notice that in the sensitivities we give and CBF is actually a positive versus the plan. So there's really a combination of things.

We are pleased to report good results for the first quarter of 2015. Operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up 4.8% from the first quarter of 2014, and operating earnings per share were $1.44, a 5.1% increase over",1329,"Thank you, Ed. And good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report good results for the first quarter of 2015. Operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up 4.8% from the first quarter of 2014, and operating earnings per share were $1.44, a 5.1% increase over the prior year period. 
Growth in the quarter was dampened by broad-based weakness in foreign currencies. Premiums, fees and other revenues, or PFOs, were essentially flat versus the prior year, but up 4% on a constant currency basis. In Latin America, reported PFOs were flat versus the prior year, but up 13% on a constant currency basis. And in Asia, reported PFOs were down 6%, but up 6% on a constant currency basis.
Earnings were also negatively impacted by the strong dollar. Operating earnings grew 5% on a reported basis and 10% on a constant currency basis. We believe MetLife's global platform should deliver attractive growth and returns over time, but currency translation can be a source of volatility. The increase in operating earnings in the quarter was driven by business growth and a rebound in underwriting margins. As you may recall, underwriting margins were below normal in the prior year period.
Investor margins remain healthy in the quarter, with an average investment spread of 211 basis points for U.S. product lines. However, the spread was at the low end of a 210 to 240 basis point range of the past few years. Margin pressure from low interest rates was only partially offset by variable investment income.
Expenses as a percentage of PFOs continue to trend downward. The operating expense ratio was 23.5% in the first quarter versus 24.1% in the prior year period. Our goal is to grow overall revenues at a faster rate than expenses, and we have sharpened our focus on expense control to help offset the drag on earnings from the current economic environment. However, we will not forgo the investments necessary to become a more customer-centric company simply to boost GAAP earnings in the near-term. Accordingly, we plan to reinvest $225 million this year to modernize the company's infrastructure and make it easier for customers to do business with us. We believe these improvements will generate additional savings and make customers more willing to recommend us to others.
Just as becoming customer-centric is the key element of our strategy, so too is growing sales of capital-efficient, protection-oriented products. We made good progress on this initiative in the first quarter. For example, Accident & Health sales outside the U.S. increased by 24% and voluntary Accident & Health and nonlife product sales in the U.S. grew by 57%.
I would now like to discuss return on equity. Operating ROE was 11.7% in the quarter and tangible ROE was 14.4%. However, low interest rates and the impact of regulatory uncertainty and capital management are challenges for ROE going forward. 
I want to remind you what we have said over the past 3 years about return on equity and provide you an updated outlook.
We introduced our new strategic plan in May 2012, with a 2016 operating ROE goal of 12% to 14%. Since that time, we have provided sensitivities for ROE related to interest rates and share repurchases. We have said that persistent low interest rates would bring down our 2016 operating ROE to low end of our 12% to 14% range. Unfortunately, the 10-year Treasury yield has averaged 2.2% since May 2012 and our current plan assumes rates rising less than we initially assumed. 
We have also said that our strategic plan contemplated $8 billion of share repurchases from 2012 to 2016 and that no buybacks over this period would reduce ROE by 100 basis points. We have been cautious on share repurchases because capital requirements remain unknown for non-bank systemically important financial institutions. We have not yet seen draft capital rules, and there is no clarity on when those rules will be issued. 
As a result, it is likely that share repurchases will be substantially lower than we had assumed in our strategic plan.
In the first quarter, we completed the $1 billion buyback program announced in December 2014. As an opportunistic buyer, we took advantage of price weakness to aggressively repurchase shares at an average price of $49.56 per share. Given regulatory uncertainty, our overall approach to share repurchases remains conservative. Since May 2012, buybacks have totaled $2 billion or 1/4 of the total contemplated in our 2016 ROE target.
Below plan M&A activity has also had a negative impact on returns. The acquisitions we have made have contributed approximately $200 million to earnings or 1/2 of what was contemplated in our strategic plan. MetLife has consistently been a disciplined buyer. And we will not relax our acquisition standards simply to boost ROE in the short-term.
The 10-year Treasury yield has been hovering around 2%. The regulatory environment remains uncertain. And it is unlikely that M&A will contribute as much to earnings as we had hoped. With only 8 months to go until 2016, we believe it is appropriate to reflect these realities in the ROE outlook. 
As a result, we estimate that MetLife's operating ROE will be approximately 11% next year.
An 11% operating ROE would mean a return that is approximately 9 percentage points above the current 10-year Treasury yield. A 9% point spread over the 10-year would be close to the pre-financial crisis levels, while the quality of MetLife's ROE has improved, largely due to lower leverage and de-risking in the U.S. Business.
Despite macro and regulatory challenges, we are optimistic about MetLife's prospects. This optimism is underscored by our board's willingness to increase the common stock dividend. As you know, on April 28, we announced a 7% increase in the quarterly common stock dividend per share. With this increase, our annual common stock dividend will be $1.50 per share. And based on MetLife's current share price, the dividend yield will be 2.9%. We have now raised the common stock dividend for 3 consecutive years resulting in a cumulative increase of 103%. Going forward, it is our goal to increase the common stock dividend as our earnings grow.
Turning to regulatory issues. I would like to begin by restating one of the core principles that guides our thinking on these matters. Simply put, it is that regulators should preserve a level playing field for all of the companies in the life insurance industry. Regulators in the United States and Europe correctly point out the virtues of competition in an antitrust context. We believe that same commitment to robust competition should apply to insurance regulation and for the same reason, competition provides consumers with the best products at the best prices. 
We were pleased when the Federal Reserve recently made clear that it will develop a simple capital -- a single capital standard for all of the insurance companies it supervises through a formal rulemaking process. If the Fed had elected to establish prudential standards for insurers by order rather than by rule, the result could have been different orders for different companies, with potentially harmful effects on competition. Developing capital standards through a rulemaking process will address one threat to competition by holding all federally-regulated insurance companies to the same standard.
However, there is still a risk that these additional capital rules for federally-regulated insurers would put them at a competitive disadvantage to companies regulated exclusively at the state level. So it will be important for regulators to ensure consistency across multiple and potentially conflicting capital regimes.
In closing, MetLife had a good quarter, especially considering the pressure from low rates and a strong dollar. Looking forward, we believe MetLife will continue to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns on equity. 
Finally, I am pleased that we have been able to offer higher current income to shareholders by more than doubling our common stock dividend over the past 3 years.
With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?"

Today, I'll cover our first quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital.
Operating earnings in the first quarter were $1.6 billion and $1.44 per share, both up 5% from the prior year period and 10% on a constant currency basis. This quarter included one notable item in our P&C business. We have higher than budgeted catastrophe experience, partially offset by a favorable prior year development, which decreased operating earnings by $16 million or $0.01 per share. Adjusting for the notable items in both periods, as disclosed in the appendix of our Quarterly Financial Supplement or QFS, operating earnings were up 6% year-over-year and 11% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were business growth and underwriting improvement, partially offset by lower variable and recurring investment income.
Turning to our bottom line results. First quarter net income was $2.1 billion or $1.87 per share. Net income was $490 million above operating earnings in the quarter. Three items that explain most of this difference are: Number one, derivative net gains of $394 million after tax, which reflects changes in foreign currencies and gains from lower interest rates; number 2, investment portfolio net gains of $113 million after tax, as credit-related losses continue to be modest in the portfolio, and these were partially offset by; number 3, charges of $35 million after tax associated with insurance contracts and other market value adjustments. Of the total $490 million difference between operating earnings and net income, we attribute $455 million to asymmetrical accounting and noneconomic adjustments.
Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $50.45 at March 31, up 6% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $41.32 at March 31, up 9% year-over-year.
With respect to first quarter margins, underwriting results improved year-over-year by approximately $0.05 per share after adjusting for notable items in both periods. This was primarily due to improved mortality and morbidity experienced in Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits or GVWB, as well as better underwriting in Corporate Benefit Funding. These favorable results were partially offset by adverse claims experienced in Retail Life.
Retail Life's interest adjusted benefit ratio was 59.3%, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 56.9%. Results this quarter were negatively impacted by higher than normal accidental death, particularly accidental falls, which we believe is related to this adverse winter weather.
The Group Life mortality ratio, which now includes AD&D, was 90.7% in the quarter. This was favorable to the prior year quarter of 91.9%, driven primarily by lower Term Life claim severity. The Group Life mortality ratio is seasonally high in the first quarter. Therefore, we would expect the mortality ratio be -- to be toward the top end of the 85% to 90% annual range.
The Non-Medical Health interest adjusted loss ratio, which now excludes AD&D, was 77.0%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 79.9% and at the low end of the targeted 77% to 82% range.
Dental had favorable margins compared to the prior year and plan due to lower utilization. We believe the lower utilization was a function of adverse winter weather and anticipate some increase in utilization similar to what we saw last year. 
Disability was in line with the prior year period. And we expect improvement for the balance of the year.
In Property & Casualty, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 89.3% in Retail and 101.2% in Group. The combined ratios, excluding catastrophes, was 79.4% in Retail and 89.7% in Group. The more favorable Retail P&C combined ratio reflects less exposure to the Northeast, which experienced particularly severe winter weather. Overall, P&C underwriting results were favorable versus the prior year due to lower non-cat losses, partially offset by higher cats.
Turning to investment margins. Please note annuity spreads in the QFS are now based on total annuities. The total annuity spread, which includes deferred annuities and single premium immediate annuities, better depicts investment margins for the business than our prior disclosure deferred annuities only. 
While investment margins have been resilient, we have seen some modest decline in spreads. The average of the 4 U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 211 basis points in the quarter, down 17 basis points year-over-year and 1 basis point sequentially. Product spreads, excluding variable investment income, were 181 basis points, down 6 basis points versus the prior year and 2 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to lower variable investment income and core yields.
Pretax variable investment income was $371 million, within our 2015 quarterly guidance range of $325 million to $425 million. After taxes and the impact of DAC, VII was $241 million, down $33 million versus the prior year due to weaker private equity returns, partially offset by higher prepays.
Core yields declined as a result of the low interest rate environment. Average new money yields are running roughly 100 to 150 basis points below the average yield on assets rolling off the portfolio. 
With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 23.5%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 24.1% and slightly favorable to 23.6% after adjusting for a legal settlement with New York in the first quarter of 2014. Gross expense saves were $244 million in the first quarter and net saves were $180 million after adjusting for reinvestment of $31 million and onetime cost of $33 million.
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Please note that our segment earnings in the current and prior year period reflect the changes discussed on our December outlook call. 
Retail operating earnings were 3 -- $653 million, up 3% versus the prior year quarter and up 8% after adjusting for notable items. Growth in Retail was driven by favorable separate account performance in Annuities and partially offset by unfavorable underwriting in Life.
Life & Other reported operating earnings of $203 million, down 20% versus the prior year quarter and 14% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were tighter core spreads, higher corporate expenses and lower closed block earnings. Underwriting, while below expectations, was only modestly unfavorable to the prior year quarter as adverse mortality in Life was mostly offset by favorable P&C experience.
Life & Other PFOs were $2.0 billion, essentially flat year-over-year as growth in the open block was partially offset by the runoff of the closed block.
Core Retail Life sales were up 23% year-over-year driven by increases in Whole Life and Term. The performance this quarter supports our view that Life sales bottomed in 2014.
Annuities reported operating earnings of $450 million, up 18% versus the prior year quarter and 22% after adjusting for excess variable investment income in the prior year. This strong performance was primarily due to separate account returns, which were 2.7% in the quarter and lower expenses.
Variable annuity sales were flat year-over-year. As you know, we introduced our new VA guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider, FlexChoice, on February 17. As the application process is typical for one month VAs, FlexChoice had little impact on first quarter results.
GVWB reported operating earnings of $228 million, up 20% versus the prior year quarter and 27% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Growth in the quarter was driven by underwriting improvement in most products.
GVWB PFOs were $4.4 billion, up 3% year-over-year, and sales increased 5% due to strong growth in voluntary products. Voluntary sales accounted for 16% of GVWB sales in the first quarter of 2015, and we would expect this percentage to grow from this level.
Corporate Benefit Funding reported operating earnings of $369 million, up 9% versus the prior year quarter and 14% after adjusting for notable items. The key drivers are favorable underwriting and business growth. 
CBF PFOs were $543 million, up 27% year-over-year due to pension closeouts and structured settlements. On closeouts, we continue to see a good pipeline of small to midsized cases.
Latin America reported operating earnings of $131 million, down 17% from the prior year quarter and 3% on a constant currency basis. Business growth and underwriting improvement were offset by lower inflation, higher taxes and higher expenses in U.S. Direct. 
Latin America PFOs were $1 billion, essentially unchanged from the prior year quarter and up 13% on a constant currency basis, driven by business growth across the region. Sales were up 11% on a constant currency basis driven by Brazil, Mexico and U.S. Direct.
Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $327 million, down 2% from the prior year quarter and up 8% on a constant currency basis, driven by business growth. 
Additionally, effective April 1, 2015, the government of Japan enacted a tax reform plan that would lower the Japanese tax rate by approximately 2%. As a result, the company expects to record a onetime benefit of $170 million to $180 million, which includes an increase in Asia's second quarter operating earnings by approximately $60 million. In addition, we expect this tax law change will favorably affect our estimated annual effective tax rate for 2015 by approximately 0.2% as compared to 2014.
Asia PFOs were $2.2 billion, down 6% from the prior year quarter, but up 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by business growth and solid persistency in core markets. 
Asia sales were 4% on a constant currency basis driven by a 32% increase in Accident & Health sales in Japan.
In EMEA, operating earnings were $70 million, down 1%, but up 35% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by business growth, as well as favorable underwriting and lower expenses, both of which were better than expected for the quarter. Going forward, we believe underwriting margins and expenses would be closer to expectations.
EMEA PFOs were $620 million, down 14% from the prior-year period, but up 2% on a constant currency basis. PFO growth was dampened by certain product and accounting reclassifications in 2014, which had no bottom line impact to earnings, but did impact the growth rate. Adjusting for that, underlying PFO was approximately -- growth was approximately 8% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong employee benefit sales in the last 2 quarters. 
Total EMEA sales increased 14% on a constant currency basis due to strong growth in employee benefits and A&H sales.
As Steve noted, we had strong growth in A&H. In the quarter, A&H sales outside the U.S. were $1.2 billion, which was 23% of total combined sales in Latin America, Asia and EMEA.
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.7 billion at March 31. This amount reflects the completion of our buyback program, the issuance of senior debt to fund an upcoming debt maturity, cash contributions to our life insurance captives, which we discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call, and the payment of our quarterly common dividend.
Turning to our capital position, the combined risk-based capital ratio for our principal U.S. insurance companies, excluding ALICO, at year-end 2014 was 410%. Also, our Japan solvency ratio was 1,036% as of December 31. 
For our U.S. companies, preliminary first quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.2 billion and statutory net income was approximately $1.3 billion. Statutory operating earnings were up 53% from the restated prior year quarter primarily due to separate account returns and improved underwriting. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $30 billion as of March 31, up 7% from December 31.
In conclusion, MetLife had a good first quarter. Investment margins remain healthy despite pressure from low rates, expenses are well controlled and underwriting improved for the third consecutive quarter. In addition, our cash and capital position remained strong, and we continue to successfully execute on our strategy as we seek to maximize shareholder value.
And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions."

But the main reason why we did not, to-date, acquire businesses with earnings of the $400 million we're assuming in our original plan of 2012 really relates to being a disciplined buyer, looking at the marketplace. We review a number of transactions that were of interest to us, but the pricing that's attractive to us to move forward on do not ultimately end up being the pricing that the transactions went for. It went for higher numbers. So that's the main driver there.

And it's about a $1 billion difference between those 2 printed numbers. 
However, if you would look at -- as we've analyzed the impact of New York and other requirements that they request we follow, the total number is actually $3 billion difference in statutory reserves. This would include about $700 million in reserves because of the fact we do not use life captives. So that's within that $3 billion. 
The other point I would raise -- tell you in this is that the $3 billion difference in statutory reserves has very little tax impact. It's not very tax effective reserves."

Remember, a big percentage of our assets now in the separate accounts are actually fixed income. So separate account performance was 2.4%, and that obviously helped. 
The second thing is investment spread, you noticed that actually ticked up a little bit this quarter, and there was some, I would say, some more unusual investment income, which we don't think is repeatable. Some -- but there's also -- part of the reason the investment margins went up is the -- when we collapsed our variable annuity captive, or Bermuda captive, last year, there was a pool of cash which is now being redeployed in the longer-term investments. So yields are up. So that's part of the reason. But the other part is some investment earnings which are not sustainable.

We are pleased to report good results for the first quarter of 2015.

We are pleased to report good results for the first quarter of 2015. Operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up 4.8% from the first quarter of 2014, and operating earnings per share were $1.44, a 5.1% increase over the prior year period. 
Growth in the quarter was dampened by broad-based weakness in foreign currencies. Premiums, fees and other revenues, or PFOs, were essentially flat versus the prior year, but up 4% on a constant currency basis. In Latin America, reported PFOs were flat versus the prior year, but up 13% on a constant currency basis. And in Asia, reported PFOs were down 6%, but up 6% on a constant currency basis.
Earnings were also negatively impacted by the strong dollar. Operating earnings grew 5% on a reported basis and 10% on a constant currency basis. We believe MetLife's global platform should deliver attractive growth and returns over time, but currency translation can be a source of volatility. The increase in operating earnings in the quarter was driven by business growth and a rebound in underwriting margins. As you may recall, underwriting margins were below normal in the prior year period.
Investment margins remain healthy in the quarter, with an average investment spread of 211 basis points for U.S. product lines. However, the spread was at the low end of the 210 to 240 basis point range of the past few years. Margin pressure from low interest rates was only partially offset by variable investment income.
Expenses as a percentage of PFOs continue to trend downward. The operating expense ratio was 23.5% in the first quarter versus 24.1% in the prior year period. Our goal is to grow overall revenues at a faster rate than expenses, and we have sharpened our focus on expense control to help offset the drag on earnings from the current economic environment. However, we will not forgo the investments necessary to become a more customer-centric company simply to boost GAAP earnings in the near-term. Accordingly, we plan to reinvest $225 million this year to modernize the company's infrastructure and make it easier for customers to do business with us. We believe these improvements will generate additional savings and make customers more willing to recommend us to others.
Just as becoming customer-centric is the key element of our strategy, so too is growing sales of capital-efficient, protection-oriented products. We made good progress on this initiative in the first quarter. For example, Accident & Health sales outside the U.S. increased by 24% and voluntary Accident & Health and nonlife product sales in the U.S. grew by 57%.
I would now like to discuss return on equity. Operating ROE was 11.7% in the quarter and tangible ROE was 14.4%. However, low interest rates and the impact of regulatory uncertainty and capital management are challenges for ROE going forward. 
I want to remind you what we have said over the past 3 years about return on equity and provide you an updated outlook.
We introduced our new strategic plan in May 2012, with a 2016 operating ROE goal of 12% to 14%. Since that time, we have provided sensitivities for ROE related to interest rates and share repurchases. We have said that persistent low interest rates would bring down our 2016 operating ROE to the low end of our 12% to 14% range. Unfortunately, the 10-year Treasury yield has averaged 2.2% since May 2012 and our current plan assumes rates rising less than we initially assumed. 
We have also said that our strategic plan contemplated $8 billion of share repurchases from 2012 to 2016 and that no buybacks over this period would reduce ROE by 100 basis points. We have been cautious on share repurchases because capital requirements remain unknown for non-bank systemically important financial institutions. We have not yet seen draft capital rules, and there is no clarity on when those rules will be issued. 
As a result, it is likely that share repurchases will be substantially lower than we had assumed in our strategic plan.
In the first quarter, we completed the $1 billion buyback program announced in December 2014. As an opportunistic buyer, we took advantage of price weakness to aggressively repurchase shares at an average price of $49.56 per share. Given regulatory uncertainty, our overall approach to share repurchases remains conservative. Since May 2012, buybacks have totaled $2 billion or 1/4 of the total contemplated in our 2016 ROE target.
Below plan M&A activity has also had a negative impact on returns. The acquisitions we have made have contributed approximately $200 million to earnings or 1/2 of what was contemplated in our strategic plan. MetLife has consistently been a disciplined buyer. And we will not relax our acquisition standards simply to boost ROE in the short-term.
The 10-year Treasury yield has been hovering around 2%. The regulatory environment remains uncertain. And it is unlikely that M&A will contribute as much to earnings as we had hoped. With only 8 months to go until 2016, we believe it is appropriate to reflect these realities in the ROE outlook. 
As a result, we estimate that MetLife's operating ROE will be approximately 11% next year.
An 11% operating ROE would mean a return that is approximately 9 percentage points above the current 10-year Treasury yield. A 9 percentage point spread over the 10-year would be close to the pre-financial crisis levels, while the quality of MetLife's ROE has improved, largely due to lower leverage and de-risking in the U.S. business.
Despite macro and regulatory challenges, we are optimistic about MetLife's prospects. This optimism is underscored by our board's willingness to increase the common stock dividend. As you know, on April 28, we announced a 7% increase in the quarterly common stock dividend per share. With this increase, our annual common stock dividend will be $1.50 per share. And based on MetLife's current share price, the dividend yield will be 2.9%. We have now raised the common stock dividend for 3 consecutive years, resulting in a cumulative increase of 103%. Going forward, it is our goal to increase the common stock dividend as our earnings grow.
Turning to regulatory issues. I would like to begin by restating one of the core principles that guides our thinking on these matters. Simply put, it is that regulators should preserve a level playing field for all of the companies in the life insurance industry. Regulators in the United States and Europe correctly point out the virtues of competition in an antitrust context. We believe that same commitment to robust competition should apply to insurance regulation and for the same reason, competition provides consumers with the best products at the best prices. 
We were pleased when the Federal Reserve recently made clear that it will develop a simple capital -- a single capital standard for all of the insurance companies it supervises through a formal rule-making process. If the Fed had elected to establish prudential standards for insurers by order rather than by rule, the result could have been different orders for different companies, with potentially harmful effects on competition. Developing capital standards through a rule-making process will address one threat to competition by holding all federally regulated insurance companies to the same standard.
However, there is still a risk that these additional capital rules for federally regulated insurers will put them at a competitive disadvantage to companies regulated exclusively at the state level. So it will be important for regulators to ensure consistency across multiple and potentially conflicting capital regimes.
In closing, MetLife had a good quarter, especially considering the pressure from low rates and a strong dollar. Looking forward, we believe MetLife will continue to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns on equity. 
Finally, I am pleased that we have been able to offer higher current income to shareholders by more than doubling our common stock dividend over the past 3 years.
With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?"

Today, I'll cover our first quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital.
Operating earnings in the first quarter were $1.6 billion and $1.44 per share, both up 5% from the prior year period and 10% on a constant currency basis. This quarter included one notable item in our P&C business. We have higher than budgeted catastrophe experience, partially offset by a favorable prior year development, which decreased operating earnings by $16 million or $0.01 per share. Adjusting for the notable items in both periods, as disclosed in the appendix of our Quarterly Financial Supplement or QFS, operating earnings were up 6% year-over-year and 11% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were business growth and underwriting improvement, partially offset by lower variable and recurring investment income.
Turning to our bottom line results. First quarter net income was $2.1 billion or $1.87 per share. Net income was $490 million above operating earnings in the quarter. Three items that explain most of this difference are: Number one, derivative net gains of $394 million after tax, which reflects changes in foreign currencies and gains from lower interest rates; number 2, investment portfolio net gains of $113 million after tax, as credit-related losses continued to be modest in the portfolio, and these were partially offset by; number 3, charges of $35 million after tax associated with insurance contracts and other market value adjustments. Of the total $490 million difference between operating earnings and net income, we attribute $455 million to asymmetrical accounting and noneconomic adjustments.
Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $50.45 at March 31, up 6% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $41.32 at March 31, up 9% year-over-year.
With respect to first quarter margins, underwriting results improved year-over-year by approximately $0.05 per share after adjusting for notable items in both periods. This was primarily due to improved mortality and morbidity experienced in Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits or GVWB, as well as better underwriting in Corporate Benefit Funding. These favorable results were partially offset by adverse claims experienced in Retail Life.
Retail Life's interest adjusted benefit ratio was 59.3%, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 56.9%. Results this quarter were negatively impacted by higher than normal accidental death, particularly accidental falls, which we believe is related to this adverse winter weather.
The Group Life mortality ratio, which now includes AD&D, was 90.7% in the quarter. This was favorable to the prior year quarter of 91.9%, driven primarily by lower Term Life claim severity. The Group Life mortality ratio is seasonally high in the first quarter. Therefore, we would expect the mortality ratio be -- to be toward the top end of the 85% to 90% annual range.
The Non-Medical Health interest adjusted loss ratio, which now excludes AD&D, was 77.0%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 79.9% and at the low end of the targeted 77% to 82% range.
Dental had favorable margins compared to the prior year and plan due to lower utilization. We believe the lower utilization was a function of adverse winter weather and anticipate some increase in utilization similar to what we saw last year. 
Disability was in line with the prior year period. And we expect improvement for the balance of the year.
In Property & Casualty, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 89.3% in Retail and 101.2% in Group. The combined ratios, excluding catastrophes, were 79.4% in Retail and 89.7% in Group. The more favorable Retail P&C combined ratio reflects less exposure to the Northeast, which experienced particularly severe winter weather. Overall, P&C underwriting results were favorable versus the prior year due to lower non-cat losses, partially offset by higher cats.
Turning to investment margins. Please note annuity spreads in the QFS are now based on total annuities. The total annuity spread, which includes deferred annuities and single premium immediate annuities, better depicts investment margins for the business than our prior disclosure of deferred annuities only. 
While investment margins have been resilient, we have seen some modest decline in spreads. The average of the 4 U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 211 basis points in the quarter, down 17 basis points year-over-year and 1 basis point sequentially. Product spreads, excluding variable investment income, were 181 basis points, down 6 basis points versus the prior year and 2 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to lower variable investment income and core yields.
Pretax variable investment income was $371 million, within our 2015 quarterly guidance range of $325 million to $425 million. After taxes and the impact of DAC, VII was $241 million, down $33 million versus the prior year due to weaker private equity returns, partially offset by higher prepays.
Core yields declined as a result of the low interest rate environment. Average new money yields are running roughly 100 to 150 basis points below the average yield on assets rolling off the portfolio. 
With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 23.5%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 24.1% and slightly favorable to 23.6% after adjusting for a legal settlement with New York in the first quarter of 2014. Gross expense saves were $244 million in the first quarter and net saves were $180 million after adjusting for a reinvestment of $31 million and onetime costs of $33 million.
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Please note that our segment earnings in the current and prior year period reflect the changes discussed on our December outlook call. 
Retail operating earnings were 3 -- $653 million, up 3% versus the prior year quarter and up 8% after adjusting for notable items. Growth in Retail was driven by favorable separate account performance in Annuities and partially offset by unfavorable underwriting in Life.
Life & Other reported operating earnings of $203 million, down 20% versus the prior year quarter and 14% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were tighter core spreads, higher corporate expenses and lower closed block earnings. Underwriting, while below expectations, was only modestly unfavorable to the prior year quarter as adverse mortality in Life was mostly offset by favorable P&C experience.
Life & Other PFOs were $2.0 billion, essentially flat year-over-year as growth in the open block was partially offset by the runoff of the closed block.
Core Retail Life sales were up 23% year-over-year driven by increases in Whole Life and Term. The performance this quarter supports our view that Life sales bottomed in 2014.
Annuities reported operating earnings of $450 million, up 18% versus the prior year quarter and 22% after adjusting for excess variable investment income in the prior year. This strong performance was primarily due to separate account returns, which were 2.7% in the quarter and lower expenses.
Variable annuity sales were flat year-over-year. As you know, we introduced our new VA guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider, FlexChoice, on February 17. As the application process is typical for one-month VAs, FlexChoice had little impact on first quarter results.
GVWB reported operating earnings of $228 million, up 20% versus the prior year quarter and 27% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Growth in the quarter was driven by underwriting improvement in most products.
GVWB PFOs were $4.4 billion, up 3% year-over-year, and sales increased 5% due to strong growth in voluntary products. Voluntary sales accounted for 16% of GVWB sales in the first quarter of 2015, and we would expect this percentage to grow from this level.
Corporate Benefit Funding reported operating earnings of $369 million, up 9% versus the prior year quarter and 14% after adjusting for notable items. The key drivers were favorable underwriting and business growth. 
CBF PFOs were $543 million, up 27% year-over-year due to pension closeouts and structured settlements. On closeouts, we continue to see a good pipeline of small to midsized cases.
Latin America reported operating earnings of $131 million, down 17% from the prior year quarter and 3% on a constant currency basis. Business growth and underwriting improvement were offset by lower inflation, higher taxes and higher expenses in U.S. Direct. 
Latin America PFOs were $1 billion, essentially unchanged from the prior year quarter and up 13% on a constant currency basis, driven by business growth across the region. Sales were up 11% on a constant currency basis driven by Brazil, Mexico and U.S. Direct.
Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $327 million, down 2% from the prior year quarter and up 8% on a constant currency basis, driven by business growth. 
Additionally, effective April 1, 2015, the government of Japan enacted a tax reform plan that would lower the Japanese tax rate by approximately 2%. As a result, the company expects to record a onetime benefit of $170 million to $180 million, which includes an increase in Asia's second quarter operating earnings by approximately $60 million. In addition, we expect this tax law change will favorably affect our estimated annual effective tax rate for 2015 by approximately 0.2% as compared to 2014.
Asia PFOs were $2.2 billion, down 6% from the prior year quarter, but up 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by business growth and solid persistency in core markets. 
Asia sales were 4% on a constant currency basis driven by a 32% increase in Accident & Health sales in Japan.
In EMEA, operating earnings were $70 million, down 1% but up 35% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by business growth as well as favorable underwriting and lower expenses, both of which were better than expected for the quarter. Going forward, we believe underwriting margins and expenses will be closer to expectations.
EMEA PFOs were $620 million, down 14% from the prior year period, but up 2% on a constant currency basis. PFO growth was dampened by certain product and accounting reclassifications in 2014, which had no bottom line impact to earnings, but did impact the growth rate. Adjusting for that, underlying PFO was approximately -- growth was approximately 8% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong employee benefit sales in the last 2 quarters. 
Total EMEA sales increased 14% on a constant currency basis due to strong growth in employee benefits and A&H sales.
As Steve noted, we had strong growth in A&H. In the quarter, A&H sales outside the U.S. were $1.2 billion, which was 23% of total combined sales in Latin America, Asia and EMEA.
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.7 billion at March 31. This amount reflects the completion of our buyback program, the issuance of senior debt to fund an upcoming debt maturity, cash contributions to our life insurance captives, which we discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call, and the payment of our quarterly common dividend.
Turning to our capital position, the combined risk-based capital ratio for our principal U.S. insurance companies, excluding ALICO, at year end 2014 was 410%. Also, our Japan solvency ratio was 1,036% as of December 31. 
For our U.S. companies, preliminary first quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.2 billion and statutory net income was approximately $1.3 billion. Statutory operating earnings were up 53% from the restated prior year quarter primarily due to separate account returns and improved underwriting. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $30 billion as of March 31, up 7% from December 31.
In conclusion, MetLife had a good first quarter. Investment margins remain healthy despite pressure from low rates, expenses are well controlled and underwriting improved for the third consecutive quarter. In addition, our cash and capital position remains strong, and we continue to successfully execute on our strategy as we seek to maximize shareholder value.
And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions."

But the main reason why we did not, to-date, acquire businesses with earnings of the $400 million we're assuming in our original plan of 2012 really relates to being a disciplined buyer, looking out in the marketplace. We've reviewed a number of transactions that were of interest to us, but the pricing that was attractive to us to move forward on did not ultimately end up being the pricing that the transactions went for.

Remember, a big percentage of our assets now in the separate accounts are actually fixed income. So separate account performance was 2.4%, and that obviously helped. 
The second thing is investment spread, you noticed it actually ticked up a little bit this quarter, and there was some, I would say, some more unusual investment income, which we don't think is repeatable. Some of -- but there's also -- part of the reason the investment margins went up is the -- when we collapsed our variable annuity captive, or Bermuda captive, last year, there was a pool of cash which is now being redeployed in the longer-term investments. So yields are up. So that's part of the reason. But the other part is some investment earnings which are not sustainable.

Because in a couple of countries, we do sell longer-term immediate annuities, especially Chile. And so in Chile, there is a portfolio of assets where the yield on the bonds is linked to the official inflation rate. And the inflation right now in Chile is quite low. And so that means that the yield on those bonds is near 0. And the overall impact -- it was actually probably the biggest driver of underearning performance in Latin America was this low inflation phenomenon.

And so that causes a net benefit compared to the plan. So you'll notice that in the sensitivities we give, and CBF is actually a positive in -- versus the plan.

We are pleased to report strong results for the second quarter of 2015. Operating earnings were $1.8 billion, up 11% from the second quarter of 2014, and operating earnings per share were $1.56, a 12% increase over the prior-year period. Operating return in equity was 12.5% in the quarter and intangible return in equity was 15.3%. Second quarter results were negatively impacted by the strong dollar. Operating earnings grew 11% on a reported basis and 16% on a constant currency basis. Favorable tax items, improvement in both investment and underwriting margins and growth in the business more than offset the negative impact from foreign currency translation. Investment margins remain healthy in the quarter with an than average investment spread for U.S. product lines of 227 basis points versus 215 basis points in the prior-year period. This spread has been in the range of 210 to 240 basis points during the past few years, which highlights the resilience of our investment margins despite of a multi-year period of a low interest rate. 
Underwriting margins were also favorable in the quarter. After adjusting for notable items, this is the fourth consecutive quarter the underwriting margins have improved versus the prior-year period. In the second quarter, underwriting were better in retail life, Group life, Group nonmedical health and property casualty. 
Turning to regulatory matters. I will begin with a brief update on our appeal of our government's designation of MetLife as a systemically important institution or SIFI. Tomorrow this will financial stability oversight council will file a brief opposing MetLife's motion for summary judgment and supporting its own position. On August 21, MetLife will file a final reply brief. At this time, the judge has not informed us whether she will be holding an oral hearing, and the timing of the final decision is difficult to predict. With regard to capital rules, the passage of the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act late last year provided flexibility for the Federal Reserve to develop rules appropriate for the business of insurance. The Federal Reserve is working on the required standards, and I am hopeful that those deliberations will lead to a suitable proposal. Developing an appropriate insurance capital standard in the United States is also important to informing the development of global capital standards. While the timing for producing a domestic capital standard remains uncertain, we believe global standards should not be finalized before domestic standard is developed. Upon completion, both standards should be tailored with the insurance business model. We are supportive of legislations that has been reduced to encourage greater transparency and increased congressional oversight of U.S. participation in the international standard setting process. Another policy issue MetLife is following closely is the proposed fiduciary rule in the Department of Labor. While our proponents argue the rule will help individuals save for retirement, we believe it will have the opposite effect by reducing choice, increasing cost and limited access to financial indication in investment advice. Wealthy investors may not be significantly impacted by the rule because their assets generate sufficient fees to pay for investment advice. However, assets of middle income investors are unlikely to generate fees sufficient to offset the higher costs of offering under this rule. Consequently, those consumers can find it difficult, if not impossible, to receive face-to-face investment advice. The proposed rule is particularly problematic for individual annuities, which are the only products that provide consumers with a variety of benefits including guaranteed retirement income they can never outlive. The proposed rule is that makes a conflict of interest to sell your own products. Without substantial modifications, the proposal could force companies, such as MetLife, to choose between manufacturing individual annuities and distributing them. It is unclear what public policy goal is served by making it more difficult for companies to provide guaranteed retirement income to consumers. MetLife submitted comments on the proposed rule to the Labor Department last week, and the department will be holding public hearings from August 10 through August 12. We are confident that policymakers can find a way to protect the interest of consumers while still preserving access to much-needed retirement advice. 
I would now like to comment on cash. As I said in MetLife's most recent annual report, we need to do a better job of generating free cash flow, which is the most important metric in determining the company's ability to return capital to shareholders. I am pleased the ratio our free cash flow to operating earnings has been an upward trend since 2012, and we remain confident in our target of 45% 55% from 2015 to 2017. Increasing the amount of cash generated by the business is an enterprisewide imperative at MetLife. Our focus on cash is an extension of a strategy that we announced in May 2012, which centered on improving on return on equity while also reducing our cost of equity capital. We have successfully repositioned our business to achieve higher returns with lower risks and are now working diligently to make sure the products we sell strike the right balance between returns and cash generation. 
I have 3 observations I would like to share with you related to this initiative. First, we are conducting a granular analysis of the cash and capital characteristics of our business. In each segment that we have examined, we have identified opportunities for improvement. Second, our goal is not maximum free cash flow today as that would mean forgoing attractive investment opportunities in the business. Our goal is to grow free cash flow over time. Third, while we are working toward a business model that will produce compelling growth and free cash flow, we also had the potential to optimize our balance sheet if MetLife's SIFI designation is overturned or the new capital requirements are reasonable. 
Finally, I want to recognize the contributions of Bill Wheeler to the success of MetLife. As most of you know, this is the last earnings call for Bill, MetLife's President of the Americas region. As we announced in April, Bill is retiring next month after 17 years with the company. I want to take this opportunity to thank Bill personally for all that he's done to help MetLife and me over the years. Bill has contributed in numerous ways to MetLife's success. As treasurer, he played a critical role in taking MetLife public in 2000. As CFO he helped guide the company's safety through the financial crises. And as President of Americas, he restructured the U.S. retail business and led our acquisition of When I joined MetLife as Chief Investment Officer in 2005, Bill did more than anyone else to help me learn the insurance business, especially the liability side of the balance sheet. During my time as CEO, Bill has been a strong partner in developing and executing our strategic plan. Bill, on behalf of our employees, our customers and our shareholders, thank you for all you have done to make MetLife one of the greatest life insurance companies in the world. 
In closing, MetLife had a strong quarter with double-digit operating EPS growth despite ongoing pressure from low interest rates and a strong dollar. We continue to face regulatory uncertainty but remain hopeful that outcomes will be manageable. Finally, we are focused on improving the cash flow characteristics of the business, an effort that we believe is necessary to maximize shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?"
185648,305520595,843216,"MetLife, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2015",2015-07-30,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our second quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. Operating ear",1918,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our second quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. Operating earnings in the second quarter were $1.8 billion, up 11% up from the prior-year period and up 16% on a constant currency basis. Operating earnings per share were $1.56, up 12% the prior-year period and 17% and on a constant currency basis. This currency included 1 notable item in our Asia business. As discussed in our first quarter earnings call, effective April 1 the Japanese corporate tax rate was reduced from 31% to 29%. As a result, we recorded a onetime tax benefit of $174 million in the second quarter. The operating earnings portion of the onetime benefit was $61 million or $0.05 per share. We estimated that the current year tax benefit for rate deduction will be approximately $24 million in 2015. Adjusted for notable items in the current and prior-year period, operating earnings were up 10% and 16% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers of growth on a constant currency basis were favorable investment margin, business growth, lower taxes and underwriting improvement. Higher expenses were partially offset to these favorable items. 
Turning to our bottom line results. Second quarter net income was $1 billion or $0.92 per share. Net income was $723 million less than operating earnings, primarily because of derivative losses. These losses were driven by higher interest rate and weakening of the U.S. dollars against certain currencies. The second quarter variant between operating earnings and net income include asymmetrical and noneconomic accounting of $856 million aftertax. Net income adjusted for a symmetrical and noneconomic accounting was above operating earning primarily due to the portion of the onetime tax benefit in Japan not reflected in operating earning. Book value per share excluding AOCI than was $50.73 as of June 30, up 4% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $41.73 at June 30, up 8% year-over-year. With respect to second quarter margins, we continue to see a good rebound in underwriting results, which were up approximately $0.03 per share after adjusting for notable items in the prior year quarter. Underwriting improvement was primarily due to better mortality experience in retail life, which returns to a normal level after adverse claims experienced in the first quarter. Retail life's interest adjustment benefit ratio was 53.0%, within the expected range of 50% to 55% and favorable to prior year quarter of 55.2% after adjusting for a onetime benefit related to a visibility waiver reserve. Average net claims from large base policies declined fro on an elevated level in the first quarter. The Group Life mortality ratio was 86.1% or toward the low end of the expected annual range of 85% to 90%. The ratio was favorable to the prior year quarter of 86.9% due to lower claims experienced across several products. The Non-Medical Health interest adjusted loss ratio was 80.5%, favorable to prior year quarter of 82.8% and within the targeted 77% to 82%. Disability result improved year-over-year due to lower incidence and severity as well as higher net closure. In dental as anticipated, we saw higher utilization following low utilization in the first quarter. We believe that low utilization in the first quarter was a function of adverse winter weather. In Property & Casualty, the combined ratio including catastrophe was 101% in retail and 96.0% in Group. The combined ratios, excluding catastrophes, were 80.2% in Retail and 85.5% in Group. Overall, P&C underwriting results improved versus the prior year due to lower cat losses and more favorable prior year development. 
Turning to investment margins. The average of the 4 U.S. product spreads in our was 227 basis points in the quarter. Higher recurring net investment income benefited from a conversion of the securities accounting for the U.S. general account, and this contributed approximately 5 basis points to our product spread. Excluding this adjustment, the simple average was 222 basis points, up 7 basis points year-over-year due to higher variable investment income. Pretax and variable investment income was $427 million, slightly above our 2015 quarterly guidance range of $325 million to $425 million. After taxes and the impact of DAC, variable investment income was $278 million, up $57 million versus the prior year quarter due to good performance across asset classes. Product spreads excluding variable investment income in the current system conversion were 182 basis points, down 8 basis points versus the prior year quarter. Core yields declined as a result of the low interest rate environment. Average new money yield continue to run roughly 100 to 150 basis points below the average yield on the assets rolling off the portfolio. With regard to expense, the operating expense ratio was 24.3%, unfavorable by 110 basis points to the prior year quarter of 23.2%. Approximately half of this increase in the ratio was attributable to lower operating revenues in single premium product. Sales of these products can fluctuate materially from quarter to quarter. Expenses were elevated in the quarter due to higher costs within MetLife's employee benefit programs and higher regulatory costs. Expenses can be volatile for both of these categories. We would expect operating expense ratio improvement in the second half of the year relative to the second quarter. Gross expense saves were $262 million in the second quarter and net saves were $194 million after adjusting for reinvestment of $33 million and onetime costs of $35 million. 
I will now discuss the business highlights of the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $690 million, up 2% versus the prior year quarter and up 6% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Growth in retail was driven by favorable underwriting and higher variable investment income. Life and other reported operating earnings of $278 million, up 5% versus a quarter year quarter and 16% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were favorable underwriting primary in life and higher variable investment income. Life and other PFOs were $2.1 billion, essentially flat year-over-year as growth in the open block was offset by runoff of the close block. Core retail life sales were up 4% year over year driven primarily by an increase in term life. Annuities reported operated earnings of $412 million, essentially flat to the prior year quarter. Higher variable investment income and lower taxes were offset by lower cost spreads, higher expenses and a less favorable initial market impact. Variable annuity sales were $1.9 billion in the quarter, up 16% year-over-year and sequentially. We are seeing good traction with our new VA guaranteed minimum withdrawal driver, FlexChoice, which was launched in February. We expect to see FlexChoice sales continue to grow in 2015 but at a less rapid pace than we had expected. Also, sales of single premium annuities are below our plan. As a result, we are lowering our expectations for total annuity sales growth in 2015 for more than 50% to more than 20%. GVWB reported operating earnings of $231 million, up 11% versus the prior year quarter and 9% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Growth in the quarter was driven by underwriting improvement and business growth. GVWB PFOs were $4.4 billion, up 2% year-over-year. Sales were down 13% year-over-year as we have seen an impact from an increasing competition particularly dental. Sales of voluntary products increased 22% due to growth of active health and property and casualty. Corporate Benefit Funding reported operating earnings of $406 million, up 12% versus the prior year quarter and 19% after adjusting for excess variable income in the prior year quarter. A key driver was an increase in investment margin. CBF PFOs were $455 million, down 44% year-over-year due to low pension closeouts and structured settlement annuity sale. On closeout, we continue to see a good pipeline of small to midsize cases, and we wrote a contract in July of over $500 million of premium. Latin America reported operating earnings of $116 million, down 15% from the prior year quarter but up 3% on a constant currency basis. U.S. Direct, which included Latin America's result, had an operating loss of $20 million versus $8 million in the prior year quarter. The loss this quarter was higher than expected due to business strain from strong sale up 70% and claims volatility in the quarter. We expect losses to moderate in the second half of the year. Excluding U.S. Direct, Latin America operating earnings were up 13% on a constant currency basis driven by business growth partially offset by less favorable market impact. Latin America PFOs were $1.1 billion, down 3% but up 13% on a constant currency basis driven by business growth across the region. Total sales were down 40% on a constant currency basis primarily due to a large contract in Mexico in the second quarter of 2014. Excluding this contract, sales were up 4% versus the prior year quarter. 
Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $425 million, up 31% from the prior year quarter and up 45% on a constant currency basis, driven by lower taxes as a result of the Japan tax rate change and strong business growth across the region. Asia PFOs were $2.2 billion, down 4% from the prior year quarter but up 9% on a constant currency basis driven by strong growth across all key markets. Asia sales were up 1% and a constant currency basis due to growth in Japan and continued growth in sales across the region offset by a decline in retirement sale. EMEA operating earnings were $50 million, down 31% year-over-year and down 70% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for favorable tax items of $7 million from the prior year quarter, operating earnings are up 6% on constant currency business driven by business growth particularly in the Gulf and the U.K. EMEA PFOs were $658 million, down 8% from the prior-year period but up 10% on a constant currency basis. Total EMEA sales increased 7% on a constant currency basis due to strong growth in employee benefits and sales across the region. 
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $6.2 billion at June 30, which is up from $5.7 billion at March 31. This increase reflects subsidiary dividend, the repayment of senior debt and the payment of quarterly dividend. We also refinance a $1.5 billion Series B preferred stock during the quarter. The lower dividend were generated approximately $19 million of savings on a full year basis during the first 5-year fixed term of the securities. 
Turning to our capital position. We reported U.S. RBC ratios actually so we don't have an update for the second quarter. For Japan, our solvency margin was 957% as of first quarter of 2015, which is the latest public data. For our U.S. insurance companies, preliminary second quarter statutory operating earnings and statutory net income were approximately $900 million. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $28 billion as of June 30, which is comparable to December 31. 
In conclusion, MetLife had strong second -- had a strong second quarter. Investment margins remain healthy and underwriting improved year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter. In addition, our cash and capital position remains strong, and we continue to successfully execute on our strategy as we seek to maximize shareholder value. And with that, I with turn it back it to the operator for questions."

And these are typically done into the NEC deadline set by the actuaries of the company and the chief signs off on how the reserves are tested. These are done every year based on the yield at the end of the year and there are shocks down from there based on typically prescribed breaks. New York, through prescribed letters sent to us each year suggests more conservative results often that our actuaries would set on a our normal basis, and this is some of the additional reserves that we hold in New York. Of quarters, as industries ride will be over time and we continue to do casual testing. Some of the reserves that to have been to lower interest rate would be released. But it depends each year on how New York suggest to us that our assumptions for those reserves, and it will be released over time. Because often the reserve increases are over period of time or they could be needed. So it depends on the type of testing that we are doing. So slowly over time the answer is how we would expect it some of this would be released as interest rates rise."

But again, we tried to be cautious in our optimism because obviously if we were to be too aggressive on capital management and the rules were disadvantageous to us, we would not want to have to go to the marketplace and raise large amounts of equity to meet rules that again we don't have yet into our forum. So I am more optimistic that the conversations developed over the years working into a better understanding of the insurance business model as compared to the banking model that regulars in Washington have historically been involved with. But the optimism is kind of tempered by caution on our side in terms of being certain that we are well capitalized as of these rules probably do come out at some point in the future."

So I think that's causing adoption to be a little slower than we had assumed as producers get more comfortable with the product. We've seen this phenomenon before with our indexed annuity product called shield. We -- sales were lower for a while that we have originally thought, and now they are seeming to accelerate now the product now for a little over a year and we probably should have been smarter about how to pay for adoption here.

We are pleased to report strong results for the second quarter of 2015. Operating earnings were $1.8 billion, up 11% from the second quarter of 2014, and operating earnings per share were $1.56, a 12% increase ov",1265,"Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report strong results for the second quarter of 2015. Operating earnings were $1.8 billion, up 11% from the second quarter of 2014, and operating earnings per share were $1.56, a 12% increase over the prior year period. Operating return on equity was 12.5% in the quarter and tangible return on equity was 15.3%.
Second quarter results were negatively impacted by the strong dollar. Operating earnings grew 11% on a reported basis and 16% on a constant currency basis. Favorable tax items, improvement in both investment and underwriting margins and growth in the business more than offset the negative impact from foreign currency translation. Investment margins remained healthy in the quarter with an average investment spread for U.S. product lines of 227 basis points versus 215 basis points in the prior year period. This spread has been in the range of 210 to 240 basis points during the past few years, which highlight the resilience of our investment margins despite of a multiyear period of low interest rates.
Underwriting margins were also favorable in the quarter. After adjusting for notable items, this is the fourth consecutive quarter that underwriting margins have improved versus the prior year period. In the second quarter, underwriting margins were better in Retail life, Group Life, Group Non-Medical Health and Property & Casualty.
Turning to regulatory matters. I will begin with a brief update on our appeal of the government's designation of MetLife as a systemically important financial institution or SIFI. Tomorrow, the Financial Stability Oversight Council will file a brief opposing MetLife's motion for summary judgment and supporting its own position. On August 21, MetLife will file a final reply brief. At this time, the judge has not informed us whether she will be holding an oral hearing, and the timing of the final decision is difficult to predict. With regard to capital rules, the passage of the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act late last year provided flexibility for the Federal Reserve to develop rules appropriate for the business of insurance. The Federal Reserve is working on the required standards, and I am hopeful that those deliberations will lead to a suitable proposal. Developing an appropriate insurance capital standard in the United States is also important in forming the development of global capital standards. While the timing for producing a domestic capital standard remains uncertain, we believe global standards should not be finalized before a domestic standard is developed. Upon completion, both standards should be tailored with the insurance business model. We are supportive of legislation that has been introduced to encourage greater transparency and increased Congressional oversight of U.S. participation in the international standard-setting process.
Another policy issue MetLife is following closely is the proposed fiduciary rule in the Department of Labor. While proponents argue the rule will help individuals save for retirement, we believe it will have the opposite effect by reducing choice, increasing cost and limiting access to financial education and investment advice. Wealthier investors may not be significantly impacted by the rule because their assets generate sufficient fees to pay for investment advice. However, assets of middle-income investors are unlikely to generate fees sufficient to offset the higher cost of offering advice under this rule. Consequently, those consumers could find it difficult, if not impossible, to receive face-to-face investment advice. The proposed rule is particularly problematic for individual annuities, which are the only products that provide consumers with a variety of benefits including guaranteed retirement income they can never outlive. The proposed rule effectively makes it a conflict of interest to sell your own products. Without substantial modifications, the proposal could force companies, such as MetLife, to choose between manufacturing individual annuities and distributing them. It is unclear what public policy goal is served by making it more difficult for companies to provide guaranteed retirement income to consumers. MetLife submitted comments on the proposed rule to the Labor Department last week, and the department will be holding public hearings from August 10 through August 12. We are confident that policymakers can find a way to protect the interest of consumers while still preserving access to much needed retirement advice.
I would now like to comment on cash. As I said in MetLife's most recent annual report, we need to do a better job of generating free cash flow, which is the most important metric in determining a company's ability to return capital to shareholders. I am pleased that the ratio of our free cash flow to operating earnings has been on an upward trend since 2012, and we remain confident in our target of 45% to 55% for 2015 to 2017. Increasing the amount of cash generated by the business is an enterprise-wide imperative at MetLife.
Our focus on cash is an extension of a strategy that we announced in May 2012, which centered on improving on return on equity while also reducing our cost of equity capital. We have successfully repositioned our business to achieve higher returns with lower risk and are now working diligently to make sure the products we sell strike the right balance between returns and cash generation.
I have 3 observations I would like to share with you related to this initiative. First, we are conducting a granular analysis of the cash and capital characteristics of our business. In each segment that we have examined, we have identified opportunities for improvement. Second, our goal is not maximum free cash flow today if that would mean forgoing attractive investment opportunities in the business. Our goal is to grow free cash flow over time. Third, while we are working toward a business model that will produce compelling growth in free cash flow, we also have the potential to optimize our balance sheet if MetLife's SIFI designation is overturned or the new capital requirements are reasonable.
Finally, I want to recognize the contributions of Bill Wheeler to the success of MetLife. As most of you know, this is the last earnings call for Bill, MetLife's President of the Americas region. As we announced in April, Bill is retiring next month after 17 years with the company. I want to take this opportunity to thank Bill personally for all that he has done to help MetLife and me over the years. Bill has contributed in numerous ways to MetLife's success. As Treasurer, he played a critical role in taking MetLife public in 2000. As CFO, he helped guide the company safely through the financial crisis. And as President of the Americas, he restructured the U.S. retail business and led our acquisition of Provida. When I joined MetLife as Chief Investment Officer in 2005, Bill did more than anyone else to help me learn the insurance business, especially the liability side of the balance sheet. During my time as CEO, Bill has been a strong partner in developing and executing on our strategic plan. Bill, on behalf of our employees, our customers and our shareholders, thank you for all that you have done to make MetLife one of the greatest life insurance companies in the world.
In closing, MetLife had a strong quarter with double-digit operating EPS growth despite ongoing pressure from low interest rates and a strong dollar. We continue to face regulatory uncertainty, but remain hopeful the outcomes will be manageable. Finally, we are focused on improving the cash flow characteristics of the business, an effort that we believe is necessary to maximize shareholder value.
With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?"

Today, I'll cover our second quarter result, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital.
Operating earnings in the second quarter were $1.8 billion, up 11% from the prior year period and up 16% on a constant currency basis. Operating earnings per share were $1.56, up 12% from the prior year period and 17% on a constant currency basis. This quarter included one notable item in our Asia business. As discussed on our first quarter earnings call, effective April 1, the Japanese corporate tax rate was reduced from 31% to 29%. As a result, we have recorded a onetime tax benefit of $174 million in the second quarter. The operating earnings portion of the onetime benefit was $61 million or $0.05 per share. We estimate that the current year tax benefit from the rate deduction will be approximately $24 million in 2015. Adjusting for notable items in the current and prior year period, operating earnings were up 10% and 16% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers of growth on a constant currency basis were favorable investment margin, business growth, lower taxes and underwriting improvement. Higher expenses were a partial offset to these favorable items.
Turning to our bottom line results. Second quarter net income was $1 billion or $0.92 per share. Net income was $723 million less than operating earnings, primarily because of derivative losses. These losses were driven by higher interest rates and weakening of the U.S. dollar against certain currencies. The second quarter variance between operating earnings and net income includes asymmetrical and noneconomic accounting of $856 million after tax. Net income adjusted for asymmetrical and noneconomic accounting was above operating earning primarily due to the portion of the onetime tax benefit in Japan not reflected in operating earning.
Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $50.73 as of June 30, up 4% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $41.73 at June 30, up 8% year-over-year. With respect to second quarter margins, we continue to see a good rebound in underwriting results, which were up approximately $0.03 per share after adjusting for notable items in the prior year quarter. Underwriting improvement was primarily due to better mortality experienced in Retail life, which returns to a normal level after adverse claims experienced in the first quarter.
Retail life's interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 53.0%, within the expected range of 50% to 55%, and favorable to the prior year quarter of 55.2% after adjusting for a onetime benefit related to a disability waiver reserve. Average net claims from large face policies declined from an elevated level in the first quarter.
The Group Life mortality ratio was 86.1% or toward the low end of the expected annual range of 85% to 90%. The ratio was favorable to the prior year quarter of 86.9% due to lower claims experienced across several products.
The Non-Medical Health interest-adjusted loss ratio was 80.5%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 82.8% and within the targeted 77% to 82%. Disability results improved year-over-year due to lower incidence and severity as well as higher net closure. In dental, as anticipated, we saw higher utilization following low utilization in the first quarter. We believe the low utilization in the first quarter was a function of adverse winter weather.
In Property & Casualty, the combined ratio including catastrophe was 100.1% in retail and 96.0% in group. The combined ratios, excluding catastrophes, were 80.2% in retail and 85.5% in group. Overall, P&C underwriting results improved versus the prior year due to lower cat losses and more favorable prior year development.
Turning to investment margins. The average of the 4 U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 227 basis points in the quarter. Higher recurring net investment income benefited from a conversion of the securities accounting system for the U.S. general account. This contributed approximately 5 basis points to our product spread. Excluding this adjustment, the simple average was 222 basis points, up 7 basis points year-over-year due to higher variable investment income. Pretax variable investment income was $427 million, slightly above our 2015 quarterly guidance range of $325 million to $425 million. After taxes and the impact of DAC, variable investment income was $278 million, up $57 million versus the prior year quarter due to good performance across asset classes. Product spreads excluding variable investment income and the accounting system conversion were 182 basis points, down 8 basis points versus the prior year quarter. Core yields declined as a result of the low interest rate environment. Average new money yields continue to run roughly 100 to 150 basis points below the average yield of the assets rolling off the portfolio.
With regard to expense, the operating expense ratio was 24.3%, unfavorable by 110 basis points to the prior year quarter of 23.2%. Approximately half of this increase in the ratio was attributable to lower operating revenues from single premium product. Sales of these products can fluctuate materially from quarter to quarter. Expenses were elevated in the quarter due to higher costs within MetLife's employee benefits program and higher regulatory costs. Expenses can be volatile for both of these categories. We would expect to see operating expense ratio improvement in the second half of the year relative to the second quarter. Gross expense saves were $262 million in the second quarter and net saves were $194 million after adjusting for reinvestment of $33 million and onetime costs of $35 million.
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $690 million, up 2% versus the prior year quarter and up 6% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Growth in Retail was driven by favorable underwriting and higher variable investment income.
Life & Other reported operating earnings of $278 million, up 5% versus the prior year quarter and 16% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were favorable underwriting, primary in life, and higher variable investment income. Life & Other PFOs were $2.1 billion, essentially flat year-over-year as growth in the open block was offset by runoff of the closed block. Core retail life sales were up 4% year over year driven primarily by an increase in term life.
Annuities reported operated earnings of $412 million, essentially flat to the prior year quarter. Higher variable investment income and lower taxes were offset by lower core spreads, higher expenses and a less favorable initial market impact. Variable annuity sales were $1.9 billion in the quarter, up 16% year-over-year and sequentially. We are seeing good traction with our new VA guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider, FlexChoice, which was launched in February. We expect to see FlexChoice sales continue to grow in 2015, but at a less rapid pace than we had expected. Also, sales of single premium immediate annuities are below our plan. As a result, we are lowering our expectation for total annuity sales growth in 2015 from more than 50% to more than 20%.
GVWB reported operating earnings of $231 million, up 11% versus the prior year quarter and 9% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Growth in the quarter was driven by underwriting improvement and business growth. GVWB PFOs were $4.4 billion, up 2% year-over-year. Sales were down 13% year-over-year as we have seen an impact from an increase in competition, particularly dental. Sales of voluntary products increased 22% due to growth in Accident & Health and Property & Casualty.
Corporate Benefit Funding reported operating earnings of $406 million, up 12% versus the prior year quarter and 19% after adjusting for excess variable income in the prior year quarter. A key driver was an increase in investment margin. CBF PFOs were $455 million, down 44% year-over-year due to low pension closeouts and structured settlement annuity sale. On closeout, we continue to see a good pipeline of small to midsized cases, and we wrote a contract in July with over $500 million of premium.
Latin America reported operating earnings of $116 million, down 15% from the prior year quarter, but up 3% on a constant currency basis. U.S. Direct, which included Latin America's result, had an operating loss of $20 million versus $8 million in the prior year quarter. The loss this quarter was higher than expected due to business drain from strong sale, up 70%, and claims volatility in the quarter. We expect losses to moderate in the second half of the year. Excluding U.S. Direct, Latin America operating earnings were up 13% on a constant currency basis driven by business growth, partially offset by less favorable market impact. Latin America PFOs were $1.1 billion, down 3%, but up 13% on a constant currency basis driven by business growth across the region. Total sales were down 40% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to a large contract in Mexico in the second quarter of 2014. Excluding this contract, sales were up 4% versus the prior year quarter.
Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $425 million, up 31% from the prior year quarter and up 45% on a constant currency basis, driven by lower taxes as a result of the Japan tax rate change and strong business growth across the region. Asia PFOs were $2.2 billion, down 4% from the prior year quarter, but up 9% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong growth across all key markets. Asia sales were up 1% and a constant currency basis due to growth in Japan and continued growth in A&H sales across the region, offset by a decline in retirement sale.
EMEA operating earnings were $50 million, down 31% year-over-year and down 7% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for favorable tax items of $7 million in the prior year quarter, operating earnings were up 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by business growth particularly in the Gulf and the U.K. EMEA PFOs were $658 million, down 8% from the prior year period, but up 10% on a constant currency basis. Total EMEA sales increased 7% on a constant currency basis, due to strong growth in employee benefits and A&H sales across the region.
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding company were approximately $6.2 billion at June 30, which is up from $5.7 billion at March 31. This increase reflects subsidiary dividend, the repayment of senior debt and the payment of our quarterly dividend. We also refinanced a $1.5 billion Series B preferred stock during the quarter. The lower dividend would generate approximately $19 million of savings on a full year basis during the first 5-year fixed term of the security.
Turning to our capital position. We report U.S. RBC ratios annually so we do not have an update for the second quarter. For Japan, our solvency margin was 957% as of the first quarter of 2015, which is the latest public data. For our U.S. insurance companies, preliminary second quarter statutory operating earnings and statutory net income were approximately $900 million. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $28 billion as of June 30, which is comparable to December 31.
In conclusion, MetLife had strong second -- had a strong second quarter. Investment margins remained healthy and underwriting improved year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter. In addition, our cash and capital position remains strong, and we continue to successfully execute on our strategy as we seek to maximize shareholder value.
And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions."

And these are typically done under the NAIC guidelines set by the actuaries of the company and the chief actuary of the company signs off on how these reserves are tested. These are done every year based on the yield at the end of the year and they're shocked down from there based on typically prescribed rates. New York, through prescribed letters they've sent to us each year suggests more conservative reserves often than our actuaries would set on a normal basis, and this is some of the additional reserves that we hold in New York. Of course, as interest rates rise slowly over time and we continue to do the cash flow testing, some of the reserves that happened at the lower interest rate would be released. But it depends each year on how New York suggest to us, our assumptions for those reserves, and it would be released over time. Because often, the reserve increases are over a period of time or they could be immediate. So it depends on the type of testing that we are doing. So slowly over time the answer is how we would expect that some of this would be released as interest rates rise."

And the nature of our conversations and the tone of our conversations provide me more optimism than I had, let's say, 3 or 4 years ago. But again, we try to be cautious in our optimism because, obviously, if we were to be too aggressive on capital management and the rules were disadvantageous to us, we would not want to have to go to the marketplace and raise large amounts of equity to meet rules that, again, we don't have yet in draft form. So I am more optimistic that the conversations have developed over the years where, I think, there's a better understanding of the insurance business model as compared to the banking model that regulators in Washington have historically been involved with. But the optimism is kind of -- is tempered by caution on our side in terms of being certain that we are well capitalized as these draft rules finally do come out at some point in the future."

Secondly, remember we've been pretty aggressive about renewals and new business in our disability area, feeling that we needed to kind of catch up a little bit on our pricing, and I think that's depressed sales a little bit in disability. You can certainly see it in the numbers. Our disability new sales are pretty low. Renewals are good in terms of we're getting our price in renewals, but the new business we're getting is pretty low.

We've been conservative so far so we have maximum flexibility depending on what the SIFI rules are because there could be Tier 2. It could be more complex. It might be different. So that we've been deliberately being a little underlevered compared to some of our targets so that we have this flexibility.

For instance, sales were a little suppressed this quarter relative to what we would normally expect for sales growth. But if you look underneath, what you'll see is, is our Mexican Afore, which is the private pension system in Mexico, is sales are much lower there. There have been certain sales practice changes which makes switching between accounts much less prevalent Afore providers. And so sales, gross sales, I would say, are much lower, but at the same time retention rates are higher. Maybe a better indicator of sort of what's really going on in Mexico or in Latin America is just PFOs. On a constant rate, PFO growth this quarter was 13%.

We are pleased to report strong results for the second quarter of 2015. Operating earnings were $1.8 billion, up 11% from the second quarter of 2014, and operating earnings per share were $1.56, a 12% increase ov",1264,"Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report strong results for the second quarter of 2015. Operating earnings were $1.8 billion, up 11% from the second quarter of 2014, and operating earnings per share were $1.56, a 12% increase over the prior year period. Operating return on equity was 12.5% in the quarter and tangible return on equity was 15.3%.
Second quarter results were negatively impacted by the strong dollar. Operating earnings grew 11% on a reported basis and 16% on a constant currency basis. Favorable tax items, improvement in both investment and underwriting margins and growth in the business more than offset the negative impact from foreign currency translation. Investment margins remained healthy in the quarter with an average investment spread for U.S. product lines of 227 basis points versus 215 basis points in the prior year period. This spread has been in the range of 210 to 240 basis points during the past few years, which highlight the resilience of our investment margins despite a multiyear period of low interest rates.
Underwriting margins were also favorable in the quarter. After adjusting for notable items, this is the fourth consecutive quarter that underwriting margins have improved versus the prior year period. In the second quarter, underwriting margins were better in Retail life, Group Life, Group Non-Medical Health and Property & Casualty.
Turning to regulatory matters. I will begin with a brief update on our appeal of the government's designation of MetLife as a systemically important financial institution or SIFI. Tomorrow, the Financial Stability Oversight Council will file a brief opposing MetLife's motion for summary judgment and supporting its own position. On August 21, MetLife will file a final reply brief. At this time, the judge has not informed us whether she will be holding an oral hearing, and the timing of the final decision is difficult to predict. With regard to capital rules, the passage of the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act late last year provided flexibility for the Federal Reserve to develop rules appropriate for the business of insurance. The Federal Reserve is working on the required standards, and I am hopeful that those deliberations will lead to a suitable proposal. Developing an appropriate insurance capital standard in the United States is also important to informing the development of global capital standards. While the timing for producing a domestic capital standard remains uncertain, we believe global standards should not be finalized before a domestic standard is developed. Upon completion, both standards should be tailored with the insurance business model. We are supportive of legislation that has been introduced to encourage greater transparency and increased Congressional oversight of U.S. participation in the international standard-setting process.
Another policy issue MetLife is following closely is the proposed fiduciary rule in the Department of Labor. While proponents argue the rule will help individuals save for retirement, we believe it will have the opposite effect by reducing choice, increasing cost and limiting access to financial education and investment advice. Wealthier investors may not be significantly impacted by the rule because their assets generate sufficient fees to pay for investment advice. However, assets of middle-income investors are unlikely to generate fees sufficient to offset the higher cost of offering advice under this rule. Consequently, those consumers could find it difficult, if not impossible, to receive face-to-face investment advice. The proposed rule is particularly problematic for individual annuities, which are the only products that provide consumers with a variety of benefits including guaranteed retirement income they can never outlive. The proposed rule effectively makes it a conflict of interest to sell your own products. Without substantial modifications, the proposal could force companies, such as MetLife, to choose between manufacturing individual annuities and distributing them. It is unclear what public policy goal is served by making it more difficult for companies to provide guaranteed retirement income to consumers. MetLife submitted comments on the proposed rule to the Labor Department last week, and the department will be holding public hearings from August 10 through August 12. We are confident that policymakers can find a way to protect the interest of consumers while still preserving access to much needed retirement advice.
I would now like to comment on cash. As I said in MetLife's most recent annual report, we need to do a better job of generating free cash flow, which is the most important metric in determining a company's ability to return capital to shareholders. I am pleased that the ratio of our free cash flow to operating earnings has been on an upward trend since 2012, and we remain confident in our target of 45% to 55% for 2015 to 2017. Increasing the amount of cash generated by the business is an enterprise-wide imperative at MetLife.
Our focus on cash is an extension of a strategy that we announced in May 2012, which centered on improving our return on equity while also reducing our cost of equity capital. We have successfully repositioned our business to achieve higher returns with lower risk and are now working diligently to make sure the products we sell strike the right balance between returns and cash generation.
I have 3 observations I would like to share with you related to this initiative. First, we are conducting a granular analysis of the cash and capital characteristics of our business. In each segment that we have examined, we have identified opportunities for improvement. Second, our goal is not maximum free cash flow today if that would mean forgoing attractive investment opportunities in the business. Our goal is to grow free cash flow over time. Third, while we are working toward a business model that will produce compelling growth in free cash flow, we also have the potential to optimize our balance sheet if MetLife's SIFI designation is overturned or the new capital requirements are reasonable.
Finally, I want to recognize the contributions of Bill Wheeler to the success of MetLife. As most of you know, this is the last earnings call for Bill, MetLife's President of the Americas region. As we announced in April, Bill is retiring next month after 17 years with the company. I want to take this opportunity to thank Bill personally for all that he has done to help MetLife and me over the years. Bill has contributed in numerous ways to MetLife's success. As Treasurer, he played a critical role in taking MetLife public in 2000. As CFO, he helped guide the company safely through the financial crisis. And as President of the Americas, he restructured the U.S. retail business and led our acquisition of Provida. When I joined MetLife as Chief Investment Officer in 2005, Bill did more than anyone else to help me learn the insurance business, especially the liability side of the balance sheet. During my time as CEO, Bill has been a strong partner in developing and executing on our strategic plan. Bill, on behalf of our employees, our customers and our shareholders, thank you for all that you have done to make MetLife one of the greatest life insurance companies in the world.
In closing, MetLife had a strong quarter with double-digit operating EPS growth despite ongoing pressure from low interest rates and a strong dollar. We continue to face regulatory uncertainty, but remain hopeful the outcomes will be manageable. Finally, we are focused on improving the cash flow characteristics of the business, an effort that we believe is necessary to maximize shareholder value.
With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?"

Today, I'll cover our second quarter result, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital.
Operating earnings in the second quarter were $1.8 billion, up 11% from the prior year period and up 16% on a constant currency basis. Operating earnings per share were $1.56, up 12% from the prior year period and 17% on a constant currency basis. This quarter included one notable item in our Asia business. As discussed on our first quarter earnings call, effective April 1, the Japanese corporate tax rate was reduced from 31% to 29%. As a result, we have recorded a onetime tax benefit of $174 million in the second quarter. The operating earnings portion of the onetime benefit was $61 million or $0.05 per share. We estimate that the current year tax benefit from the rate deduction will be approximately $24 million in 2015. Adjusting for notable items in the current and prior year period, operating earnings were up 10% and 16% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers of growth on a constant currency basis were favorable investment margin, business growth, lower taxes and underwriting improvement. Higher expenses were a partial offset to these favorable items.
Turning to our bottom line results. Second quarter net income was $1 billion or $0.92 per share. Net income was $723 million less than operating earnings, primarily because of derivative losses. These losses were driven by higher interest rates and weakening of the U.S. dollar against certain currencies. The second quarter variance between operating earnings and net income includes asymmetrical and noneconomic accounting of $856 million after tax. Net income adjusted for asymmetrical and noneconomic accounting was above operating earning primarily due to the portion of the onetime tax benefit in Japan not reflected in operating earning.
Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $50.73 as of June 30, up 4% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $41.73 at June 30, up 8% year-over-year. With respect to second quarter margins, we continue to see a good rebound in underwriting results, which were up approximately $0.03 per share after adjusting for notable items in the prior year quarter. Underwriting improvement was primarily due to better mortality experienced in Retail life, which returns to a normal level after adverse claims experienced in the first quarter.
Retail life's interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 53.0%, within the expected range of 50% to 55%, and favorable to the prior year quarter of 55.2% after adjusting for a onetime benefit related to a disability waiver reserve. Average net claims from large face policies declined from an elevated level in the first quarter.
The Group Life mortality ratio was 86.1% or toward the low end of the expected annual range of 85% to 90%. The ratio was favorable to the prior year quarter of 86.9% due to lower claims experienced across several products.
The Non-Medical Health interest-adjusted loss ratio was 80.5%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 82.8% and within the targeted 77% to 82%. Disability results improved year-over-year due to lower incidence and severity as well as higher net closure. In dental, as anticipated, we saw higher utilization following low utilization in the first quarter. We believe the low utilization in the first quarter was a function of adverse winter weather.
In Property & Casualty, the combined ratio including catastrophe was 100.1% in retail and 96.0% in group. The combined ratios, excluding catastrophes, were 80.2% in retail and 85.5% in group. Overall, P&C underwriting results improved versus the prior year due to lower cat losses and more favorable prior year development.
Turning to investment margins. The average of the 4 U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 227 basis points in the quarter. Higher recurring net investment income benefited from a conversion of the securities accounting system for the U.S. general account. This contributed approximately 5 basis points to our product spread. Excluding this adjustment, the simple average was 222 basis points, up 7 basis points year-over-year due to higher variable investment income. Pretax variable investment income was $427 million, slightly above our 2015 quarterly guidance range of $325 million to $425 million. After taxes and the impact of DAC, variable investment income was $278 million, up $57 million versus the prior year quarter due to good performance across asset classes. Product spreads excluding variable investment income in the accounting system conversion were 182 basis points, down 8 basis points versus the prior year quarter. Core yields declined as a result of the low interest rate environment. Average new money yields continue to run roughly 100 to 150 basis points below the average yield of the assets rolling off the portfolio.
With regard to expense, the operating expense ratio was 24.3%, unfavorable by 110 basis points to the prior year quarter of 23.2%. Approximately half of this increase in the ratio was attributable to lower operating revenues from single premium product. Sales of these products can fluctuate materially from quarter to quarter. Expenses were elevated in the quarter due to higher costs within MetLife's employee benefits program and higher regulatory costs. Expenses can be volatile for both of these categories. We would expect to see operating expense ratio improvement in the second half of the year relative to the second quarter. Gross expense saves were $262 million in the second quarter and net saves were $194 million after adjusting for reinvestment of $33 million and onetime costs of $35 million.
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $690 million, up 2% versus the prior year quarter and up 6% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Growth in Retail was driven by favorable underwriting and higher variable investment income.
Life & Other reported operating earnings of $278 million, up 5% versus the prior year quarter and 16% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were favorable underwriting, primary in life, and higher variable investment income. Life & Other PFOs were $2.1 billion, essentially flat year-over-year as growth in the open block was offset by runoff of the closed block. Core retail life sales were up 4% year over year driven primarily by an increase in term life.
Annuities reported operated earnings of $412 million, essentially flat to the prior year quarter. Higher variable investment income and lower taxes were offset by lower core spreads, higher expenses and a less favorable initial market impact. Variable annuity sales were $1.9 billion in the quarter, up 16% year-over-year and sequentially. We are seeing good traction with our new VA guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider, FlexChoice, which was launched in February. We expect to see FlexChoice sales continue to grow in 2015, but at a less rapid pace than we had expected. Also, sales of single premium immediate annuities are below our plan. As a result, we are lowering our expectation for total annuity sales growth in 2015 from more than 50% to more than 20%.
GVWB reported operating earnings of $231 million, up 11% versus the prior year quarter and 9% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Growth in the quarter was driven by underwriting improvement and business growth. GVWB PFOs were $4.4 billion, up 2% year-over-year. Sales were down 13% year-over-year as we have seen an impact from an increase in competition, particularly dental. Sales of voluntary products increased 22% due to growth in Accident & Health and Property & Casualty.
Corporate Benefit Funding reported operating earnings of $406 million, up 12% versus the prior year quarter and 19% after adjusting for excess variable income in the prior year quarter. A key driver was an increase in investment margin. CBF PFOs were $455 million, down 44% year-over-year due to low pension closeouts and structured settlement annuity sale. On closeout, we continue to see a good pipeline of small to midsized cases, and we wrote a contract in July with over $500 million of premium.
Latin America reported operating earnings of $116 million, down 15% from the prior year quarter, but up 3% on a constant currency basis. U.S. Direct, which included Latin America's result, had an operating loss of $20 million versus $8 million in the prior year quarter. The loss this quarter was higher than expected due to business drain from strong sale, up 70%, and claims volatility in the quarter. We expect losses to moderate in the second half of the year. Excluding U.S. Direct, Latin America operating earnings were up 13% on a constant currency basis driven by business growth, partially offset by less favorable market impact. Latin America PFOs were $1.1 billion, down 3%, but up 13% on a constant currency basis driven by business growth across the region. Total sales were down 40% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to a large contract in Mexico in the second quarter of 2014. Excluding this contract, sales were up 4% versus the prior year quarter.
Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $425 million, up 31% from the prior year quarter and up 45% on a constant currency basis, driven by lower taxes as a result of the Japan tax rate change and strong business growth across the region. Asia PFOs were $2.2 billion, down 4% from the prior year quarter, but up 9% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong growth across all key markets. Asia sales were up 1% and a constant currency basis due to growth in Japan and continued growth in A&H sales across the region, offset by a decline in retirement sale.
EMEA operating earnings were $50 million, down 31% year-over-year and down 7% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for favorable tax items of $7 million in the prior year quarter, operating earnings were up 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by business growth particularly in the Gulf and the U.K. EMEA PFOs were $658 million, down 8% from the prior year period, but up 10% on a constant currency basis. Total EMEA sales increased 7% on a constant currency basis, due to strong growth in employee benefits and A&H sales across the region.
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding company were approximately $6.2 billion at June 30, which is up from $5.7 billion at March 31. This increase reflects subsidiary dividend, the repayment of senior debt and the payment of our quarterly dividend. We also refinanced a $1.5 billion Series B preferred stock during the quarter. The lower dividend would generate approximately $19 million of savings on a full year basis during the first 5-year fixed term of the security.
Turning to our capital position. We report U.S. RBC ratios annually so we do not have an update for the second quarter. For Japan, our solvency margin was 957% as of the first quarter of 2015, which is the latest public data. For our U.S. insurance companies, preliminary second quarter statutory operating earnings and statutory net income were approximately $900 million. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $28 billion as of June 30, which is comparable to December 31.
In conclusion, MetLife had strong second -- had a strong second quarter. Investment margins remained healthy and underwriting improved year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter. In addition, our cash and capital position remains strong, and we continue to successfully execute on our strategy as we seek to maximize shareholder value.
And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions."

And these are typically done under the NAIC guidelines set by the actuaries of the company and the chief actuary of the company signs off on how these reserves are tested. These are done every year based on the yield at the end of the year and they're shocked down from there based on typically prescribed rates. New York, through prescribed letters they've sent to us each year suggests more conservative reserves often than our actuaries would set on a normal basis, and this is some of the additional reserves that we hold in New York. Of course, as interest rates rise slowly over time and we continue to do the cash flow testing, some of the reserves that have been set up for the lower interest rate would be released. But it depends each year on how New York suggests to us, our assumptions for those reserves, and it would be released over time. Because often, the reserve increases are over a period of time or they could be immediate. So it depends on the type of testing that we are doing. So slowly over time the answer is how we would expect that some of this would be released as interest rates rise."

And the nature of our conversations and the tone of our conversations provide me more optimism than I had, let's say, 3 or 4 years ago. But again, we try to be cautious in our optimism because, obviously, if we were to be too aggressive on capital management and the rules were disadvantageous to us, we would not want to have to go to the marketplace and raise large amounts of equity to meet rules that, again, we don't have yet in draft form. So I am more optimistic that the conversations have developed over the years where, I think, there's a better understanding of the insurance business model as compared to the banking model that regulators in Washington have historically been involved with. But the optimism is kind of -- is tempered by caution on our side in terms of being certain that we are well capitalized as these draft rules finally do come out at some point in the future."

Secondly, remember we've been pretty aggressive about renewals and new business in our disability area, feeling that we needed to kind of catch up a little bit on our pricing, and I think that's depressed sales a little bit in disability. You can certainly see it in the numbers. Our disability new sales are pretty low. Renewals are good in terms of we're getting our price in renewals, but the new business we're getting is pretty low.

Last night, we reported third quarter operating earnings per share of $0.62, which included a preannounced noncash charge of $0.70 per share related to the tax treatment of a wholly-owned U.K.-based investment su",1228,"Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported third quarter operating earnings per share of $0.62, which included a preannounced noncash charge of $0.70 per share related to the tax treatment of a wholly-owned U.K.-based investment subsidiary. Adjusted for this and other notable items, operating earnings per share were $1.36 in the quarter, which compares to $1.51 on the same basis in the prior-year period. Adjusted for notable items, operating return equity was 10.7%, intangible ROE was 13.1% in the quarter. While operating EPS adjusted for notable items were down this quarter, our 9-month results on the same basis were up 3% with an operating ROE of 11.5% and intangible ROE of 14.2%.
Macro economic factors, foreign currency, equity markets and interest rates explain the year-over-year decline in third quarter operating earnings per share adjusted for notable items. Broad-based strength in the U.S. dollar reduced operating earnings from international businesses by $0.09 per share, with significant weakness in the Mexican and Chilean pesos, the Aussie dollar and the euro.
Equity market performance relative to the prior year quarter hurt operating earnings by $0.04 per share. Most of the negative impact was in Retail Annuities, but poor equity market performance also hurt the coinvestment related earnings from Provida AFP.
The persistent low interest rate environment remains challenging and reduced operating earnings adjusted for notable items by $0.03 per share relative to the third quarter of last year. Investment margins have been resilient in recent years as a result of affected asset liability management, low interest rate hedges and variable investment income. However, we face ongoing headwinds from new money yields that are 100 to 150 basis points below the portfolio yield and from a gradual expiration of derivative protection.
From a balance sheet standpoint, we believe low interest rates are a manageable risk. For example, we completed our annual actuarial assumption review in the third quarter and the negative impact from low rates on net income was less than $180 million. A key driver of this charge was an assumption change on how long it will take for the 10-year treasury yield to reach a normalized level. We are now assuming it takes 11 years for the 10-year Treasury yield to increase to our normalized assumption of 4.5% versus 3 years previously.
Turning to regulatory issues. We recently received the clearest indication to date regarding the Federal Reserve's thinking on capital rules for federally regulated insurance companies. In a speech delivered in late September, Federal Reserve Board Governor Dan commented on the importance of the liability side of an insurance company's balance sheet when constructing capital rules. He said, ""Traditional insurance liabilities argue for lower capital programs that might be required for hypothetical bank holding a similar portfolio of assets."" These are welcomed comments made possible by the enactment of the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act in December of last year.
At the same time, Governor said the balance sheet of many large life insurers contain liabilities that he does not consider traditional. Our takeaway is that while the Fed clearly recognizes the difference between the bank business model and the insurance business model, they still need to see draft capital rules before we can draw any firm conclusions about the impact on our business.
On a parallel track, international regulators are developing capital rules for global systemically important insurers. Here, too, the news is mixed. On October 5, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors released its proposal for higher loss absorbency capital requirements or HLA.
While MetLife holds capital comfortably above the levels prescribed by the IAIS, we have 2 concerns with the methodology. The first is that the required capital levels in the international framework are procyclical and potentially volatile because they are based on a mark-to-market approach that ignores the ability of insurers to hold assets for the long-term.
The second is that the IAIS proposes to apply higher capital charges to so-called nontraditional noninsurance activities. Certain products with guarantees, such as variable Annuities, are deemed nontraditional, while other products with similar guarantees sold by competitors elsewhere in the world are deemed traditional. This highlights the risk that MetLife has consistently identified in determining what is systemic, that regulators will inadvertently pick winners and losers in the life insurance industry.
The good news is that the IAIS has said the higher loss absorbency rates will be subject to revision before the target effective date of 2019. In fact, the IAIS is launching a review this month of the definition of nontraditional insurance and has said that any changes will flow through to the HLA rules.
Another regulatory issue MetLife is following closely is the Department of Labor's proposed fiduciary rule. As drafted, the rule will make it significantly more difficult for life insurance companies to sell variable annuities. MetLife has shared its concerns with the DOL in comment letters. And the majority of members in both the House and Senate have asked the department to make changes to the rule. In addition, several members of Congress are beginning to work on a legislative alternative to the DOL proposal, which underscores the growing awareness that the proposal will harm consumers by reducing choice and limiting access to financial education and investment advice.
I would now like to comment on cash distributions to shareholders. As you know, on September 22, we increased our share repurchase authorization from $261 million to $1 billion. We are comfortable with this authorization given our current capital position, which we continue to maintain above historical levels because of uncertain capital rules. Since the announcement, we have repurchased $261 million of stock, including $107 million in the third quarter. And we plan to remain an opportunistic buyer of our shares. In the first 9 months of 2015, our total payout to shareholders was $2.3 billion, with roughly an in-split [ph] between share repurchases and dividends. This total payout equals approximately half of our 9-month operating earnings adjusted for notable items and is in line with our guidance of a 45% to 55% ratio of free cash flow to operating earnings.
MetLife philosophy remains unchanged. Excess capital belongs to our shareholders. In my annual letter to shareholders this past March, I say that free cash flow generation has become an enterprisewide imperative for MetLife, one that will form all of our major business decisions in the months and years ahead. As mentioned during our Second Quarter Earnings Call, we have undertaken a granular analysis of the cash and capital characteristics of our business. This ongoing work is helping us improve our capital allocation process, which we expect will drive more value for shareholders over time.
In closing this morning, I want to provide an update on the management structure of our Americas region. MetLife is taking deliberative approach to find the right leadership for the Americas. While our search continues, we have named Eric Steigerwalt as interim head of the U.S. Business reporting to me. In addition to Retail, Eric will oversee our other U.S. businesses, group voluntary/worksite benefits, Corporate Benefit Funding and U.S. Direct. Oscar Schmidt will continue his role as head of our Latin America business, also reporting to me. Both are strong leaders focused on generating long-term value for MetLife's shareholders.
I will now turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?"

Today, I'll cover our third quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. 
Operating earnings in the third quarter was $705 million or $0.62 per share. This quarter included 5 notable items, which were highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our Quarterly Financial Supplement or QFS. First, we have previously announced that our previously announced noncash charge of $792 million or $0.70 per share related to the tax treatment of a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. 
Second, as a result of our annual actuarial assumption revenue and other insurance adjustments, we had an after-tax charge to operating earnings of $92 million or $0.08 per share. The total after-tax charge to net income was $210 million. Retail accounted for $228 million, partially offset by modest positive earnings impact in Asia and EMEA. The impact in Retail was mainly due to the change in our assumptions to reflect the persistent low interest rate environment and our current view that rates will remain below normal levels longer than we had originally assumed. As you heard from Steve, we are now assuming that it takes 11 years for the 10-year Treasury yield to reach 4.5% versus 3 years previously. We've also lowered our long-term earned rate assumption for Annuities from 5.25% to 5%. Our long-term earned rate assumption for life insurance is unchanged at 5.75%, and our long-term separate account return assumption remains 7.25%.
Third, variable investment income was $174 million after taxes and DAC which is $37 million or $0.03 per share, below the bottom end of our 2015 quarterly guidance range.
Fourth, we have favorable onetime tax items in the Americas, which increased operating earnings by $72 million or $0.06 per share.
Finally, we had lower-than-budgeted catastrophe losses and favorable prior year reserve developments, which increased operating earnings by $21 million or $0.02 per share.
In total, notable items included operating earnings were $828 million or $0.73 per share.
Turning to our bottom line results. Third quarter net income was $1.2 billion or $1.06 per share. Net income was $492 million higher than operating expenses, primarily because of derivative and investment portfolio net gains. The derivative net gains were driven by lower interest rates and strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain currencies. The investment portfolio net gains were mainly the result of real estate sales.
The difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter included a favorable impact of $568 million related to asymmetrical and noneconomic accounting after tax. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, other than FCTA was $51.11 as of September 30, up 3% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $42.21 as of September 30, up 6% year-over-year.
With respect to third quarter margins, underwriting primarily in the U.S. was less favorable than prior year quarter by $0.03 per share after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Retail Life & Other and property and casualty were the primary drivers of the year-over-year result. Retail Life's interest adjusted benefit ratio was 53.4%, excluding a 4% point impact from the actual assumption review. The ratio was less favorable than in prior year quarter of 51.0% on a comparable basis but within the expected range of 50% to 55%. Average net claims the large face policies were higher than the prior year quarter but within the normal range of expectations. 
The Group Life mortality ratio was 86.1% or toward the low end of the expected annual range of 85% to 90%. The ratio is favorable to the prior year quarter of 87.8% due to better claims experience. 
The Non-Medical Health interest adjusted loss ratio was 80.7%, approximately in line with the prior year quarter of 80.5% and within the targeted range of 77% to 82%.
In property and casualty, the combined ratio including catastrophes was 90.9% of Retail and 97.7% in group. The combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 84.0% in Retail and 92.7% in group. Overall, P&C underwriting was unfavorable versus the prior year quarter. We experienced higher noncatastrophe claim costs primarily due to higher frequency and severity in our auto business as well as higher catastrophes.
Turning to investment margins. The average of the 4 U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 202 basis points in the quarter, down 28 basis points year-over-year. Pretax variable investment income was $267 million, down $157 million versus the prior year quarter due to weak hedge fund performance and lower prepayment income. Product spreads excluding variable investment income were 172 basis points, down 13 basis points year-over-year. Lower core yields accounted for most of this decline as a result of the low interest rate environment.
With regard to expenses. The operating expense ratio was 24.2% unfavorable to prior year quarter of 23.0%. There was an interest-related component of the noncash tax charge that flowed through expenses. Excluding this item, the operating expense ratio was 21.4% or 160 basis points better than the prior year, primarily driven by strong pension closeout sales.
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $523 million, down 33% versus the prior year quarter and down 10% after adjusting for notable items in both periods.
Life & Other reported operating earnings of $183 million, down 50% versus the prior year quarter and down 14% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were lower expense margins, less favorable underwriting primarily in P&C and lower recurring investment income.
Life & Other PFOs were $2.1 billion, down 3% year-over-year as growth in the open block was more than offset by runoff of the closed block.
Core Retail Life sales were up 36% year-over-year, primarily driven by whole and Term Life.
Annuities reported operating earnings of $340 million, down 19% versus the prior year quarter and down 8% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were less favorable [indiscernible] market impact, higher expenses and taxes. The separate account return was negative 6% in the quarter. Total annuity sales were $2.4 billion in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year. We continue to see good momentum with our indexed length annuity shield level selector, and we expect this product to exceed $1 billion in sales this year. Also, our new VA guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider, FlexChoice, continues to gain acceptance in the market and drove VA sales to $1.8 billion this quarter, an increase of 15% year-over-year.
Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits, or GVWB, we reported operating earnings of $238 million, down 1% versus the prior year quarter and essentially flat after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Business growth in the quarter was offset by less favorable underwriting in P&C, primarily in the auto business. GVWB PFOs were $4.4 billion, up 2% year-over-year. Sales were down 12% year-over-year as we continue to see an impact from increased competition in life and. Sales of voluntary products increased 24% due to growth in property and casualty.
Corporate Benefit Funding, or CBF, reported operating earnings of $326 million, down 17% versus the prior year quarter and down 13% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key driver was lower investment margins. CBF PFOs were $1.7 billion, up significantly year-over-year due to strong pension closeout sales in the quarter. Excluding closeouts, PFOs were down 15% due to lower structured settlement sales.
Latin America reported operating earnings of $176 million, up 44% from the prior year quarter and 100% on a constant currency basis. After adjusting for the notable items in both periods, primarily Chile taxes, Latin America operating earnings were down 4% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were less favorable underwriting and unfavorable market performance, partially offset by growth in the region.
U.S. direct, which is included in Latin America's result, had an operating loss of $7 million versus $15 million loss in the prior year quarter, reflecting lower expenses. Latin America PFOs were $940 million, down 18% and essentially unchanged on a constant currency basis as growth in Provida and Argentina was offset by lower single premium immediate annuity sales in Chile. Total Latin America sales increased 3% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to direct marketing across the region, partially offset by lower sales in Mexico and single premium annuity sales in Chile.
Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $338 million, up 9% from the prior year quarter and up 26% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 22% on a constant currency basis, driven by favorable business growth, $21 million in investment income from the loan sale and an unusual low tax rate. Asia PFOs were $2.1 billion, down 13% from the prior year quarter but up 3% on a constant currency basis driven by higher A&H in Japan. Asia sales were down 10% on a constant currency basis due to 2 large group cases in Australia in the prior year quarter. Excluding these cases, sales were up 6%. The highlight in the quarter was a 23% increase in Japan A&H sales as we continue to benefit from a refurbished product portfolio.
EMEA operating earnings were $66 million, down 15% year-over-year but up 14% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 25% on a constant currency basis driven by business growth, particularly in the Gulf and the U.K. and favorable tax items. EMEA PFOs were $618 million, down 15% from the prior period and down 1% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact from the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting in the prior year quarter, PFOs were up 4%. Total EMEA sales declined 8% due to strong employee benefits sales in the Middle East and the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting in the prior year quarter. Adjusting for these items, sales were up 3% driven by A&H, particularly -- partially offset by a lower than expected life and retirement sales.
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.5 billion at September 30. The decrease from the previous quarter was driven primarily by the payment of our quarterly common dividend, interest expense and share repurchases.
Turning to our capital position. We reported U.S. RBC ratios annually, so we do not have an update for the third quarter. For Japan, our solvency margin was 959% as of the second quarter of 2015, which is the latest public data. For U.S. insurance companies, preliminary third-quarter statutory results are an operating loss of approximately $900 million and a net loss of approximately $700 million. As previously disclosed, on a statutory basis, the noncash tax charge was $911 million in the quarter. Of this charge, $972 million went to the statutory earnings and $119 million directly into surplus. In addition, earnings were negatively impacted by the stock market decline in the third quarter. Our strategy is to underhedge for smaller market moves and accept the resulting volatility while ensuring we have sufficient hedges to protect against extreme shocks. We estimate our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $29 billion as of September 30, which was comparable to December 31. 
In conclusion, third quarter operating earnings had several notable items that negatively impacted results and market factors were unfavorable relative to the prior year. However, quarterly volatility is to be expected. While we short of analyst expectations in the third quarter, we exceeded expectations in the first 2 quarters of the year. We are striving to create long-term sustainable growth and value, and improvement in our free cash flow generation and material increase in distributions to our shareholders highlight this commitment.
And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions."

But the goal, clearly, is to raise the number and we're looking at all of our businesses by product, by geography, by customer. There's a great deal of very granular analysis that's ongoing. And we're looking at a number of factors as we think of our businesses, including quicker paybacks on our products. So the goal here is to improve free cash flow. And I should mention that companies that have undergone this process in the past and primarily in Europe took a number of years to go through this process. We are trying to condense that to a shorter period of time, but it's not an exercise that one could go through in a couple of quarters. So we'll have more to say about it clearly next year. But you can be assured that we're working very hard on driving higher free cash flow ratio. And as we learn things along the way here with our analysis, we are making adjustments on an ongoing basis."

And as you change your assumptions, that tends to be immediate, of course, on your DAC amortization. There's also a U.S. GAAP plus recognition testing that if you need to increase those, that's done over time. What I had said was I didn't expect to change assumptions immediately to go right down to flat 2% forever would take some time for to change our view on that as the worldwide might change. Because for 10-year Treasury's to remain at 2% forever means there's no inflation or very little growth in the U.S. economy. We don't believe long-term that, that is the case but we now believe it will take a lot longer to get there from where we are today. So that's the assumption change. And as I said, the calculations we have done are consistent with the prior year guidance that I've given."

So obviously, where interest rates go long-term is very important for us, how we price, how we think and how we account for our business. We've spent a lot of time thinking about is 4.5 still the correct long long-term assumption. And when I say long term, we are putting liabilities in the books today that may last for 100 years given life expectancies of young people. So it's a very long-term assumption. So that we think about that. And the question is how fast will we get there? And I would say currently and we would talk to a lot of economists and academics on this and look to the global economy, I think given this year compared to even a few years ago where there was much more optimism about the recovery of the world economies, we see much slower growth for now and for the foreseeable future. And that's why we put a longer slope going out on the treasury rate, which is the risk-free rate. When it comes to credit spreads, we really normalize those over the entire credit cycle. And the fact they're up in the quarter or down in the quarter doesn't really impact our thinking over a very long-term cycle. And we study credit spreads over decades, and that's how we set these long-term assumptions. And we're lucky we have experience of credit cycles over decades and have very good experience in this.

Last night, we reported third quarter operating earnings per share of $0.62, which included a preannounced noncash charge of $0.70 per share related to the tax treatment of a wholly owned U.K.-based investment subsidiary. Adjusted for this and other notable items, operating earnings per share were $1.36 in the quarter, which compares to $1.51 on the same basis in the prior year period. 
Adjusted for notable items, operating return on equity was 10.7%, intangible ROE was 13.1% in the quarter. While operating EPS adjusted for notable items were down this quarter, our 9-month results on the same basis were up 3%, with an operating ROE of 11.5% and intangible ROE of 14.2%.
Macroeconomic factors, foreign currency, equity markets and interest rates explain the year-over-year decline in third quarter operating earnings per share adjusted for notable items. Broad-based strength in the U.S. dollar reduced operating earnings from international businesses by $0.09 per share, with significant weakness in the Mexican and Chilean pesos, the Aussie dollar and the euro.
Equity market performance relative to the prior year quarter hurt operating earnings by $0.04 per share. Most of the negative impact was in retail annuities, but poor equity market performance also hurt the co-investment-related earnings from Provida AFP.
The persistent low interest rate environment remains challenging and reduced operating earnings adjusted for notable items by $0.03 per share relative to the third quarter of last year. Investment margins have been resilient in recent years as a result of affected asset liability management, low interest rate hedges and variable investment income. However, we face ongoing headwinds from new money yields that are 100 to 150 basis points below the portfolio yield and from the gradual expiration of derivative protection.
From a balance sheet standpoint, we believe low interest rates are a manageable risk. For example, we completed our annual actuarial assumption review in the third quarter, and the negative impact from low rates on net income was less than $180 million. A key driver of this charge was an assumption change on how long it will take for the 10-year Treasury yield to reach a normalized level. We are now assuming it takes 11 years for the 10-year Treasury yield to increase to our normalized assumption of 4.5% versus 3 years previously.
Turning to regulatory issues. We recently received the clearest indication to date regarding the Federal Reserve's thinking on capital rules for federally regulated insurance companies. In a speech delivered in late September, Federal Reserve Board Governor Dan Tarullo commented on the importance of the liability side of an insurance company's balance sheet when constructing capital rules. He said, ""Traditional insurance liabilities argue for lower capital programs than might be required for a hypothetical bank holding a similar portfolio of assets."" These are welcome comments made possible by the enactment of the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act in December of last year.
At the same time, Governor Tarullo said the balance sheets of many large life insurers contain liabilities that he does not consider traditional. Our takeaway is that while the Fed clearly recognizes the difference between the bank business model and the insurance business model, we still need to see draft capital rules before we can draw any firm conclusions about the impact on our business.
On a parallel track, international regulators are developing capital rules for global systemically important insurers. Here, too, the news is mixed. On October 5, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors released its proposal for higher loss absorbency capital requirements or HLA.
While MetLife holds capital comfortably above the levels prescribed by the IAIS, we have 2 concerns with the methodology. The first is that the required capital levels in the international framework are procyclical and potentially volatile because they are based on a mark-to-market approach that ignores the ability of insurers to hold assets for the long term.
The second is that the IAIS proposes to apply higher capital charges to so-called nontraditional noninsurance activities. Certain products with guarantees, such as variable annuities, are deemed nontraditional while other products with similar guarantees sold by competitors elsewhere in the world are deemed traditional. This highlights the risk that MetLife has consistently identified in determining what is systemic, that regulators will inadvertently pick winners and losers in the life insurance industry.
The good news is that the IAIS has said the higher loss absorbency rules will be subject to revision before the target effective date of 2019. In fact, the IAIS is launching a review this month of the definition of nontraditional insurance and has said that any changes will flow through to the HLA rules.
Another regulatory issue MetLife is following closely is the Department of Labor's proposed fiduciary rule. As drafted, the rule would make it significantly more difficult for life insurance companies to sell variable annuities. MetLife has shared its concerns with the DOL in comment letters, and the majority of members in both the House and Senate had asked the department to make changes to the rule. 
In addition, several members of Congress are beginning work on a legislative alternative to the DOL proposal, which underscores the growing awareness that the proposal will harm consumers by reducing choice and limiting access to financial education and investment advice.
I would now like to comment on cash distributions to shareholders. As you know, on September 22, we increased our share repurchase authorization from $261 million to $1 billion. We are comfortable with this authorization given our current capital position, which we continue to maintain above historical levels because of uncertain capital rules. Since the announcement, we have repurchased $261 million of stock, including $107 million in the third quarter, and we plan to remain an opportunistic buyer of our shares. 
In the first 9 months of 2015, our total payout to shareholders was $2.3 billion, with roughly an even split between share repurchases and dividends. This total payout equals approximately half of our 9-month operating earnings adjusted for notable items and is in line with our guidance of a 45% to 55% ratio of free cash flow to operating earnings.
MetLife philosophy remains unchanged. Excess capital belongs to our shareholders. In my annual letter to shareholders this past March, I said that free cash flow generation has become an enterprisewide imperative for MetLife, one that will inform all of our major business decisions in the months and years ahead. As mentioned during our second quarter earnings call, we have undertaken a granular analysis of the cash and capital characteristics of our business. This ongoing work is helping us improve our capital allocation process, which we expect will drive more value for shareholders over time.
In closing this morning, I want to provide an update on the management structure of our Americas region. MetLife is taking a deliberative approach to find the right leadership for the Americas. While our search continues, we have named Eric Steigerwalt as interim Head of the U.S. Business reporting to me. In addition to Retail, Eric will oversee our other U.S. businesses, Group, Voluntary/Worksite Benefits, Corporate Benefit Funding and U.S. Direct. Oscar Schmidt will continue in his role as Head of our Latin America business, also reporting to me. Both are strong leaders focused on generating long-term value for MetLife's shareholders.
I will now turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?"

Today, I'll cover our third quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. 
Operating earnings in the third quarter were $705 million or $0.62 per share. This quarter included 5 notable items, which were highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our Quarterly Financial Supplement or QFS. 
First, we have previously announced -- we had a previously announced noncash charge of $792 million or $0.70 per share related to the tax treatment of a wholly owned U.K. investment subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. 
Second, as a result of our annual actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments, we had an after-tax charge to operating earnings of $92 million or $0.08 per share. The total after-tax charge to net income was $210 million. Retail accounted for $228 million, partially offset by modest positive earnings impact in Asia and EMEA. The impact in Retail was mainly due to the change in our assumptions to reflect the persistent low interest rate environment and our current view that rates will remain below normal levels longer than we had originally assumed. 
As you heard from Steve, we are now assuming that it takes 11 years for the 10-year Treasury yield to reach 4.5% versus 3 years previously. We've also lowered our long-term earned rate assumption for Annuities from 5.25% to 5%. Our long-term earned rate assumption for life insurance is unchanged at 5.75%, and our long-term separate account return assumption remains 7.25%.
Third, variable investment income was $174 million after taxes and DAC, which is $37 million or $0.03 per share, below the bottom end of our 2015 quarterly guidance range.
Fourth, we have favorable onetime tax items in the Americas, which increased operating earnings by $72 million or $0.06 per share.
Finally, we had lower-than-budgeted catastrophe losses and favorable prior year reserve development, which increased operating earnings by $21 million or $0.02 per share.
In total, notable items included in operating earnings were $828 million or $0.73 per share.
Turning to our bottom line results. Third quarter net income was $1.2 billion or $1.06 per share. Net income was $492 million higher than operating expenses primarily because of derivative and investment portfolio net gains. The derivative net gains were driven by lower interest rates and strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain currencies. The investment portfolio net gains were mainly the result of real estate sales.
The difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter included a favorable impact of $568 million related to asymmetrical and noneconomic accounting after tax. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, other than FCTA, was $51.11 as of September 30, up 3% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $42.21 as of September 30, up 6% year-over-year.
With respect to third quarter margins, underwriting primarily in the U.S. was less favorable than prior year quarter by $0.03 per share after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Retail Life & Other and Property & Casualty were the primary drivers of the year-over-year result. Retail Life's interest adjusted benefit ratio was 53.4%, excluding a 4% point impact from the actuarial assumption review. The ratio was less favorable than in prior year quarter of 51.0% on a comparable basis but within the expected range of 50% to 55%. Average net claims from the large face policies were higher than the prior year quarter but within the normal range of expectations. 
The group life mortality ratio was 86.1% or toward the low end of the expected annual range of 85% to 90%. The ratio is favorable to the prior year quarter of 87.8% due to better claims experience. 
The Non-Medical Health interest adjusted loss ratio was 80.7%, approximately in line with the prior year quarter of 80.5% and within the targeted range of 77% to 82%.
In Property & Casualty, the combined ratio including catastrophes was 90.9% in Retail and 97.7% in group. The combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 84.0% in Retail and 92.7% in group. Overall, P&C underwriting was unfavorable versus the prior year quarter. We experienced higher noncatastrophe claim costs primarily due to higher frequency and severity in our auto business as well as higher catastrophes.
Turning to investment margins. The average of the 4 U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 202 basis points in the quarter, down 28 basis points year-over-year. Pretax variable investment income was $267 million, down $157 million versus the prior year quarter due to weak hedge fund performance and lower prepayment income. Product spreads excluding variable investment income were 172 basis points, down 13 basis points year-over-year. Lower core yields accounted for most of this decline as a result of the low interest rate environment.
With regard to expenses. The operating expense ratio was 24.2%, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 23.0%. There was an interest-related component of the noncash tax charge that flowed through expenses. Excluding this item, the operating expense ratio was 21.4% or 160 basis points better than the prior year, primarily driven by strong pension closeout sales.
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $523 million, down 33% versus the prior year quarter and down 10% after adjusting for notable items in both periods.
Life & Other reported operating earnings of $183 million, down 50% versus the prior year quarter and down 14% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were lower expense margins, less favorable underwriting primarily in P&C and lower recurring investment income.
Life & Other PFOs were $2.1 billion, down 3% year-over-year as growth in the open block was more than offset by runoff of the closed block.
Core Retail life sales were up 36% year-over-year, primarily driven by Whole and Term Life.
Annuities reported operating earnings of $340 million, down 19% versus the prior year quarter and down 8% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were less favorable initial market impact, higher expenses and taxes. The separate account return was negative 6% in the quarter. Total annuity sales were $2.4 billion in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year. We continue to see good momentum with our indexed length annuity Shield Level Selector, and we expect this product to exceed $1 billion in sales this year. Also, our new VA guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider, FlexChoice, continues to gain acceptance in the market and drove VA sales to $1.8 billion this quarter, an increase of 15% year-over-year.
Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits or GVWB reported operating earnings of $238 million, down 1% versus the prior year quarter and essentially flat after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Business growth in the quarter was offset by less favorable underwriting in P&C, primarily in the auto business. GVWB PFOs were $4.4 billion, up 2% year-over-year. Sales were down 12% year-over-year as we continue to see an impact from increased competition in life and dental. Sales of voluntary products increased 24% due to growth in Property & Casualty.
Corporate Benefit Funding or CBF reported operating earnings of $326 million, down 17% versus the prior year quarter and down 13% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key driver was lower investment margins. CBF PFOs were $1.7 billion, up significantly year-over-year due to strong pension closeout sales in the quarter. Excluding closeouts, PFOs were down 15% due to lower structured settlement sales.
Latin America reported operating earnings of $176 million, up 44% from the prior year quarter and 100% on a constant currency basis. After adjusting for notable items in both periods, primarily Chile taxes, Latin America operating earnings were down 4% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were less favorable underwriting and unfavorable market performance, partially offset by growth in the region.
U.S. Direct, which is included in Latin America's results, had an operating loss of $7 million versus $15 million loss in the prior year quarter, reflecting lower expenses. Latin America PFOs were $940 million, down 18% and essentially unchanged on a constant currency basis as growth in Provida and Argentina was offset by lower single premium immediate annuity sales in Chile. Total Latin America sales increased 3% on a constant currency basis primarily due to direct marketing across the region, partially offset by lower foreign sales in Mexico and single premium immediate annuity sales in Chile.
Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $338 million, up 9% from the prior year quarter and up 26% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 22% on a constant currency basis, driven by favorable business growth, $21 million in investment income from the loan sale and an unusual low tax rate. 
Asia PFOs were $2.1 billion, down 13% from the prior year quarter but up 3% on a constant currency basis, driven by higher A&H in Japan. Asia sales were down 10% on a constant currency basis due to 2 large group cases in Australia in the prior year quarter. Excluding these cases, sales were up 6%. A highlight in the quarter was a 23% increase in Japan A&H sales as we continue to benefit from a refurbished product portfolio.
EMEA operating earnings were $66 million, down 15% year-over-year but up 14% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 25% on a constant currency basis driven by business growth, particularly in the Gulf and the U.K. and favorable tax items. EMEA PFOs were $618 million, down 15% from the prior year period and down 1% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact from the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting in the prior year quarter, PFOs were up 4%. 
Total EMEA sales declined 8% due to strong employee benefit sales in the Middle East and the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting in the prior year quarter. Adjusting for these items, sales were up 3% driven by A&H, particularly -- partially offset by a lower-than-expected life and retirement sales.
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.5 billion at September 30. The decrease from the previous quarter was driven primarily by the payment of our quarterly common dividend, interest expense and share repurchases.
Turning to our capital position. We reported U.S. RBC ratios annually, so we do not have an update for the third quarter. For Japan, our solvency margin was 959% as of the second quarter of 2015, which is the latest public data. For U.S. insurance companies, preliminary third quarter statutory results are an operating loss of approximately $900 million and a net loss of approximately $700 million. As previously disclosed, on a statutory basis, the noncash tax charge was $911 million in the quarter. Of this charge, $972 million (sic) [$792 million] went to the statutory earnings and $119 million directly into surplus. 
In addition, earnings were negatively impacted by the stock market decline in the third quarter. Our strategy is to underhedge for smaller market moves and accept the resulting volatility while ensuring we have sufficient hedges to protect against extreme shocks. We estimate our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $29 billion as of September 30, which was comparable to December 31. 
In conclusion, third quarter operating earnings had several notable items that negatively impacted results, and market factors were unfavorable relative to the prior year. However, quarterly volatility is to be expected. While we were short of analyst expectations in the third quarter, we exceeded expectations in the first 2 quarters of the year. We are striving to create long-term sustainable growth and value, and improvement in our free cash flow generation and material increase in distributions to our shareholders highlight this commitment.
And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions."

But again, it's uncertain, and we don't know how this will all play out. So it -- right now, it's a little bit of a judgment call. And we are, in this year, looking to return to shareholders the free cash flow that the business generated. I think if nothing changes in the external world, that would be the pace we'd be on going forward in 2016 as well.

And so my question is, at least it strikes me that way. And so my question is, is this something that you have decided recently that you've been thinking about for a while? And given that interest rates have actually risen this year, treasury yields are flat, but credit spreads have widened, as you think about what has happened in the world, what has prompted you to make what seems to be such a dramatic change in your outlook for interest rates?"

So obviously, where interest rates go long term is very important for us in how we price, how we think and how we account for our business. We've spent a lot of time thinking about, is 4.5% still the correct long long-term assumption? And when I say long term, we're putting liabilities on the books today that may last for 100 years given life expectancies of young people. So it's a very long-term assumption. So that -- we think about that. And the question is, how fast will we get there? And I would say currently, and we would talk to a lot of economists and academics on this and look to the global economy, I think given this year compared to even a few years ago where there was much more optimism about the recovery of the world economies, we see a much slower growth for now and for the foreseeable future. And that's why we've put a longer slope going out on the treasury rate, which is the risk-free rate. When it comes to credit spreads, we really normalize those over the entire credit cycle. And the fact they're up in a quarter or down in a quarter doesn't really impact our thinking over a very long-term cycle. And we study credit spreads over decades, and that's how we set these long-term assumptions. And we're lucky we have experience of credit cycles over decades and have very good experience in this. So that's sort of our thinking behind how we set these assumptions."

Last night, we reported third quarter operating earnings per share of $0.62, which included a preannounced noncash charge of $0.70 per share related to the tax treatment of a wholly owned U.K.-based investment subsidiary. Adjusted for this and other notable items, operating earnings per share were $1.36 in the quarter, which compares to $1.51 on the same basis in the prior year period. 
Adjusted for notable items, operating return on equity was 10.7%, intangible ROE was 13.1% in the quarter. While operating EPS adjusted for notable items were down this quarter, our 9-month results on the same basis were up 3%, with an operating ROE of 11.5% and tangible ROE of 14.2%.
Macroeconomic factors, foreign currency, equity markets and interest rates explain the year-over-year decline in third quarter operating earnings per share adjusted for notable items. Broad-based strength in the U.S. dollar reduced operating earnings from international businesses by $0.09 per share, with significant weakness in the Mexican and Chilean pesos, the Aussie dollar and the euro.
Equity market performance relative to the prior year quarter hurt operating earnings by $0.04 per share. Most of the negative impact was in retail annuities, but poor equity market performance also hurt the co-investment-related earnings from Provida AFP.
The persistent low interest rate environment remains challenging and reduced operating earnings adjusted for notable items by $0.03 per share relative to the third quarter of last year. Investment margins have been resilient in recent years as a result of affected asset liability management, low interest rate hedges and variable investment income. However, we face ongoing headwinds from new money yields that are 100 to 150 basis points below the portfolio yield and from the gradual expiration of derivative protection.
From a balance sheet standpoint, we believe low interest rates are a manageable risk. For example, we completed our annual actuarial assumption review in the third quarter, and the negative impact from low rates on net income was less than $180 million. A key driver of this charge was an assumption change on how long it will take for the 10-year Treasury yield to reach a normalized level. We are now assuming it takes 11 years for the 10-year Treasury yield to increase to our normalized assumption of 4.5% versus 3 years previously.
Turning to regulatory issues. We recently received the clearest indication to date regarding the Federal Reserve's thinking on capital rules for federally regulated insurance companies. In a speech delivered in late September, Federal Reserve Board Governor Dan Tarullo commented on the importance of the liability side of an insurance company's balance sheet when constructing capital rules. He said, ""Traditional insurance liabilities argue for lower capital programs than might be required for a hypothetical bank holding a similar portfolio of assets."" These are welcome comments made possible by the enactment of the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act in December of last year.
At the same time, Governor Tarullo said the balance sheets of many large life insurers contain liabilities that he does not consider traditional. Our takeaway is that while the Fed clearly recognizes the difference between the bank business model and the insurance business model, we still need to see draft capital rules before we can draw any firm conclusions about the impact on our business.
On a parallel track, international regulators are developing capital rules for global systemically important insurers. Here, too, the news is mixed. On October 5, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors released its proposal for higher loss absorbency capital requirements or HLA.
While MetLife holds capital comfortably above the levels prescribed by the IAIS, we have 2 concerns with the methodology. The first is that the required capital levels in the international framework are procyclical and potentially volatile because they are based on a mark-to-market approach that ignores the ability of insurers to hold assets for the long term.
The second is that the IAIS proposes to apply higher capital charges to so-called nontraditional noninsurance activities. Certain products with guarantees, such as variable annuities, are deemed nontraditional while other products with similar guarantees sold by competitors elsewhere in the world are deemed traditional. This highlights the risk that MetLife has consistently identified in determining what is systemic, that regulators will inadvertently pick winners and losers in the life insurance industry.
The good news is that the IAIS has said the higher loss absorbency rules will be subject to revision before the target effective date of 2019. In fact, the IAIS is launching a review this month of the definition of nontraditional insurance and has said that any changes will flow through to the HLA rules.
Another regulatory issue MetLife is following closely is the Department of Labor's proposed fiduciary rule. As drafted, the rule would make it significantly more difficult for life insurance companies to sell variable annuities. MetLife has shared its concerns with the DOL in comment letters, and the majority of members in both the House and Senate had asked the department to make changes to the rule. 
In addition, several members of Congress are beginning work on a legislative alternative to the DOL proposal, which underscores the growing awareness that the proposal will harm consumers by reducing choice and limiting access to financial education and investment advice.
I would now like to comment on cash distributions to shareholders. As you know, on September 22, we increased our share repurchase authorization from $261 million to $1 billion. We are comfortable with this authorization given our current capital position, which we continue to maintain above historical levels because of uncertain capital rules. Since the announcement, we have repurchased $261 million of stock, including $107 million in the third quarter, and we plan to remain an opportunistic buyer of our shares. 
In the first 9 months of 2015, our total payout to shareholders was $2.3 billion, with roughly an even split between share repurchases and dividends. This total payout equals approximately half of our 9-month operating earnings adjusted for notable items and is in line with our guidance of a 45% to 55% ratio of free cash flow to operating earnings.
MetLife philosophy remains unchanged. Excess capital belongs to our shareholders. In my annual letter to shareholders this past March, I said that free cash flow generation has become an enterprise-wide imperative for MetLife, one that will inform all of our major business decisions in the months and years ahead. As mentioned during our second quarter earnings call, we have undertaken a granular analysis of the cash and capital characteristics of our business. This ongoing work is helping us improve our capital allocation process, which we expect will drive more value for shareholders over time.
In closing this morning, I want to provide an update on the management structure of our Americas region. MetLife is taking a deliberative approach to find the right leadership for the Americas. While our search continues, we have named Eric Steigerwalt as interim Head of the U.S. Business reporting to me. In addition to Retail, Eric will oversee our other U.S. businesses, Group, Voluntary/Worksite Benefits, Corporate Benefit Funding and U.S. Direct. Oscar Schmidt will continue in his role as Head of our Latin America business, also reporting to me. Both are strong leaders focused on generating long-term value for MetLife's shareholders.
I will now turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?"

Today, I'll cover our third quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. 
Operating earnings in the third quarter were $705 million or $0.62 per share. This quarter included 5 notable items, which were highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our Quarterly Financial Supplement or QFS. 
First, we have previously announced -- we had a previously announced noncash charge of $792 million or $0.70 per share related to the tax treatment of a wholly owned U.K. investment subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. 
Second, as a result of our annual actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments, we had an after-tax charge to operating earnings of $92 million or $0.08 per share. The total after-tax charge to net income was $210 million. Retail accounted for $228 million, partially offset by modest positive earnings impact in Asia and EMEA. The impact in Retail was mainly due to the change in our assumptions to reflect the persistent low interest rate environment and our current view that rates will remain below normal levels longer than we had originally assumed. 
As you heard from Steve, we are now assuming that it takes 11 years for the 10-year Treasury yield to reach 4.5% versus 3 years previously. We've also lowered our long-term earned rate assumption for Annuities from 5.25% to 5%. Our long-term earned rate assumption for life insurance is unchanged at 5.75%, and our long-term separate account return assumption remains 7.25%.
Third, variable investment income was $174 million after taxes and DAC, which is $37 million or $0.03 per share, below the bottom end of our 2015 quarterly guidance range.
Fourth, we have favorable onetime tax items in the Americas, which increased operating earnings by $72 million or $0.06 per share.
Finally, we had lower-than-budgeted catastrophe losses and favorable prior year reserve development, which increased operating earnings by $21 million or $0.02 per share.
In total, notable items included in operating earnings were $828 million or $0.73 per share.
Turning to our bottom line results. Third quarter net income was $1.2 billion or $1.06 per share. Net income was $492 million higher than operating expenses primarily because of derivative and investment portfolio net gains. The derivative net gains were driven by lower interest rates and strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain currencies. The investment portfolio net gains were mainly the result of real estate sales.
The difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter included a favorable impact of $568 million related to asymmetrical and noneconomic accounting after tax. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, other than FCTA, was $51.11 as of September 30, up 3% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $42.21 as of September 30, up 6% year-over-year.
With respect to third quarter margins, underwriting primarily in the U.S. was less favorable than prior year quarter by $0.03 per share after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Retail Life & Other and Property & Casualty were the primary drivers of the year-over-year result. Retail Life's interest adjusted benefit ratio was 53.4%, excluding a 4% point impact from the actuarial assumption review. The ratio was less favorable than in prior year quarter of 51.0% on a comparable basis but within the expected range of 50% to 55%. Average net claims from the large face policies were higher than the prior year quarter but within the normal range of expectations. 
The group life mortality ratio was 86.1% or toward the low end of the expected annual range of 85% to 90%. The ratio is favorable to the prior year quarter of 87.8% due to better claims experience. 
The Non-Medical Health interest adjusted loss ratio was 80.7%, approximately in line with the prior year quarter of 80.5% and within the targeted range of 77% to 82%.
In Property & Casualty, the combined ratio including catastrophes was 90.9% in Retail and 97.7% in group. The combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 84.0% in Retail and 92.7% in group. Overall, P&C underwriting was unfavorable versus the prior year quarter. We experienced higher noncatastrophe claim costs primarily due to higher frequency and severity in our auto business as well as higher catastrophes.
Turning to investment margins. The average of the 4 U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 202 basis points in the quarter, down 28 basis points year-over-year. Pretax variable investment income was $267 million, down $157 million versus the prior year quarter due to weak hedge fund performance and lower prepayment income. Product spreads excluding variable investment income were 172 basis points, down 13 basis points year-over-year. Lower core yields accounted for most of this decline as a result of the low interest rate environment.
With regard to expenses. The operating expense ratio was 24.2%, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 23.0%. There was an interest-related component of the noncash tax charge that flowed through expenses. Excluding this item, the operating expense ratio was 21.4% or 160 basis points better than the prior year, primarily driven by strong pension closeout sales.
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $523 million, down 33% versus the prior year quarter and down 10% after adjusting for notable items in both periods.
Life & Other reported operating earnings of $183 million, down 50% versus the prior year quarter and down 14% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were lower expense margins, less favorable underwriting primarily in P&C and lower recurring investment income.
Life & Other PFOs were $2.1 billion, down 3% year-over-year as growth in the open block was more than offset by runoff of the closed block.
Core Retail life sales were up 36% year-over-year, primarily driven by Whole and Term Life.
Annuities reported operating earnings of $340 million, down 19% versus the prior year quarter and down 8% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were less favorable initial market impact, higher expenses and taxes. The separate account return was negative 6% in the quarter. Total annuity sales were $2.4 billion in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year. We continue to see good momentum with our indexed length annuity Shield Level Selector, and we expect this product to exceed $1 billion in sales this year. Also, our new VA guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider, FlexChoice, continues to gain acceptance in the market and drove VA sales to $1.8 billion this quarter, an increase of 15% year-over-year.
Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits or GVWB reported operating earnings of $238 million, down 1% versus the prior year quarter and essentially flat after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Business growth in the quarter was offset by less favorable underwriting in P&C, primarily in the auto business. GVWB PFOs were $4.4 billion, up 2% year-over-year. Sales were down 12% year-over-year as we continue to see an impact from increased competition in life and dental. Sales of voluntary products increased 24% due to growth in Property & Casualty.
Corporate Benefit Funding or CBF reported operating earnings of $326 million, down 17% versus the prior year quarter and down 13% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key driver was lower investment margins. CBF PFOs were $1.7 billion, up significantly year-over-year due to strong pension closeout sales in the quarter. Excluding closeouts, PFOs were down 15% due to lower structured settlement sales.
Latin America reported operating earnings of $176 million, up 44% from the prior year quarter and 100% on a constant currency basis. After adjusting for notable items in both periods, primarily Chile taxes, Latin America operating earnings were down 4% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were less favorable underwriting and unfavorable market performance, partially offset by growth in the region.
U.S. Direct, which is included in Latin America's results, had an operating loss of $7 million versus $15 million loss in the prior year quarter, reflecting lower expenses. Latin America PFOs were $940 million, down 18% and essentially unchanged on a constant currency basis as growth in Provida and Argentina was offset by lower single premium immediate annuity sales in Chile. Total Latin America sales increased 3% on a constant currency basis primarily due to direct marketing across the region, partially offset by lower foreign sales in Mexico and single premium immediate annuity sales in Chile.
Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $338 million, up 9% from the prior year quarter and up 26% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 22% on a constant currency basis, driven by favorable business growth, $21 million in investment income from the loan sale and an unusual low tax rate. 
Asia PFOs were $2.1 billion, down 13% from the prior year quarter but up 3% on a constant currency basis, driven by higher A&H in Japan. Asia sales were down 10% on a constant currency basis due to 2 large group cases in Australia in the prior year quarter. Excluding these cases, sales were up 6%. A highlight in the quarter was a 23% increase in Japan A&H sales as we continue to benefit from a refurbished product portfolio.
EMEA operating earnings were $66 million, down 15% year-over-year but up 14% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 25% on a constant currency basis driven by business growth, particularly in the Gulf and the U.K. and favorable tax items. EMEA PFOs were $618 million, down 15% from the prior year period and down 1% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact from the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting in the prior year quarter, PFOs were up 4%. 
Total EMEA sales declined 8% due to strong employee benefit sales in the Middle East and the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting in the prior year quarter. Adjusting for these items, sales were up 3% driven by A&H, particularly -- partially offset by a lower-than-expected life and retirement sales.
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.5 billion at September 30. The decrease from the previous quarter was driven primarily by the payment of our quarterly common dividend, interest expense and share repurchases.
Turning to our capital position. We reported U.S. RBC ratios annually, so we do not have an update for the third quarter. For Japan, our solvency margin was 959% as of the second quarter of 2015, which is the latest public data. For U.S. insurance companies, preliminary third quarter statutory results are an operating loss of approximately $900 million and a net loss of approximately $700 million. As previously disclosed, on a statutory basis, the noncash tax charge was $911 million in the quarter. Of this charge, $972 million (sic) [$792 million] went to the statutory earnings and $119 million directly into surplus. 
In addition, earnings were negatively impacted by the stock market decline in the third quarter. Our strategy is to underhedge for smaller market moves and accept the resulting volatility while ensuring we have sufficient hedges to protect against extreme shocks. We estimate our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $29 billion as of September 30, which was comparable to December 31. 
In conclusion, third quarter operating earnings had several notable items that negatively impacted results, and market factors were unfavorable relative to the prior year. However, quarterly volatility is to be expected. While we were short of analyst expectations in the third quarter, we exceeded expectations in the first 2 quarters of the year. We are striving to create long-term sustainable growth and value, and improvement in our free cash flow generation and material increase in distributions to our shareholders highlight this commitment.
And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions."

We've got a tough comparison coming up against the fourth quarter of 2014, but I think overall, the prior guidance we've given you in terms of sales at third sector was that we would grow it mid- to high single digits this year. Given the performance you've had so far, we can lift that guidance now to a full year out and move about 10% to 12%. So the new products are progressing really well. They give customers good choice, they are simple products, they've got segmented pricing, and all 4 of our key distribution channels are up.

So obviously, where interest rates go long term is very important for us in how we price, how we think and how we account for our business. We've spent a lot of time thinking about, is 4.5% still the correct long long-term assumption?

So that -- we think about that. And the question is, how fast will we get there? And I would say currently, and we would talk to a lot of economists and academics on this and look to the global economy, I think given this year compared to even a few years ago where there was much more optimism about the recovery of the world economies, we see a much slower growth for now and for the foreseeable future. And that's why we've put a longer slope going out on the treasury rate, which is the risk-free rate. When it comes to credit spreads, we really normalize those over the entire credit cycle. And the fact they're up in a quarter or down in a quarter doesn't really impact our thinking over a very long-term cycle. And we study credit spreads over decades, and that's how we set these long-term assumptions. And we're lucky we have experience of credit cycles over decades and have very good experience in this.

Last night, we reported third quarter operating earnings per share of $0.62, which included a preannounced noncash charge of $0.70 per share related to the tax treatment of a wholly owned U.K.-based investment su",1234,"Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported third quarter operating earnings per share of $0.62, which included a preannounced noncash charge of $0.70 per share related to the tax treatment of a wholly owned U.K.-based investment subsidiary. Adjusted for this and other notable items, operating earnings per share were $1.36 in the quarter, which compares to $1.51 on the same basis in the prior year period. 
Adjusted for notable items, operating return on equity was 10.7%, intangible ROE was 13.1% in the quarter. While operating EPS adjusted for notable items were down this quarter, our 9-month results on the same basis were up 3%, with an operating ROE of 11.5% and tangible ROE of 14.2%.
Macroeconomic factors, foreign currency, equity markets and interest rates explain the year-over-year decline in third quarter operating earnings per share adjusted for notable items. Broad-based strength in the U.S. dollar reduced operating earnings from international businesses by $0.09 per share, with significant weakness in the Mexican and Chilean pesos, the Aussie dollar and the euro.
Equity market performance relative to the prior year quarter hurt operating earnings by $0.04 per share. Most of the negative impact was in retail annuities, but poor equity market performance also hurt the co-investment-related earnings from Provida AFP.
The persistent low interest rate environment remains challenging and reduced operating earnings adjusted for notable items by $0.03 per share relative to the third quarter of last year. Investment margins have been resilient in recent years as a result of affected asset liability management, low interest rate hedges and variable investment income. However, we face ongoing headwinds from new money yields that are 100 to 150 basis points below the portfolio yield and from the gradual expiration of derivative protection.
From a balance sheet standpoint, we believe low interest rates are a manageable risk. For example, we completed our annual actuarial assumption review in the third quarter, and the negative impact from low rates on net income was less than $180 million. A key driver of this charge was an assumption change on how long it will take for the 10-year Treasury yield to reach a normalized level. We are now assuming it takes 11 years for the 10-year Treasury yield to increase to our normalized assumption of 4.5% versus 3 years previously.
Turning to regulatory issues. We recently received the clearest indication to date regarding the Federal Reserve's thinking on capital rules for federally regulated insurance companies. In a speech delivered in late September, Federal Reserve Board Governor Dan Tarullo commented on the importance of the liability side of an insurance company's balance sheet when constructing capital rules. He said, ""Traditional insurance liabilities argue for lower capital programs than might be required for a hypothetical bank holding a similar portfolio of assets."" These are welcome comments made possible by the enactment of the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act in December of last year.
At the same time, Governor Tarullo said the balance sheets of many large life insurers contain liabilities that he does not consider traditional. Our takeaway is that while the Fed clearly recognizes the difference between the bank business model and the insurance business model, we still need to see draft capital rules before we can draw any firm conclusions about the impact on our business.
On a parallel track, international regulators are developing capital rules for global systemically important insurers. Here, too, the news is mixed. On October 5, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors released its proposal for higher loss absorbency capital requirements or HLA.
While MetLife holds capital comfortably above the levels prescribed by the IAIS, we have 2 concerns with the methodology. The first is that the required capital levels in the international framework are procyclical and potentially volatile because they are based on a mark-to-market approach that ignores the ability of insurers to hold assets for the long term.
The second is that the IAIS proposes to apply higher capital charges to so-called nontraditional noninsurance activities. Certain products with guarantees, such as variable annuities, are deemed nontraditional while other products with similar guarantees sold by competitors elsewhere in the world are deemed traditional. This highlights the risk that MetLife has consistently identified in determining what is systemic, that regulators will inadvertently pick winners and losers in the life insurance industry.
The good news is that the IAIS has said the higher loss absorbency rules will be subject to revision before the target effective date of 2019. In fact, the IAIS is launching a review this month of the definition of nontraditional insurance and has said that any changes will flow through to the HLA rules.
Another regulatory issue MetLife is following closely is the Department of Labor's proposed fiduciary rule. As drafted, the rule would make it significantly more difficult for life insurance companies to sell variable annuities. MetLife has shared its concerns with the DOL in comment letters, and the majority of members in both the House and Senate had asked the department to make changes to the rule. 
In addition, several members of Congress are beginning work on a legislative alternative to the DOL proposal, which underscores the growing awareness that the proposal will harm consumers by reducing choice and limiting access to financial education and investment advice.
I would now like to comment on cash distributions to shareholders. As you know, on September 22, we increased our share repurchase authorization from $261 million to $1 billion. We are comfortable with this authorization given our current capital position, which we continue to maintain above historical levels because of uncertain capital rules. Since the announcement, we have repurchased $261 million of stock, including $107 million in the third quarter, and we plan to remain an opportunistic buyer of our shares. 
In the first 9 months of 2015, our total payout to shareholders was $2.3 billion, with roughly an even split between share repurchases and dividends. This total payout equals approximately half of our 9-month operating earnings adjusted for notable items and is in line with our guidance of a 45% to 55% ratio of free cash flow to operating earnings.
MetLife philosophy remains unchanged. Excess capital belongs to our shareholders. In my annual letter to shareholders this past March, I said that free cash flow generation has become an enterprise-wide imperative for MetLife, one that will inform all of our major business decisions in the months and years ahead. As mentioned during our second quarter earnings call, we have undertaken a granular analysis of the cash and capital characteristics of our business. This ongoing work is helping us improve our capital allocation process, which we expect will drive more value for shareholders over time.
In closing this morning, I want to provide an update on the management structure of our Americas region. MetLife is taking a deliberative approach to find the right leadership for the Americas. While our search continues, we have named Eric Steigerwalt as interim Head of the U.S. Business reporting to me. In addition to Retail, Eric will oversee our other U.S. businesses, Group, Voluntary/Worksite Benefits, Corporate Benefit Funding and U.S. Direct.

185648,312658497,894404,"MetLife, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2015",2015-11-05,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our third quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights.

Today, I'll cover our third quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. 
Operating earnings in the third quarter were $705 million or $0.62 per share. This quarter included 5 notable items, which were highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our Quarterly Financial Supplement or QFS. 
First, we have previously announced -- we had a previously announced noncash charge of $792 million or $0.70 per share related to the tax treatment of a wholly owned U.K. investment subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. 
Second, as a result of our annual actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments, we had an after-tax charge to operating earnings of $92 million or $0.08 per share. The total after-tax charge to net income was $210 million. Retail accounted for $228 million, partially offset by modest positive earnings impact in Asia and EMEA. The impact in Retail was mainly due to the change in our assumptions to reflect the persistent low interest rate environment and our current view that rates will remain below normal levels longer than we had originally assumed. 
As you heard from Steve, we are now assuming that it takes 11 years for the 10-year Treasury yield to reach 4.5% versus 3 years previously. We've also lowered our long-term earned rate assumption for Annuities from 5.25% to 5%. Our long-term earned rate assumption for life insurance is unchanged at 5.75%, and our long-term separate account return assumption remains 7.25%.
Third, variable investment income was $174 million after taxes and DAC, which is $37 million or $0.03 per share, below the bottom end of our 2015 quarterly guidance range.
Fourth, we have favorable onetime tax items in the Americas, which increased operating earnings by $72 million or $0.06 per share.
Finally, we had lower-than-budgeted catastrophe losses and favorable prior year reserve development, which increased operating earnings by $21 million or $0.02 per share.
In total, notable items included in operating earnings were $828 million or $0.73 per share.
Turning to our bottom line results. Third quarter net income was $1.2 billion or $1.06 per share. Net income was $492 million higher than operating expenses primarily because of derivative and investment portfolio net gains. The derivative net gains were driven by lower interest rates and strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain currencies. The investment portfolio net gains were mainly the result of real estate sales.
The difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter included a favorable impact of $568 million related to asymmetrical and noneconomic accounting after tax. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, other than FCTA, was $51.11 as of September 30, up 3% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $42.21 as of September 30, up 6% year-over-year.
With respect to third quarter margins, underwriting primarily in the U.S. was less favorable than prior year quarter by $0.03 per share after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Retail Life & Other and Property & Casualty were the primary drivers of the year-over-year result. Retail Life's interest adjusted benefit ratio was 53.4%, excluding a 4% point impact from the actuarial assumption review. The ratio was less favorable than in prior year quarter of 51.0% on a comparable basis but within the expected range of 50% to 55%. Average net claims from the large face policies were higher than the prior year quarter but within the normal range of expectations. 
The group life mortality ratio was 86.1% or toward the low end of the expected annual range of 85% to 90%. The ratio is favorable to the prior year quarter of 87.8% due to better claims experience. 
The Non-Medical Health interest adjusted loss ratio was 80.7%, approximately in line with the prior year quarter of 80.5% and within the targeted range of 77% to 82%.
In Property & Casualty, the combined ratio including catastrophes was 90.9% in Retail and 97.7% in group. The combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 84.0% in Retail and 92.7% in group. Overall, P&C underwriting was unfavorable versus the prior year quarter. We experienced higher noncatastrophe claim costs primarily due to higher frequency and severity in our auto business as well as higher catastrophes.
Turning to investment margins. The average of the 4 U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 202 basis points in the quarter, down 28 basis points year-over-year. Pretax variable investment income was $267 million, down $157 million versus the prior year quarter due to weak hedge fund performance and lower prepayment income. Product spreads excluding variable investment income were 172 basis points, down 13 basis points year-over-year. Lower core yields accounted for most of this decline as a result of the low interest rate environment.
With regard to expenses. The operating expense ratio was 24.2%, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 23.0%. There was an interest-related component of the noncash tax charge that flowed through expenses. Excluding this item, the operating expense ratio was 21.4% or 160 basis points better than the prior year, primarily driven by strong pension closeout sales.
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $523 million, down 33% versus the prior year quarter and down 10% after adjusting for notable items in both periods.
Life & Other reported operating earnings of $183 million, down 50% versus the prior year quarter and down 14% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were lower expense margins, less favorable underwriting primarily in P&C and lower recurring investment income.
Life & Other PFOs were $2.1 billion, down 3% year-over-year as growth in the open block was more than offset by runoff of the closed block.
Core Retail life sales were up 36% year-over-year, primarily driven by Whole and Term Life.
Annuities reported operating earnings of $340 million, down 19% versus the prior year quarter and down 8% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were less favorable initial market impact, higher expenses and taxes. The separate account return was negative 6% in the quarter. Total annuity sales were $2.4 billion in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year. We continue to see good momentum with our indexed length annuity Shield Level Selector, and we expect this product to exceed $1 billion in sales this year. Also, our new VA guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider, FlexChoice, continues to gain acceptance in the market and drove VA sales to $1.8 billion this quarter, an increase of 15% year-over-year.
Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits or GVWB reported operating earnings of $238 million, down 1% versus the prior year quarter and essentially flat after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Business growth in the quarter was offset by less favorable underwriting in P&C, primarily in the auto business. GVWB PFOs were $4.4 billion, up 2% year-over-year. Sales were down 12% year-over-year as we continue to see an impact from increased competition in life and dental. Sales of voluntary products increased 24% due to growth in Property & Casualty.
Corporate Benefit Funding or CBF reported operating earnings of $326 million, down 17% versus the prior year quarter and down 13% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key driver was lower investment margins. CBF PFOs were $1.7 billion, up significantly year-over-year due to strong pension closeout sales in the quarter. Excluding closeouts, PFOs were down 15% due to lower structured settlement sales.
Latin America reported operating earnings of $176 million, up 44% from the prior year quarter and 100% on a constant currency basis. After adjusting for notable items in both periods, primarily Chile taxes, Latin America operating earnings were down 4% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were less favorable underwriting and unfavorable market performance, partially offset by growth in the region.
U.S. Direct, which is included in Latin America's results, had an operating loss of $7 million versus $15 million loss in the prior year quarter, reflecting lower expenses. Latin America PFOs were $940 million, down 18% and essentially unchanged on a constant currency basis as growth in Provida and Argentina was offset by lower single premium immediate annuity sales in Chile. Total Latin America sales increased 3% on a constant currency basis primarily due to direct marketing across the region, partially offset by lower foreign sales in Mexico and single premium immediate annuity sales in Chile.
Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $338 million, up 9% from the prior year quarter and up 26% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 22% on a constant currency basis, driven by favorable business growth, $21 million in investment income from the loan sale and an unusual low tax rate. 
Asia PFOs were $2.1 billion, down 13% from the prior year quarter but up 3% on a constant currency basis, driven by higher A&H in Japan. Asia sales were down 10% on a constant currency basis due to 2 large group cases in Australia in the prior year quarter. Excluding these cases, sales were up 6%. A highlight in the quarter was a 23% increase in Japan A&H sales as we continue to benefit from a refurbished product portfolio.
EMEA operating earnings were $66 million, down 15% year-over-year but up 14% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 25% on a constant currency basis driven by business growth, particularly in the Gulf and the U.K. and favorable tax items. EMEA PFOs were $618 million, down 15% from the prior year period and down 1% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact from the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting in the prior year quarter, PFOs were up 4%. 
Total EMEA sales declined 8% due to strong employee benefit sales in the Middle East and the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting in the prior year quarter. Adjusting for these items, sales were up 3% driven by A&H, particularly -- partially offset by a lower-than-expected life and retirement sales.
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.5 billion at September 30. The decrease from the previous quarter was driven primarily by the payment of our quarterly common dividend, interest expense and share repurchases.
Turning to our capital position. We reported U.S. RBC ratios annually, so we do not have an update for the third quarter. For Japan, our solvency margin was 959% as of the second quarter of 2015, which is the latest public data. For U.S. insurance companies, preliminary third quarter statutory results are an operating loss of approximately $900 million and a net loss of approximately $700 million. As previously disclosed, on a statutory basis, the noncash tax charge was $911 million in the quarter. Of this charge, $972 million (sic) [$792 million] went to the statutory earnings and $119 million directly into surplus. 
In addition, earnings were negatively impacted by the stock market decline in the third quarter. Our strategy is to underhedge for smaller market moves and accept the resulting volatility while ensuring we have sufficient hedges to protect against extreme shocks. We estimate our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $29 billion as of September 30, which was comparable to December 31. 
In conclusion, third quarter operating earnings had several notable items that negatively impacted results, and market factors were unfavorable relative to the prior year. However, quarterly volatility is to be expected. While we were short of analyst expectations in the third quarter, we exceeded expectations in the first 2 quarters of the year. We are striving to create long-term sustainable growth and value, and improvement in our free cash flow generation and material increase in distributions to our shareholders highlight this commitment.
And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions."

And our decision a couple of years back was to begin returning capital to shareholders excess free cash flow, and we built up what we believe is a good buffer. But again, it's uncertain, and we don't know how this will all play out. So it -- right now, it's a little bit of a judgment call. And we are, in this year, looking to return to shareholders the free cash flow that the business generated. I think if nothing changes in the external world, that would be the pace we'd be on going forward in 2016 as well. But I have to put some caveats in here because there could be a change in the environment that we learn about at some point in the future, but that is our current thinking."

And I should mention that companies that have undergone this process in the past and primarily in Europe took a number of years to go through this process. We are trying to condense that to a shorter period of time, but it's not a exercise that one could go through in a couple of quarters. So we'll have more to say about it clearly next year, but you can be assured that we're working very hard on driving higher free cash flow ratio.

If you look at this quarter for instance, obviously, last quarter, we have that very high one-off tax issue in Japan, which threw the numbers out. But for this quarter, the constant rate growth is 26%, and there's 3 main items in that. One is business growth which accounts for about 11% or 12% of that. One is favorable investment income of $21 million, which is about 7%. And then there's a couple of one-off tax items. So you should probably think about $310 million to $320 million plus or minus 5% that that's sort of average run rate for the Asia business."

So obviously, where interest rates go long term is very important for us in how we price, how we think and how we account for our business. We've spent a lot of time thinking about, is 4.5% still the correct long long-term assumption? And when I say long term, we're putting liabilities on the books today that may last for 100 years given life expectancies of young people. So it's a very long-term assumption. So that -- we think about that. And the question is, how fast will we get there? And I would say currently, and we would talk to a lot of economists and academics on this and look to the global economy, I think given this year compared to even a few years ago where there was much more optimism about the recovery of the world economies, we see a much slower growth for now and for the foreseeable future. And that's why we've put a longer slope going out on the treasury rate, which is the risk-free rate. When it comes to credit spreads, we really normalize those over the entire credit cycle. And the fact they're up in a quarter or down in a quarter doesn't really impact our thinking over a very long-term cycle. And we study credit spreads over decades, and that's how we set these long-term assumptions. And we're lucky we have experience of credit cycles over decades and have very good experience in this. So that's sort of our thinking behind how we set these assumptions."

Last night, we reported third quarter operating earnings per share of $0.62, which included a preannounced noncash charge of $0.70 per share related to the tax treatment of a wholly owned U.K.-based investment su",1234,"Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported third quarter operating earnings per share of $0.62, which included a preannounced noncash charge of $0.70 per share related to the tax treatment of a wholly owned U.K.-based investment subsidiary. Adjusted for this and other notable items, operating earnings per share were $1.36 in the quarter, which compares to $1.51 on the same basis in the prior year period. 
Adjusted for notable items, operating return on equity was 10.7%, intangible ROE was 13.1% in the quarter. While operating EPS adjusted for notable items were down this quarter, our 9-month results on the same basis were up 3%, with an operating ROE of 11.5% and tangible ROE of 14.2%.
Macroeconomic factors, foreign currency, equity markets and interest rates explain the year-over-year decline in third quarter operating earnings per share adjusted for notable items. Broad-based strength in the U.S. dollar reduced operating earnings from international businesses by $0.09 per share, with significant weakness in the Mexican and Chilean pesos, the Aussie dollar and the euro.
Equity market performance relative to the prior year quarter hurt operating earnings by $0.04 per share. Most of the negative impact was in retail annuities, but poor equity market performance also hurt the co-investment-related earnings from Provida AFP.
The persistent low interest rate environment remains challenging and reduced operating earnings adjusted for notable items by $0.03 per share relative to the third quarter of last year. Investment margins have been resilient in recent years as a result of effective asset liability management, low interest rate hedges and variable investment income. However, we face ongoing headwinds from new money yields that are 100 to 150 basis points below the portfolio yield and from the gradual expiration of derivative protection.
From a balance sheet standpoint, we believe low interest rates are a manageable risk. For example, we completed our annual actuarial assumption review in the third quarter, and the negative impact from low rates on net income was less than $180 million. A key driver of this charge was an assumption change on how long it will take for the 10-year Treasury yield to reach a normalized level. We are now assuming it takes 11 years for the 10-year Treasury yield to increase to our normalized assumption of 4.5% versus 3 years previously.
Turning to regulatory issues. We recently received the clearest indication to date regarding the Federal Reserve's thinking on capital rules for federally regulated insurance companies. In a speech delivered in late September, Federal Reserve Board Governor Dan Tarullo commented on the importance of the liability side of an insurance company's balance sheet when constructing capital rules. He said, ""Traditional insurance liabilities argue for lower capital requirements that might be required for a hypothetical bank holding a similar portfolio of assets."" These are welcome comments made possible by the enactment of the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act in December of last year.
At the same time, Governor Tarullo said the balance sheets of many large life insurers contain liabilities that he does not consider traditional. Our takeaway is that while the Fed clearly recognizes the difference between the bank business model and the insurance business model, we still need to see draft capital rules before we can draw any firm conclusions about the impact on our business.
On a parallel track, international regulators are developing capital rules for global systemically important insurers. Here, too, the news is mixed. On October 5, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors released its proposal for higher loss absorbency capital requirements or HLA.
While MetLife holds capital comfortably above the levels prescribed by the IAIS, we have 2 concerns with the methodology. The first is that the required capital levels in the international framework are procyclical and potentially volatile because they are based on a mark-to-market approach that ignores the ability of insurers to hold assets for the long term.
The second is that the IAIS proposes to apply higher capital charges to so-called nontraditional noninsurance activities. Certain products with guarantees, such as variable annuities, are deemed nontraditional while other products with similar guarantees sold by competitors elsewhere in the world are deemed traditional. This highlights the risk that MetLife has consistently identified in determining what is systemic, that regulators will inadvertently pick winners and losers in the life insurance industry.
The good news is that the IAIS has said the higher loss absorbency rules will be subject to revision before the target effective date of 2019. In fact, the IAIS is launching a review this month of the definition of nontraditional insurance and has said that any changes will flow through to the HLA rules.
Another regulatory issue MetLife is following closely is the Department of Labor's proposed fiduciary rule. As drafted, the rule would make it significantly more difficult for life insurance companies to sell variable annuities. MetLife has shared its concerns with the DOL in comment letters, and the majority of members in both the House and Senate had asked the department to make changes to the rule. 
In addition, several members of Congress are beginning work on a legislative alternative to the DOL proposal, which underscores the growing awareness that the proposal will harm consumers by reducing choice and limiting access to financial education and investment advice.
I would now like to comment on cash distributions to shareholders. As you know, on September 22, we increased our share repurchase authorization from $261 million to $1 billion. We are comfortable with this authorization given our current capital position, which we continue to maintain above historical levels because of uncertain capital rules. Since the announcement, we have repurchased $261 million of stock, including $107 million in the third quarter, and we plan to remain an opportunistic buyer of our shares. 
In the first 9 months of 2015, our total payout to shareholders was $2.3 billion, with roughly an even split between share repurchases and dividends. This total payout equals approximately half of our 9-month operating earnings adjusted for notable items and is in line with our guidance of a 45% to 55% ratio of free cash flow to operating earnings.
MetLife philosophy remains unchanged. Excess capital belongs to our shareholders. In my annual letter to shareholders this past March, I said that free cash flow generation has become an enterprise-wide imperative for MetLife, one that will inform all of our major business decisions in the months and years ahead. As mentioned during our second quarter earnings call, we have undertaken a granular analysis of the cash and capital characteristics of our business. This ongoing work is helping us improve our capital allocation process, which we expect will drive more value for shareholders over time.
In closing this morning, I want to provide an update on the management structure of our Americas region. MetLife is taking a deliberative approach to find the right leadership for the Americas. While our search continues, we have named Eric Steigerwalt as interim Head of the U.S. Business reporting to me. In addition to Retail, Eric will oversee our other U.S. businesses, Group, Voluntary/Worksite Benefits, Corporate Benefit Funding and U.S. Direct. Oscar Schmidt will continue in his role as Head of our Latin America business, also reporting to me. Both are strong leaders focused on generating long-term value for MetLife's shareholders.
I will now turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?"

I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. 
Operating earnings in the third quarter were $705 million or $0.62 per share. This quarter included 5 notable items, which were highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our Quarterly Financial Supplement or QFS. 
First, we have previously announced -- we had a previously announced noncash charge of $792 million or $0.70 per share related to the tax treatment of a wholly owned U.K. investment subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. 
Second, as a result of our annual actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments, we had an after-tax charge to operating earnings of $92 million or $0.08 per share. The total after-tax charge to net income was $210 million. Retail accounted for $228 million, partially offset by modest positive earnings impact in Asia and EMEA. The impact in Retail was mainly due to the change in our assumptions to reflect the persistent low interest rate environment and our current view that rates will remain below normal levels longer than we had originally assumed. 
As you heard from Steve, we are now assuming that it takes 11 years for the 10-year Treasury yield to reach 4.5% versus 3 years previously. We've also lowered our long-term earned rate assumption for Annuities from 5.25% to 5%. Our long-term earned rate assumption for life insurance is unchanged at 5.75%, and our long-term separate account return assumption remains 7.25%.
Third, variable investment income was $174 million after taxes and DAC, which is $37 million or $0.03 per share, below the bottom end of our 2015 quarterly guidance range.
Fourth, we have favorable onetime tax items in the Americas, which increased operating earnings by $72 million or $0.06 per share.
Finally, we had lower-than-budgeted catastrophe losses and favorable prior year reserve development, which increased operating earnings by $21 million or $0.02 per share.
In total, notable items included in operating earnings were $828 million or $0.73 per share.
Turning to our bottom line results. Third quarter net income was $1.2 billion or $1.06 per share. Net income was $492 million higher than operating expenses primarily because of derivative and investment portfolio net gains. The derivative net gains were driven by lower interest rates and strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain currencies. The investment portfolio net gains were mainly the result of real estate sales.
The difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter included a favorable impact of $568 million related to asymmetrical and noneconomic accounting after tax. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, other than FCTA, was $51.11 as of September 30, up 3% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $42.21 as of September 30, up 6% year-over-year.
With respect to third quarter margins, underwriting primarily in the U.S. was less favorable than prior year quarter by $0.03 per share after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Retail Life & Other and Property & Casualty were the primary drivers of the year-over-year result. Retail Life's interest adjusted benefit ratio was 53.4%, excluding a 4% point impact from the actuarial assumption review. The ratio was less favorable than in prior year quarter of 51.0% on a comparable basis but within the expected range of 50% to 55%. Average net claims from the large face policies were higher than the prior year quarter but within the normal range of expectations. 
The group life mortality ratio was 86.1% or toward the low end of the expected annual range of 85% to 90%. The ratio is favorable to the prior year quarter of 87.8% due to better claims experience. 
The Non-Medical Health interest adjusted loss ratio was 80.7%, approximately in line with the prior year quarter of 80.5% and within the targeted range of 77% to 82%.
In Property & Casualty, the combined ratio including catastrophes was 90.9% in Retail and 97.7% in group. The combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 84.0% in Retail and 92.7% in group. Overall, P&C underwriting was unfavorable versus the prior year quarter. We experienced higher noncatastrophe claim costs primarily due to higher frequency and severity in our auto business as well as higher catastrophes.
Turning to investment margins. The average of the 4 U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 202 basis points in the quarter, down 28 basis points year-over-year. Pretax variable investment income was $267 million, down $157 million versus the prior year quarter due to weak hedge fund performance and lower prepayment income. Product spreads excluding variable investment income were 172 basis points, down 13 basis points year-over-year. Lower core yields accounted for most of this decline as a result of the low interest rate environment.
With regard to expenses. The operating expense ratio was 24.2%, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 23.0%. There was an interest-related component of the noncash tax charge that flowed through expenses. Excluding this item, the operating expense ratio was 21.4% or 160 basis points better than the prior year, primarily driven by strong pension closeout sales.
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $523 million, down 33% versus the prior year quarter and down 10% after adjusting for notable items in both periods.
Life & Other reported operating earnings of $183 million, down 50% versus the prior year quarter and down 14% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were lower expense margins, less favorable underwriting primarily in P&C and lower recurring investment income.
Life & Other PFOs were $2.1 billion, down 3% year-over-year as growth in the open block was more than offset by runoff of the closed block.
Core Retail life sales were up 36% year-over-year, primarily driven by Whole and Term Life.
Annuities reported operating earnings of $340 million, down 19% versus the prior year quarter and down 8% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were less favorable initial market impact, higher expenses and taxes. The separate account return was negative 6% in the quarter. Total annuity sales were $2.4 billion in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year. We continue to see good momentum with our index-linked annuity Shield Level Selector, and we expect this product to exceed $1 billion in sales this year. Also, our new VA guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider, FlexChoice, continues to gain acceptance in the market and drove VA sales to $1.8 billion this quarter, an increase of 15% year-over-year.
Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits or GVWB reported operating earnings of $238 million, down 1% versus the prior year quarter and essentially flat after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Business growth in the quarter was offset by less favorable underwriting in P&C, primarily in the auto business. GVWB PFOs were $4.4 billion, up 2% year-over-year. Sales were down 12% year-over-year as we continue to see an impact from increased competition in life and dental. Sales of voluntary products increased 24% due to growth in Property & Casualty.
Corporate Benefit Funding or CBF reported operating earnings of $326 million, down 17% versus the prior year quarter and down 13% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key driver was lower investment margins. CBF PFOs were $1.7 billion, up significantly year-over-year due to strong pension closeout sales in the quarter. Excluding closeouts, PFOs were down 15% due to lower structured settlement sales.
Latin America reported operating earnings of $176 million, up 44% from the prior year quarter and 100% on a constant currency basis. After adjusting for notable items in both periods, primarily Chile taxes, Latin America operating earnings were down 4% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were less favorable underwriting and unfavorable market performance, partially offset by growth in the region.
U.S. Direct, which is included in Latin America's results, had an operating loss of $7 million versus $15 million loss in the prior year quarter, reflecting lower expenses. Latin America PFOs were $940 million, down 18% and essentially unchanged on a constant currency basis as growth in Provida and Argentina was offset by lower single premium immediate annuity sales in Chile. Total Latin America sales increased 3% on a constant currency basis primarily due to direct marketing across the region, partially offset by lower Afore sales in Mexico and single premium immediate annuity sales in Chile.
Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $338 million, up 9% from the prior year quarter and up 26% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 22% on a constant currency basis, driven by favorable business growth, $21 million in investment income from the loan sale and an unusual low tax rate. 
Asia PFOs were $2.1 billion, down 13% from the prior year quarter but up 3% on a constant currency basis, driven by higher A&H in Japan. Asia sales were down 10% on a constant currency basis due to 2 large group cases in Australia in the prior year quarter. Excluding these cases, sales were up 6%. A highlight in the quarter was a 23% increase in Japan A&H sales as we continue to benefit from a refurbished product portfolio.
EMEA operating earnings were $66 million, down 15% year-over-year but up 14% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 25% on a constant currency basis driven by business growth, particularly in the Gulf and the U.K. and favorable tax items. EMEA PFOs were $618 million, down 15% from the prior year period and down 1% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact from the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting in the prior year quarter, PFOs were up 4%. 
Total EMEA sales declined 8% due to strong employee benefit sales in the Middle East and the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting in the prior year quarter. Adjusting for these items, sales were up 3% driven by A&H, particularly -- partially offset by a lower-than-expected life and retirement sales.
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.5 billion at September 30. The decrease from the previous quarter was driven primarily by the payment of our quarterly common dividend, interest expense and share repurchases.
Turning to our capital position. We reported U.S. RBC ratios annually, so we do not have an update for the third quarter. For Japan, our solvency margin was 959% as of the second quarter of 2015, which is the latest public data. For U.S. insurance companies, preliminary third quarter statutory results are an operating loss of approximately $900 million and a net loss of approximately $700 million. As previously disclosed, on a statutory basis, the noncash tax charge was $911 million in the quarter. Of this charge, $972 million (sic) [$792 million] went to the statutory earnings and $119 million directly into surplus. 
In addition, earnings were negatively impacted by the stock market decline in the third quarter. Our strategy is to underhedge for smaller market moves and accept the resulting volatility while ensuring we have sufficient hedges to protect against extreme shocks. We estimate our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $29 billion as of September 30, which was comparable to December 31. 
In conclusion, third quarter operating earnings had several notable items that negatively impacted results, and market factors were unfavorable relative to the prior year. However, quarterly volatility is to be expected. While we were short of analyst expectations in the third quarter, we exceeded expectations in the first 2 quarters of the year. We are striving to create long-term sustainable growth and value, and improvement in our free cash flow generation and material increase in distributions to our shareholders highlight this commitment.
And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions."

State approvals throughout the year play a big part. Certain key states came a fair amount later than we had thought they would. However, at this point, sales are looking pretty good.

So obviously, where interest rates go long term is very important for us in how we price, how we think and how we account for our business. We've spent a lot of time thinking about, is 4.5% still the correct long long-term assumption?

So that -- we think about that. And the question is, how fast will we get there? And I would say currently, and we would talk to a lot of economists and academics on this and look to the global economy, I think given this year compared to even a few years ago where there was much more optimism about the recovery of the world economies, we see a much slower growth for now and for the foreseeable future. And that's why we've put a longer slope going out on the treasury rate, which is the risk-free rate. When it comes to credit spreads, we really normalize those over the entire credit cycle. And the fact they're up in a quarter or down in a quarter doesn't really impact our thinking over a very long-term cycle. And we study credit spreads over decades, and that's how we set these long-term assumptions. And we're lucky we have experience of credit cycles over decades and have very good experience in this.
