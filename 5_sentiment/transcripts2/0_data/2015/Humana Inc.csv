This morning, Humana reported full year adjusted earnings per share for 2014 of $7.51, in line with our 2014 guidance.

This morning, Humana reported full year adjusted earnings per share for 2014 of $7.51, in line with our 2014 guidance. This past year was particularly dynamic across the sector and presented a number of challenges, as well as some new opportunities. Humana continues to rise to these challenges through our consumer-focused strategy and integrated care delivery model while simultaneously investing in new growth areas. As a result, we are reiterating our guidance for 2015 earnings of $8.50 to $9 per share, a growth rate of approximately 17% at the mid-point. 
As we outlined in our Investor Day this past December, Humana's investment thesis is driven by our customer-focused, integrated care delivery model and the related results. This thesis includes 4 key elements: Continued robust organic membership and revenue growth; proven superior clinical operating performance; disciplined capital allocation, which all lead to a sustainable, competitive advantage.
I'll begin our discussion this morning with a focus on our membership and revenue growth. We recently raised our net Medicare Advantage membership growth expectations for 2015 to 300,000 to 350,000, primarily as a result of a strong sales during -- results of strong sales during a recently completed annual election period or AEP.
And looking at the January enrollment data from CMS, Humana continues to lead the industry in membership growth for individual Medicare Advantage plans. The CMS data indicates that Humana accounted for nearly 70% of the individual MA net enrollment growth across the sector. In fact, approximately 52% of our individual gross sales during the AEP came from competitor Medicare Advantage offerings.
From a geographic perspective, we did not see strong specific concentration with this growth, but did experience our highest membership gains in North Carolina. We are pleased with this individual MA growth as it complements the group MA membership increase we experienced in that state in 2014, making this a very important Humana market.
With a large base of Medicare members, we are now able to bring other Humana offerings, like HumanaOne, to the state. As you'll see from Slide 8, approximately 73% of our individual MA net growth was in HMO offerings, including current Humana members who chose to move to an -- into an HMO in 2015. This compares to 64% in 2014. 
Our HMO offerings continue to provide the highest level of engagement from both a member and provider perspective and also have the highest retention rate of our Medicare products. Over the past few years, we've discussed our integrated care delivery model and its 3 core elements: Improve the consumer experience by simplifying the interaction resulting in a trusting relationship; based on the trusting relationship, engage members and clinical programs; and offering assistance to providers and transitioning from fee-for-service to value-based reimbursement. 
This strategy has provided superior clinical operating performance resulting in a sustainable competitive advantage. Over the past few years, membership growth in Star scores provide evidence of the success of this strategy. We believe there are 5 key points of influence that drive our superior clinical operating performance. Although I will not go through all the detail on the slide today, I did want to highlight how we are already been working with our new 2015 members, allowing us to begin to get to know them and allow for timely enrollment in the proper clinical programs.
I'll begin with wellness and prevention. Staying in tune with the health of our members is a major focus of our wellness and prevention efforts. This all begins with our new member welcome calls. This call begin shortly after the onset of the AEP this past October. This outreach efforts have already resulted in the completion of over 160,000 health risk assessments. Data from the welcome calls, health risk assessments and our sophisticated predictive modeling have already come together to identify more than 46,000 of our members for referrals to our Humana At Home.
Our wellness efforts have a strong focus on gaps-in-care. In 2014, we closed approximately 4.3 million gaps-in-care for our members, driven by improvement in preventative screenings. Better still, we are very pleased that approximately 1.3 million of our members across all lines of business received preventative treatment on schedule.
Turning to the primary care point of influence. We are pleased to report that approximately 55% of our net membership growth during the AEP is for members associated with providers and value-based arrangements. Remember that we offer providers a continuum of opportunities to increase the integration of care. This includes performance bonuses, shared savings and shared risk relationships.
We see HHS announcement last week on its move to paying providers based on value as further validation that our integrated care delivery strategy is on track. We look forward to working with HHS in developing new payment models and continuing to assist providers in the transition to value-based payment.
Health care @Home will also be an important element of the care for many of our new members. As we've shared with you in the past, our Humana At Home programs did a terrific job of providing members with clinical support and care that often results in a significantly higher number of days they spend at their homes instead of in an acute care facility. 
Importantly, as we evaluate each of the points of influence I've just described, as well as our pharmacy interactions with our members, we utilize advanced analytics, including sophisticated predictive models, to provide insights that are both actionable and drive value for our members. All these metrics are indicative of the solid value proposition we continue to offer Medicare beneficiaries in the phase of rate reductions. Successfully engaging our members in clinical programs is proving we can assist our members with their health needs. This is allowing us to offer stability in their premiums and benefits, and reduce the complexity of navigating the health care system and helps produce the robust organic growth we are sharing with you today.
Looking at our other offerings. Humana's stand-alone PDP membership continues to experience strong growth with the bulk of the growth in our low-priced Walmart offering. This, together with growth in our Medicare Advantage membership, drives higher use of the services in our Healthcare Services segment, benefiting the enterprise overall.
Turning to our HumanaOne membership. As we evaluate recent health care exchange enrollment data, we believe it comports well with the pricing assumptions we made for 2015. As we've indicated on prior calls, our 2015 pricing appropriately assume the ultimate elimination of 2 of the 3Rs. We continue to be pleased with the mix of our membership, both across the metal tiers and by age distribution. We also believe that the 55 to 64 age ranges are opportunity to develop relationship with these members before they age into Medicare Advantage.
I also would want to highlight for you today something innovative we are doing in the Employer Group business. In the latter part of 2013, we introduced to our employer customers a product we call Total Health, which turns any standard medical plan of the employers choosing into an integrated health and well-being solution that encourages participation in HumanaVitality, health coaching and clinical programs. Employee participation results in employer discounts, which is resulting in the shift of our single year contract to a multi-year relationship that is creating employer solutions to not only cost, but also productivity.
Employer receptivity to the Total Health product is line with membership now at approximately 100,000 versus less than 400,000 at the end of 2013. We anticipate in the future these wellness programs and services will be complementary to employers choosing private and public exchange models. 
In conclusion, we continue to be pleased with our prospects for 2015 and beyond. The engagement of our associates and focus on the consumer through our integrated care delivery model has never been stronger. We believe that will result in the continuation of our superior clinical operating performance and a sustainable, competitive advantage for quite some time to come. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian for a more detailed discussion of our financials and our commitment to disciplined capital allocation."

As Bruce said in his remarks, 2014 was an unusually dynamic year full of opportunities and challenges. The growth in our Medicare business was substantial and was supplemented by the power of our Healthcare Services segment, which has prospered while making a truly positive difference in our member's lives. Our Employer Group business capitalized on the way 2013 rollout of an exciting new offering in the form of total health, while also ending the year on a high note in terms of financial performance. All these transpired while we invested heavily in new growth opportunities, both HumanaOne and our state-based businesses, which we believe will generate significant returns for our shareholders down the road.
We are pleased that our full year adjusted EPS came in just above the mid-point of our guidance at $7.51 per share. As we close out the year, there were a few items that adversely affected our 2014 results, but we do not see any of these significantly impacting our 2015 guidance. 
Our Retail segment pretax earnings finished the year below our guidance range. This was primarily attributable to the severity of the flu season, slightly higher investment spending for our rules and state-based contracts and deterioration in the results for our Puerto Rico Medicare business, which continues to be a difficult market for us.
With regard to the flu, hospital inpatient admissions peaked in late December, early January, but have since abated and have returned to more normalized levels. I should hasten to add that utilization more broadly remains benign and within expectations.
With regard to the duals, we continue to build out our for structure and are well-positioned heading into 2015 to significantly reduce our investments, which we have committed to do.
Turning to the Employer Group segment. Our 2014 earnings results ended meaningfully above the upper end of our guidance range. While the flu did have some adverse impact on the Employer Group results, these were more than offset by lower medical claims utilization that we saw in both our commercial and Group Medicare businesses. It is also important to note the effort that our Employer Group team has made to reduce administrative costs, which was also a significant driver of the segment's full year results.
Finally, our effective tax rate came in above the range of our previous guidance. There were several factors driving this, including the associated tax ramifications of higher losses in our Puerto Rico Medicare operations, which are non-deductible for U.S. income tax purposes, as well as lower tax exempts investment income. We've evaluated each of these factors closely and have confidence that the 2015 guidance points we shared with you this morning encompass any continuing impact of each of these items.
Turning now to 2015. The majority of the guidance points we shared with you last quarter are unchanged. This slide summarizes the more significant changes since our last earnings call.
As we disclosed in a Form 8-K filing last month, we revised our Medicare Advantage and stand-alone PDP enrollment guidance to reflect the results of the 2015 AEP. Our higher projection for Medicare Advantage enrollment resulted in an increase to our revenue guidance that more than offset the revenue impact of the lower expectations for stand-alone PDP membership. As we have discussed in the past, the higher membership in our MA plans from the annual enrollment process will have a nominal impact on our Retail insurance segment performance this year. While there will be a favorable impact on the Healthcare Services segment home-based business from the higher Medicare Advantage membership, this will be offset by the impact of the revised stand-alone PDP membership will have on Humana pharmacy, as PDP members in our low price point offering tend to use our wholly owned mail order and Specialty pharmacies at rates slightly higher than our MA members.
One other element of our 2015 guidance points that we updated today is our projected accruals for the premium stabilization programs, commonly called the 3Rs. As Bruce shared in his remarks, we now have more color around the mix of our membership distribution, among the metal tiers and by age range. Having evaluated that data, we're comfortable lowering our projection for full year accruals for the 3Rs by approximately $50 million at the mid-point. We now expect the net receivables for 2015 to be less than half of the level they were compared to the balances we accrued at the end of 2014.
As we've noted in prior calls, our pricing strategy for 2015 included significantly lowering reliance on the 3Rs, and we are still on track for 2015 to achieve at a minimum breakeven results.
With regard to the risk corridors. We believe that the 2014 $51 million net receivable that we disclosed this morning is indeed collectible based on statutory and administrative actions. Further, any 2014 amounts must first be satisfied before subsequent years are paid. Finally, for 2015, the risk corridor receivable that we are currently forecasting is insignificant.
Turning to our operating cash flows. We have been around 1.5x net income for some time now, and we anticipate maintaining that quality of earnings metric again in 2015. This morning, we raised our guidance for operating cash flows by approximately $200 million, driven primarily by the timing of certain working capital items. While our days claims payable declined sequentially by 2.8 days to 44.7, this was primarily due to the increasing capitation payments as we continue to grow the number of providers under risk-based contracts, as well as the growth in our long-term support services business, whose providers get paid monthly. 
Additionally, our normal December decline in claims inventories, driven by the holiday season and higher staffing associated with preparing for new members coming on January 1, was magnified by the relatively late HumanaOne enrollment and the associated pended claims, which we paid down in the fourth quarter.
I'll now turn to our view of the quarterly breakdown of earnings for 2015. Though we do not divide specific quarterly guidance, we did want to give you a sense for the key drivers of performance among the quarters, as we've done in prior years. Given our expectations that our health care exchange business will at least breakeven and our investments in state-based contracts will begin to mitigate, we've layered in the impact of those newer businesses across the quarters. The results is that we again project the third and fourth quarters to experience the most pressure in light of the quarterly progression of health benefit ratios and the timing of marketing and Open Enrollment across our lines of business.
I'll conclude my discussion this morning with a few words around capital allocation. As Bruce said in his remarks, disciplined capital allocation is a key component of Humana's investment thesis. At the time of our third quarter release, we announced a significant increase in our share repurchase authorization and a commitment to accelerate our buyback activity. We've held true to that commitment and maintained our expectation to buy back $1 billion in stock by June of this year with approximately $630 million of that already completed. We would also expect to continue share repurchases in the back half of the year.
Aside from share repurchase activity, we are continuing to evaluate all of our businesses to ensure that they fit strategically within our portfolio and our earning the cost of capital will have a convincing plan to do so. To the extent, if business does not meet this criteria, that business will be restructured or divested. We expect to continue to update you on the progress of this review over the coming months.
With that, we will open the lines up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please introduce the first caller."

With regard to Puerto Rico, I rather not go into the details of the numbers there, but we are losing money in that market. We lost more this quarter than we expected. And really, that's driven by the fact that the dynamics in that market are different. The medical management of those members is different. We got hit by uncompensated care adjustments that we had to take into our results that weren't in the bids because they came after the bids. And so 2014 was a very difficult year for that market. On the duals side, we're continuing to build up that infrastructure. As we think about investments for 2014, I would say the duals came in slightly higher. Individual came in slightly lower.

This morning, Humana reported full year adjusted earnings per share for 2014 of $7.51, in line with our 2014 guidance. This past year was particularly dynamic across the sector and presented a number of challenges as well as some new opportunities. Humana continues to rise to these challenges through our consumer-focused strategy and integrated care delivery model, while simultaneously investing in new growth areas. As a result, we are reiterating our guidance for 2015 earnings of $8.50 to $9 per share, a growth rate of approximately 17% at the midpoint. 
As we outlined in our Investor Day this past December, Humana's investment thesis is driven by our customer-focused integrated care delivery model and the related results. This thesis includes 4 key elements: continued robust organic membership and revenue growth; proven superior clinical operating performance; disciplined capital allocation, which all lead to a sustainable competitive advantage.
I'll begin our discussion this morning with a focus on our membership and revenue growth. We recently raised our net Medicare Advantage membership growth expectations for 2015 to 300,000 to 350,000, primarily as a result of a strong sales during -- or results of strong sales during the recently completed annual election period or AEP.
And looking at the January enrollment data from CMS, Humana continues to lead the industry in membership growth for individual Medicare Advantage plans. The CMS data indicates that Humana accounted for nearly 70% of the individual MA net enrollment growth across the sector. In fact, approximately 52% of our individual gross sales during the AEP came from competitor Medicare Advantage offerings.
From a geographic perspective, we did not see strong specific concentration with this growth, but did experience our highest membership gains in North Carolina. We are pleased with this individual MA growth as it complements the group MA membership increase we experienced in that state in 2014, making this a very important Humana market.
With a large base of Medicare members, we are now able to bring other Humana offerings, like HumanaOne, to the state. As you'll see from Slide 8, approximately 73% of our individual MA net growth was in HMO offerings, including current Humana members who chose to move to an -- into an HMO in 2015. This compares to 64% in 2014. 
Our HMO offerings continue to provide the highest level of engagement from both a member and provider perspective and also have the highest retention rate of our Medicare products. Over the past few years, we've discussed our integrated care delivery model and its 3 core elements: improve the consumer experience by simplifying the interaction, resulting in a trusting relationship; based on the trusting relationship, engage members and clinical programs; and offering assistance to providers and transitioning from fee-for-service to value-based reimbursement. 
This strategy has provided superior clinical operating performance, resulting in a sustainable competitive advantage. Over the past few years, membership growth in Star scores provide evidence of the success of this strategy. We believe there are 5 key points of influence that drive our superior clinical operating performance. Although I will not go through all the detail on the slide today, I did want to highlight how we are already been working with our new 2015 members, allowing us to begin to get to know them and allow for timely enrollment in the proper clinical programs.
I'll begin with wellness and prevention. Staying in tune with the health of our members is a major focus of our wellness and prevention efforts. This all begins with our new member welcome calls. These calls begin shortly after the onset of the AEP this past October. These outreach efforts have already resulted in the completion of over 160,000 health risk assessments. Data from the welcome calls, health risk assessments and our sophisticated predictive modeling have already come together to identify more than 46,000 of our members for referrals to our Humana At Home.
Our wellness efforts have a strong focus on gaps in care. In 2014, we closed approximately 4.3 million gaps in care for our members, driven by improvement in preventative screenings. Better still, we are very pleased that approximately 1.3 million of our members across all lines of business received preventative treatment on schedule.
Turning to the primary care point of influence. We are pleased to report that approximately 55% of our net membership growth during the AEP is for members associated with providers in value-based arrangements. Remember that we offer providers a continuum of opportunities to increase the integration of care. This includes performance bonuses, shared savings and shared risk relationships.
We see HHS announcement last week on its move to paying providers based on value as further validation that our integrated care delivery strategy is on track. We look forward to working with HHS in developing new payment models and continuing to assist providers in the transition to value-based payment.
Health care at home will also be an important element of the care for many of our new members. As we've shared with you in the past, our Humana At Home programs do a terrific job of providing members with clinical support and care that often results in a significantly higher number of days they spend at their homes instead of in an acute care facility. 
Importantly, as we evaluate each of the points of influence I've just described, as well as our pharmacy interactions with our members, we utilize advanced analytics, including sophisticated predictive models, to provide insights that are both actionable and drive value for our members. All these metrics are indicative of the solid value proposition we continue to offer Medicare beneficiaries in the face of rate reductions. Successfully engaging our members in clinical programs is proving we can assist our members with their health needs. This is allowing us to offer stability in their premiums and benefits and reduce the complexity of navigating the health care system and helps produce the robust organic growth we are sharing with you today.
Looking at our other offerings. Humana's stand-alone PDP membership continues to experience strong growth with the bulk of the growth in our low-priced Walmart offering. This, together with growth in our Medicare Advantage membership, drives higher use of the services in our Healthcare Services segment, benefiting the enterprise overall.
Turning to our HumanaOne membership. As we evaluate recent health care exchange enrollment data, we believe it comports well with the pricing assumptions we made for 2015. As we've indicated on prior calls, our 2015 pricing appropriately assume the ultimate elimination of 2 of the 3Rs. We continue to be pleased with the mix of our membership, both across the metal tiers and by age distribution. We also believe that the 55 to 64 age ranges are opportunity to develop relationships with these members before they age into Medicare Advantage.
I also would want to highlight for you today something innovative we are doing in the Employer Group business. In the latter part of 2013, we introduced to our employer customers a product we call Total Health, which turns any standard medical plan of the employers choosing into an integrated health and well-being solution that encourages participation in HumanaVitality, health coaching and clinical programs. Employee participation results in employer discounts, which is then resulting in the shift of our single-year contract to a multiyear relationship that is creating employer solutions to not only cost, but also productivity.
Employer receptivity to the Total Health product is high with membership now at approximately 100,000 versus less than 400,000 at the end of 2013. We anticipate in the future these wellness programs and services will be complementary to employers choosing private and public exchange models. 
In conclusion, we continue to be pleased with our prospects for 2015 and beyond. The engagement of our associates and focus on the consumer through our integrated care delivery model has never been stronger. We believe that will result in the continuation of our superior clinical operating performance and a sustainable competitive advantage for quite some time to come.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian for a more detailed discussion of our financials and our commitment to disciplined capital allocation."

As Bruce said in his remarks, 2014 was an unusually dynamic year full of opportunities and challenges. The growth in our Medicare business was substantial and was supplemented by the power of our Healthcare Services segment, which has prospered, while making a truly positive difference in our members' lives. Our Employer Group business capitalized on the late 2013 rollout of an exciting new offering in the form of Total Health, while also ending the year on a high note in terms of financial performance. All this transpired while we invested heavily in new growth opportunities, both HumanaOne and our state-based businesses, which we believe will generate significant returns for our shareholders down the road.
We are pleased that our full year adjusted EPS came in just above the midpoint of our guidance at $7.51 per share. As we close out the year, there were a few items that adversely affected our 2014 results, but we do not see any of these significantly impacting our 2015 guidance. 
Our Retail segment pretax earnings finished the year below our guidance range. This was primarily attributable to the severity of the flu season, slightly higher investment spending for our duals and state-based contracts and deterioration in the results for our Puerto Rico Medicare business, which continues to be a difficult market for us.
With regard to the flu, hospital inpatient admissions peaked in late December, early January, but have since abated and have returned to more normalized levels. I should hasten to add that utilization more broadly remains benign and within expectations.
With regard to the duals, we continue to build out our infrastructure and are well positioned heading into 2015 to significantly reduce our investments, which we have committed to do.
Turning to the Employer Group segment. Our 2014 earnings results ended meaningfully above the upper end of our guidance range. While the flu did have some adverse impact on the Employer Group results, these were more than offset by lower medical claims utilization that we saw in both our commercial and group Medicare businesses. It is also important to note the effort that our Employer Group team has made to reduce administrative costs, which was also a significant driver of the segment's full year results.
Finally, our effective tax rate came in above the range of our previous guidance. There were several factors driving this, including the associated tax ramifications of higher losses in our Puerto Rico Medicare operations, which are nondeductible for U.S. income tax purposes, as well as lower tax-exempt investment income. We've evaluated each of these factors closely and have confidence that the 2015 guidance points we shared with you this morning encompass any continuing impact of each of these items.
Turning now to 2015. The majority of the guidance points we shared with you last quarter are unchanged. This slide summarizes the more significant changes since our last earnings call.
As we disclosed in a Form 8-K filing last month, we revised our Medicare Advantage and stand-alone PDP enrollment guidance to reflect the results of the 2015 AEP. Our higher projection for Medicare Advantage enrollment resulted in an increase to our revenue guidance that more than offset the revenue impact of the lower expectations for stand-alone PDP membership. As we have discussed in the past, the higher membership in our MA plans from the annual enrollment process will have a nominal impact on our Retail insurance segment performance this year. While there will be a favorable impact on the Healthcare Services segment's home-based business from the higher Medicare Advantage membership, this will be offset by the impact of the revised stand-alone PDP membership we'll have on Humana Pharmacy as PDP members in our low price point offering tend to use our wholly owned mail order and specialty pharmacies at rates slightly higher than our MA members.
One other element of our 2015 guidance points that we updated today is our projected accruals for the premium stabilization programs, commonly called the 3Rs. As Bruce shared in his remarks, we now have more color around the mix of our membership distribution among the metal tiers and by age range. Having evaluated that data, we are comfortable lowering our projection for full year accruals for the 3Rs by approximately $50 million at the midpoint. We now expect the net receivables for 2015 to be less than half of the level they were compared to the balances we accrued at the end of 2014.
As we've noted in prior calls, our pricing strategy for 2015 included significantly lowering reliance on the 3Rs, and we are still on track for 2015 to achieve at a minimum breakeven results.
With regard to the risk corridors, we believe that the 2014 $51 million net receivable that we disclosed this morning is indeed collectible based on statutory and administrative actions. Further, any 2014 amounts must first be satisfied before subsequent years are paid. Finally, for 2015, the risk corridor receivable that we are currently forecasting is insignificant.
Turning to our operating cash flows. We have been around 1.5x net income for some time now, and we anticipate maintaining that quality of earnings metric again in 2015. This morning, we raised our guidance for operating cash flows by approximately $200 million, driven primarily by the timing of certain working capital items. While our days claims payable declined sequentially by 2.8 days to 44.7, this was primarily due to the increase in capitation payments as we continue to grow the number of providers under risk-based contracts as well as the growth in our long-term support services business, whose providers get paid monthly. 
Additionally, our normal December decline in claims inventories, driven by the holiday season and higher staffing associated with preparing for new members coming on January 1, was magnified by the relatively late HumanaOne enrollment and the associated pended claims, which we paid down in the fourth quarter.
I'll now turn to our view of the quarterly breakdown of earnings for 2015. Though we do not provide specific quarterly guidance, we did want to give you a sense for the key drivers of performance among the quarters, as we have done in prior years. Given our expectations that our health care exchange business will at least breakeven and our investments in state-based contracts will begin to mitigate, we've layered in the impact of those newer businesses across the quarters. The result is that we again project the third and fourth quarters to experience the most pressure in light of the quarterly progression of health benefit ratios and the timing of marketing and open enrollment across our lines of business.
I'll conclude my discussion this morning with a few words around capital allocation. As Bruce said in his remarks, disciplined capital allocation is a key component of Humana's investment thesis. At the time of our third quarter release, we announced a significant increase in our share repurchase authorization and a commitment to accelerate our buyback activity. We've held true to that commitment and maintained our expectation to buy back $1 billion in stock by June of this year with approximately $630 million of that already completed. We would also expect to continue share repurchases in the back half of the year.
Aside from share repurchase activity, we are continuing to evaluate all of our businesses to ensure that they fit strategically within our portfolio and our earning their cost of capital will have a convincing plan to do so. To the extent a business does not meet these criteria, that business will be restructured or divested. We expect to continue to update you on the progress of this review over the coming months.
With that, we will open the lines up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please introduce the first caller."

With regard to Puerto Rico, I'd rather not go into the details of the numbers there, but we are losing money in that market. We lost more this quarter than we expected. And really, that's driven by the fact that the dynamics in that market are different. The medical management of those members is different. We got hit by uncompensated care adjustments that we had to take into our results that weren't in the bids because they came after the bids. And so 2014 was a very difficult year for that market. On the duals side, we're continuing to build out that infrastructure. As we think about investments for 2014, I would say the duals came in slightly higher, individual came in slightly lower.

Bruce earlier talked about North Carolina, and that's the market where we have 4.5 stars, and some of the competitors that were there before didn't have as high a Star score. And we think that, that, in terms of the premium and benefits that we're able to put on The Street, helps to position us better. So I would say that that's one aspect that we're seeing play itself out. We're obviously very pleased about that. As respects the number of members that we get from competitors versus fee-for-service, I would tell you that, that number, as we've looked at it, is about 50-50. Agents generally -- a significant part of the agent growth occurs during the ROI as opposed to during the AEP itself. A lot of favorable dynamics.

It's lowering the cost of Medicare and you get affected. But I do think long term the Medicare Advantage offers a significantly better advantage as you look at the comprehensive nature of it. It's just not about the price. And also what we found is about the integration of the services and the systems that's provided there.

This morning, Humana reported full year adjusted earnings per share for 2014 of $7.51, in line with our 2014 guidance. This past year was particularly dynamic across the sector and presented a number o",1365,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, Humana reported full year adjusted earnings per share for 2014 of $7.51, in line with our 2014 guidance. This past year was particularly dynamic across the sector and presented a number of challenges as well as some new opportunities. Humana continues to rise to these challenges through our consumer-focused strategy and integrated care delivery model, while simultaneously investing in new growth areas. As a result, we are reiterating our guidance for 2015 earnings of $8.50 to $9 per share, a growth rate of approximately 17% at the midpoint. 
As we outlined in our Investor Day this past December, Humana's investment thesis is driven by our customer-focused integrated care delivery model and the related results. This thesis includes 4 key elements: continued robust organic membership and revenue growth; proven superior clinical operating performance; disciplined capital allocation, which all lead to a sustainable competitive advantage.
I'll begin our discussion this morning with a focus on our membership and revenue growth. We recently raised our net Medicare Advantage membership growth expectations for 2015 to 300,000 to 350,000, primarily as a result of a strong sales during -- or results of strong sales during the recently completed annual election period or AEP.
And looking at the January enrollment data from CMS, Humana continues to lead the industry in membership growth for individual Medicare Advantage plans. The CMS data indicates that Humana accounted for nearly 70% of the individual MA net enrollment growth across the sector. In fact, approximately 52% of our individual gross sales during the AEP came from competitor Medicare Advantage offerings.
From a geographic perspective, we did not see strong specific concentration with this growth, but did experience our highest membership gains in North Carolina. We are pleased with this individual MA growth as it complements the group MA membership increase we experienced in that state in 2014, making this a very important Humana market.
With a large base of Medicare members, we are now able to bring other Humana offerings, like HumanaOne, to the state. As you'll see from Slide 8, approximately 73% of our individual MA net growth was in HMO offerings, including current Humana members who chose to move to an -- into an HMO in 2015. This compares to 64% in 2014. 
Our HMO offerings continue to provide the highest level of engagement from both a member and provider perspective and also have the highest retention rate of our Medicare products. Over the past few years, we've discussed our integrated care delivery model and its 3 core elements: improve the consumer experience by simplifying the interaction, resulting in a trusting relationship; based on the trusting relationship, engage members and clinical programs; and offering assistance to providers and transitioning from fee-for-service to value-based reimbursement. 
This strategy has provided superior clinical operating performance, resulting in a sustainable competitive advantage. Over the past few years, membership growth in Star scores provide evidence of the success of this strategy. We believe there are 5 key points of influence that drive our superior clinical operating performance. Although I will not go through all the detail on the slide today, I did want to highlight how we are already been working with our new 2015 members, allowing us to begin to get to know them and allow for timely enrollment in the proper clinical programs.
I'll begin with wellness and prevention. Staying in tune with the health of our members is a major focus of our wellness and prevention efforts. This all begins with our new member welcome calls. These calls begin shortly after the onset of the AEP this past October. These outreach efforts have already resulted in the completion of over 160,000 health risk assessments. Data from the welcome calls, health risk assessments and our sophisticated predictive modeling have already come together to identify more than 46,000 of our members for referrals to our Humana At Home.
Our wellness efforts have a strong focus on gaps in care. In 2014, we closed approximately 4.3 million gaps in care for our members, driven by improvement in preventative screenings. Better still, we are very pleased that approximately 1.3 million of our members across all lines of business received preventative treatment on schedule.
Turning to the primary care point of influence. We are pleased to report that approximately 55% of our net membership growth during the AEP is for members associated with providers in value-based arrangements. Remember that we offer providers a continuum of opportunities to increase the integration of care. This includes performance bonuses, shared savings and shared risk relationships.
We see HHS announcement last week on its move to paying providers based on value as further validation that our integrated care delivery strategy is on track. We look forward to working with HHS in developing new payment models and continuing to assist providers in the transition to value-based payment.
Health care at home will also be an important element of the care for many of our new members. As we've shared with you in the past, our Humana At Home programs do a terrific job of providing members with clinical support and care that often results in a significantly higher number of days they spend at their homes instead of in an acute care facility. 
Importantly, as we evaluate each of the points of influence I've just described, as well as our pharmacy interactions with our members, we utilize advanced analytics, including sophisticated predictive models, to provide insights that are both actionable and drive value for our members. All these metrics are indicative of the solid value proposition we continue to offer Medicare beneficiaries in the face of rate reductions. Successfully engaging our members in clinical programs is proving we can assist our members with their health needs. This is allowing us to offer stability in their premiums and benefits and reduce the complexity of navigating the health care system and helps produce the robust organic growth we are sharing with you today.
Looking at our other offerings. Humana's stand-alone PDP membership continues to experience strong growth with the bulk of the growth in our low-priced Walmart offering. This, together with growth in our Medicare Advantage membership, drives higher use of the services in our Healthcare Services segment, benefiting the enterprise overall.
Turning to our HumanaOne membership. As we evaluate recent health care exchange enrollment data, we believe it comports well with the pricing assumptions we made for 2015. As we've indicated on prior calls, our 2015 pricing appropriately assume the ultimate elimination of 2 of the 3Rs. We continue to be pleased with the mix of our membership, both across the metal tiers and by age distribution. We also believe that the 55 to 64 age ranges are opportunity to develop relationships with these members before they age into Medicare Advantage.
I also would want to highlight for you today something innovative we are doing in the Employer Group business. In the latter part of 2013, we introduced to our employer customers a product we call Total Health, which turns any standard medical plan of the employers choosing into an integrated health and well-being solution that encourages participation in HumanaVitality, health coaching and clinical programs. Employee participation results in employer discounts, which is then resulting in the shift of our single-year contract to a multiyear relationship that is creating employer solutions to not only cost, but also productivity.
Employer receptivity to the Total Health product is high with membership now at approximately 100,000 versus less than 400,000 at the end of 2013. We anticipate in the future these wellness programs and services will be complementary to employers choosing private and public exchange models. 
In conclusion, we continue to be pleased with our prospects for 2015 and beyond. The engagement of our associates and focus on the consumer through our integrated care delivery model has never been stronger. We believe that will result in the continuation of our superior clinical operating performance and a sustainable competitive advantage for quite some time to come.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian for a more detailed discussion of our financials and our commitment to disciplined capital allocation."

As Bruce said in his remarks, 2014 was an unusually dynamic year full of opportunities and challenges. The growth in our Medicare business was substantial and was supplemented by the power of our Healthcare Services segment, which has prospered, while making a truly positive difference in our members' lives. Our Employer Group business capitalized on the late 2013 rollout of an exciting new offering in the form of Total Health, while also ending the year on a high note in terms of financial performance. All this transpired while we invested heavily in new growth opportunities, both HumanaOne and our state-based businesses, which we believe will generate significant returns for our shareholders down the road.
We are pleased that our full year adjusted EPS came in just above the midpoint of our guidance at $7.51 per share. As we close out the year, there were a few items that adversely affected our 2014 results, but we do not see any of these significantly impacting our 2015 guidance. 
Our Retail segment pretax earnings finished the year below our guidance range. This was primarily attributable to the severity of the flu season, slightly higher investment spending for our duals and state-based contracts and deterioration in the results for our Puerto Rico Medicare business, which continues to be a difficult market for us.
With regard to the flu, hospital inpatient admissions peaked in late December, early January, but have since abated and have returned to more normalized levels. I should hasten to add that utilization more broadly remains benign and within expectations.
With regard to the duals, we continue to build out our infrastructure and are well positioned heading into 2015 to significantly reduce our investments, which we have committed to do.
Turning to the Employer Group segment. Our 2014 earnings results ended meaningfully above the upper end of our guidance range. While the flu did have some adverse impact on the Employer Group results, these were more than offset by lower medical claims utilization that we saw in both our commercial and group Medicare businesses. It is also important to note the effort that our Employer Group team has made to reduce administrative costs, which was also a significant driver of the segment's full year results.
Finally, our effective tax rate came in above the range of our previous guidance. There were several factors driving this, including the associated tax ramifications of higher losses in our Puerto Rico Medicare operations, which are nondeductible for U.S. income tax purposes, as well as lower tax-exempt investment income. We've evaluated each of these factors closely and have confidence that the 2015 guidance points we shared with you this morning encompass any continuing impact of each of these items.
Turning now to 2015. The majority of the guidance points we shared with you last quarter are unchanged. This slide summarizes the more significant changes since our last earnings call.
As we disclosed in a Form 8-K filing last month, we revised our Medicare Advantage and stand-alone PDP enrollment guidance to reflect the results of the 2015 AEP. Our higher projection for Medicare Advantage enrollment resulted in an increase to our revenue guidance that more than offset the revenue impact of the lower expectations for stand-alone PDP membership. As we have discussed in the past, the higher membership in our MA plans from the annual enrollment process will have a nominal impact on our Retail insurance segment performance this year. While there will be a favorable impact on the Healthcare Services segment's home-based business from the higher Medicare Advantage membership, this will be offset by the impact of the revised stand-alone PDP membership we'll have on Humana Pharmacy as PDP members in our low price point offering tend to use our wholly owned mail order and specialty pharmacies at rates slightly higher than our MA members.
One other element of our 2015 guidance points that we updated today is our projected accruals for the premium stabilization programs, commonly called the 3Rs. As Bruce shared in his remarks, we now have more color around the mix of our membership distribution among the metal tiers and by age range. Having evaluated that data, we are comfortable lowering our projection for full year accruals for the 3Rs by approximately $50 million at the midpoint. We now expect the net receivables for 2015 to be less than half of the level they were compared to the balances we accrued at the end of 2014.
As we've noted in prior calls, our pricing strategy for 2015 included significantly lowering reliance on the 3Rs, and we are still on track for 2015 to achieve at a minimum breakeven results.
With regard to the risk corridors, we believe that the 2014 $51 million net receivable that we disclosed this morning is indeed collectible based on statutory and administrative actions. Further, any 2014 amounts must first be satisfied before subsequent years are paid. Finally, for 2015, the risk corridor receivable that we are currently forecasting is insignificant.
Turning to our operating cash flows. We have been around 1.5x net income for some time now, and we anticipate maintaining that quality of earnings metric again in 2015. This morning, we raised our guidance for operating cash flows by approximately $200 million, driven primarily by the timing of certain working capital items. While our days claims payable declined sequentially by 2.8 days to 44.7, this was primarily due to the increase in capitation payments as we continue to grow the number of providers under risk-based contracts as well as the growth in our long-term support services business, whose providers get paid monthly. 
Additionally, our normal December decline in claims inventories, driven by the holiday season and higher staffing associated with preparing for new members coming on January 1, was magnified by the relatively late HumanaOne enrollment and the associated pended claims, which we paid down in the fourth quarter.
I'll now turn to our view of the quarterly breakdown of earnings for 2015. Though we do not provide specific quarterly guidance, we did want to give you a sense for the key drivers of performance among the quarters, as we have done in prior years. Given our expectations that our health care exchange business will at least breakeven and our investments in state-based contracts will begin to mitigate, we've layered in the impact of those newer businesses across the quarters. The result is that we again project the third and fourth quarters to experience the most pressure in light of the quarterly progression of health benefit ratios and the timing of marketing and open enrollment across our lines of business.
I'll conclude my discussion this morning with a few words around capital allocation. As Bruce said in his remarks, disciplined capital allocation is a key component of Humana's investment thesis. At the time of our third quarter release, we announced a significant increase in our share repurchase authorization and a commitment to accelerate our buyback activity. We've held true to that commitment and maintained our expectation to buy back $1 billion in stock by June of this year with approximately $630 million of that already completed. We would also expect to continue share repurchases in the back half of the year.
Aside from share repurchase activity, we are continuing to evaluate all of our businesses to ensure that they fit strategically within our portfolio and our earning their cost of capital will have a convincing plan to do so. To the extent a business does not meet these criteria, that business will be restructured or divested. We expect to continue to update you on the progress of this review over the coming months.
With that, we will open the lines up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please introduce the first caller."

With regard to Puerto Rico, I'd rather not go into the details of the numbers there, but we are losing money in that market. We lost more this quarter than we expected. And really, that's driven by the fact that the dynamics in that market are different. The medical management of those members is different. We got hit by uncompensated care adjustments that we had to take into our results that weren't in the bids because they came after the bids. And so 2014 was a very difficult year for that market. On the duals side, we're continuing to build out that infrastructure. As we think about investments for 2014, I would say the duals came in slightly higher, individual came in slightly lower. So that's sort of how I'd calibrate those results on the Retail segment."

Bruce earlier talked about North Carolina, and that's the market where we have 4.5 stars, and some of the competitors that were there before didn't have as high a Star score. And we think that, that, in terms of the premium and benefits that we're able to put on The Street, helps to position us better. So I would say that that's one aspect that we're seeing play itself out. We're obviously very pleased about that. As respects the number of members that we get from competitors versus fee-for-service, I would tell you that, that number, as we've looked at it, is about 50-50. Agents generally -- a significant part of the agent growth occurs during the ROI as opposed to during the AEP itself. A lot of favorable dynamics. And again, as Brian and Bruce both pointed out, we're pretty pleased with the way that this AEP played out for us."

It's lowering the cost of Medicare and you get affected. But I do think long term the Medicare Advantage offers a significantly better advantage as you look at the comprehensive nature of it. It's just not about the price. And also what we found is about the integration of the services and the systems that's provided there.

29618,278392365,754605,"Humana Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2015",2015-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Humana Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, Humana reported full year adjusted earnings per share for 2014 of $7.51, in line with our 2014 guidance. This past year was particularly dynamic across the sector and presented a number o",1364,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, Humana reported full year adjusted earnings per share for 2014 of $7.51, in line with our 2014 guidance. This past year was particularly dynamic across the sector and presented a number of challenges as well as some new opportunities. Humana continues to rise to these challenges through our consumer-focused strategy and integrated care delivery model, while simultaneously investing in new growth areas. As a result, we are reiterating our guidance for 2015 earnings of $8.50 to $9 per share, a growth rate of approximately 17% at the midpoint. 
As we outlined at our Investor Day this past December, Humana's investment thesis is driven by our customer-focused integrated care delivery model and the related results. This thesis includes 4 key elements: continued robust organic membership and revenue growth; proven superior clinical operating performance; disciplined capital allocation, which all lead to a sustainable competitive advantage.
I'll begin our discussion this morning with a focus on our membership and revenue growth. We recently raised our net Medicare Advantage membership growth expectations for 2015 to 300,000 to 350,000, primarily as a result of a strong sales during -- or results of strong sales during the recently completed annual election period or AEP.
And looking at the January enrollment data from CMS, Humana continues to lead the industry in membership growth for individual Medicare Advantage plans. The CMS data indicates that Humana accounted for nearly 70% of the individual MA net enrollment growth across the sector. In fact, approximately 52% of our individual gross sales during the AEP came from competitor Medicare Advantage offerings.
From a geographic perspective, we did not see strong specific concentration with this growth, but did experience our highest membership gains in North Carolina. We are pleased with this individual MA growth as it complements the group MA membership increase we experienced in that state in 2014, making this a very important Humana market.
With a large base of Medicare members, we are now able to bring other Humana offerings, like HumanaOne, to the state. As you'll see from Slide 8, approximately 73% of our individual MA net growth was in HMO offerings, including current Humana members who chose to move to an -- into an HMO in 2015. This compares to 64% in 2014. 
Our HMO offerings continue to provide the highest level of engagement from both a member and provider perspective and also have the highest retention rate of our Medicare products. Over the past few years, we've discussed our integrated care delivery model and its 3 core elements: improve the consumer experience by simplifying the interaction, resulting in a trusting relationship; based on the trusting relationship, engage members in clinical programs; and offering assistance to providers and transitioning from fee-for-service to value-based reimbursement. 
This strategy has provided superior clinical operating performance, resulting in a sustainable competitive advantage. Over the past few years, membership growth in Star scores provide evidence of the success of this strategy. We believe there are 5 key points of influence that drive our superior clinical operating performance. Although I will not go through all the detail on the slide today, I did want to highlight how we are already been working with our new 2015 members, allowing us to begin to get to know them and allow for timely enrollment in the proper clinical programs.
I'll begin with wellness and prevention. Staying in tune with the health of our members is a major focus of our wellness and prevention efforts. This all begins with our new member welcome calls. These calls begin shortly after the onset of the AEP this past October. These outreach efforts have already resulted in the completion of over 160,000 health risk assessments. Data from the welcome calls, health risk assessments and our sophisticated predictive modeling have already come together to identify more than 46,000 of our members for referrals to our Humana At Home.
Our wellness efforts have a strong focus on gaps in care. In 2014, we closed approximately 4.3 million gaps in care for our members, driven by improvement in preventative screenings. Better still, we are very pleased that approximately 1.3 million of our members across all lines of business received preventative treatment on schedule.
Turning to the primary care point of influence. We are pleased to report that approximately 55% of our net membership growth during the AEP is for members associated with providers in value-based arrangements. Remember that we offer providers a continuum of opportunities to increase the integration of care. This includes performance bonuses, shared savings and shared risk relationships.
We see HHS announcement last week on its move to paying providers based on value as further validation that our integrated care delivery strategy is on track. We look forward to working with HHS in developing new payment models and continuing to assist providers in the transition to value-based payment.
Health care at home will also be an important element of the care for many of our new members. As we've shared with you in the past, our Humana At Home programs do a terrific job of providing members with clinical support and care that often results in a significantly higher number of days they spend at their homes instead of in an acute care facility. 
Importantly, as we evaluate each of the points of influence I've just described, as well as our pharmacy interactions with our members, we utilize advanced analytics, including sophisticated predictive models, to provide insights that are both actionable and drive value for our members. All these metrics are indicative of the solid value proposition we continue to offer Medicare beneficiaries in the face of rate reductions. Successfully engaging our members in clinical programs is proving we can assist our members with their health needs. This is allowing us to offer stability in their premiums and benefits, and reduce the complexity of navigating the health care system and helps produce the robust organic growth we are sharing with you today.
Looking at our other offerings. Humana's stand-alone PDP membership continues to experience strong growth with the bulk of the growth in our low-priced Walmart offering. This, together with growth in our Medicare Advantage membership, drives higher use of the services in our Healthcare Services segment, benefiting the enterprise overall.
Turning to our HumanaOne membership. As we evaluate recent health care exchange enrollment data, we believe it comports well with the pricing assumptions we made for 2015. As we've indicated on prior calls, our 2015 pricing appropriately assume the ultimate elimination of 2 of the 3Rs. We continue to be pleased with the mix of our membership, both across the metal tiers and by age distribution. We also believe that the 55 to 64 age ranges are opportunity to develop relationships with these members before they age into Medicare Advantage.
I also would want to highlight for you today something innovative we are doing in the Employer Group business. In the latter part of 2013, we introduced to our employer customers a product we call Total Health, which turns any standard medical plan of the employers choosing into an integrated health and well-being solution that encourages participation in HumanaVitality, health coaching and clinical programs. Employee participation results in employer discounts, which is resulting in the shift of our single-year contract to a multiyear relationship that is creating employer solutions to not only cost, but also productivity.
Employer receptivity to the Total Health product is high with membership now at approximately 100,000 versus less than 400,000 at the end of 2013. We anticipate in the future these wellness programs and services will be complementary to employers choosing private and public exchange models. 
In conclusion, we continue to be pleased with our prospects for 2015 and beyond. The engagement of our associates and focus on the consumer through our integrated care delivery model has never been stronger. We believe that will result in the continuation of our superior clinical operating performance and a sustainable competitive advantage for quite some time to come.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian for a more detailed discussion of our financials and our commitment to disciplined capital allocation."

As Bruce said in his remarks, 2014 was an unusually dynamic year full of opportunities and challenges. The growth in our Medicare business was substantial and was supplemented by the power of our Healthcare Services segment, which has prospered, while making a truly positive difference in our members' lives. Our Employer Group business capitalized on the late 2013 rollout of an exciting new offering in the form of Total Health, while also ending the year on a high note in terms of financial performance. All this transpired while we invested heavily in new growth opportunities, both HumanaOne and our state-based businesses, which we believe will generate significant returns for our shareholders down the road.
We are pleased that our full year adjusted EPS came in just above the midpoint of our guidance at $7.51 per share. As we closed out the year, there were a few items that adversely affected our 2014 results, but we do not see any of these significantly impacting our 2015 guidance. 
Our Retail segment pretax earnings finished the year below our guidance range. This was primarily attributable to the severity of the flu season, slightly higher investment spending for our duals and state-based contracts and deterioration in the results for our Puerto Rico Medicare business, which continues to be a difficult market for us.
With regard to the flu, hospital inpatient admissions peaked in late December, early January, but have since abated and have returned to more normalized levels. I should hasten to add that utilization more broadly remains benign and within expectations.
With regard to the duals, we continue to build out our infrastructure and are well positioned heading into 2015 to significantly reduce our investments, which we have committed to do.
Turning to the Employer Group segment. Our 2014 earnings results ended meaningfully above the upper end of our guidance range. While the flu did have some adverse impact on the Employer Group results, these were more than offset by lower medical claims utilization that we saw in both our commercial and group Medicare businesses. It is also important to note the effort that our Employer Group team has made to reduce administrative costs, which was also a significant driver of the segment's full year results.
Finally, our effective tax rate came in above the range of our previous guidance. There were several factors driving this, including the associated tax ramifications of higher losses in our Puerto Rico Medicare operations, which are nondeductible for U.S. income tax purposes, as well as lower tax-exempt investment income. We've evaluated each of these factors closely and have confidence that the 2015 guidance points we shared with you this morning encompass any continuing impact of each of these items.
Turning now to 2015. The majority of the guidance points we shared with you last quarter are unchanged. This slide summarizes the more significant changes since our last earnings call.
As we disclosed in a Form 8-K filing last month, we revised our Medicare Advantage and stand-alone PDP enrollment guidance to reflect the results of the 2015 AEP. Our higher projection for Medicare Advantage enrollment resulted in an increase to our revenue guidance that more than offset the revenue impact of the lower expectations for stand-alone PDP membership. As we have discussed in the past, the higher membership in our MA plans from the annual enrollment process will have a nominal impact on our Retail insurance segment performance this year. While there will be a favorable impact on the Healthcare Services segment's home-based business from the higher Medicare Advantage membership, this will be offset by the impact of the revised stand-alone PDP membership will have on Humana Pharmacy, as PDP members in our low price point offering tend to use our wholly owned mail order and specialty pharmacies at rates slightly higher than our MA members.
One other element of our 2015 guidance points that we updated today is our projected accruals for the premium stabilization programs, commonly called the 3Rs. As Bruce shared in his remarks, we now have more color around the mix of our membership distribution among the metal tiers and by age range. Having evaluated that data, we are comfortable lowering our projection for full year accruals for the 3Rs by approximately $50 million at the midpoint. We now expect the net receivables for 2015 to be less than half of the level they were compared to the balances we accrued at the end of 2014.
As we've noted in prior calls, our pricing strategy for 2015 included significantly lowering reliance on the 3Rs, and we are still on track for 2015 to achieve at a minimum breakeven results.
With regard to the risk corridors, we believe that the 2014 $51 million net receivable that we disclosed this morning is indeed collectible based on statutory and administrative actions. Further, any 2014 amounts must first be satisfied before subsequent years are paid. Finally, for 2015, the risk corridor receivable that we are currently forecasting is insignificant.
Turning to our operating cash flows. We have been around 1.5x net income for some time now, and we anticipate maintaining that quality of earnings metric again in 2015. This morning, we raised our guidance for operating cash flows by approximately $200 million, driven primarily by the timing of certain working capital items. While our days claims payable declined sequentially by 2.8 days to 44.7, this was primarily due to the increase in capitation payments as we continue to grow the number of providers under risk-based contracts as well as the growth in our long-term support services business, whose providers get paid monthly. 
Additionally, our normal December decline in claims inventories, driven by the holiday season and higher staffing associated with preparing for new members coming on January 1, was magnified by the relatively late HumanaOne enrollment and the associated pended claims, which we paid down in the fourth quarter.
I'll now turn to our view of the quarterly breakdown of earnings for 2015. Though we do not provide specific quarterly guidance, we did want to give you a sense for the key drivers of performance among the quarters, as we have done in prior years. Given our expectations that our health care exchange business will at least break even and our investments in state-based contracts will begin to mitigate, we've layered in the impact of those newer businesses across the quarters. The result is that we again project the third and fourth quarters to experience the most pressure in light of the quarterly progression of health benefit ratios and the timing of marketing and open enrollment across our lines of business.
I'll conclude my discussion this morning with a few words around capital allocation. As Bruce said in his remarks, disciplined capital allocation is a key component of Humana's investment thesis. At the time of our third quarter release, we announced a significant increase in our share repurchase authorization and a commitment to accelerate our buyback activity. We've held true to that commitment and maintain our expectation to buy back $1 billion in stock by June of this year with approximately $630 million of that already completed. We would also expect to continue share repurchases in the back half of the year.
Aside from share repurchase activity, we are continuing to evaluate all of our businesses to ensure that they fit strategically within our portfolio and are earning their cost of capital or have a convincing plan to do so. To the extent a business does not meet these criteria, that business will be restructured or divested. We expect to continue to update you on the progress of this review over the coming months.

With regard to Puerto Rico, I'd rather not go into the details of the numbers there, but we are losing money in that market. We lost more this quarter than we expected. And really, that's driven by the fact that the dynamics in that market are different. The medical management of those members is different. We got hit by uncompensated care adjustments that we had to take into our results that weren't in the bids because they came after the bids. And so 2014 was a very difficult year for that market. On the duals side, we're continuing to build out that infrastructure. As we think about investments for 2014, I would say the duals came in slightly higher, individual came in slightly lower. So that's sort of how I'd calibrate those results on the Retail segment."

So I would say that that's one aspect that we're seeing play itself out. We're obviously very pleased about that. As respects the number of members that we get from competitors versus fee-for-service, I would tell you that, that number, as we've looked at it, is about 50-50. Agents generally -- a significant part of the agent growth occurs during the ROI [ph] as opposed to during the AEP itself. A lot of favorable dynamics.

I think we look at that as an opportunity for us both in helping providers and, at the same time, continuing to advance the Medicare Advantage positioning. In regards to does it affect the benchmark, I think, is where you're getting to. Over time, it will affect the benchmark, I think, in any kind of plan that's there. It's lowering the cost of Medicare and you get affected. But I do think long term the Medicare Advantage offers a significantly better advantage as you look at the comprehensive nature of it. It's just not about the price. And also what we found is about the integration of the services and the assistance that's provided there. But at the same time, we realize that we have to be better than the competition at our clinical programs, and that competition is both within Medicare Advantage and also Medicare as a whole."

We purposely tried to downsize as respect to our activities relative to the AEPs so that we could shrink that membership. The premium that we get from the federal government for Medicare is solid. As Brian alluded to earlier, the government made some change in the way that they pay hospitals after our bids were finalized for 2014. That was a big drag on our results. And the other thing that Brian mentioned, the loss of focus, because we did lose the Medicaid contract and the clinical model that was commensurate with that, negatively impacted our Medicare results.

This morning, Humana announced first quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per share of $2.47, up 5% from the first quarter of last year. Our pretax earnings of $744 million were a record high and we believe are a clear demonstration on the progress we continue to make as a company. Further, we continue to have confidence in our full year guidance for adjusted earnings of $8.50 to $9 per share.
Our more significant achievements during the quarter included substantial membership growth in our Medicare Advantage stand-alone PDP and HumanaOne products; the recent launch of our population health technology business, Transcend Insights; announcement of the pending sale of our Concentra business; and completion of our $500 million accelerated share repurchase program. I'll begin with our Medicare Advantage growth.
As we shared with you last quarter, we experienced another successful Medicare enrollment season for 2015. Individual Medicare Advantage membership at March 31, 2015, was up 11% versus the end of the fourth quarter 2014, up 14% year-over-year. We continue to see the positive impact for our members of stability in our value proposition, as well as high Star quality ratings.
A recent McKinsey study on the 2015 Star ratings concludes that HMO plans performed best on an enrollment weighted basis. Approximately 56% of our individual members are in HMO plans compared to 4 -- 53% a year ago. Further, the McKinsey study indicates that plans built around integrated delivery networks achieve higher average Star ratings.
CMS recently eliminated certain fixed thresholds for 4 Star ratings for 2017 bonus year. These changes may result in some pressure on our overall Star ratings, but we believe we will sustain our solid competitive advantage. We expect we will maintain our high-quality ratings due to our successful integrated care delivery model. Our model includes use of data analytics to engage members in preventative measures and wellness programs that close clinical gaps-in-care.
In some, we believe the combination of a solid value proposition and a high-quality ratings are critical to attracting new membership and retaining our existing membership base. Our projected 2015 net new membership gains of approximately 12%, including a voluntary retention rate of approximately 90%, are all helping to validate this belief.
CMS has also recently released its final Medicare rates for 2016. While we were encouraged by the average rate increase for the first time in 7 years, this average still lags fee-for-service medical cost trends. Additionally, CMS' transition to the new risk adjustment model will negatively impact certain of our markets, better leading in our country in value-based reimbursement methods and holistically assisting members with multiple complex chronic conditions, both which are key goals for CMS.
As we prepare our Medicare bids for 2016, we will seek to minimize any disruption that rate changes may cause to Medicare beneficiaries while holding firm on our 4.5% to 5% pretax margin target. The continuing investment in our clinical model are expected to provide some offsets to rate pressures that will vary, of course, from market to market. Those investments were highlighted this month by Humana's @Home acquisition of Your Home Advantage, a leading provider of nurse practitioner in home visits. 
Additionally, we believe our focus on the consumer experience and our proprietary market point distribution channel will be important elements in solidifying our relationship with our members as we face these rate challenges at the market level.
Turning to our stand-alone PDP offerings. We also experienced significant growth for these products with membership up 10% since the end of 2014 and 14% to the first quarter of last year, primarily in our low price point offerings.
And now we'll spend some time in our investments in health care exchanges and state-based contracts. We're pleased that HumanaOne membership has continued to grow nicely. While we'll continue to project at least breakeven results for our HumanaOne business, our projected increased reliance on the 3 Rs is driven primarily by the results for the State of Georgia and our outer network provider usage. We believe both are isolated and addressable. Brian will discuss each of these factors in his remarks.
Entering a new customer segment is never an easy task. However, we believe that health care exchanges are a leading example of the ongoing movement to the retail model where we have been so effective in Medicare. We continue to be highly targeted in terms of where we will participate in health care exchanges with a strong emphasis on current Medicare Advantage markets to enable customer migration as member's life situations change.
Our expansions into health care exchanges and our state-based contracts are deepening our partnership with local providers -- local market providers as we develop local market scale through multiple product offerings. 
State-based Medicaid membership was now includes those members associated with dual demonstration programs is up significantly both on a sequential basis and year-over-year. We continue to monitor the RFP pipeline and plan to pursue other state-based opportunities later in 2015. These opportunities would not be as a viable if it weren't for our integrated care delivery model. 
Importantly, we continue to show progress in key integrated care delivery model metrics. Some examples include the number of individual Medicare Advantage members covered by value-based arrangements is now more than 54%. This is particularly encouraging, given the substantial increase in membership this quarter. Membership in our Humana Chronic Care Program is up 10% since the end of the year and 56% versus the prior year.
Adoption of mail order pharmacy among our members continues to grow as we highlight this benefit more fully during the sales process and welcome calls. Individual Medicare Advantage mail-order penetration is now, on an average, approaching 35%.
We continue to focus on reaching out to members with gaps-in-care and have sent over 4 million proactive messages to 2.5 million members to prevent gaps-in-care. These actions have resulted in a gap closure rate of more than 30%. As a leader in both the development and execution of value-based payment models and technology driven population health management analytics, we support trends that encourage care coordination across all payers.
In that context, this quarter, we launched Transcend Insights, which leverages the population health capabilities we have developed in our Medicare Advantage business. Our goal is to provide payer agnostic tools to our provider partners, allowing more of our members to be in value-based reimbursement models. As we've shared with you in the past, value-based arrangements have proven to lead to higher heat scores, lower medical costs and higher membership satisfaction.
Before closing, I'd like to spend a moment on our recently announced sale of Concentra. As we've said in previous calls, we review our various businesses on an ongoing basis to ensure each earns its cost of capital and is aligned with our integrated care delivery strategy. The Concentra acquisition was part of a multipronged approach to increase our capabilities of managing risk through primary care physicians. Our subsequent MSO acquisitions and joint venture investments provided a more integrated primary care platform than Concentra. Although it did not ultimately fit strategically, we are able to achieve an attractive price that will result in a gain versus our initial investment.
Brian will speak more to the details of this transaction in his remarks. We expect the transaction will close in the next few weeks. I want to thank all of our Concentra associates for their dedication to the consumer and to our company. Several of you have asked for an update on our PBM evaluation. That work continues, and we expect to provide a full debriefing on our analysis during the third quarter earnings call in November.
In summary, we believe our robust organic membership and revenue growth, together with our proven superior clinical operating performance and disciplined capital allocation, all come together to provide our sustainable competitive advantage. Excluding the one-time gains that we expect from the Concentra sale, we continue to expect our full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $8.50 to $9 and look forward to providing you updates as the year progresses.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian for a more detailed discussion of our financials."
29618,278392395,796979,"Humana Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2015",2015-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Humana Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. As Bruce mentioned, the first quarter of 2015 produced strong results and continues to demonstrate the successful implementation of our integrated care delivery model.

As Bruce mentioned, the first quarter of 2015 produced strong results and continues to demonstrate the successful implementation of our integrated care delivery model. The attractiveness of our product offerings is resonating with our customers, as demonstrated by the continuing increases in our Medicare Advantage, stand-alone PDP and exchange membership.
Consequently, we have raised full year membership expectations for both stand-alone PDP and HumanaOne. Stand-alone PDP is being driven by higher retention that we are seeing post the open enrollment period, which is largely the results of fewer auto enrollees being reassigned. I'll speak more to the HumanaOne business shortly.
With regard to our Medicare Advantage growth, early indications for our new members are positive as we evaluate individual market growth and performance. Additionally, the growth in our PBM and Humana At Home businesses remains unabated with not only more volume driven by membership growth, but also deeper penetration in terms of increased engagement, as well as benefits from scale that are driving results.
First quarter revenues for the Healthcare Services segment rose 26% versus the prior year and pretax earnings are up 24% year-over-year. The quarter had several developments that will be the focus of my remarks today. These include the following: The increase in our projected 3R receivables for the year; medical utilization and prior period development; days in claims payable and cash flows from operations; the earnings implications of the Concentra transaction; and capital allocation.
Let's begin with our exchange business and the premium stabilization programs commonly called the 3Rs. Our conviction in our health care exchange strategy remained strong. We continue to focus on our key growth markets by offering high-value networks to drive affordability and access for our customers. We believe that this strategy has been effective in successfully establishing a new growth business while providing a compelling products that our members value. 
Over time, we believe that HumanaOne will not only contribute meaningfully to our results, but it will also, as Bruce emphasized, advance our objectives of local market presence and scale with providers while allowing us to offer a range of products that are relevant to our customers no matter of their age or income circumstances.
As with any startup business, we have had our successes, as well as our challenges. In terms of successes, our ACA-compliant membership for HumanaOne is up 38% from the end of 2014, well ahead of our previous expectations. This was driven by better-than-forecast sales and lower-than-anticipated attrition. Consequently, we have adjusted our aggregate HumanaOne guidance to reflect higher projected membership in the ACA-compliant business, which we also believe results in us approaching the scale we need for long-term success.
We continue to forecast that we will have at least breakeven results in 2015 and earn a reasonable return on capital in 2016, albeit, that achievement of breakeven results this year now includes higher reliance on the 3Rs than previously anticipated coming into 2015. 
As you've seen from our release, we have increased our net 2015 3R guidance range to $450 million to $550 million, with reinsurance accounting for approximately 75% and risk adjustment and risk corridors accounting for approximately 25% of the total.
As we have discussed in the past, there is an interplay between risk adjustment and risk corridors. And that if we don't get the risk adjustment exactly right, a meaningful part of the balance, either positive or negative, is captured to the risk corridors.
As we evaluate our financial performance to date, including runoff claims from 2014, the drivers of the increase in full year receivables related to the 3Rs are quantifiable and addressable. The first 2 Bruce mentioned in his remarks are higher-than-anticipated out of network utilization and poor results in our Georgia market. The last driver of the higher receivables is simply a function of having more members than we had previously expected.
I'll start with out of network utilization. As the exchanges were rolling out across the nation, we believe there would be time period during which our members will be getting accustomed to our efficient network products. Consequently, we permitted out of network utilization for the small proportion of our members who did not stay in network to avoid disruption, notwithstanding the products design, which underpin the affordability that our members seek.
Our provider network team has thoroughly evaluated our networks in light of our membership levels by market, and we are very satisfied in our level of network adequacy. As a consequence, we are in the process of implementing stricter enforcement of network utilization by working closely with nonnetwork providers, as well as educating our members on the product.
Higher levels of in network utilization are anticipated to ensure the continued affordability of our health care exchange offerings, as well as aligned with our pricing assumptions for the remainder of the year and for 2016.
After adjusting for the out of network usage, our markets across the country, including our largest HumanaOne market in Florida, are performing within expectations with the notable exception of Georgia. One of the challenges we faced in both 2013 and 2014 was the immaturity of the claims data we had available at the time we set our health care exchange pricing for the following year versus what we would have preferred, specifically, more detail regarding statewide market conditions and health status based on significant exchange claims data.
To help address this, we juxtaposed the limited Georgia claims data we had against claims data nationally for states that we believe had similar utilization patterns and mix of likely enrollees to derive assumptions around the population health of each estate, and in turn, set our pricing.
Recent actuarial claims data for the State of Georgia now indicate that enrollees in the state as a whole are skewing more towards being a less healthy state population than we had believed and have priced for. Consequently, we are accruing both a risk adjustment and risk corridor receivable.
It's important to recall that this was the original intent behind the premium stabilization programs, namely earlier protection in this circumstance. We are, of course, incorporating our emerging experience into our actuarial assumptions and are taking the appropriate targeted actions through pricing and product design when we file our 2016 rates in the next few weeks to ensure that Georgia's results will be back on track for 2016 without reliance on the risk corridors.
As I mentioned, the remaining driver of the higher 3R balance relates to higher-than-projected growth of our ACA-compliant business. This will result in higher 2015 receivable so than we had expected primarily associated with reinsurance.
Finally, a quick word on our 2014 3R accruals. As you will see, we have decreased reinsurance by approximately $50 million and have increased our risk corridors by around $40 million as an offset. As we have evaluated the runoff of our 2014 claims, fewer of our members that anticipated will hit the reinsurance attachment point, which is the reason we have made this change. 
Turning to medical utilization. We are watching very closely the hospital inpatient admissions per thousand data for our Medicare Advantage business. We have seen some of the hospital published data, which suggest higher Medicare usage of inpatient services and have also witnessed in the last number of weeks an uptick in inpatient authorizations. For Medicare Advantage, we have projected a decline year-over-year in hospital admissions. And for the first quarter, we have seen that decline bear out. In other words, our trend benders continue to result in lower admissions.
However, during the last weeks of the quarter and into April, we are seeing an elevated level of authorizations for hospitals admissions, which although still declining, are slightly higher than we had anticipated. Importantly, we have also seen data throughout the quarter that would suggest our cost per admit is lower than forecast, implying lower severity conditions are driving the admissions.
While it is too early to draw any conclusions from what I just described, especially as admissions tend to fluctuate, it is something that bears close watching as the actual claims experience develops over the coming months.
As was highlighted in this morning's press release, we did see a lower level of favorable prior period development than in last year's first quarter. A meaningful portion of the lower prior period development was anticipated due to the PPD for the first quarter of 2014 having been unusually high and as a result of claims processing changes involving the implementation in early 2014 of a front-end review for Medicare claims.
Front-end review enables us to improve the initial accuracy of claim payments, reducing the amount of overpayments recaptured later as part of prior period development. PPD was also adversely impacted by fourth quarter flu claims that came through in the first quarter of 2015 across our lines of business.
I will now turn to the balance sheet and operating cash flow. I'll start with days in claims payable or DCP. You will note that we have revised the DCP table to exclude reinsurance associated with the 3Rs. Given that reinsurance reduces benefits expense but does not impact the related benefits payable, it skews DCP trends over the 3-year period of the program.
Days in claims payable during the first quarter of 2015 declined by less than a day, driven primarily by the typical first quarter increase in Part D claims associated with our Medicare Advantage business. That impact is included in the all other category of the DCP roll forward table in our press release. Recall that our stand-alone PDP business is excluded from our days and claims payable calculation. 
Much like our stand-alone PDP offerings, our Medicare Advantage Part D benefit designs generally have the plan picking up substantially all the initial pharmacy claims, but covering less of the benefit as the year progresses. While the pharmacy expense associated with these members is in our DCP calculation, the related payable is relatively small due to the speed of processing pharmacy claims.
Higher capitation and provider settlements also resulted in a slight decrease to DCP during the quarter. But importantly, this was more than offset by an increase in unprocessed and processed claims inventories.
Cash flow from operations is down versus the first quarter of 2014, as higher net income was more than offset by working capital items. Specifically, the increase in benefits payable, which accompanies growing membership, was smaller year-over-year due to the lower level of overall growth in average membership given the outsized growth we experienced in 2014. This pressured the cash flow from operations on a comparative basis by approximately $250 million in the quarter. Working capital needs for our growing Pharmacy business primarily accounted for the remainder of the delta in the first quarter cash flows.
For the year, our operating cash flow guidance is largely unchanged, other than reducing operating cash flow by guidance -- cash flow guidance by approximately $200 million at the midpoint, primarily reflecting the increase in the 3R receivable that I just discussed previously, as well as the pending sale of Concentra.
Before closing, I'll spend just a few minutes on capital allocation and earnings guidance. As Bruce said in his remarks, we announced this quarter the sale of our Concentra business. The timing of the signing of the definitive agreement triggered the need to recognize the gain on the establishment of a deferred tax asset. And thus, the $0.35 per share gain was included in our first quarter GAAP results.
We expect this transaction to close in the next few weeks, so we have included the full impact of the transaction in our earnings guidance, both from a GAAP and an adjusted perspective. 
For GAAP, we are including a total projected gain from the sale in the range of $1.35 to $1.45 per share, including the $0.35 tax gain. On an adjusted basis, excluding this one-time gain, we continue to forecast earnings per share in the range of $8.50 to $9 per share.
The sale of Concentra is expected to generate net of taxes and deal expenses approximately $1 billion in net proceeds. Before any anticipated use of these proceeds, the sale will results in $0.11 of 2015 EPS dilution. We continue to look for value-enhancing acquisitions, such as the Your Home Advantage deal we recently announced that will advance our in home capabilities, as well as pursue additional share repurchase opportunistically.
However, given where we are in the year, it is likely that a good portion of this dilution will persist. 
With respect to share repurchase, this quarter, we completed our $500 million accelerated share repurchase program. Additionally, holding true on our commitment to buy back $1 billion of stock by June of this year, we have entered into a 10b5-1 plan that we expect will complete that goal. You will note, however, that we have raised our guidance slightly for the average fully diluted share count due largely to the higher-than-anticipated buyback price, which will have a several [ph] cent negative EPS impact.
Finally, our work around optimizing our portfolio continues to ensure that each of our businesses fit strategically and earns its cost of capital. More generally, we are encouraged by our progress in our prospects, all driven by execution around our integrated care delivery strategy. 
With that, we will open the lines up for your questions. Operator, please introduce the first caller."

And we wondered how long before you would dial in. With respect to Georgia, as Brian said earlier, one of the things that we did at the very beginning was to take our individual legacy business and do relativities to our small group block of business because that was a guarantee issue population. We thought that was fairly close to what might ultimately happen on the exchanges. And after that, and that was done local market by local market, we evaluated morbidities across a national basis with the help of an outside consulting actuarial firm. And as a result of that overall evaluation from a national perspective, we've lowered some of our market's expected morbidities. And with respects to Georgia, while other markets turned out just fine relative to that pricing philosophy, Georgia didn't. Another part of the Georgia issue has to do with the Platinum plans, which you asked about in the past. One of the things that we're seeing with the platinum plans is that the philosophy or the strategy that we've enumerated in the past with you and others is that you need to have documentable risk conditions for the members that are heavier utilizers. And as we study the Georgia population, as we're doing some of our risk adjustment work, we're seeing that the Georgia population, although have year utilizers, don't have documentable risk conditions, which doesn't allow us then to get risk adjustment for them.

I think we talked about that with the large group business, we were going to wind that down over the next several years because we are not a national player and we can't compete in that space. But we are focused on what we call our sweet spot of smaller case sizes. And over the last 6 months, we performed reasonably well with our sweet spot focus. You may recall that in the fourth quarter, we grew very nicely with our small or focused business. This past quarter, we have seen some shrinkage in our fully insured smaller Capesize membership as a lot of our competitors are implementing their new rates relative to community rating. And we're seeing a little bit of an aggressive posture in some of the states that we do business. That will ultimately change over time. And we think that, that will work itself out. We feel very confident with our focus on the smaller case sizes. Over the next several years, we're going to be evaluating our Group business. And again, feel very good about its prospects for continued profitability. And it serves very nicely as a complement to our focus on local market scale. We talked a lot about that with our Medicare business, our individual business, our Medicaid business and our Group business in certain of the bar of what we referred to as bold move markets.

Our pretax earnings of $744 million were a record high and we believe",1369,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.
This morning, Humana announced first quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per share of $2.47, up 5% from the first quarter of last year. Our pretax earnings of $744 million were a record high and we believe are a clear demonstration on the progress we continue to make as a company. Further, we continue to have confidence in our full year guidance for adjusted earnings of $8.50 to $9 per share.
Our more significant achievements during the quarter included substantial membership growth in our Medicare Advantage, stand-alone PDP and HumanaOne products; the recent launch of our population health technology business, Transcend Insights; announcement of the pending sale of our Concentra business; and completion of our $500 million accelerated share repurchase program. I'll begin with our Medicare Advantage growth.
As we shared with you last quarter, we experienced another successful Medicare enrollment season for 2015. Individual Medicare Advantage membership at March 31, 2015, was up 11% versus the end of the fourth quarter 2014 up 14% year-over-year. We continue to see the positive impact for our members of stability in our value proposition as well as high Star quality ratings. A recent McKinsey study on the 2015 Star ratings concludes that HMO plans perform best on an enrollment-weighted basis. Approximately 56% of our individual members are in HMO plans compared to 53% a year ago. Further, the McKinsey study indicates that plans built around integrated delivery networks achieve higher average Star ratings.
CMS recently eliminated certain fixed thresholds for 4 Star ratings for 2017 bonus year. These changes may result in some pressure on our overall Star ratings, but we believe we will sustain our solid competitive advantage. We expect we will maintain our high-quality ratings due to our successful integrated care delivery model. Our model includes use of data analytics to engage members in preventative measures and wellness programs that close clinical gaps in care.
In sum, we believe the combination of a solid value proposition and a -- high-quality ratings are critical to attracting new membership and retaining our existing membership base. Our projected 2015 net new membership gains of approximately 12%, including a voluntary retention rate of approximately 90%, are all helping to validate this belief.
CMS has also recently released its final Medicare rates for 2016. While we were encouraged by the average rate increase for the first time in 7 years, this average still lags fee-for-service medical cost trends. Additionally, CMS' transition to the new risk adjustment model will negatively impact certain of our markets that are leading the country in value-based reimbursement methods and holistically assisting members with multiple complex chronic conditions, both which are key goals for CMS. As we prepare our Medicare bids for 2016, we will seek to minimize any disruption that rate changes may cause to Medicare beneficiaries while holding firm on our 4.5% to 5% pretax margin target. The continuing investment in our clinical model are expected to provide some offsets to rate pressures that will vary, of course, from market to market. Those investments were highlighted this month by Humana's -- At Home's acquisition of Your Home Advantage, a leading provider of nurse practitioner in home visits. Additionally, we believe our focus on the consumer experience and our proprietary market point distribution channel will be important elements in solidifying our relationship with our members as we face these rate challenges at the market level.
Turning to our stand-alone PDP offerings. We also experienced significant growth for these products, with membership up 10% since the end of 2014 and 14% to the first quarter of last year, primarily in our low-price-point offerings.
I now will spend some time on our investments in health care exchanges and state-based contracts.
We're pleased that HumanaOne membership has continued to grow nicely. While we will continue to project at least breakeven results for our HumanaOne business, our projected increased reliance on the 3Rs is driven primarily by the results for the State of Georgia and our out-of-network provider usage. We believe both are isolated and addressable. Brian will discuss each of these factors in his remarks.
Entering a new customer segment is never an easy task. However, we believe that health care exchanges are a leading example of the ongoing movement to the Retail model, where we have been so effective in Medicare. We continue to be highly targeted in terms of where we will participate in health care exchanges, with a strong emphasis on current Medicare Advantage markets, to enable customer migration as members' life situations change. Our expansions into health care exchanges and our state-based contracts are deepening our partnership with local providers -- local market providers as we develop local market scale through multiple product offerings. State-based Medicaid membership which now includes those members associated with dual demonstration programs is up significantly both on a sequential basis and year-over-year. We continue to monitor the RFP pipeline and plan to pursue other state-based opportunities later in 2015.
These opportunities would not be as viable if it weren't for our integrated care delivery model. Importantly, we continue to show progress in key integrated care delivery model metrics. Some examples include the number of individual Medicare Advantage members covered by value-based arrangements is now more than 54%. This is particularly encouraging giving the substantial increase in membership this quarter. Membership in our Humana Chronic Care Program is up 10% since the end of the year and 56% versus the prior year. Adoption of mail-order pharmacy among our members continues to grow as we highlight this benefit more fully during the sales process and welcome calls. Individual Medicare Advantage mail-order penetration is now, on an average, approaching 35%.
We continue to focus on reaching out to members with gaps in care and have sent over 4 million proactive messages to 2.5 million members to prevent gaps in care. These actions have resulted in a gap closure rate of more than 30%.
As a leader in both the development and execution of value-based payment models and technology-driven population health management analytics, we support trends that encourage care coordination across all payers. In that context, this quarter, we launched Transcend Insights, which leverages the population health capabilities we have developed in our Medicare Advantage business. Our goal is to provide Payer-agnostic tools to our provider partners, allowing more of our members to be in value-based reimbursement models. As we've shared with you in the past, value-based arrangements have proven to lead to higher HEDIS scores, lower medical cost and higher membership satisfaction.
Before closing, I'd like to spend a moment on our recently announced sale of Concentra.
As we've said in previous calls, we review our various businesses on an ongoing basis to ensure each earns its cost of capital and is aligned with our integrated care delivery strategy. The Concentra acquisition was part of a multipronged approach to increase our capabilities of managing risk through primary care physicians. Our subsequent MSO acquisitions and joint venture investments provided a more integrated primary care platform than Concentra. Although it did not ultimately fit strategically, we were able to achieve an attractive price that will result in a gain versus our initial investment. Brian will speak more to the details of this transaction in his remarks.
We expect the transaction will close in the next few weeks. I want to thank all of our Concentra associates for their dedication to the consumer and to our company.
Several of you have asked for an update on our PBM evaluation. That work continues, and we expect to provide a full debriefing on our analysis during the Third Quarter Earnings Call in November.
In summary, we believe our robust organic membership and revenue growth, together with our proven superior clinical operating performance and disciplined capital allocation, all come together to provide our sustainable competitive advantage. Excluding the onetime gains that we expect from the Concentra sale, we continue to expect our full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $8.50 to $9 and look forward to providing you updates as the year progresses.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian for a more detailed discussion of our financials."
29618,278392395,797305,"Humana Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2015",2015-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Humana Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bruce. And good morning, everyone.As Bruce mentioned, the first quarter of 2015 produced strong results and continues to demonstrate the successful implementation of our integrated care delivery model.

As Bruce mentioned, the first quarter of 2015 produced strong results and continues to demonstrate the successful implementation of our integrated care delivery model. The attractiveness of our product offerings is resonating with our customers, as demonstrated by the continuing increases in our Medicare Advantage, stand-alone PDP and exchange membership.
Consequently, we have raised full year membership expectations for both stand-alone PDP and HumanaOne. Stand-alone PDP is being driven by higher retention that we are seeing post the open-enrollment period, which is largely the results of fewer auto enrollees being reassigned. I'll speak more to the HumanaOne business shortly. With regard to our Medicare Advantage growth, early indications for our new members are positive as we evaluate individual market growth and performance. Additionally, the growth in our PBM and Humana At Home businesses remains unabated with not only more volume driven by membership growth but also deeper penetration in terms of increased engagement, as well as benefits from scale that are driving results.
First quarter revenues for the Healthcare Services segment rose 26% versus the prior year, and pretax earnings are up 24% year-over-year.
The quarter had several developments that will be the focus of my remarks today. These include the following: the increase in our projected 3R receivables for the year, medical utilization and prior-period development, days in claims payable and cash flows from operations, the earnings implications of the Concentra transaction and capital allocation. Let's begin with our exchange business and the premium stabilization programs commonly called the 3Rs.
Our conviction in our health care exchange strategy remains strong. We continue to focus on our key growth markets by offering high-value networks to drive affordability and access for our customers. We believe that this strategy has been effective in successfully establishing a new growth business while providing a compelling product that our members value. Over time, we believe that HumanaOne will not only contribute meaningfully to our results but it will also, as Bruce emphasized, advance our objectives of local market presence and scale with providers while allowing us to offer a range of products that are relevant to our customers no matter their age or income circumstance.
As with any startup business, we've had our successes as well as our challenges. In terms of successes, our ACA-compliant membership for HumanaOne is up 38% from the end of 2014, well ahead of our previous expectations. This was driven by better-than-forecast sales and lower-than-anticipated attrition. Consequently, we have adjusted our aggregate HumanaOne guidance to reflect higher projected membership in the ACA-compliant business, which we also believe results in us approaching the scale we need for long-term success.
We continue to forecast that we will have at least breakeven results in 2015 and earn a reasonable return on capital in 2016, albeit that achievement of breakeven results this year now includes higher reliance on the 3Rs than previously anticipated coming into 2015. As you've seen from our release, we have increased our net 2015 3R guidance range to $450 million to $550 million, with reinsurance accounting for approximately 75% and risk adjustment and risk corridors accounting for approximately 25% of the total. As we have discussed in the past, there is an interplay between risk adjustment and risk corridors in that, if we don't get the risk adjustment exactly right, a meaningful part of the balance, either positive or negative, is captured through the risk corridors.
As we evaluate our financial performance to date, including runoff claims from 2014, the drivers of the increase in full year receivables related to the 3Rs are quantifiable and addressable. The first 2 Bruce mentioned in his remarks are higher-than-anticipated out-of-network utilization and poor results in our Georgia market. The last driver of the higher receivables is simply a function of having more members than we had previously expected.
I'll start with out-of-network utilization. As the exchanges were rolling out across the nation, we believe there would be a time period during which our members will be getting accustomed to our efficient network products. Consequently, we permitted out-of-network utilization for the small proportion of our members who did not stay in network to avoid disruption, notwithstanding the products designed -- product's design, which underpin the affordability that our members seek. Our provider network team has thoroughly evaluated our networks in light of our membership levels by market, and we are very satisfied in our level of network adequacy. As a consequence, we are in the process of implementing stricter enforcement of network utilization by working closely with nonnetwork providers, as well as educating our members on the products. Higher levels of in-network utilization are anticipated to ensure the continued affordability of our health care exchange offerings as well as aligned with our pricing assumptions for the remainder of the year and for 2016.
After adjusting for the out-of-network usage, our markets across the country, including our largest HumanaOne market in Florida, are performing within expectations, with the notable exception of Georgia. One of the challenges we faced in both 2013 and 2014 was the immaturity of the claims data we had available at the time we set our health care exchange pricing for the following year versus what we would have preferred, specifically, more detail regarding statewide market conditions and health status based on significant exchange claims data. To help address this, we juxtaposed the limited Georgia claims data we had against claims data nationally for states that we believe had similar utilization patterns and mix of likely enrollees to derive assumptions around the population health of each state and, in turn, set our pricing. Recent actuarial claims data for the State of Georgia now indicate that enrollees in the state as a whole are skewing more towards being a less-healthy state population than we had believed and had priced for. Consequently, we are accruing both a risk adjustment and risk corridor receivable.
It's important to recall that this was the original intent behind the premium stabilization programs, namely earlier protection, in this circumstance. We are, of course, incorporating our emerging experience into our actuarial assumptions and are taking the appropriate targeted actions through pricing and product design when we file our 2016 rates in the next few weeks to ensure that Georgia's results will be back on track for 2016 without reliance on the risk corridors.
As I mentioned, the remaining driver of the higher 3R balance relates to higher-than-projected growth of our ACA-compliant business. This will result in higher 2015 receivables than we had expected primarily associated with reinsurance.
Finally, a quick word on our 2014 3R accruals. As you will see, we have decreased reinsurance by approximately $50 million and have increased our risk corridors by around $40 million as an offset. As we've evaluated the runout of our 2014 claims, fewer of our members than anticipated will hit the reinsurance attachment point, which is the reason we have made this change.
Turning to medical utilization. We are watching very closely the hospital ""inpatient admissions per thousand"" data for our Medicare Advantage business. We have seen some of the hospital published data which suggest higher Medicare usage of inpatient services and have also witnessed in the last number of weeks an uptick in inpatient authorizations. For Medicare Advantage, we have projected a decline year-over-year in hospital admissions, and for the first quarter, we have seen that decline bear out. In other words, our trend benders continue to results in lower admissions. However, during the last weeks of the quarter and into April, we are seeing an elevated level of authorizations for hospitals admissions, which although still declining, are slightly higher than we had anticipated. Importantly, we have also seen data throughout the quarter that would suggest our cost per admit is lower than forecast, implying lower-severity conditions are driving the admissions.
While it is too early to draw any conclusions from what I just described, especially as admissions tend to fluctuate, it is something that bears close watching as the actual claims experience develops over the coming months.
As was highlighted in this morning's press release, we did see a lower level of favorable prior-period development than in last year's first quarter. A meaningful portion of the lower prior-period development was anticipated due to the PPD for the first quarter of 2014 having been unusually high and as a result of claims processing changes involving the implementation in early 2014 of a front-end review for Medicare claims. Front-end review enables us to improve the initial accuracy of claim payments, reducing the amount of overpayments recaptured later as part of prior-period development. PPD was also adversely impacted by fourth quarter flu claims that came through in the first quarter of 2015 across our lines of business.
I will now turn to the balance sheet and operating cash flow. I'll start with days in claims payable or DCP.
You will note that we have revised the DCP table to exclude reinsurance associated with the 3Rs. Given that reinsurance reduces benefits expense but does not impact the related benefits payable, it skews DCP trends over the 3-year period of the program.
Days in claims payable during the first quarter of 2015 declined by less than a day, driven primarily by the typical first quarter increase in Part D claims associated with our Medicare Advantage business. That impact is included in the all other category of the DCP roll-forward table in our press release. Recall that our stand-alone PDP business is excluded from our days in claims payable calculation.
Much like our stand-alone PDP offerings, our Medicare Advantage Part D benefit designs generally have the plan picking up substantially all the initial pharmacy claims but covering less of the benefit as the year progresses. While the pharmacy expense associated with these members is in our DCP calculation, the related payable is relatively small due to the speed of processing pharmacy claims. Higher capitation and provider settlements also resulted in a slight decrease to DCP during the quarter, but importantly, this was more than offset by an increase in unprocessed and processed claims inventories.
Cash flow from operations is down versus the first quarter of 2014, as higher net income was more than offset by working capital items. Specifically, the increase in benefits payable, which accompanies growing membership, was smaller year-over-year due to the lower level of overall growth in average membership given the outsized growth we experienced in 2014. This pressured the cash flow from operations on a comparative basis by approximately $250 million in the quarter. Working capital needs for our growing pharmacy business primarily accounted for the remainder of the delta in the first quarter cash flows.
For the year, our operating cash flow guidance is largely unchanged, other than reducing operating cash flow by guidance -- cash flow guidance by approximately $200 million at the midpoint, primarily reflecting the increase in the 3R receivable that I just discussed previously as well as the pending sale of Concentra.
Before closing, I'll spend just a few minutes on capital allocation and earnings guidance. As Bruce said in his remarks, we announced this quarter the sale of our Concentra business. The timing of the signing of the definitive agreement triggered the need to recognize the gain on the establishment of a deferred tax asset. And thus, the $0.35 per share gain was included in our first quarter GAAP results.
We expect this transaction to close in the next few weeks, so we have included the full impact of the transaction in our earnings guidance both from a GAAP and an adjusted perspective. For GAAP, we are including a total projected gain from the sale in the range of $1.35 to $1.45 per share, including the $0.35 tax gain. On an adjusted basis, excluding this onetime gain, we continue to forecast earnings per share in the range of $8.50 to $9 per share.
The sale of Concentra is expected to generate, net of taxes and deal expenses, approximately $1 billion in net proceeds. Before any anticipated use of these proceeds, the sale will results in $0.11 of 2015 EPS dilution. We continue to look for value-enhancing acquisitions such as the Your Home Advantage deal we recently announced that will advance our in-home capabilities, as well as pursue additional share repurchase opportunistically. However, given where we are in the year, it is likely that a good portion of this dilution will persist.
With respect to share repurchase, this quarter, we completed our $500 million accelerated share repurchase program. Additionally, holding true on our commitment to buy back $1 billion of stock by June of this year, we have entered into a 10b5-1 plan that we expect will complete that goal. You will note, however, that we have raised our guidance slightly for the average fully diluted share count due largely to the higher-than-anticipated buyback price, which will have a several-cent negative EPS impact.
Finally, our work around optimizing our portfolio continues to ensure that each of our businesses fits strategically and earns its cost of capital. More generally, we are encouraged by our progress in our prospects, all driven by execution around our integrated care delivery strategy.

But we're also seeing better engagement with our members both from a mail-older perspective on the pharmacy, which is very important, but also with Humana At Home as our analytical capabilities continue to identify people who would benefit from our Humana At Home capabilities.

I'll take your question. And we wondered how long before you would dial in. With respect to Georgia, as Brian said earlier, one of the things that we did at the very beginning was to take our individual legacy business and do relativities to our smaller Group block of business because that was a guarantee issue population. We thought that was fairly close to what might ultimately happen on the exchanges. And after that, and that was done local market by local market, we evaluated morbidities across a national basis with the help of an outside consulting actuarial firm. And as a result of that overall evaluation on a -- from a national perspective, we've lowered some of our markets' expected morbidities. And with respects to Georgia, while other markets turned out just fine relative to that pricing philosophy, Georgia didn't. Another part of the Georgia issue has to do with the platinum plans, which you've asked about in the past. One of the things that we're seeing with the platinum plans is that the philosophy or the strategy that we've enumerated in the past with you and others is that you need to have documentable risk conditions for the members that are heavier utilizers. And as we study the Georgia population as we're doing some of our risk adjustment work, we're seeing that the Georgia population, although heavier utilizers, don't have documentable risk conditions, which doesn't allow us then to get risk adjustment for them. And as a result of that, as Brian said, not only in Georgia but also in other states, we're evaluating that requirement as it respects our platinum plan strategies going forward. And you'll see us take some actions relative to that."

This morning, Humana announced first quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per share of $2.47, up 5% from the first quarter of last year. Our pretax earnings of $744 million were a record high and we believe are a clear demonstration on the progress we continue to make as a company. Further, we continue to have confidence in our full year guidance for adjusted earnings of $8.50 to $9 per share.
Our more significant achievements during the quarter included substantial membership growth in our Medicare Advantage, stand-alone PDP and HumanaOne products; the recent launch of our population health technology business, Transcend Insights; announcement of the pending sale of our Concentra business; and completion of our $500 million accelerated share repurchase program. I'll begin with our Medicare Advantage growth.
As we shared with you last quarter, we experienced another successful Medicare enrollment season for 2015. Individual Medicare Advantage membership at March 31, 2015, was up 11% versus the end of the fourth quarter 2014 up 14% year-over-year. We continue to see the positive impact for our members of stability in our value proposition as well as high Star quality ratings. A recent McKinsey study on the 2015 Star ratings concludes that HMO plans perform best on an enrollment-weighted basis. Approximately 56% of our individual members are in HMO plans compared to 53% a year ago. Further, the McKinsey study indicates that plans built around integrated delivery networks achieve higher average Star ratings.
CMS recently eliminated certain fixed thresholds for 4-Star ratings for 2017 bonus year. These changes may result in some pressure on our overall Star ratings, but we believe we will sustain our solid competitive advantage. We expect we will maintain our high-quality ratings due to our successful integrated care delivery model. Our model includes use of data analytics to engage members in preventative measures and wellness programs that close clinical gaps in care.
In sum, we believe the combination of a solid value proposition and a -- high-quality ratings are critical to attracting new membership and retaining our existing membership base. Our projected 2015 net new membership gains of approximately 12%, including a voluntary retention rate of approximately 90%, are all helping to validate this belief.
CMS has also recently released its final Medicare rates for 2016. While we were encouraged by the average rate increase for the first time in 7 years, this average still lags fee-for-service medical cost trends. Additionally, CMS' transition to the new risk adjustment model will negatively impact certain of our markets that are leading the country in value-based reimbursement methods and holistically assisting members with multiple complex chronic conditions, both which are key goals for CMS. As we prepare our Medicare bids for 2016, we will seek to minimize any disruption that rate changes may cause to Medicare beneficiaries while holding firm on our 4.5% to 5% pretax margin target. The continuing investment in our clinical model are expected to provide some offsets to rate pressures that will vary, of course, from market to market. Those investments were highlighted this month by Humana At Home's acquisition of Your Home Advantage, a leading provider of nurse practitioner in home visits. Additionally, we believe our focus on the consumer experience and our proprietary market point distribution channel will be important elements in solidifying our relationship with our members as we face these rate challenges at the market level.
Turning to our stand-alone PDP offerings. We also experienced significant growth for these products, with membership up 10% since the end of 2014 and 14% to the first quarter of last year, primarily in our low-price-point offerings.
I now will spend some time on our investments in health care exchanges and state-based contracts.
We're pleased that HumanaOne membership has continued to grow nicely. While we will continue to project at least breakeven results for our HumanaOne business, our projected increased reliance on the 3Rs is driven primarily by the results for the State of Georgia and our out-of-network provider usage. We believe both are isolated and addressable. Brian will discuss each of these factors in his remarks.
Entering a new customer segment is never an easy task. However, we believe that health care exchanges are a leading example of the ongoing movement to the Retail model, where we have been so effective in Medicare. We continue to be highly targeted in terms of where we will participate in health care exchanges, with a strong emphasis on current Medicare Advantage markets, to enable customer migration as members' life situations change. Our expansions into health care exchanges and our state-based contracts are deepening our partnership with local providers -- local market providers as we develop local market scale through multiple product offerings. State-based Medicaid membership, which now includes those members associated with dual demonstration programs, is up significantly both on a sequential basis and year-over-year. We continue to monitor the RFP pipeline and plan to pursue other state-based opportunities later in 2015.
These opportunities would not be as viable if it weren't for our integrated care delivery model. Importantly, we continue to show progress in key integrated care delivery model metrics. Some examples include the number of individual Medicare Advantage members covered by value-based arrangements is now more than 54%. This is particularly encouraging giving the substantial increase in membership this quarter. Membership in our Humana Chronic Care Program is up 10% since the end of the year and 56% versus the prior year. Adoption of mail-order pharmacy among our members continues to grow as we highlight this benefit more fully during the sales process and welcome calls. Individual Medicare Advantage mail-order penetration is now, on an average, approaching 35%.
We continue to focus on reaching out to members with gaps in care and have sent over 4 million proactive messages to 2.5 million members to prevent gaps in care. These actions have resulted in a gap closure rate of more than 30%.
As a leader in both the development and execution of value-based payment models and technology-driven population health management analytics, we support trends that encourage care coordination across all payers. In that context, this quarter, we launched Transcend Insights, which leverages the population health capabilities we have developed in our Medicare Advantage business. Our goal is to provide payer-agnostic tools to our provider partners, allowing more of our members to be in value-based reimbursement models. As we've shared with you in the past, value-based arrangements have proven to lead to higher HEDIS scores, lower medical cost and higher membership satisfaction.
Before closing, I'd like to spend a moment on our recently announced sale of Concentra.
As we've said in previous calls, we review our various businesses on an ongoing basis to ensure each earns its cost of capital and is aligned with our integrated care delivery strategy. The Concentra acquisition was part of a multipronged approach to increase our capabilities of managing risk through primary care physicians. Our subsequent MSO acquisitions and joint venture investments provided a more integrated primary care platform than Concentra. Although it did not ultimately fit strategically, we were able to achieve an attractive price that will result in a gain versus our initial investment. Brian will speak more to the details of this transaction in his remarks.
We expect the transaction will close in the next few weeks. I want to thank all of our Concentra associates for their dedication to the consumer and to our company.
Several of you have asked for an update on our PBM evaluation. That work continues, and we expect to provide a full debriefing on our analysis during the third quarter earnings call in November.
In summary, we believe our robust organic membership and revenue growth, together with our proven superior clinical operating performance and disciplined capital allocation, all come together to provide our sustainable competitive advantage. Excluding the onetime gains that we expect from the Concentra sale, we continue to expect our full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $8.50 to $9 and look forward to providing you updates as the year progresses.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian for a more detailed discussion of our financials."
29618,278392395,797547,"Humana Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2015",2015-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Humana Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bruce. And good morning, everyone.As Bruce mentioned, the first quarter of 2015 produced strong results and continues to demonstrate the successful implementation of our integrated care delivery model.

As Bruce mentioned, the first quarter of 2015 produced strong results and continues to demonstrate the successful implementation of our integrated care delivery model. The attractiveness of our product offerings is resonating with our customers, as demonstrated by the continuing increases in our Medicare Advantage, stand-alone PDP and exchange membership.
Consequently, we have raised full year membership expectations for both stand-alone PDP and HumanaOne. Stand-alone PDP is being driven by higher retention that we are seeing post the open-enrollment period, which is largely the results of fewer auto-enrollees being reassigned. I'll speak more to the HumanaOne business shortly. With regard to our Medicare Advantage growth, early indications for our new members are positive as we evaluate individual market growth and performance. Additionally, the growth in our PBM and Humana At Home businesses remains unabated with not only more volume driven by membership growth, but also deeper penetration in terms of increased engagement as well as benefits from scale that are driving results.
First quarter revenues for the Healthcare Services segment rose 26% versus the prior year, and pretax earnings are up 24% year-over-year.
The quarter had several developments that will be the focus of my remarks today. These include the following: the increase in our projected 3R receivables for the year, medical utilization and prior-period development, days in claims payable and cash flows from operations, the earnings implications of the Concentra transaction and capital allocation. Let's begin with our exchange business and the premium stabilization programs commonly called the 3Rs.
Our conviction in our health care exchange strategy remains strong. We continue to focus on our key growth markets by offering high-value networks to drive affordability and access for our customers. We believe that this strategy has been effective in successfully establishing a new growth business while providing a compelling product that our members value. Over time, we believe that HumanaOne will not only contribute meaningfully to our results but it will also, as Bruce emphasized, advance our objectives of local market presence and scale with providers while allowing us to offer a range of products that are relevant to our customers no matter their age or income circumstance.
As with any startup business, we've had our successes as well as our challenges. In terms of successes, our ACA-compliant membership for HumanaOne is up 38% from the end of 2014, well ahead of our previous expectations. This was driven by better-than-forecast sales and lower-than-anticipated attrition. Consequently, we have adjusted our aggregate HumanaOne guidance to reflect higher projected membership in the ACA-compliant business, which we also believe results in us approaching the scale we need for long-term success.
We continue to forecast that we will have at least breakeven results in 2015 and earn a reasonable return on capital in 2016, albeit that achievement of breakeven results this year now includes higher reliance on the 3Rs than previously anticipated coming into 2015. As you've seen from our release, we have increased our net 2015 3R guidance range to $450 million to $550 million, with reinsurance accounting for approximately 75% and risk adjustment and risk corridors accounting for approximately 25% of the total. As we have discussed in the past, there is an interplay between risk adjustment and risk corridors in that, if we don't get the risk adjustment exactly right, a meaningful part of the balance, either positive or negative, is captured through the risk corridors.
As we evaluate our financial performance to date, including runoff claims from 2014, the drivers of the increase in full year receivables related to the 3Rs are quantifiable and addressable. The first 2 Bruce mentioned in his remarks are higher-than-anticipated out-of-network utilization and poor results in our Georgia market. The last driver of the higher receivables is simply a function of having more members than we had previously expected.
I'll start with out-of-network utilization. As the exchanges were rolling out across the nation, we believed there would be a time period during which our members would be getting accustomed to our efficient network products. Consequently, we permitted out-of-network utilization for the small proportion of our members who did not stay in network to avoid disruption, notwithstanding the products designed -- product's design, which underpinned the affordability that our members seek. Our provider network team has thoroughly evaluated our networks in light of our membership levels by market, and we are very satisfied in our level of network adequacy. As a consequence, we are in the process of implementing stricter enforcement of network utilization by working closely with nonnetwork providers as well as educating our members on the products. Higher levels of in-network utilization are anticipated to ensure the continued affordability of our health care exchange offerings as well as aligned with our pricing assumptions for the remainder of the year and for 2016.
After adjusting for the out-of-network usage, our markets across the country, including our largest HumanaOne market in Florida, are performing within expectations with the notable exception of Georgia. One of the challenges we faced in both 2013 and 2014 was the immaturity of the claims data we had available at the time we set our health care exchange pricing for the following year versus what we would have preferred, specifically, more detail regarding statewide market conditions and health status based on significant exchange claims data. To help address this, we juxtaposed the limited Georgia claims data we had against claims data nationally for states that we believe had similar utilization patterns and mix of likely enrollees to derive assumptions around the population health of each state and, in turn, set our pricing. Recent actuarial claims data for the State of Georgia now indicate that enrollees in the state as a whole are skewing more towards being a less-healthy state population than we had believed and had priced for. Consequently, we are accruing both a risk adjustment and risk corridor receivable.
It's important to recall that this was the original intent behind the premium stabilization programs, namely earlier protection, in this circumstance. We are, of course, incorporating our emerging experience into our actuarial assumptions and are taking the appropriate targeted actions through pricing and product design when we file our 2016 rates in the next few weeks to ensure that Georgia's results will be back on track for 2016 without reliance on the risk corridors.
As I mentioned, the remaining driver of the higher 3R balance relates to higher-than-projected growth of our ACA-compliant business. This will result in higher 2015 receivables than we had expected, primarily associated with reinsurance.
Finally, a quick word on our 2014 3R accruals. As you will see, we have decreased reinsurance by approximately $50 million and have increased our risk corridors by around $40 million as an offset. As we've evaluated the runout of our 2014 claims, fewer of our members than anticipated will hit the reinsurance attachment point, which is the reason we have made this change.
Turning to medical utilization. We are watching very closely the hospital ""inpatient admissions per thousand"" data for our Medicare Advantage business. We have seen some of the hospital published data which suggest higher Medicare usage of inpatient services and have also witnessed in the last number of weeks an uptick in inpatient authorizations. For Medicare Advantage, we have projected a decline year-over-year in hospital admissions, and for the first quarter, we have seen that decline bear out. In other words, our trend benders continue to results in lower admissions. However, during the last weeks of the quarter and into April, we are seeing an elevated level of authorizations for hospital admissions which, although still declining, are slightly higher than we had anticipated. Importantly, we have also seen data throughout the quarter that would suggest our cost per admit is lower than forecast, implying lower-severity conditions are driving the admissions.
While it is too early to draw any conclusions from what I just described, especially as admissions tend to fluctuate, it is something that bears close watching as the actual claims experience develops over the coming months.
As was highlighted in this morning's press release, we did see a lower level of favorable prior-period development than in last year's first quarter. A meaningful portion of the lower prior-period development was anticipated due to the PPD for the first quarter of 2014 having been unusually high and as a result of claims processing changes involving the implementation in early 2014 of a front-end review for Medicare claims. Front-end review enables us to improve the initial accuracy of claim payments, reducing the amount of overpayments recaptured later as part of prior-period development. PPD was also adversely impacted by fourth quarter flu claims that came through in the first quarter of 2015 across our lines of business.
I will now turn to the balance sheet and operating cash flow. I'll start with days in claims payable or DCP.
You will note that we have revised the DCP table to exclude reinsurance associated with the 3Rs. Given that reinsurance reduces benefits expense but does not impact the related benefits payable, it skews DCP trends over the 3-year period of the program.
Days in claims payable during the first quarter of 2015 declined by less than a day, driven primarily by the typical first quarter increase in Part D claims associated with our Medicare Advantage business. That impact is included in the all other category of the DCP roll-forward table in our press release. Recall that our stand-alone PDP business is excluded from our days in claims payable calculation.
Much like our stand-alone PDP offerings, our Medicare Advantage Part D benefit designs generally have the plan picking up substantially all the initial pharmacy claims, but covering less of the benefit as the year progresses. While the pharmacy expense associated with these members is in our DCP calculation, the related payable is relatively small due to the speed of processing pharmacy claims. Higher capitation and provider settlements also resulted in a slight decrease to DCP during the quarter, but importantly, this was more than offset by an increase in unprocessed and processed claims inventories.
Cash flow from operations is down versus the first quarter of 2014, as higher net income was more than offset by working capital items. Specifically, the increase in benefits payable, which accompanies growing membership, was smaller year-over-year due to the lower level of overall growth in average membership given the outsized growth we experienced in 2014. This pressured the cash flow from operations on a comparative basis by approximately $250 million in the quarter. Working capital needs for our growing pharmacy business primarily accounted for the remainder of the delta in the first quarter cash flows.
For the year, our operating cash flow guidance is largely unchanged, other than reducing operating cash flow by guidance -- cash flow guidance by approximately $200 million at the midpoint, primarily reflecting the increase in the 3R receivable that I just discussed previously as well as the pending sale of Concentra.
Before closing, I'll spend just a few minutes on capital allocation and earnings guidance. As Bruce said in his remarks, we announced this quarter the sale of our Concentra business. The timing of the signing of the definitive agreement triggered the need to recognize the gain on the establishment of a deferred tax asset. And thus, the $0.35 per share gain was included in our first quarter GAAP results.
We expect this transaction to close in the next few weeks, so we have included the full impact of the transaction in our earnings guidance both from a GAAP and an adjusted perspective. For GAAP, we are including a total projected gain from the sale in the range of $1.35 to $1.45 per share, including the $0.35 tax gain. On an adjusted basis, excluding this onetime gain, we continue to forecast earnings per share in the range of $8.50 to $9 per share.
The sale of Concentra is expected to generate, net of taxes and deal expenses, approximately $1 billion in net proceeds. Before any anticipated use of these proceeds, the sale will result in $0.11 of 2015 EPS dilution. We continue to look for value-enhancing acquisitions, such as the Your Home Advantage deal we recently announced that will advance our in-home capabilities, as well as pursue additional share repurchase opportunistically. However, given where we are in the year, it is likely that a good portion of this dilution will persist.
With respect to share repurchase, this quarter, we completed our $500 million accelerated share repurchase program. Additionally, holding true on our commitment to buy back $1 billion of stock by June of this year, we have entered into a 10b5-1 plan that we expect will complete that goal. You will note, however, that we have raised our guidance slightly for the average fully diluted share count due largely to the higher-than-anticipated buyback price, which will have a several-cent negative EPS impact.
Finally, our work around optimizing our portfolio continues to ensure that each of our businesses fits strategically and earns its cost of capital. More generally, we are encouraged by our progress and our prospects, all driven by execution around our integrated care delivery strategy. 
With that, we will open the lines up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please introduce the first caller."

I'll take your question. And we wondered how long before you would dial in. With respect to Georgia, as Brian said earlier, one of the things that we did at the very beginning was to take our individual legacy business and do relativities to our smaller Group block of business because that was a guarantee issue population.

And with respects to Georgia, while other markets turned out just fine relative to that pricing philosophy, Georgia didn't. Another part of the Georgia issue has to do with the platinum plans, which you've asked about in the past. One of the things that we're seeing with the platinum plans is that the philosophy or the strategy that we've enumerated in the past with you and others is that you need to have documentable risk conditions for the members that are heavier utilizers. And as we study the Georgia population as we're doing some of our risk adjustment work, we're seeing that the Georgia population, although heavier utilizers, don't have documentable risk conditions, which doesn't allow us then to get risk adjustment for them.

The company seems to be more aggressively pursuing RFPs, I guess, as you have in the past. Can you talk a bit about your view, kind of what's changed in the last couple of years? And you've pursued RFPs in a couple of different ways, outright or through joint ventures and things like that, so how do you think about the form of these types of participation might take?"

But we are focused on what we call our sweet spot of smaller case sizes. And over the last 6 months, we've performed reasonably well with our sweet spot focus. You may recall that, in the fourth quarter, we grew very nicely with our small or focused business. This past quarter, we have seen some shrinkage in our fully insured smaller-case-size membership as a lot of our competitors are implementing their new rates relative to community rating. And we're seeing a little bit of an aggressive posture in some of the states that we do business. That will ultimately change over time, and we think that, that will work itself out. We feel very confident with our focus on the smaller case size. Over the next several years, we're going to be evaluating our Group business and, again, feel very good about its prospects for continued profitability. And it serves very nicely as a complement to our focus on local market scale. We talk a lot about that with our Medicare business, our individual business, our Medicaid business and our Group business in certain of our -- what we refer to as bold-move markets.
