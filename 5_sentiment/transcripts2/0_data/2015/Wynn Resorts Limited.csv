3449701,283231223,753845,"Wynn Resorts Ltd., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2015",2015-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Wynn Resorts, Limited","Executives","I hope everybody can hear us today. We've issued our earnings which I don't think surprised anybody. I know that in Macau, everybody follows the margins and the weekly casino numbers. January last year was a month in which we had extremely low hold percen",1197,"I hope everybody can hear us today. We've issued our earnings which I don't think surprised anybody. I know that in Macau, everybody follows the margins and the weekly casino numbers. January last year was a month in which we had extremely low hold percentage. And this year, we had a high hold percentage. So surprisingly, we've made more money in Macau in January, for example, than we did a year ago. 
Our business for the year looked great, but the fourth quarter was tough. Since Golden Week in October, the effects of the changes in China have had a negative effect on all of the top-end business, whether that means retail top-end like Rolex and Louis Vuitton or whether we're talking about the high-end gaming in junkets in the VIP section. 
We looked at the fourth quarter and the drop in VIP business. And then, we looked at the first month of this year, anticipating the kinds of question we will get today, and we ask ourselves, “Is January -- were there any indications in January of the change?” And in terms of the VIP business, no. It was off by -- turn was off by 30-odd-percent but -- and occupancy was high because we only have 1,000 rooms in Macau. And therefore, we still had occupancy. It was more of our mass occupancy, a little more than the VIP occupancy, but the hotel was full. 
Things like Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Rolex were off as they were in the fourth quarter during January, even though we made $5 million or $6 million or $7 million more than we did last year. I'm using January because we know the results of this first month. And in January, we were able to make $80-odd-million instead of $70-odd-million. 
In Las Vegas, so there was -- excuse me, if I can stick with Macau for a moment. There was one change. The -- without any adjustment for hold percentage, but making normal hold percentage comparisons, which we had last January and this January, our mass business was up 26%. Slots were off by 16% or 18%, but a lot of our slot business is very top-end oriented. So it reflected the kind of diminution in the business that we saw at the tables at the high end. Mass business, though, was up legitimately 26%. 
We also are opening in a week or so the new area of the casino in Macau that is dedicated to VIP business and it this better facilities than anybody's seen in that town yet. And so -- and we're getting some very good people to occupy that space, which also frees up some of our other space for more mass table games. So to that extent, I think February is going to see an improvement of some sort and I don't need to quantify that. But I expect that we will see a better result comparing that to the previous months. 
In Las Vegas, I mentioned in our third quarter announcement that if we had a legitimate November and December, we'd be the first company to exceed $500 million in profitability probably in the, not only in the history of Las Vegas, but also in America. And in fact, we did do $515 million in EBITDA in Las Vegas, which was encouraging, and we're very happy about that. 
But China remains a big question mark. We have more questions than answers. Thousands of our Macau employees are anticipating promotion and a better life because of Wynn Palace, a breakaway property by any measurement, which up until now has been on budget and on time. But we were notified by our builder last night that because of a problem in the timing of our construction labor permits that they thought they were going to miss the Chinese New Year next year as the opening and they would be late with regard to that date that we have used in these calls. 
In our public releases, we've always said that it would be the first half of '16. And I have been more optimistic and said we'd make Chinese New Year, which until last night I thought was true. But if we were to believe the email we've got from late in construction, they're not going to make Chinese New Year, they think they're going to miss that date. I'm going to explore that a little bit more deeply with them. Mike Harvey is on this call who ran late in Hong Kong and Macau and built our first 2 hotels as the senior executive of latent running our jobs. He switched over to become our own executive-in-charge for the Wynn Palace project, so he's in a better position to discuss the latent email and its ramifications than I am at the moment. But I do believe that for all of Chinese businessman, there is, at the moment, a bit of uncertainty as to what the future will hold because so much of everything in China depends upon the policy of the central government. 
We have learned in the last 12 years the way to behave in China and that is to listen very carefully to what the leadership says and to do our best, to be helpful and to conform with the program as we are their guest. In my history in China, starting in 2001, I was very lucky to be instructed by former President Bush on how to behave there and that was to be helpful and to understand that culture. And to that extent, I believe that they sort out their problems in an orderly fashion as they see them. And in some cases, that impacts like in Macau or Hong Kong. There is nothing to be done, but to be patient and to be alert and to do your best to be cooperative and to go along with the program. There's no doubt that the existence of Wynn Palace is a major event in the development of entertainment and tourism in Macau and I believe that the government recognizes that to be true. We did get a 700% increase to our construction labor this week although we requested 1,000, we've got 700. And I guess that's encouraging, albeit that it was 3 months late. 
So timing and government approvals are a factor that we have to deal with. Hopefully, we'll be able to keep our promises to our employees that live in Macau and all of the staff that work at these places and that their hopes for a better life will be fulfilled and that our ambitions to growth in Macau will continue to develop.
I think that's pretty much the kinds of comments that are appropriate at this moment. If any of my colleagues on the call would care to add to any of this, Gamal Aziz and Ian are there. Linda is there, our main connection to the gaming fraternity there. And as I said, Mike Harvey, the construction man is on the call. And all of us here in Las Vegas and the parent company are standing by for questions, which we'll take at this time"

And we've never ever been in a position, we're the only game in town. We've always, in my career, for the past 40-odd-years, we have competed and prevailed in the most competitive markets that exist. And we tend to thrive under those circumstances because as they -- as a top-end operator, we tend to take off the grainy part of the market, whether it's in mass or in VIP. And to be in Boston, Massachusetts and the Metropolitan area in Everett and have almost 4 million people where we're the only game in town is titillating. We work very hard to compete for the right to operate in Massachusetts, as you know, and it was expensive to do that process and time-consuming, very. We had an 1,800-pound application when we finally finished. We spent $25 million just to get to the end of the game in terms of local elections and requirements with related communities. You know that we had $130 million in infrastructure that we had to agree to. And then there was another $100 million in the cost of the license, other miscellaneous stuff that -- we were in $230 million of our budget already, or promises from that are separate apart from the construction from that budget. We are going to be the -- one of the top-five private employers in the history of state of Massachusetts. We're going to be responsible for $50 million a month in revenue for the state, probably another $50 million in related revenues to all the surrounding communities. We're going to employ thousands and thousands of people. It's the largest construction budget in recent history of Massachusetts, maybe forever. We've got a serious presence there in Massachusetts, and we're delighted to have that position. And we finished the design of the hotel, and I think it's, along with The Palace, the best work we've ever done based upon 40 years of experience. What's best of all, with the same group of executives that have learned from all of our past experiences and projects. And hopefully, our next stuff that comes up will reflect the evolution and the enlightenment that we've been able to achieve because of those experiences. So speaking for myself, I'm delighted with the bolt-on opportunity, when America and now enjoys, I think, we're alone. This last few months, we've got our investment grade, which we've had from Moody's and now from Standard & Poor's so our credit rating is the highest in the industry. We financed $1 billion in the quarter of our Boston project already a few months ago. And LIBOR plus 1.75  and we're a real apple pie shaped just as our financing in China was at LIBOR plus 1.75 , $3,850,000,000 of the project in China was financed nonrecourse at LIBOR plus 1.75% or a total of 3.3% for the $3.85 billion that we raised again, nonrecourse. Our Boston financing is nonrecourse to the parent and Wynn America, which is I just said, I'm proud to say, investment grade. So all in all, the setup is just right for Massachusetts. And as we wend our way through the complexities of the agent situation, our setup is just right to keep our promise to our employees and to the government in China."

But the answer is, at least speaking, I'm getting over a cold, for our company. In each and every case in America, leading up to China, we have broken the record for casino revenue. At The Mirage, we broke the Caesars pre-existing record for casino revenue. Then we broke the Mirage record at Bellagio and then we broke the Bellagio record at Wynn, and we broke the Wynn record when we opened Encore. What's interesting though, even though we've gone into the $800 million range, never in the history of our company, has our casino revenue met or exceeded our noncasino revenue. That is to say, the reputation of this company -- its status today is based upon the fact that we did not focus completely on gaming, but recognized that gaming was a result, not a cause. But although it was a productive cash register in the building that the real attraction and the power, the energy and vitality of our enterprise was directly related to its noncasino experiential entertainment and hospitality aspects. The one thing that led to the spread of new concessions in Macau, the desire of that government after the turnover to the PRC was to broaden the appeal of Macau and to diversify from purely baccarat to beyond baccarat. Now all of the operators there, all of our competitors, have recognized this from day 1, not because of a mandate from the government necessarily, but because of their understanding of how the industry survives and prospers. Based upon creating experiences for people that they can't get at home. Tourism, the broadest definition of tourism, a positive and exciting experience that you can't get at home and surely we recognize that a slot machine or a baccarat is an experience you can get anywhere. Every damn slot machine on earth looks like every other one. I can't even tell 1 manufacturer from another unless I look at the plate on the side. Every roulette table is identical to every roulette table no matter what nation you're in, from one end of the globe to the other. Our company has recognized that more than every other company in the history. Our Noncasino revenue always exceeds our casino revenue. Wynn Palace was built as Bellagio when Wynn and Encore have been built to create a complete tourist destination experience. Only the smallest part of our budget in Macau is dedicated to baccarat tables, but hundreds of millions, yes, billions of dollars, up to $4 billion, dedicated to entertainment, shopping, food and beverage, spas, incredible hotel room experiences, and most importantly, to an extensive in-depth training routine and discipline on the area of human resources to guarantee the visitors to Wynn Palace a unique experience for those people who travel and seek to have unique experience.
So when you hear that the Central Government and the Macau government urged operators to diversify the attractions of their facilities, when they speak to us, they're preaching to the choir. We invented that idea. It has been certainly enhanced and it's certainly be carried on by companies like Venetian and Melco, no question, and Galaxy. And all of these facilities being built in Cotai today are remarkable destination resorts. And they were planned and they were executed with enormous amounts of capital before and during any encouragement by the Central Government or the Macau government. So this is a development -- this development of noncasino is something that was going to happen anyway and has happened. And I've said this once before and I'm going to repeat it again today. If you take Macau with its destination resorts which include gaming tables, and you take [indiscernible], adjacent to Macau with its additional non-gaming attractions like theme parks, I say that, that Macau Island area, will in the next 5 to 10 years, become the most dynamic tourist destination location on the planet. And that's saying something in a country that has Orlando and Anaheim and Las Vegas. But boy, it was being done over there is really something and to a certain extent that it's happening in Shanghai as well. So I hope that's a response to your question."

At the end of this consideration, you and I and everybody else on this call have to ask ourselves, “Is there commonality in humanity in terms of aspiration? Is China so different than America?"" And my answer to that question based upon these 40-odd-years of dealing with Asian customers more than anybody else probably in the last 30 years, starting with Mirage, and talking to them constantly both here and at home in Macau, is that aspirationally, all folks are the same. When they go on vacation, they want to live bigger and better than they can in their normal discipline lives. And that's what makes destination resorts necessarily special so that they can fulfill that aspirational dynamic. Nothing that we've seen in China has changed my opinion. And in fact, everything that we've experienced in the past 12 years in wonderful Macau has reinforced that. Folks may look differently and talk a different language and their menu may be different. But in terms of what they want, it's all the same. And every place in the world we've given people what they want in this ever more mobile society. The moving middle-class of the world, they have responded to the same invitation with similar enthusiasm. Wynn Palace is a guilt-edge invitation to that party. And my confidence is based upon 40 years of experience, both with American and international players. And the Brazilians and the Mexicans and the Argentinians and the Colombians where we have offices and Venezuelans, the Taiwanese, the South Koreans, the Japanese and the Chinese folks, when they have some money and a chance to enjoy it, they all want the same thing. And that's the basis of my confidence. And I might add, it's most likely if Sheldon was on the call or Francis Lui, they -- or Lawrence [indiscernible] or Jimmy Packard, they would say the same thing. I believe that to be true. And that's something I'm very hesitant, as you know, I'm insecure about the short-term future of the way things roll out in Macau. But I am not insecure about the answer to that question."

I talk to people. And this campaign against corruption has been a big wake up call in China. President [indiscernible] has determined that his leadership should eliminate the perception of corruption and the only way to do that is to root it out. And you know there's a huge national campaign to investigate public officials and their behavior. Now it's comforting to note that the liaison officer who represents the fed -- the central government in [indiscernible] that looks over Macau made a public statement when I was there last week that there is little or no evidence of any government officials gambling away their money in Macau. He wasn't concerned about that, that was a positive announcement by him and I think he felt necessary to say that.

So I think what we're seeing across China is a retrenchment of spending instincts. And how long will that last? I don't know."

And -- but I might point out that in planning Wynn Palace, we were required to submit extensive schedules of how many employees we would need for construction and when we would need them. How many people we would hire from Macau. How many people -- how many tables we would need, everything was included in the submissions that were considered and reviewed by the government extensively for protracted periods of time. And that process was slow, laborious and extended. And then, we've got our final approval and we commenced construction. The building was designed and the employees and the promises made to the employees were all based upon all of those submissions and those declarations, which were then approved and accepted and we were given the green light to go ahead. It seems to me that at the end of the day, the government will respect that. Talks of caps and all of that thing, all of those sort of things, they occurred after our approvals and after our construction had begun and on the land. And so although I don't know what our table total is as we speak today, I have a sense that, that common sense and consistency will be the order of the day. I don't see the government of Macau threatening the security of the employees who live in Macau. We're all shareholders of our company. I just don't see that, nor do I sense that in my conversations with the government. So how they allocate those tables is something that's clearly, their own business. But the responsibility for these projects, although we have financed and built them, is also their business. And I have confidence that their common sense and their integrity will, at the end of the day, be the last word on the subject.

We have over 2,000 feet on the strip. And opposing are 2,000 feet -- are the frontage of the old Stardust and the old Frontier Hotel. The Frontier has been purchased by the interest of James Packer and he has hired people of quality and experience to build and to design and build a facility that is approximately $2 billion. KT Lim, an internationally experienced casino developer in Malaysia and Hong Kong and even New York with the slot machines of Aqueduct and Singapore and Malaysia and Aqueduct, he has announced a project on the site of the old Stardust or the Echelon property. Again, this opposes Encore that is $4 billion. Now if you say that instead of an empty land and a couple of shell structures, we're going to have $6 billion worth of construction. And eventually in 4 or 5 years, buildings and employees and guests across the street with thousands of rooms, that's worth at least $30 million to $50 million on the bottom line of my company. I love that. And so right away, I see Las Vegas being enhanced going forward by this kind of experienced capital investment. Hopefully, those projects won't be fallen starts, they will really happen. And the men that announced them are people fully capable of keeping the promise. That's good news for us in our spot here on the promenade. So my feeling about Las Vegas, it's still the destination of choice worldwide. Otherwise, why would all the Asians come here as they do on Chinese New Year? Why were they all here on New Year's Eve? They filled -- over 2,000 of them filled our ballroom to watch Bruno Mars. And then they shopped and ate and gamble and enjoyed themselves to the hilt, they got a great New Year's. So nothings new. And I think again, so much depends on American domestic political situation. I thought that we were under the gun for -- during the recession with administration policies of more of a wet blanket on job formation and economic development and they were constructive. But that was my own personal view. We seem to have overcome the administration and the recession. And we finally, slowly seem to be crawling out of the ditch we were in. And maybe things will continue to improve in America. But Las Vegas and at least the Wynn Resorts has come through it handily. I think the same thing is going to apply in the future."

Pricing is always one of the art forms of any business. Pricing blackjack, pricing rooms, pricing everything. So it was -- you don't want to price yourself out of the market, but you don't want to miss the opportunity to take an increase, especially if you think you got the kind of demand and reputation that will allow you to do it. We've been able to do that so far. The business of business is not about home runs, it's about bunch and singles, and you build a reputation, you create a platform for business that can sustain pricing increases over a long period time because of consistency. Consistency is probably the most important word in politics and business and human relations. Consistency is the most important thing to the future in Macau. Does the world think that China is consistent? Macau is consistent? That the businesses and the governments will be consistent in their positions? Consistency allows for a better future and a better life for people. Inconsistency is destabilizing and frightening and it creates all that uncertainty. We live with a certain amount of it on a daily basis. Surely we do internationally as a nation with the problems of the Mideast. And surely we do politically in America. And surely at the moment, we do deal with uncertainty in China. The question becomes, if the only constant is change and uncertainty, then how agile is the company? How agile is it financially? How agile is it in terms of its human resources? It's very important for CEOs and senior management people in all companies to recognize that flexibility, agility is everything for survival in the modern world. And I think that's probably almost a universal truth these days. That's the main thing that I see going forward, that we maintain the kind of platform that allows us to deal with change easily and with -- and to be agile. And then, the trade on our goodwill and our past performance, we've got the concession in Macau because of Bellagio and Mirage. When the government of China decided that day 1, after the takeover, to broaden the appeal of Macau as a worldwide destination, travel and tourist destination, they went looking for people that they thought could do it. And I think that we've got the position because of our past performance in Las Vegas. And our job in Macau has been to keep the promise going forward with a capital. We reinvested as much in China as we ever made. All of our money is back in there. And in spite of the success we've had in that is true of the Venetian as well as Galaxy and Melco. We're all the same in that regard. Everybody, MGM is doing in this well. So I think that's all bodes well for the future in spite of short-term uncertainty."

We've issued our earnings which I don't think surprised anybody. I know that in Macau, everybody follows the margins and the weekly casino numbers. January last year was a month in which we had extremely low hold percen",1199,"I hope everybody can hear us today. We've issued our earnings which I don't think surprised anybody. I know that in Macau, everybody follows the margins and the weekly casino numbers. January last year was a month in which we had extremely low hold percentage. And this year, we had a high hold percentage. So surprisingly, we made more money in Macau in January, for example, than we did a year ago. 
Our business for the year looked great, but the fourth quarter was tough. Since the Golden Week in October, the effects of the changes in China have had a negative effect on all of the top-end business, whether that means retail top-end like Rolex and Louis Vuitton, or whether we're talking about the high-end gaming in junkets in the VIP section. 
We looked at the fourth quarter and the drop in VIP business. And then we looked at the first month of this year, anticipating the kinds of question we get today, and we ask ourselves, is January -- were there any indications in January of a change? And in terms of the VIP business, no. It was off by -- turn was off by 40-odd-percent but -- and the occupancy was high because we only have 1,000 rooms in Macau and therefore, we still had occupancy. It was more of our mass occupancy, a little more than the VIP occupancy, but the hotel was full. 
Things like Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior were -- and Rolex were off as they were in the fourth quarter during January, even though we made $5 million or $6 million or $7 million more than we did last year. I'm using January because we know the results of this first month. And in January, we were able to make $80-odd-million instead of $70-odd-million. 
In Las Vegas, so there was -- excuse me, if I can stick with Macau for a moment. There was one change. The -- without any adjustment for hold percentage but making normal hold percentage comparisons, which we had last January and this January, our mass business was up 26%. Slots were off by 16% or 18%, but a lot of our slot business is very top-end-oriented. So it reflected the kind of diminution of business that we saw at the tables at the high end. Mass business, though, was up legitimately 26%. 
We also are opening in a week or so the new area of the casino in Macau that is dedicated to VIP business, and it has better facilities than anybody's seen in that town yet. And so -- and we're getting some very good people to occupy that space, which also frees up some of our other space for more mass table games. So to that extent, I think February is going to see an improvement of some sort and I don't need to quantify that. But I expect that we will see a better result comparing that to the previous months. 
In Las Vegas, I mentioned in our third quarter announcement that if we had a legitimate November and December, we'd be the first company to exceed $500 million in profitability probably in the -- not only in the history of Las Vegas, but also in America. And in fact, we did do $515 million in EBITDA in Las Vegas, which was encouraging, and we're very happy about that. 
But China remains a big question mark. We have more questions than answers. Thousands of our Macau employees are anticipating a promotion and a better life because of Wynn Palace, a breakaway property by any measurement, which up until now has been on budget and on time. But we were notified by our builder last night that because of a problem in the timing of our construction labor permits that they thought they were going to miss the Chinese New Year next year as the opening and they would be late with regard to that date that we have used in these calls. 
In our public releases, we've always said that it would be the first half of '16. And I have been more optimistic and said we'd make Chinese New Year, which until last night I thought was true. But if we're to believe the email we got from Leighton Construction, they're not going to make Chinese New Year. They think they're going to miss that date. 
I'm going to explore that a little bit more deeply with them. Mike Harvey is on this call who ran Leighton in Hong Kong and Macau and built our first 2 hotels as the senior executive of Leighton running our jobs. He switched over to become our own executive-in-charge for the Wynn Palace product -- project, so he's in a better position to discuss the Leighton email and its ramifications than I am at the moment. But I do believe that for all of Chinese businessmen, there is at the moment a bit of uncertainty as to what the future will hold because so much of everything in China depends upon the policy of the Central Government. 
We have learned in the last 12 years the way to behave in China and that is to listen very carefully to what the leadership says and to do our best, to be helpful and to conform with the program as we are their guest. In my history in China, starting in 2001, I was very lucky to be instructed by former President Bush on how to behave there and that was to be helpful and to understand that culture. And to that extent, I believe that they sort out their problems in an orderly fashion as they see them. And in some cases, that impacts like Macau or Hong Kong. There is nothing to be done but to be patient and to be alert and to do your best to be cooperative and to go along with the program. There's no doubt that the existence of Wynn Palace is a major event in the development of entertainment and tourism in Macau, and I believe that the government recognizes that to be true. We did get a 700% increase to our construction labor this week, although we requested 1,000, we got 700. And I guess that's encouraging, albeit that it was 3 months late. 
So timing and government approvals are a factor that we have to deal with. Hopefully, we'll be able to keep our promises to our employees that live in Macau and all of the staff that work at these places, and that their hopes for a better life will be fulfilled and that our ambitions to grow in Macau will continue to develop.
I think that's pretty much the kinds of comments that are appropriate at this moment. If any of my colleagues on the call would care to add to any of this, Gamal Aziz and Ian are there. Linda is there, our main connection to the gaming fraternity there. And as I said, Mike Harvey, the construction man, is on the call. And all of us here in Las Vegas and the parent company are standing by for questions, which we'll take at this time."

And we've never ever been in the position. We were the only game in town. We've always, in my career, for the past 40-odd-years, we have competed and prevailed in the most competitive markets that exist. And we tend to thrive under those circumstances because as a top-end operator, we tend to take off the creamy part of the market, whether it's in mass or in VIP. And to be in Boston, Massachusetts and the Metropolitan area in Everett and have almost 4 million people where we're the only game in town is titillating. We worked very hard to compete for the right to operate in Massachusetts, as you know, and it was expensive to do that process and time-consuming, very. We had an 1,800-pound application when it -- when we'd finally finished. We spent $25 million just to get to the end of the game in terms of local elections and requirements with related communities. You know that we had $130 million in infrastructure that we had to agree to. And then there was another $100 million in the cost of the license, other miscellaneous stuff -- we were in -- we're in $230 million of our budget already or promises for that, that are separate and apart from the construction and that project budget. We are going to be the -- one of the top 5 private employers in the history of the State of Massachusetts. We're going to be responsible for $50 million a month in revenue for the state, probably another $50 million in related revenues to all the surrounding communities. We're going to employ thousands and thousands of people. It's the largest construction budget in recent history in Massachusetts, maybe forever. We've got a serious presence there in Massachusetts, and we're delighted to have that position. And we finished the design of the hotel, and I think it's, along with the Palace, the best work we've ever done based upon 40 years of experience with what's best of all, with the same group of executives that have learned from all of our past experiences and projects. And hopefully, our next stuff that comes up will reflect the evolution and the enlightenment that we've been able to achieve because of those experiences. So speaking for myself, I am delighted with the Boston opportunity Wynn America now enjoys. I think we're alone. This last few months, we got our investment grade, which we've had from Moody's, now from Standard & Poor's, so our credit rating is the highest in the industry. We financed $1.25 billion of our Boston project already a few months ago and LIBOR plus 1.75%, and we're in real apple pie shape just as our financing in China was at LIBOR plus 1.75%. $3,850,000,000 of the project in China was financed nonrecourse at LIBOR plus 1.75% or a total of 3.3% for the $3.85 billion that we raised, again, nonrecourse. Our Boston financing is nonrecourse to the parent, and Wynn America, which is, as I just said, I'm proud to say, investment grade. So all in all, the setup is just right for Massachusetts. And as we wend our way through the complexities of the Asian situation, our setup is just right to keep our promise to our employees and to the government in China."

And every -- obviously, everyone is taking directives from the Central Government seriously. There really shouldn't be a question there. But in your view, has the mandate changed? That is, is your perception of what the government wanted when you started your new project, when you started Wynn Palace, has that changed significantly when you started? And if so, does the increased rhetoric on diversification of the Macau economy affect your expectations for the returns of Wynn Palace at all?"

And I'm sure glad you asked. I didn't expect that today. But the answer is, at least speaking, I'm getting over a cold, for our company, in each and every case in America, leading up to China, we have broken the record",721,"That's a great question, I must say. And I'm sure glad you asked. I didn't expect that today. But the answer is, at least speaking, I'm getting over a cold, for our company, in each and every case in America, leading up to China, we have broken the record for casino revenue. At the Mirage, we broke the Caesars preexisting record for casino revenue. Then we broke the Mirage record at Bellagio, and then we broke the Bellagio record at Wynn. And then we broke the Wynn record at -- when we opened Encore. And what's interesting though, even though we've gone into the $800 million range, never in the history of our company has our casino revenue met or exceeded our noncasino revenue. That is to say, the reputation of this company -- its status today is based upon the fact that we did not focus completely on gaming but recognized that gaming was a result, not a cause. That although it was a productive cash register in the building, that the real attraction and the power, the energy and vitality of our enterprise was directly related to its noncasino experiential entertainment and hospitality aspects. The one thing that led to the spread of new concessions in Macau, the desire of that government after the turnover to the PRC was to broaden the appeal of Macau and to diversify from purely Baccarat to beyond Baccarat. Now all of the operators there, all of our competitors, have recognized this from day 1, not because of a mandate from the government necessarily, but because of their understanding of how the industry survives and prospers, based upon creating experiences for people that they can't get at home. Tourism, the broadest definition of tourism, a positive and exciting experience that you can't get at home, and surely we recognize that a slot machine or a Baccarat is an experience you can get anywhere. Every damn slot machine on earth looks like every other one. I can't even tell 1 manufacturer from another from -- unless I look at the plate on the side. Every roulette table is identical to every other roulette table no matter what nation you're in, from one end of the globe to the other. Our company has recognized that more than any other company in history. Our noncasino revenue always exceeds our casino revenue. Wynn Palace was built as Bellagio, and Wynn and Encore have been built to create a complete tourist destination experience. Only the smallest part of our budget in Macau is dedicated to Baccarat tables, but hundreds of millions, yes, billions of dollars, up to $4 billion, dedicated to entertainment, shopping, food and beverage, spas, incredible hotel room experiences and most importantly, to an extensive in-depth training routine and discipline on the area of human resources to guarantee the visitors to Wynn Palace a unique experience for those people who travel and seek to have unique experience.
So when you hear that the Central Government and the Macau government urged operators to diversify the attractions of their facilities, when they speak to us, they're preaching to the choir. We invented that idea. It has been certainly enhanced and it's certainly been carried on by companies like Venetian and Melco, no question, and Galaxy. And all of these facilities being built in Cotai today are remarkable destination resorts. And they were planned and they were executed with enormous amounts of capital before and during any encouragement by the Central Government or the Macau government. So this is a development. This development of noncasino is something that was going to happen anyway and has happened. And I've said this once before and I'm going to repeat it again today. If you take Macau with its destination resorts, which include gaming tables, and you take Hengshan Island, adjacent to Macau, with its additional nongaming attractions like theme parks, I say that, that Macau, Hengshan Island area, will, in the next 5 to 10 years, become the most dynamic tourist destination location on the planet. And that's saying something in a country that has Orlando and Anaheim and Las Vegas. But boy, what's being done over there is really something, and to a certain extent, it's happening in Shanghai as well. So I hope that's the response to your question."

At the end of this consideration, you and I and everybody else on this call have to ask ourselves, is there a commonality in humanity in terms of aspiration? Is China so different than America? And my answer to that question, based upon these 40-odd-years of dealing with Asian customers more than anybody else probably in the last 30 years, starting with Mirage, and talking to them constantly both here and at home in Macau, is that aspirationally, all folks are the same. When they go on vacation, they want to live bigger and better than they can in their normal discipline lives. And that's what makes destination resorts necessarily special so that they can fulfill that aspirational dynamic. Nothing that we've seen in China has changed my opinion, and in fact, everything that we've experienced in the past 12 years in wonderful Macau has reinforced that. Folks may look differently and talk a different language, and their menu may be different. But in terms of what they want, it's all the same. And every place in the world, we'd given people what they want in this ever-more mobile society. The moving middle class of the world, they have responded to the same invitation with similar enthusiasm. Wynn Palace is a gilt-edged invitation to that party. And my confidence is based upon 40 years of experience, both with American and international players. And the Brazilians and the Mexicans and the Argentinians and the Colombians, where we have offices, and the Venezuelans, the Taiwanese, the South Koreans, the Japanese and the Chinese folks, when they have some money and a chance to enjoy it, they all want the same thing. And that's the basis of my confidence. And I might add, it's most likely if Sheldon was on the call or Francis Lui, they -- or Lawrence Ho or Jamie Packer, they would say the same thing. I believe that to be true. And that's something I'm very hesitant. As you know, I'm insecure about the short-term future of the way things roll out in Macau. But I am not insecure about the answer to that question."

Now it's comforting to note that the liaison officer who represents the fed -- the Central Government in Zhuhai that looks over Macau made a public statement when I was there last week, that there is little or no evidence of any government officials gambling away their money in Macau. He wasn't concerned about that. That was a positive announcement by him, and I think he felt it necessary to say that. But we wait for announcements from the government with bated breadth to understand what their perceptions are of Macau and what the related activities will be as a result of those perceptions. So I think what we're seeing across China is a retrenchment of spending instincts. And how long will that last? I don't know."

And -- but I might point out that in planning Wynn Palace, we were required to submit extensive schedules of how many employees we would need for construction and when we would need them, how many people we would hire from Macau, how many people -- how many tables we'd need, everything was included in the submissions that were considered and reviewed by the government extensively for protracted periods of time. And that process was slow, laborious and extended. And then we got our final approval and we commenced construction. The building was designed and the employees and the promises made to the employees were all based upon all of those submissions and those declarations, which were then approved and accepted, and we were given the green light to go ahead. It seems to me that at the end of the day, the government will respect that. Talks of caps and all of that thing, all of those sort of things, they occurred after our approvals and after our construction had begun and on the land. And so although I don't know what our table total is as we speak today, I have a sense that, that common sense and consistency will be the order of the day. I don't see the government of Macau threatening the security of the employees who live in Macau, who are all shareholders of our company. I just don't see that, nor do I sense that in my conversations with the government. So how they allocate those tables is something that's clearly their own business. But the responsibility for these projects, although we have financed and built them, is also their business. And I have confidence that their common sense and their integrity will, at the end of the day, be the last word on the subject. I don't know how you would look at it if you were -- if you change seats with me this afternoon. But that's my feeling about it. I don't see the government of Macau scuttling their own industry."

We have over 2,000 feet on the strip, and opposing are 2,000 feet -- are the frontage of the old Stardust and the old Frontier Hotel. The Frontier has been purchased by the interest of James Packer, and he has hired people of quality and experience to build and to design and build a facility that is approximately $2 billion. KT Lim, an internationally experienced casino developer in Malaysia and Hong Kong, and even New York with the slot machines at Aqueduct, and Singapore and Malaysia and Aqueduct, he has announced a project on the site of the old Stardust or the Echelon property. Again, it opposes Encore that is $4 billion. Now if you say that instead of an empty land and a couple of shell structures, we're going to have $6 billion worth of construction and eventually in 4 or 5 years, buildings and employees and guests across the street with thousands of rooms, that's worth at least $30 million to $50 million on the bottom line of my company. I love that. And so right away, I see Las Vegas being enhanced going forward by this kind of experienced capital investment. Hopefully, those projects won't be false starts. They will really happen. And the men who have announced them are people fully capable of keeping the promise. That's good news for us in our spot here on the promenade. So my feeling about Las Vegas, it's still the destination of choice worldwide. Otherwise, why would all the Asians come here as they do on Chinese New Year? Why were they all here on New Year's Eve? They filled -- over 2,000 of them filled our ballroom to watch Bruno Mars. And then they shopped and ate and gambled and enjoyed themselves to the hilt. They had a great New Year's. So nothing's new. And I think, again, so much depends on American domestic political situation. I thought that we were under the gun for -- during the recession with administration policies of more of a wet blanket on job formation and economic development than they were constructive. But that was my own personal view. We seem to have overcome the administration and the recession. And we finally, slowly, seem to be crawling out of the ditch we were in. And maybe things will continue to improve in America. But Las Vegas and at least the Wynn Resorts has come through it handily. I think the same thing is going to apply in the future."

I decided to raise the prices. Pricing is always one of the art forms of any business. Pricing blackjack, pricing rooms, pricing everything, it's always a -- you don't want to price yourself out of the market, but you don't want to miss the opportunity to take an increase, especially if you think you've got the kind of demand and reputation that will allow you to do it. We've been able to do that so far. The business of business is not about home runs, it's about bunch and singles. And you build a reputation, you create a platform for a business that can sustain pricing increases over a long period of time because of consistency. Consistency is probably the most important word in politics and business and human relations. Consistency is the most important thing to the future of Macau. Does the world think that China is consistent? That Macau is consistent? That the businesses and the governments will be consistent in their decisions? Consistency allows for a better future and a better life for people. Inconsistency is destabilizing and frightening and then creates all that uncertainty. We live with a certain amount of it on a daily basis. Surely, we do internationally as a nation, with the problems of the Mideast. And surely, we do politically in America, and surely, at the moment, we do deal with uncertainty in China. The question becomes, if the only constant is change and uncertainty, then how agile is the company? How agile is it financially? How agile is it in terms of its human resources? It's very important for CEOs and senior management people in all companies to recognize that flexibility, agility is everything to survival in the modern world. And I think that's probably almost a universal truth these days. That's the main thing that I see going forward, that we maintain the kind of platform that allows us to deal with change easily and with -- and to be agile. And then to trade on our goodwill and our past performance, we've got the concession in Macau because of Bellagio and Mirage. When the government of China decided that day 1, after the takeover, to broaden the appeal of Macau as a worldwide destination, travel and tourist destination, they went looking for people that they thought could do it. And I think that we've got the concession because of our past performance in Las Vegas. And our job in Macau has been to keep that promise going forward with the capital. We've invested as much in China as we've ever made. All of our money is back in there. And in spite of the success we've had, and that is true of Venetian as well as Galaxy and Melco, we're all the same in that regard. Everybody, MGM is doing it as well. So I think that all bodes well for the future in spite of short-term uncertainty."

And so when they say 7,000 people it takes to build 6 million feet, that isn't a wish list, it's just a simple practical explanation of the requirements. And we're 1,600 or 1,700 away from that now. That's it, I guess. So thank you, everybody. I appreciate your attention. Hope that we've been responsive. And we'll wait and see what happens in the next 60 or 90 days."

3449701,283231223,754016,"Wynn Resorts Ltd., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2015",2015-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Wynn Resorts, Limited","Executives","I hope everybody can hear us today. We've issued our earnings which I don't think surprised anybody. I know that in Macau, everybody follows the margins and the weekly casino numbers. January last year was a month in which we had extremely low hold percen",1199,"I hope everybody can hear us today. We've issued our earnings which I don't think surprised anybody. I know that in Macau, everybody follows the margins and the weekly casino numbers. January last year was a month in which we had extremely low hold percentage. And this year, we had a high hold percentage. So surprisingly, we made more money in Macau in January, for example, than we did a year ago. 
Our business for the year looked great, but the fourth quarter was tough. Since Golden Week in October, the effects of the changes in China have had a negative effect on all of the top-end business, whether that means retail top-end like Rolex and Louis Vuitton, or whether we're talking about the high-end gaming in junkets in the VIP section. 
We looked at the fourth quarter and the drop in VIP business. And then we looked at the first month of this year, anticipating the kinds of question we would get today, and we asked ourselves, is January -- were there any indications in January of a change? And in terms of the VIP business, no. It was off by -- turn was off by 40-odd-percent but -- and the occupancy was high because we only have 1,000 rooms in Macau and therefore, we still had occupancy. It was more of our mass occupancy, a little more than VIP occupancy, but the hotel was full. 
Things like Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior were -- and Rolex were off as they were in the fourth quarter during January, even though we made $5 million or $6 million or $7 million more than we did last year. I'm using January because we know the results of this first month. And in January, we were able to make $80-odd-million instead of $70-odd-million. 
In Las Vegas, so there was -- excuse me, if I can stick with Macau for a moment. There was one change. The -- without any adjustment for hold percentage but making normal hold percentage comparisons, which we had last January and this January, our mass business was up 26%. Slots were off by 16% or 18%, but a lot of our slot business is very top-end-oriented. So it reflected the kind of diminution of business that we saw at the tables at the high end. Mass business, though, was up legitimately 26%. 
We also are opening in a week or so the new area of the casino in Macau that is dedicated to VIP business, and it has better facilities than anybody's seen in that town yet. And so -- and we're getting some very good people to occupy that space, which also frees up some of our other space for more mass table games. So to that extent, I think February is going to see an improvement of some sort and I don't need to quantify that. But I expect that we will see a better result comparing that to the previous months. 
In Las Vegas, I mentioned in our third quarter announcement that if we had a legitimate November and December, we'd be the first company to exceed $500 million in profitability probably in the -- not only in the history of Las Vegas, but also in America. And in fact, we did do $515 million in EBITDA in Las Vegas, which was encouraging, and we're very happy about that. 
But China remains a big question mark. We have more questions than answers. Thousands of our Macau employees are anticipating a promotion and a better life because of Wynn Palace, a breakaway property by any measurement, which up until now has been on budget and on time. But we were notified by our builder last night that because of a problem in the timing of our construction labor permits that they thought they were going to miss the Chinese New Year next year as the opening and they would be late with regard to that date that we have used in these calls. 
In our public releases, we've always said that it would be the first half of '16. And I have been more optimistic and said we'd make Chinese New Year, which until last night I thought was true. But if we're to believe the email we got from Leighton Construction, they're not going to make Chinese New Year. They think they're going to miss that date. 
I'm going to explore that a little bit more deeply with them. Mike Harvey is on this call who ran Leighton in Hong Kong and Macau and built our first 2 hotels as the senior executive of Leighton running our jobs. He switched over to become our own executive-in-charge for the Wynn Palace product -- project, so he's in a better position to discuss the Leighton email and its ramifications than I am at the moment. But I do believe that for all of Chinese businessmen, there is at the moment a bit of uncertainty as to what the future will hold because so much of everything in China depends upon the policy of the Central Government. 
We have learned in the last 12 years the way to behave in China and that is to listen very carefully to what the leadership says and to do our best to be helpful and to conform with the program as we are their guest. In my history in China, starting in 2001, I was very lucky to be instructed by former President Bush on how to behave there and that was to be helpful and to understand that culture. And to that extent, I believe that they sort out their problems in an orderly fashion as they see them. And in some cases, that impacts like Macau or Hong Kong. There is nothing to be done but to be patient and to be alert and to do your best to be cooperative and to go along with the program. There's no doubt that the existence of Wynn Palace is a major event in the development of entertainment and tourism in Macau, and I believe that the government recognizes that to be true. We did get a 700 person increase to our construction labor this week, although we requested 1,000, we got 700. And I guess that's encouraging, albeit that it was 3 months late. 
So timing and government approvals are a factor that we have to deal with. Hopefully, we'll be able to keep our promises to our employees that live in Macau and all of the staff that work at these places, and that their hopes for a better life will be fulfilled and that our ambitions to grow in Macau will continue to develop.
I think that's pretty much the kinds of comments that are appropriate at this moment. If any of my colleagues on the call would care to add to any of this, Gamal Aziz and Ian are there. Linda is there, our main connection to the gaming fraternity there. And as I said, Mike Harvey, the construction man, is on the call. And all of us here in Las Vegas and the parent company are standing by for questions, which we'll take at this time."

And we've never, ever, been in a position -- we were the only game in town. We've always, in my career, for the past 40-odd-years, we have competed and prevailed in the most competitive markets that exist. And we tend to thrive under those circumstances because as a top-end operator, we tend to take off the creamy part of the market, whether it's in mass or in VIP. And to be in Boston, Massachusetts and the Metropolitan area in Everett and have almost 4 million people where we're the only game in town is titillating. We worked very hard to compete for the right to operate in Massachusetts, as you know, and it was expensive to do that process and time-consuming, very. We had an 1,800-pound application when it -- when we'd finally finished. We spent $25 million just to get to the end of the game in terms of local elections and requirements with related communities. You know that we had $130 million in infrastructure that we had to agree to. And then there was another $100 million in the cost of the license, other miscellaneous stuff -- we were in -- we're in $230 million of our budget already or promises for that, that are separate and apart from the construction in that project budget. We are going to be the -- one of the top 5 private employers in the history of the State of Massachusetts. We're going to be responsible for $50 million a month in revenue for the state, probably another $50 million in related revenues to all the surrounding communities. We're going to employ thousands and thousands of people. It's the largest construction budget in recent history in Massachusetts, maybe forever. We've got a serious presence there, in Massachusetts, and we're delighted to have that position. And we finished the design of the hotel, and I think it's, along with the Palace, the best work we've ever done based upon 40 years of experience with what's best of all, with the same group of executives that have learned from all of our past experiences and projects. And hopefully, our next stuff that comes up will reflect the evolution and the enlightenment that we've been able to achieve because of those experiences. So speaking for myself, I am delighted with the Boston opportunity Wynn America now enjoys. I think we're alone. This last few months, we got our investment grade, which we've had from Moody's, now from Standard & Poor's, so our credit rating is the highest in the industry. We financed $1.25 billion of our Boston project already a few months ago at LIBOR plus 1.75%, and we're in real apple pie shape just as our financing in China was at LIBOR plus 1.75%. $3,850,000,000 of the project in China was financed nonrecourse at LIBOR plus 1.75% or a total of 3.3% for the $3.85 billion that we raised, again, nonrecourse. Our Boston financing is nonrecourse to the parent, and Wynn America, which is, as I just said, I'm proud to say, investment grade. So all in all, the setup is just right for Massachusetts. And as we wend our way through the complexities of the Asian situation, our setup is just right to keep our promise to our employees and to the government in China."

But the answer is, at least speaking -- I'm getting over a cold. For our company, in each and every case in America, leading up to China, we have broken the record for casino revenue. At the Mirage, we broke the Caesars preexisting record for casino revenue. Then we broke the Mirage record at Bellagio, and then we broke the Bellagio record at Wynn. And then we broke the Wynn record at -- when we opened Encore. And what's interesting though, even though we've gone into the $800 million range, never in the history of our company has our casino revenue met or exceeded our noncasino revenue. That is to say, the reputation of this company -- its status today is based upon the fact that we did not focus completely on gaming, but recognized that gaming was a result, not a cause. That although it was a productive cash register in the building, that the real attraction and the power, the energy and vitality of our enterprise was directly related to its noncasino experiential entertainment and hospitality aspects. The one thing that led to the spread of new concessions in Macau, the desire of that government after the turnover to the PRC was to broaden the appeal of Macau and to diversify from purely Baccarat to beyond Baccarat. Now all of the operators there, all of our competitors, have recognized this from day 1, not because of a mandate from the government necessarily, but because of their understanding of how the industry survives and prospers, based upon creating experiences for people that they can't get at home. Tourism, the broadest definition of tourism, a positive and exciting experience that you can't get at home, and surely we recognize that a slot machine or a Baccarat is an experience you can get anywhere. Every damn slot machine on earth looks like every other one. I can't even tell 1 manufacturer from another from -- unless I look at the plate on the side. Every roulette table is identical to every other roulette table no matter what nation you're in, from one end of the globe to the other. Our company has recognized that more than any other company in history. Our noncasino revenue always exceeds our casino revenue. Wynn Palace was built as Bellagio, and Wynn and Encore have been built to create a complete tourist destination experience. Only the smallest part of our budget in Macau is dedicated to Baccarat tables, but hundreds of millions, yes, billions of dollars, up to $4 billion, dedicated to entertainment, shopping, food and beverage, spas, incredible hotel room experiences and most importantly, to an extensive in-depth training routine and discipline on the area of human resources to guarantee the visitors to Wynn Palace a unique experience for those people who travel and seek to have unique experience.
So when you hear that the Central Government and the Macau government urged operators to diversify the attractions of their facilities, when they speak to us, they're preaching to the choir. We invented that idea. It has been certainly enhanced and it's certainly been carried on by companies like Venetian and Melco, no question, and Galaxy. And all of these facilities being built in Cotai today are remarkable destination resorts. And they were planned and they were executed with enormous amounts of capital before and during any encouragement by the Central Government or the Macau government. So this is a development. This development of noncasino is something that was going to happen anyway and has happened. And I've said this once before; I'm going to repeat it again today. If you take Macau with its destination resorts, which include gaming tables, and you take Hengshan Island, adjacent to Macau, with its additional nongaming attractions like theme parks, I say that, that Macau, Hengshan Island area, will, in the next 5 to 10 years, become the most dynamic tourist destination location on the planet. And that's saying something in a country that has Orlando and Anaheim and Las Vegas. But boy, what's being done over there is really something, and to a certain extent, it's happening in Shanghai as well. So I hope that's responsive to your question."

At the end of this consideration, you and I and everybody else on this call have to ask ourselves, is there a commonality in humanity in terms of aspiration? Is China so different than America? And my answer to that question, based upon these 40-odd-years of dealing with Asian customers more than anybody else probably in the last 30 years, starting with Mirage, and talking to them constantly both here at home and Macau, is that aspirationally, all folks are the same. When they go on vacation, they want to live bigger and better than they can in their normal disciplined lives. And that's what makes destination resorts necessarily special so that they can fulfill that aspirational dynamic. Nothing that we've seen in China has changed my opinion, and in fact, everything that we've experienced in the past 12 years in wonderful Macau has reinforced that. Folks may look differently and talk a different language, and their menu may be different. But in terms of what they want, it's all the same. And every place in the world, we've given people what they want in this ever-more mobile society. The moving middle class of the world, they have responded to the same invitation with similar enthusiasm. Wynn Palace is a gilt-edged invitation to that party. And my confidence is based upon 40 years of experience, both with American and international players. And the Brazilians and the Mexicans and the Argentinians and the Colombians, where we have offices, and the Venezuelans, the Taiwanese, the South Koreans, the Japanese and the Chinese folks, when they have some money and a chance to enjoy it, they all want the same thing. And that's the basis of my confidence. And I might add, it's most likely if Sheldon was on the call or Francis Lui, they -- or Lawrence Ho or Jamie Packer, they would say the same thing. I believe that to be true. And that's something I'm very hesitant. As you know, I'm insecure about the short-term future of the way things roll out in Macau. But I am not insecure about the answer to that question."

I think that -- and you're seeing that all across Mainland China, that people are being cautious. There's an uncertainty in China these days about things that are a little foreign to us here. What is expected of them? What's the relationship of Chinese businessmen to Chinese government officials? Is corruption as widespread as people say it is? I read the South China Morning Post. I talk to people. And this campaign against corruption has been a big wake-up call in China. President Xi Jinping has determined that his leadership should eliminate the perception of corruption. And the only way to do that is to root it out. And you know there's a huge national campaign to investigate public officials and their behavior. Now it's comforting to note that the liaison officer who represents the fed -- the Central Government in Zhuhai that looks over Macau made a public statement when I was there last week, that there is little or no evidence of any government officials gambling away their money in Macau. He wasn't concerned about that. That was a positive announcement by him, and I think he felt it necessary to say that. But we wait for announcements from the government with bated breadth to understand what their perceptions are of Macau and what the related activities will be as a result of those perceptions. So I think what we're seeing across China is a retrenchment of spending instincts. And how long will that last? I don't know."

And -- but I might point out that in planning Wynn Palace, we were required to submit extensive schedules of how many employees we would need for construction and when we would need them; how many people we would hire from Macau; how many people -- how many tables we'd need. Everything was included in the submissions that were considered and reviewed by the government extensively for protracted periods of time. And that process was slow, laborious and extended. And then we got our final approval and we commenced construction. The building was designed and the employees and the promises made to the employees were all based upon all of those submissions and those declarations, which were then approved and accepted, and we were given the green light to go ahead. It seems to me that at the end of the day, the government will respect that. Talks of caps and all of that thing, all of those sort of things, they occurred after our approvals and after our construction had begun and on the land. And so although I don't know what our table total is as we speak today, I have a sense that, that common sense and consistency will be the order of the day. I don't see the government of Macau threatening the security of the employees who live in Macau, who are all shareholders of our company. I just don't see that, nor do I sense that in my conversations with the government. So how they allocate those tables is something that's clearly their own business. But the responsibility for these projects, although we have financed and built them, is also their business. And I have confidence that their common sense and their integrity will, at the end of the day, be the last word on the subject.

I love that. And so right away, I see Las Vegas being enhanced going forward by this kind of experienced capital investment. Hopefully, those projects won't be false starts. They will really happen. And the men who have announced them are people fully capable of keeping the promise. That's good news for us in our spot here on the promenade. So my feeling about Las Vegas, it's still the destination of choice worldwide. Otherwise, why would all the Asians come here as they do on Chinese New Year? Why were they all here on New Year's Eve? They filled -- over 2,000 of them filled our ballroom to watch Bruno Mars. And then they shopped and ate and gambled and enjoyed themselves to the hilt. They had a great New Year's. So nothing's new. And I think, again, so much depends on American domestic political situation. I thought that we were under the gun for -- during the recession with administration policies of more of a wet blanket on job formation and economic development than they were constructive. But that was my own personal view. We seem to have overcome the administration and the recession. And we finally, slowly, seem to be crawling out of the ditch we were in. And maybe things will continue to improve in America. But Las Vegas and at least the Wynn Resorts has come through it handily. I think the same thing is going to apply in the future."

I decided to raise the prices. Pricing is always one of the art forms of any business. Pricing blackjack, pricing rooms, pricing everything, is always a -- you don't want to price yourself out of the market, but you don't want to miss the opportunity to take an increase, especially if you think you've got the kind of demand and reputation that will allow you to do it. We've been able to do that so far. The business of business is not about home runs, it's about bunts and singles. And you build a reputation, you create a platform for a business that can sustain pricing increases over a long period of time because of consistency. Consistency is probably the most important word in politics and business and human relations. Consistency is the most important thing to the future of Macau. Does the world think that China is consistent? That Macau is consistent? That the businesses and the governments will be consistent in their decisions? Consistency allows for a better future and a better life for people. Inconsistency is destabilizing and frightening and then creates all that uncertainty. We live with a certain amount of it on a daily basis. Surely, we do internationally as a nation, with the problems of the Mideast. And surely, we do politically in America, and surely, at the moment, we do deal with uncertainty in China. The question becomes, if the only constant is change and uncertainty, then how agile is the company? How agile is it financially? How agile is it in terms of its human resources? It's very important for CEOs and senior management people in all companies to recognize that flexibility, agility is everything to survival in the modern world. And I think that's probably almost a universal truth these days. That's the main thing that I see going forward, that we maintain the kind of platform that allows us to deal with change easily and with -- and to be agile. And then to trade on our goodwill and our past performance. We got the concession in Macau because of Bellagio and Mirage. When the government of China decided that they wanted, after the takeover, to broaden the appeal of Macau as a worldwide destination, travel and tourist destination, they went looking for people that they thought could do it. And I think that we got the concession because of our past performance in Las Vegas. And our job in Macau has been to keep that promise going forward with the capital. We've invested as much in China as we've ever made. All of our money is back in there. And in spite of the success we've had, and that is true of Venetian as well as Galaxy and Melco, we're all the same in that regard. Everybody, MGM is doing it as well. So I think that all bodes well for the future in spite of short-term uncertainty."

I think the trends in Macau were beginning to be very visible in the fourth quarter, but our hopes for an improvement in the Chinese New Year turned out to be incorrect. And the repositioning of the market and the degradation of the volumes in VIP have continued even into April. 
I'm going to -- most of my remarks now are going to include what we've seen in the first 4 months, not just the first 3 months because the trends that were clear in the January, February and March have continued into April. And as we look at the whole year in Las Vegas and Macau, certain simple truths emerge. 
It is no secret that there's been a change in Mainland China and attitudes towards a number of things that have impacted Macau. That has not -- nothing has changed since this all began last October, and the depression of the VIP market continues. 
This sets us out 44%, 45% or something like that. It is impossible for us to predict how long that will last. We're not at a position to answer those kinds of questions intelligently. We're only in a position to react intelligently to what we see. We run this company, and we have at all times with a few simple guidelines and principles. 
Number one, we want to maximize shareholder value for the people that actually own the company. We want to always be able to honor our debts and never have to ask for reconsideration. In order to do that, we pay careful attention to the capital structure of the company. 
At the core of the whole discussion is what is the franchise of a business like Wynn Resorts or even the others in the hospitality business, and it's simply guest experience. Guest experience is what creates a better tomorrow and allows us to continue a business, eventually raise our prices to offset the rising cost of business. 
People who have a good experience tell their friends, and they come back again and again. Guest experience is the beginning, the middle and the end of the story. If you accept that as a truth then, of course, guest experience is determined by our employees, the people that actually touch our guests and create that experience. So our attention goes from our balance sheet and our financial condition to maintain flexibility, but also it goes immediately to keeping our workforce stabilized, happy and proud to be here. That's the core of our business plan. That's the core of our understanding, and every major decision in this company is determined by those principles alone: protect the employee attitudes and morale because they impact, and they really create the guest experience. 
In order to do that, again our financial condition has to remain flexible, strong and secure. In the 40-odd years I've been in business, we've never altered a debt or any of that sort of thing, and we don't ever intend to do it. 
So as we look backwards for the fourth quarter and especially during the last 4 months and understand what's happening, both in Las Vegas because of the Asian impact of Baccarat, and we look back and then we extrapolate and try to predict the future or at least understand what most likely will be the future, it is foolhardy and immature and unsophisticated to issue dividends on borrowed money. 
We only distribute money that's free cash flow based upon our earnings. Therefore, today, we lowered the dividend as we have raised it in the past. Based upon financial results, we are lowering it today to $0.50 a quarter, and I might add that I and my Board of Directors would not hesitate to adjust the dividend down or up based upon performance without a second thought and without any apology. 
Dividends are nothing, and we don't say that because we have a business that we now have a $0.50 dividends forever. That's baloney. Any company that does that is irresponsible. We distribute the money that we make after we make provisions for capital expenditures and all of our other obligations to creditors and to our employees and then we distribute aggressively whatever is free and easy to distribute after that. 
Now I'm speaking on this call as the largest single recipient of such distributions. There's a few institutions that if you take T. Rowe Price own more shares collectively at least for the moment, but they're in individual pockets. When there's a dividend check in this company, the largest one goes to me. And so I say again unapologetically as a shareholder and as Chairman of the Board, we believe that you distribute the money that's free and clear cash flow after you've met all other obligations, and the Board of Directors should consider that principle every time they meet each quarter as we did this time. 
And I hope that those comments summarize not only our current attitude, but it will allow anybody to predict our future behavior in Wynn Resorts with regard to distributions. 
We have 2 projects that are aggressive and ambitious. One of them is a $4 billion Wynn Palace in Macau, which even though we struggled with adjusting our work schedule on construction to the permissions we've been given for workers on construction by the government, we believe we're going to be open at the end of the first quarter next year in March. 
And Wynn Palace will quite simply be the most extravagant and beautiful hotel in the world, 1,700 rooms, and I don't think there's ever been anything quite like what we're going to show off next year. It took us 2 years to plan it. It's taken 4 years to build it. Big, long, a project conceived by people with experience, and I think will be a powerful addition to the Macau market whatever size that Macau market may be at the moment. 
We do not know how many tables we're going to have. That's a very difficult uncertainty to adjust to, but nevertheless, it is the uncertainty of the moment as to what the government will do. 
When we started the project, we had an understanding that the table levels would -- that we would need approximately the same amount of tables as we had at The Peninsula Hotel, and nobody objected. But then subsequent to our beginning, the government made announcement to institute a cap of certain percentage of table increases a year. 
They've said that the allocation of that percentage of extra tables is a decision that they will make based upon a number of factors, and they will weigh such factors as diversification, noncasino versus casino. The Wynn Palace is the most extravagant exercise in non-casino attractions in Macau. 
We've taken entertainment to every restaurant. We've taken massive public entertainment to the front and dedicated a huge portion of our real estate to public entertainment for tens of millions of dollars, approximately $100 million when we're done with just the front leg. 
So it's going to be the big photo op for Macau, and it will show up next year hopefully with enough tables to allow it to prosper. We'll begin construction this fall in Boston. We've made most of the financial arrangements to finance those projects. Macau was completely financed. Boston is almost completely financed at very favorable rates with a debt that is nonrecourse to the parent. 
And so the company, at the moment, is on strong financial footing. I don't know whether with this change in EBITDA whether S&P and Moody's will continue our bond rating as favorably as they have in the past, but the fundamental health of the company is perfect and without question, and my intention is to keep it that way without any qualification to that statement. 
Now we'll take questions, and all of the executives in China and Las Vegas are here to get into the detail of these stories. I just wanted to provide the overview. 
With that, we'll take questions."

These jobs have, after all, are people from Mainland China just on the other side of the fence. But there's pressure locally. I guess it's sort of the locals don't want the streets too crowded or something, and they put pressure on the local government officials, and they respond. They're very sensitive to local pressure. So it leaves us in a bit of a quandary. We never know quite what to expect these days, and uncertainty for our employees we're beginning to notice that -- we have the lowest -- let me start over on this. In that town where, there's a 25% to 30% turnover rate, our company stands alone with a current rate of 8%. All of last year was 11%. All our employees are very sticky. They like us. They stay with us. That's a big advantage when you're building a new property. However, every one of our employees in Macau is a shareholder of Wynn Macau, and they're counting on the accumulated dividends, the value of those shares as their basic savings. The current situation in Macau is threatening them. And unfortunately, I'm not in a position to protect them from the exposures to the changes that have been brought about in the marketplace. We try and deal with that as we build the new place, but there's no question that uncertainty is the plaguing word of the day in Macau. And hopefully, our government in Macau will calm that down and put some certainty back into the picture, and that'll be very important to the employees, who are basically Macau citizens. But they're beginning to feel these rumbles, and I fear that, that may erupt into protests against the government if it isn't settled soon."

They're never critical of anything directly. When they want something, they make requests. It's a very civilized process, but there's no question that the atmosphere there has changed and become cloudier in terms of predictability and consistency. It's definitely become cloudy. They had a press conference, one of the new ministers as part of this government made a statement in front of legislature that the light-rail system, which has been under development for 5 years that I'm aware of or 6 years, that they don't have any idea exactly when that'll be finished or what it's going to cost.

They just explain how we approach distributions, and I think that applies in good times and hard times as well. In terms of my long-term view, what I object to very often is this unrelenting attempt to CEOs and their agencies in these calls to try and support the stock price with rosy predictions that do not come true. What I'm interested in accomplishing when we have these phone calls is to build up a structure of trustworthiness and suitability about the way we run the company. In order to do that, I have to be very candid about what we see and the conditions that we find ourselves in, and I don't know any other way to handle this and still be true to the notion of creating consistency in the way people perceive the management's common sense and my Board of Director's comments. Incidentally, all of us are totally unanimous on this approach. If I start to talk about gee, don't worry about all this. The long-term is going to be great. Although my instincts tell me that, that has to be true, I mean, after all, President Gin Ping, he instituted this campaign against corruption based upon his explicit explanation that he felt that there was a perception in the 1,300,000,000 Chinese that government officials were corrupt. Of course, there were members of the Communist Party, and that this corruption undermined the public's faith in its government. And therefore, he was bound and determined to change that period, and he set out on this campaign. And if we were to believe the South China Morning Post, a leading newspaper of South China and Hong Kong, then thousands upon thousands of public officials have been brought up on accusations of misconduct of varying degrees. And it's starting at the bureau itself, which is unprecedented and descending all the way down the chain of command to local governments. If this observation is accurate, then Gin Ping is doing the right thing for the right reason. Now does that create a new norm? I don't know. People like to use phrases like that, the new norm. Newspaper people love to be able to make far-reaching and categorical statements. They're irresponsible when they do that. There are no far-reaching and categorical statements, but we know this the only reason the President did this was to strengthen public confidence in his government. His speeches in Macau at December was unequivocal. He supports the continuing prosperity and diversification like our new resort of the offerings for tourism and other industries in Macau. He was unequivocal in that statement, and he has begun to take steps in Mainland China to privatize and to make the government-owned companies even more responsive to the public or to change them to private. If the Communist Party and its leadership are dedicated to a peaceful, growing and harmonious China, then it's hard to believe that they would do anything to sabotage one of their key positions, Macau, going forward or Hong Kong for that matter. And for that reason, one can be very positive about the long-term future of China and its special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau. I look at that big picture to draw my confidence in our participation and hopefully, our long-term participation there as agents of development and change, as visitors and guests of that country to bring about positive results. So there's my long-term view and the reason for it. But these short-term implications are significant. We've lost half the province. You go from making $4 million a day to $2 million a day. Now considering that the success we've had in Macau, $2 million a day would be terrific anywhere else. But compared to the unbelievable events of the past few years, it seems morbid. It's not morbid. Am I being responsive to you in explaining why I tend to talk about what we see and what we think, and I'm trying to deal with the next 6 or 8 months, and it's hard to do. I've been doing this for 40-odd years I have to tell you, and I talked to Sheldon. We're very good friends. It's hard for us. It's hard for Rob Goldstein and the rest of the people, our neighbors next door were up to their eyebrows in development investments in China. They've noticed it in Singapore as well, and then we hear that finally, it appears the Japanese are going to pass -- are on the threshold of passing a study build. We've always been told that if they weren't going to do it, they wouldn't have a study build in the diet. But now it turns out there's going to be a study build it appears this week. We spent the -- I spent the day yesterday with a deputation from Osaka, the whole day yesterday with Osaka, and they were here touring all the hotels. So there's a lot of good news, and I love our opportunity in Boston, and we're going to build them the first really grand hotel in the city with nonstop service from every major capital in Europe, Latin America, Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai. So I don't want to stop anything, but I want to build it carefully and as much insight that we can gain from our 40-odd years of successful experience. We've never had a failure at this industry. We've never had a real bump. We don't do layoffs. Okay."

Basically the opportunity we have in the decline of the VIP business has opened a window for us to attract more of the premium and general mass to the property, which you've seen in the first quarter and actually continues in April. It opened up more room inventory, and it allowed us to invite some of our premium and middle tier of the premium market. And as you saw, the market declined about 27%. Wynn Macau declined only by 6% or 7%. So we're making inroads in that category in that segment of the market. I think that's going to continue. Every time we have an opportunity in the decline of the VIP, we'll open it up for the more aspirational premium and general mass. So I think that's a balance that's going to continue until there is a stabilization on the VIP front. Whether that lasts until the second or third or fourth quarter, we will have the flexibility to fill in the room with mass and premium mass customers. So."

And in private conversations with the government, I raised the question of further diversification, and I'm awaiting their response. The government is tentative at best in responding to us. I think that's a reflection of a little bit of their own uncertainty under the circumstances. I repeat again. The tentativeness of the government is a reflection of their own uncertainty, I believe, in many respects as far as predicting where to go tomorrow or in the near future.

I don't know how you delay Wynn Palace without causing major social disruption in the city. All of these people, their shares, their jobs, their future, these are Macau people are sitting in anticipation of that event. There's never been a hotel of this scale in Macau. And Las Vegas, Venetian is -- Wynn Palace is a $4 billion hotel. Now that money was very carefully spent, and you say it slowly 1,700 rooms, $4 billion. This is a fancy piece of business. It is a destination creating -- it creates more of a destination for Macau from people from far away. Remember, growth in the market is a phrase I've used before. Tourism is all about bringing people from over there to over here, and the way you bring people over there to over here is to make sure that what's here is better than what's over there. That simplistic $0.03 as I just said are at the heart of the way we've designed and created based upon 43 years of unparalleled construction. Every project we've ever done has changed the market. We decided that we were going to try and do that again in Macau, and we took our time, as you know, with the Palace, and it represents our very best effort. The city benefits from that in its appeal to the outside world, to bring folks from outside China and from all over the Pacific Rim to Macau just as the other buildings that have been built by Galaxy and by Melco and by Venetian have done that. The growth of that market, its position as a destination in Asia is the most phenomenal modern development in the last 50 years. Why anyone would want to tamper with that or undermine it flies in the face of all of logic that we have been discussing for the past several minutes, but can there be social disruption? For sure. The public and the citizens of Macau have been brought to a higher level of income and a higher level of expectation, and they don't hesitate to express themselves publicly on this subject. The government is now currently awaiting and hoping there won't be any many demonstrations. Just like America, everybody has high hopes, and everybody gets a little spoiled at times, and they want what they want when they want it, and all we do is try and service this expectation as best we can with the help of the government hopefully."

When we designed the Palace, it was going to have a spectacularly dramatic front area with the fountains and the gondolas and everything else. And of course, it was going to be serviced by the light rail. It was going to stop right in the middle of our front area. Well, whether it stops now or later is irrelevant to the fact that we had to answer the question what do we put on the lake? Well, we put major restaurants and then we put VIP rooms. And each of them had -- and our pool and our recreation area, all look over the lake, and the gondolas pass over it look into recreational area of the hotel from about 30 feet off them and about 30 feet out over the water. It's quite dramatic, and there's new music in the gondolas and air-conditioning in the gondolas as people experience this to use a Disney term this. Now, we've decided to put VIP rooms on the lake, and each one of them have balconies. Well you know there's been a crack down on smoking that's very aggressive by the government. There's no misunderstanding their intention or their rational for those things, and our job is to accept those decisions regardless of our own opinions of those decisions. Frankly, the air inside our hotel is better than the air outside of our hotel. But notwithstanding that truth, we were able to take the mass area and some of our regular gaming and put it in these areas on the lake, which means that these tables can take 3 steps and be outside on a smoking balcony. It has unintended consequences, but it tends to mitigate the impact of the smoking ban because all of these areas around the lake have terraces that are open aired and will allow visitors to smoke if that's their pleasure, and so there's a little silver lining to the smoking cloud. We have an advantage that our competitors don't enjoy in regard to that fact. Just a little piece of business that's interesting about it as you reallocate space. Anybody else want to step up?"

I think the trends in Macau were beginning to be very visible in the fourth quarter, but our hopes for an improvement in the Chinese New Year turned out to be incorrect and the repositioning of the market an",1350,"Well, the numbers in the first quarter are out. I think the trends in Macau were beginning to be very visible in the fourth quarter, but our hopes for an improvement in the Chinese New Year turned out to be incorrect and the repositioning of the market and the degradation of the volumes in VIP have continued even into April.
I'm going to -- most of my remarks now are going to include what we've seen in the first 4 months, not just the first 3 months because the trends that were clear in January, February and March have continued into April. And as we look at the whole year in Las Vegas and Macau, certain simple truths emerge. It is no secret that there's been a change in Mainland China in attitudes towards a number of things that have impacted Macau. That has not -- nothing has changed since this all began last October, and the depression of the VIP market continues. Business is off [ph] 44%, 45% or something like that.
It is impossible for us to predict how long that will last. We're not in a position to answer those kinds of questions intelligently. We're only in a position to react intelligently to what we see. We run this company and we have at all times with a few simple guidelines and principles.
Number one, we want to maximize shareholder value, for the people that actually own the company. We want to always be able to honor our debts and never have to ask for reconsideration. In order to do that, we pay careful attention to the capital structure of the company.
At the core of the whole discussion is what is the franchise of a business like Wynn Resorts or even the others in the hospitality business, and it's simply guest experience. Guest experience is what creates a better tomorrow and allows us to continue in business, eventually raise our prices to offset the rising cost of business. People, when they have a good experience, tell their friends, and they come back again and again.
Guest experience is the beginning, the middle and the end of the story. If you accept that as a truth then, of course, guest experience is determined by our employees, the people that actually touch our guests and create that experience. So our attention goes from our balance sheet and our financial condition to maintain flexibility, but also it goes immediately to keeping our workforce stabilized, happy and proud to be here. That's the core of our business plan. That's the core of our understanding, and every major decision in this company is determined by those principles alone: protect the employee attitudes and morale because they impact and they really create the guest experience.
In order to do that, again, our financial condition has to remain flexible, strong and secure. In the 40-odd years I've been in the business, we've never altered a debt or any of that sort of thing and we don't ever intend to do it.
So as we look backwards for the fourth quarter and especially during the last 4 months and understand what's happening both in Las Vegas because of the Asian impact of baccarat, and we look back and then we extrapolate and try and predict the future or at least understand what most likely will be the future, it is foolhardy and immature and unsophisticated to issue dividends on borrowed money. We only distribute money that's free cash flow based upon our earnings trail.
Therefore, today we lowered the dividend as we have raised it in the past. Based upon financial results, we are lowering it today to $0.50 a quarter, and I might add that I and my Board of Directors would not hesitate to adjust the dividend down or up based upon performance without a second thought and without any apology.
Dividends are nothing, and we don't say that because we have a business that we now have a $0.50 dividends forever. That's baloney. Any company that does that is irresponsible. We distribute the money that we make after we make provisions for capital expenditures and all of our other obligations to creditors and to our employees, and then we distribute aggressively whatever is free and easy to distribute after that.
Now I'm speaking on this call as the largest single recipient of such distributions. There's a few institutions that, if you take T. Rowe Price own more shares collectively at least for the moment, but they're in individual pockets. When there's a dividend check in this company, the largest one goes to me. And so I say again unapologetically, as a shareholder and as Chairman of the Board, we believe that you distribute the money that's free and clear cash flow after you've met all other obligations and the Board of Directors should consider that principle every time they meet each quarter as we did this time. And I hope that those comments summarize not only our current attitude but will allow anybody to predict our future behavior in Wynn Resorts with regard to distributions.
We have 2 projects that are aggressive and ambitious. One of them is a $4 billion Wynn Palace in Macau, which even though we struggled with adjusting our work schedule on construction to the permissions we've been given for workers on construction by the government, we believe we're going to be open at the end of the first quarter next year in March. And Wynn Palace will quite simply be the most extravagant and beautiful hotel in the world, 1,700 rooms, and I don't think there's ever been anything quite like what we're going to show off next year. It took us 2 years to plan it. It's taken 4 years to build it. Big, long project conceived by people with experience and I think will be a powerful addition to the Macau market, whatever size that Macau market may be at the moment. We do not know how many tables we're going to have. That's a very difficult uncertainty to adjust to but nevertheless, it is the uncertainty of the moment as to what the government will do.
When we started the project, we had an understanding that the table levels would -- that we would need approximately the same amount of tables as we had at The Peninsula Hotel and nobody objected. But then subsequent to our beginning, the government made an announcement to institute a cap of certain percentage of table increases a year. They've said that the allocation of that percentage of extra tables is a decision that they will make based upon a number of factors, and they will weigh such factors as diversification non-casino versus casino.
The Wynn Palace is the most extravagant exercise in non-casino attractions in Macau. We've taken entertainment to every restaurant. We've taken massive public entertainment to the front and dedicated a huge portion of our real estate to public entertainment for tens of millions of dollars, approximately $100 million when we're done, with just the front lake.
So it's going to be the big photo op for Macau, and it will show up next year hopefully with enough tables to allow it to prosper. We'll begin construction this fall in Boston. We've made most of the financial arrangements to finance those projects. Macau was completely financed. Boston is almost completely financed at very favorable rates with a debt that is nonrecourse to the parent.
And so the company at the moment is on strong financial footing. I don't know whether with this change in EBITDA whether S&P and Moody's will continue our bond rating as favorably as they have in the past, but the fundamental health of the company is perfect and without question and my intention is to keep it that way without any qualification to that statement.
Now we'll take questions, and all of the executives in China and Las Vegas are here to get into the detail of these stories. I just wanted to provide the overview. With that, we'll take questions."

Then we made another application, and they gave us less than we asked for and we appealed that. I'm not sure how exactly the process works in the calculations that are done at the Labor Department in Macau. These jobs, after all, are people from Mainland China just on the other side of the fence. But there's pressure locally. I guess it's sort of the locals don't want the streets too crowded or something, and they put pressure on the local government officials and they respond -- they're very sensitive to local pressure. So it leaves us in a bit of quandary. We never know quite what to expect these days and uncertainty -- for our employees, we're beginning to notice that our -- we have the lowest -- let me just start over on this. In that town where there's a 25% to 30% turnover rate, our company stands alone with a current rate of 8%. All of last year was 11%. We have -- our employees are very sticky. They like us. They stay with us. That's a big advantage when you're building a new property. However, every one of our employees in Macau is a shareholder of Wynn Macau, and they're counting on the accumulated dividends, the value of those shares as their basic savings. The current situation in Macau is threatening them and unfortunately, I'm not in a position to protect them from the exposures attendant [ph] to the changes that have been brought about in the marketplace. We try and deal with that as we build the new place. But there's no question that uncertainty is the plaguing word of the day in Macau. And hopefully, our government in Macau will calm that down and put some certainty back into the picture, and that will be very important to the employees who are basically Macau citizens, but they're beginning to feel these rumbles and I fear that, that may erupt into protests against the government if it isn't settled soon."

We don't really know how much pressure they feel in different areas. We hear their public statements and we certainly enjoy private conversations with them, but they tend to be very formal. They're never critical of anything directly. When they want something, they make requests. It's a very civilized process, but there's no question that the atmosphere there has changed and become cloudier in terms of predictability and consistency. It's definitely become cloudy. They had a press conference. One of the new ministers, as part of this government, made a statement in front of legislature that the light-rail system, which has been underdevelopment for 5 years that I'm aware of or 6 years, that they don't have any idea exactly when it'll be finished or what it's going to cost. I'm sure that was a painful thing for the man to say exact words. You cannot excuse the unexcusable. I'm here just to apologize.

They just explain how we approach distributions, and I think that applies in good times and hard times as well. In terms of my long-term view, what I object to very often is this unrelenting attempt of CEOs and their agencies in these calls to try and support the stock price with rosy predictions that do not come true. What I'm interested in accomplishing when we have these phone calls is to build up a structure of trustworthiness and predictability about the way we run the company. In order to do that, I have to be very candid about what we see and the conditions that we find ourselves in, and I don't know any other way to handle this and still be true to the notion of creating consistency in the way people perceive the management's common sense and my Board of Director's common sense. Incidentally, all of us are totally unanimous on this approach. If I start to talk about, ""Gee, don't worry about all of this. The long term is going to be great,"" although my instincts tell me that, that has to be true -- I mean, after all, President Xi Jinping, he instituted this campaign against corruption based upon his explicit explanation that he felt that there was a perception in the 1,300,000,000 Chinese that government officials were corrupt -- of course, they were members of the Communist Party, and that this corruption undermined the public's faith in its government and therefore, he was bound and determined to change that, period. And he set out on his campaign, and if we're to believe the South China Morning Post, the leading newspaper of South China and Hong Kong, then thousands upon thousands of public officials have been brought up on accusations of misconduct of varying degrees. And it's starting at the Politburo itself, which is unprecedented, and descending all the way down the chain of command to local governments. If this observation is accurate, then Xi Jinping is doing the right thing for the right reason. Now does that create a new norm? I don't know. People like to use phrases like that, the new norm. Newspaper people love to be able to make far-reaching and categorical statements. They're irresponsible when they do that. There are no far-reaching and categorical statements, but we know this: The only reason that President Xi Jinping did this was to strengthen public confidence in his government. His speeches in Macau in December was unequivocal. He supports the continuing prosperity and the diversification, like our new resort, of the offerings for tourism and other industries in Macau. He was unequivocal in that statement, and he has begun to take steps in Mainland China to privatize and to make the government-owned companies either more responsive to the public or to change them to private. If the Communist Party and its leadership are dedicated to a peaceful, growing and harmonious China, then it's hard to believe that they would do anything to sabotage one of their key positions, Macau, going forward or Hong Kong for that matter. And for that reason, one can be very positive about the long-term future of China and its special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau. I look at that big picture to draw my confidence in our participation, and hopefully our long-term participation there, as agents of development and change, as visitors and guests of that country to bring about positive results. So there's my long-term view and the reason for it. But these short-term implications are significant. We've lost half the province. You go from making $4 million a day to $2 million a day. Now considering the success we've had in Macau, $2 million a day would be terrific anywhere else. But compared to the unbelievable events of the past few years, it seems morbid. It's not morbid. Am I being responsive to you in explaining?"

Basically, the opportunity that we have in the decline of the VIP business has opened a window for us to attract more of the premium and general mass to the property, which you've seen in the first quarter, and it actually continues in April. It opened up more room inventory, and it allowed us to invite some of our premium and middle tier of the premium market. And as you saw, the market declined about 27%. Wynn Macau declined only by 6% or 7%. So we're making inroads in that category, in that segment of the market. I think that's going to continue. Every time we have an opportunity in the decline of the VIP, we'll open it up for the more aspirational premium and general mass. So I think that's a balance that's going to continue until there is a stabilization on the VIP front. Whether that lasts in the -- until the second or third or fourth quarter, we will have the flexibility to fill in the room with mass and premium mass customers. So..."

If that isn't diversification then I need a new lesson in the use of language, but we have followed the guidelines of the government religiously and diversified the offerings that we have. And in private conversations with the government, I raised the question of further diversification and I'm awaiting their response. The government is tentative at best in responding to us. I think that's a reflection of a little bit of their own uncertainty under the circumstances. I repeat again, the tentativeness of the government is a reflection of their own uncertainty, I believe, in many respects as far as predicting where to go tomorrow or in the near future.

I don't know how you delay Wynn Palace without causing major social disruption in the city. All of these people, their shares, their jobs, their future, these are Macau people, are sitting in anticipation of that event. There's never been a hotel with this scale in Macau. And as big as Venetian is, Wynn Palace is a $4 billion hotel. Now that money was very carefully spent, and you say it slowly: 1,700 rooms, $4 billion. This is a fancy piece of business. It is a destination creating -- it creates more of a destination for Macau from people from far away. Remember, growth in the market is a phrase I've used before. Tourism is all about bringing people from over there to over here, and the way you bring people from over there to over here is to make sure that what's here is better than what's over there. That simplistic 3 sentences I just said are the heart of the way we've designed and created based upon 43 years of unparalleled construction. Every project we've ever done has changed the market. We decided that we were going to try and do that again in Macau and we took our time, as you know, with the Palace, and it represents our very best effort. The city benefits from that in its appeal to the outside world, bringing folks from outside China and from all over the Pacific Rim to Macau just as the other buildings that have been built by Galaxy and by Melco and by Venetian have done that. The growth of that market, its position as a destination in Asia, is the most phenomenal modern development in the last 50 years. Why anyone would want to tamper with that or undermine it flies in the face of all of logic that we have been discussing for the past several minutes. But can there be social disruption? For sure. The public, the citizens of Macau have been brought to a higher level of income and a higher level of expectation and they don't hesitate to express themselves publicly on this subject. The government is now currently awaiting and hoping there won't be any May demonstrations. Just like America, everybody has high hopes and everybody gets a little spoiled at times and they want what they want when they want it. And all we do is try and service this expectation as best we can with the help of the government hopefully."

When we designed the Palace, it was going to have a spectacularly dramatic front area with the fountains and the gondolas and everything else. And of course, it was going to be serviced by the light rail that was going to stop right in the middle of our front area. Well, whether it stops now or later is irrelevant to the fact that we had to answer the question, what do we put on the lake? Well, we put major restaurants and then we put VIP rooms. And each of them had -- and our pool and our recreation area all look over the lake. We -- and the gondolas pass over it and look at the recreational area of the hotel from about 30 feet up them and about 30 feet out over the water. It's quite dramatic, and there's music in the gondolas and air-conditioning in the gondolas as people experience this, to use a Disney term, this e-ride [ph]. Now we decided to put VIP rooms on the lake, and each one of them have balconies. Well, you know there's been a crackdown on smoking that's very aggressive by the government. There's no misunderstanding their intention or their rationale for such things, and our job is to accept those decisions regardless of our own opinions about those decisions. Frankly, the air inside our hotel is better than the air outside our hotel. But notwithstanding that truth, we were able to take the mass area and some of our regular gaming and put it in these areas on the lake, which means that these tables can take 3 steps and be outside on a smoking balcony. It was unintended consequences, but it tends to mitigate the impact of the smoking ban because all of these areas around the lake have terraces that are open aired and will allow visitors to smoke if that's their pleasure. And so there's a little silver lining to the smoking cloud. We have an advantage that our competitors don't enjoy in regard to that fact. Just a little piece of business that's interesting about as you reallocate space. Anybody else want to step up here?"

We had to make some changes in the plan to accommodate, as we've learned this year, the weather. And so we've revisited our project to make sure we had adequate snowmelt and the proper disposition of snow when it accumulates so as not to interfere with business. And again remember, you can't just push the snow into the Mystic River. That's against the law. You have to store the water. You have to deal with the snow when it melts, and we've accommodated all of those things. It's a new challenge for us, so it's very interesting to do. I spent several months with my colleague, DeRuyter Butler, with whom I designed these hotels, and we've made changes to ensure that even if there's a blizzard, you'll be able to turn off Alford Street and be on dry pavement as you go to our porte cocheres or our garage. I'm very high on the Boston project and see no reason to say anything else. But timing will depend upon Massachusetts' substantial and formidable regulatory hurdles. Here's a project between $1.5 billion to $2 billion that has $300-odd million. Matt, why don't you put a fine point to this? Hear this now. This is very interesting. In order to build something that is the largest employer, private employer in the state of Massachusetts that will contribute more jobs and more revenue to the state than anything they've seen in decades, how much money have we spent that is not going into the project itself, Matt, just to get into the position to build?"

I think the trends in Macau were beginning to be very visible in the fourth quarter, but our hopes for an improvement in the Chinese New Year turned out to be incorrect and the repositioning of the market an",1350,"Well, the numbers in the first quarter are out. I think the trends in Macau were beginning to be very visible in the fourth quarter, but our hopes for an improvement in the Chinese New Year turned out to be incorrect and the repositioning of the market and the degradation of the volumes in VIP have continued even into April.
I'm going to -- most of my remarks now are going to include what we've seen in the first 4 months, not just the first 3 months because the trends that were clear in January, February and March have continued into April. And as we look at the whole year in Las Vegas and Macau, certain simple truths emerge. It is no secret that there's been a change in Mainland China in attitudes towards a number of things that have impacted Macau. That has not -- nothing has changed since this all began last October, and the depression of the VIP market continues. Business is off 44%, 45% or something like that.
It is impossible for us to predict how long that will last. We're not in a position to answer those kinds of questions intelligently. We're only in a position to react intelligently to what we see. We run this company and we have at all times with a few simple guidelines and principles.
Number one, we want to maximize shareholder value, for the people that actually own the company. We want to always be able to honor our debts and never have to ask for reconsideration. In order to do that, we pay careful attention to the capital structure of the company.
At the core of the whole discussion, is what is the franchise of a business like Wynn Resorts or even the others in the hospitality business, and it's simply guest experience. Guest experience is what creates a better tomorrow and allows us to continue in business, eventually raise our prices to offset the rising cost of business. People, when they have a good experience, tell their friends, and they come back again and again.
Guest experience is the beginning, the middle and the end of the story. If you accept that as a truth then, of course, guest experience is determined by our employees, the people that actually touch our guests and create that experience. So our attention goes from our balance sheet and our financial condition to maintain flexibility, but also it goes immediately to keeping our workforce stabilized, happy and proud to be here. That's the core of our business plan. That's the core of our understanding, and every major decision in this company is determined by those principles alone: protect the employee attitudes and morale because they impact and they really create the guest experience.
In order to do that, again, our financial condition has to remain flexible, strong and secure. In the 40-odd years I've been in the business, we've never altered a debt or any of that sort of thing and we don't ever intend to do it.
So as we look backwards for the fourth quarter and especially during the last 4 months and understand what's happening both in Las Vegas because of the Asian impact on baccarat, and we look back and then we extrapolate and try and predict the future or at least understand what most likely will be the future, it is foolhardy and immature and unsophisticated to issue dividends on borrowed money. We only distribute money that's free cash flow based upon our earnings that trail.
Therefore, today we lowered the dividend as we have raised it in the past. Based upon financial results, we are lowering it today to $0.50 a quarter, and I might add that I and my Board of Directors would not hesitate to adjust the dividend down or up based upon performance without a second thought and without any apology.
Dividends are nothing, and we don't say that because we have a business that we now have a $0.50 dividends forever. That's baloney. Any company that does that is irresponsible. We distribute the money that we make after we make provisions for capital expenditures and all of our other obligations to creditors and to our employees, and then we distribute aggressively whatever is free and easy to distribute after that.
Now I'm speaking on this call as the largest single recipient of such distributions. There's a few institutions that, if you take T. Rowe Price, own more shares collectively at least for the moment, but they're in individual pockets. When there's a dividend check in this company, the largest one goes to me. And so I say again unapologetically, as a shareholder and as Chairman of the Board, we believe that you distribute the money that's free and clear cash flow after you've met all other obligations and the Board of Directors should consider that principle every time they meet each quarter as we did this time. And I hope that those comments summarize not only our current attitude but will allow anybody to predict our future behavior in Wynn Resorts with regard to distributions.
We have 2 projects that are aggressive and ambitious. One of them is a $4 billion Wynn Palace in Macau, which even though we struggled with adjusting our work schedule on construction to the permissions we've been given for workers on construction by the government, we believe we're going to be open at the end of the first quarter next year in March. And Wynn Palace will quite simply be the most extravagant and beautiful hotel in the world, 1,700 rooms, and I don't think there's ever been anything quite like what we're going to show off next year. It took us 2 years to plan it. It's taken 4 years to build it. Big, long project conceived by people with experience and I think will be a powerful addition to the Macau market, whatever size that Macau market may be at the moment. We do not know how many tables we're going to have. That's a very difficult uncertainty to adjust to but nevertheless, it is the uncertainty of the moment as to what the government will do.
When we started the project, we had an understanding that the table levels would -- that we would need approximately the same amount of tables as we had at The Peninsula Hotel and nobody objected. But then subsequent to our beginning, the government made an announcement to institute a cap of certain percentage of table increases a year. They've said that the allocation of that percentage of extra tables is a decision that they will make based upon a number of factors, and they will weigh such factors as diversification non-casino versus casino.
The Wynn Palace is the most extravagant exercise in non-casino attractions in Macau. We've taken entertainment to every restaurant. We've taken massive public entertainment to the front and dedicated a huge portion of our real estate to public entertainment for tens of millions of dollars, approximately $100 million when we're done, with just the front lake.
So it's going to be the big photo op for Macau, and it will show up next year hopefully with enough tables to allow it to prosper. We'll begin construction this fall in Boston. We've made most of the financial arrangements to finance those projects. Macau was completely financed. Boston is almost completely financed at very favorable rates with a debt that is nonrecourse to the parent.
And so the company at the moment is on strong financial footing. I don't know whether with this change in EBITDA whether S&P and Moody's will continue our bond rating as favorably as they have in the past, but the fundamental health of the company is perfect and without question and my intention is to keep it that way without any qualification to that statement.
Now we'll take questions, and all of the executives in China and Las Vegas are here to get into the detail of these stories. I just wanted to provide the overview. With that, we'll take questions."

Then we made another application, and they gave us less than we asked for and we appealed that. I'm not sure how exactly the process works in the calculations that are done at the Labor Department in Macau. These jobs, after all, are people from Mainland China just on the other side of the fence. But there's pressure locally. I guess it's sort of, the locals don't want the streets too crowded or something, and they put pressure on the local government officials and they respond -- they're very sensitive to local pressure. So it leaves us in a bit of a quandary. We never know quite what to expect these days and uncertainty -- for our employees, we're beginning to notice that our -- we have the lowest -- let me just start over on this. In that town where there's a 25% to 30% turnover rate, our company stands alone with a current rate of 8%. All of last year was 11%. We have -- our employees are very sticky. They like us. They stay with us. That's a big advantage when you're building a new property. However, every one of our employees in Macau is a shareholder of Wynn Macau, and they're counting on the accumulated dividends, the value of those shares as their basic savings. The current situation in Macau is threatening them and unfortunately, I'm not in a position to protect them from the exposures attendant to the changes that have been brought about in the marketplace. We try and deal with that as we build the new place. But there's no question that uncertainty is the plaguing word of the day in Macau. And hopefully, our government in Macau will calm that down and put some certainty back into the picture, and that will be very important to the employees who are basically Macau citizens, but they're beginning to feel these rumbles and I fear that, that may erupt into protests against the government if it isn't settled soon."

It's a very civilized process, but there's no question that the atmosphere there has changed and become cloudier in terms of predictability and consistency. It's definitely become cloudy. They had a press conference. One of the new ministers, as part of this government, made a statement in front of legislature that the light-rail system, which has been underdevelopment for 5 years that I'm aware of or 6 years, that they don't have any idea exactly when it'll be finished or what it's going to cost.

In terms of my long-term view, what I object to very often is this unrelenting attempt of CEOs and their agencies in these calls to try and support the stock price with rosy predictions that do not come true. What I'm interested in accomplishing when we have these phone calls is to build up a structure of trustworthiness and predictability about the way we run the company. In order to do that, I have to be very candid about what we see and the conditions that we find ourselves in, and I don't know any other way to handle this and still be true to the notion of creating consistency in the way people perceive the management's common sense and my Board of Director's common sense. Incidentally, all of us are totally unanimous on this approach. If I start to talk about, ""Gee, don't worry about all of this. The long term is going to be great,"" although my instincts tell me that, that has to be true -- I mean, after all, President Xi Jinping, he instituted this campaign against corruption based upon his explicit explanation that he felt that there was a perception in the 1,300,000,000 Chinese that government officials were corrupt -- of course, they were members of the Communist Party, and that this corruption undermined the public's faith in its government and therefore, he was bound and determined to change that, period. And he set out on his campaign, and if we're to believe the South China Morning Post, the leading newspaper of South China and Hong Kong, then thousands upon thousands of public officials have been brought up on accusations of misconduct of varying degrees. And it's starting at the Politburo itself, which is unprecedented, and descending all the way down the chain of command to local governments. If this observation is accurate, then Xi Jinping is doing the right thing for the right reason. Now does that create a new norm? I don't know. People like to use phrases like that, the new norm. Newspaper people love to be able to make far-reaching and categorical statements. They're irresponsible when they do that. There are no far-reaching and categorical statements, but we know this: The only reason that President Xi Jinping did this was to strengthen public confidence in his government. His speeches in Macau in December was unequivocal. He supports the continuing prosperity and the diversification, like our new resort, of the offerings for tourism and other industries in Macau. He was unequivocal in that statement, and he has begun to take steps in Mainland China to privatize and to make the government-owned companies either more responsive to the public or to change them to private. If the Communist Party and its leadership are dedicated to a peaceful, growing and harmonious China, then it's hard to believe that they would do anything to sabotage one of their key possessions, Macau, going forward or Hong Kong for that matter. And for that reason, one can be very positive about the long-term future of China and its special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau. I look at that big picture to draw my confidence in our participation, and hopefully our long-term participation there, as agents of development and change, as visitors and guests of that country to bring about positive results. So there's my long-term view and the reason for it. But these short-term implications are significant. We've lost half the province. You go from making $4 million a day to $2 million a day. Now considering the success we've had in Macau, $2 million a day would be terrific anywhere else. But compared to the unbelievable events of the past few years, it seems morbid. It's not morbid. Am I being responsive to you in explaining?"

So there's a lot of good news, and I love our opportunity in Boston. And we're going to build them the first really grand hotel in the city with nonstop service from every major capital in Europe, Latin America, Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai. So I don't want to stop anything, but I want to build them carefully with as much insight that we can gain from our 40-odd years of successful experience. We've never had a failure in this industry. We've never hit a real bump. We don't do layoffs. Okay."

Basically, the opportunity that we have in the decline of the VIP business has opened a window for us to attract more of the premium and general mass to the property, which you've seen in the first quarter, and it actually continues in April. It opened up more room inventory, and it allowed us to invite some of our premium and middle tier of the premium market. And as you saw, the market declined about 27%. Wynn Macau declined only by 6% or 7%. So we're making inroads in that category, in that segment of the market. I think that's going to continue. Every time we have an opportunity in the decline of the VIP, we'll open it up for the more aspirational premium and general mass. So I think that's a balance that's going to continue until there is a stabilization on the VIP front. Whether that lasts in the -- until the second or third or fourth quarter, we will have the flexibility to fill in the room with mass and premium mass customers. So..."

It'll be the photo op in China. If that isn't diversification then I need a new lesson in the use of language, but we have followed the guidelines of the government religiously in diversifying the offerings that we have. And in private conversations with the government, I raised the question of further diversification and I'm awaiting their response. The government is tentative at best in responding to us. I think that's a reflection of a little bit of their own uncertainty under the circumstances. I repeat again, the tentativeness of the government is a reflection of their own uncertainty, I believe, in many respects as far as predicting where to go tomorrow or in the near future. There's a new boss in China, Xi Jinping, and his agenda is something that everybody is adjusting to. He's a very dynamic man. He enjoys enormous popularity among the people of China.

I don't know how you delay Wynn Palace without causing major social disruption in the city. All of these people, their shares, their jobs, their future, these are Macau people, are sitting in anticipation of that event. There's never been a hotel with this scale in Macau. And as big as Venetian is, Wynn Palace is a $4 billion hotel. Now that money was very carefully spent, and you say it slowly: 1,700 rooms, $4 billion. This is a fancy piece of business. It is a destination creating -- it creates more of a destination for Macau from people from far away. Remember, growth in the market -- this is a phrase I've used before: tourism is all about bringing people from over there to over here, and the way you bring people from over there to over here is to make sure that what's here is better than what's over there. That simplistic 3 sentences I just said are at the heart of the way we've designed and created based upon 43 years of unparalleled construction. Every project we've ever done has changed the market. We decided that we were going to try and do that again in Macau and we took our time, as you know, with the Palace, and it represents our very best effort. The city benefits from that in its appeal to the outside world, bringing folks from outside China and from all over the Pacific Rim to Macau just as the other buildings that have been built by Galaxy and by Melco and by Venetian have done that. The growth of that market, its position as a destination in Asia, is the most phenomenal modern development in the last 50 years. Why anyone would want to tamper with that or undermine it flies in the face of all of logic that we have been discussing for the past several minutes. But can there be social disruption? For sure. The public, the citizens of Macau have been brought to a higher level of income and a higher level of expectation and they don't hesitate to express themselves publicly on this subject. The government is now currently awaiting and hoping there won't be any May demonstrations. Just like America, everybody has high hopes and everybody gets a little spoiled at times and they want what they want when they want it. And all we do is try and service this expectation as best we can with the help of the government hopefully."

When we designed the Palace, it was going to have a spectacularly dramatic front area with the fountains and the gondolas and everything else. And of course, it was going to be serviced by the light rail that was going to stop right in the middle of our front area. Well, whether it stops now or later is irrelevant to the fact that we had to answer the question, what do we put on the lake? Well, we put major restaurants and then we put VIP rooms. And each of them had -- and our pool and our recreation area all look over the lake. We -- and the gondolas pass over it and look at the recreational area of the hotel from about 30 feet above them and about 30 feet out over the water. It's quite dramatic, and there's music in the gondolas and air-conditioning in the gondolas as people experience this, to use a Disney term, this e-ride. Now we decided to put VIP rooms on the lake, and each one of them have balconies. Well, you know there's been a crackdown on smoking that's very aggressive by the government. There's no misunderstanding their intention or their rationale for such things, and our job is to accept those decisions regardless of our own opinions about those decisions. Frankly, the air inside our hotel is better than the air outside our hotel. But notwithstanding that truth, we were able to take the mass area and some of our regular gaming and put it in these areas on the lake, which means that these tables can take 3 steps and be outside on a smoking balcony. It was unintended consequences, but it tends to mitigate the impact of the smoking ban because all of these areas around the lake have terraces that are open aired and will allow visitors to smoke if that's their pleasure. And so there's a little silver lining to the smoking cloud. We have an advantage that our competitors don't enjoy in regard to that fact. Just a little piece of business that's interesting about as you reallocate space. Anybody else want to step up here?"

You have to deal with the snow when it melts, and we've accommodated all of those things. It's a new challenge for us, so it's very interesting to do. I spent several months with my colleague, DeRuyter Butler, with whom I designed these hotels, and we've made changes to ensure that even if there's a blizzard, you'll be able to turn off Alford Street and be on dry pavement as you go to our porte cocheres or our garage. I'm very high on the Boston project and see no reason to say anything else. But timing will depend upon Massachusetts' substantial and formidable regulatory hurdles. Here's a project between $1.5 billion to $2 billion that has $300-odd million. Matt, why don't you put a fine point to this? Hear this now. This is very interesting. In order to build something that is the largest employer, private employer in the state of Massachusetts that will contribute more jobs and more revenue to the state than anything they've seen in decades, how much money have we spent that is not going into the project itself, Matt, just to get into the position to build?"

They're sort of, I think, probably no surprise to anybody. Macau continues to be more of a question than a certainty as we head through 2015 and towards our opening on March 25 of Wynn Palace in 2016.",587,"Good afternoon, everybody. You've seen our numbers. They're sort of, I think, probably no surprise to anybody. 
Macau continues to be more of a question than a certainty as we head through 2015 and towards our opening on March 25 of Wynn Palace in 2016. Our construction, and our staffing is on schedule. We've made some adjustments in the staffing until we have a clearer picture of the game total that will be allocated to us by the government. But in the meantime, we're finishing this building. 
I would mention that, as I have in the past, that the design of this building and its creation over 5 years ago was done in anticipation of market conditions perhaps not as critical as they are today, but under the general assumption that the robust and unprecedented growth in the market would not be the kind of growth we'd be experiencing in 2016 and that we would face competition for which we had great respect. 
Our fellow operators in Macau are intelligent. They're extremely well financed, and they're quick to learn and to accommodate the things that they see in other hotels and to accommodate changes necessitated by their own experience in that market. It's a very, very sharp place. The buildings that are built represent remarkable diversifications into nongaming attractions. And of course, that adds to the competitive nature of our situation. 
We designed the hotel, as I say, in anticipation of just such an environment, perhaps not quite as critical as one we are facing, but we said we had to be clearly, clearly a superior choice competitively. We enjoy a segment of the market that we want to continue to enjoy: the upper premium, the VIP business and the top end of the mass marketing. We enjoy that advantage today, and we intended to increase that advantage by the opening of Wynn Palace. 
Such were the assumptions of its creation, and I'm happy to say that, that was the result of the construction and the development. Our staff, headed by Mr. Gamal Aziz and Ian Coughlan and Linda Chen in China, are doing an excellent job in preparing the place to make a good opening and make a good impression on our guests, so that hopefully, the Wynn Palace will be everybody's first choice when they go to Cotai. 
In Las Vegas, we were enjoying a comfortable business, I think, is the right word for it. It's not an aggressive growth by any means, but we are enjoying noncasino revenue that is acceptable. 
Our game -- our slot machine and table games are growing with one exception. It should come as no surprise to professionals on this call, and that is that since we were the operator of choice for the international baccarat business, namely, from China that if anything interfered with that business, we would, of course, experience more of a penalty in that regard than our competitors since we had more of those kinds of people attending our hotel. When that group is diminished, we, of course, feel it critically. 
So our baccarat table business has suffered, mainly because of the absence of a number of Asian players. But business from Latin America is still good, and perhaps that explains why we had clearly the most powerful performance in this quarter of any operator in America. 
And with that, I think I've sort of summarized whatever I can add to the conversation today, and I'll be glad to take questions along with my colleagues."

I think the right number is closer to 22 because of the dominance of baccarat. You can -- if you look at is historically, and you -- in calculating hold percentage because we have so many buy ins at the cage, which is completely atypical from the American experience, usually we know exactly what the drop or the handle is in a casino in Las Vegas for those of you who may not be quite familiar with this term. We count -- when someone gambles at a table, at any table in the world, they have to buy chips. They come to the table. They give the money to the dealer. The dealer drops the money in the box and slides the chips out of the rack to the customer, and that's the buy in. The other way that people get chips is with credit, and when they take a marker, if they're approved by the supervisor in charge or the team leader then the chips are slid across the table out of the rack just as if they had paid cash, and a credit slip associated with the marker goes into the box in lieu of cash. Now there are other pieces of paper in the box that represent changes to the inventory in the rack during the 8-hour shift fills if there's a need for more chips when the customers are winning or credit slips if the customers are losing, and the rack gets overcrowded with the chips that are taken back. We return them to the cage. They don't have anything to do with handle. What we measure is the cash and the credit slips associated with markers. That tells us the total amount of activity. We measure that against the changes in the opening and closing inventories of the shift, and that tells us the performance of the table or the win. In China, and virtually no one buys chips at the cage in America at least in our experience over the last 40-odd-years and then walks to a table and gambles. In China, they do, in fact, do exactly that. I don't know whether it's because they're using their credit card or they're cashing in whatever RMBs they have or whatever, but people that go to the cage, buy chips and then circulate around the casino and bring the gaming tokens to the table with them. That means that when we count the boxes, it's not a measurement truly of the drop or activity in the casino, the handle it's referred to in the alternative. So we started now taking the buy ins of the cage at the cashier and the money and credit slips in the box although in the mass casino, we don't give credit at the table, but we take the cash and the buy ins at the cage, and we try as close as we can to then recreate a comparable number that all of you would understand as handle or drop or the level of activity at the tables. I hope I'm being clear enough in this explanation. And based upon this, we've gone back and tried to give a comparison of the real hold compared to the theoretical hold of the mass table game activity in China. And my experience because of the dominance of baccarat, that, that number be between 22 and 23. Matt thinks it should be 20, but at any rate, it's arbitrary. You can make an adjustment any way you'd like. If you look at us historically, it's what I said 22, 23. Matt is -- the whole financial structure of this company is extremely conservative as you know. So Matt decided to say well, it's 20, and I think that's on the low side, but call it what you may. Go ahead, Matt. Anything else? I hope that was clarified how it works. Many people don't really understand casino accounting or what handle is, and I thought maybe good idea to slide it in."

We're in a marketplace where we're 6 to 8 months out from opening Wynn Palace. We are doing a huge amount of training on property, getting people ready for promotions to the new property.

On the revenue side, clearly, the junket market continues to be challenged in the way it's being challenged for the last 12, 14 months. On the mass casino side, we've taken advantage of as described previously of the additional room inventory. Currently, 51% of our room inventory is going to the mass table games and mass slot area, and that's worked out very successfully. We clearly see difficulty at the very high level of mass as those players are impacted in the same way that the junket and direct players are impacted from a liquidity perspective. But we found a very rich stream of customers in the mid-tier, the business class of mass, and that continues to grow for us. The grind aspect of mass is stable. On the hotel side, you can see the numbers are still in the mid- -- occupancy still around 96% with a decent average rate. The towns got a lot more competitive, particularly in Cotai with the addition of more Galaxy room inventory and more to come with Studio City, but we continue to drive high occupancy with a good rate. Food and beverages impacted in fine dining, particularly because of the lack of junket complementaries, and that's been the pattern since late last year. So where we can, we're driving revenues, and there has been some stability looking at junket turnover.

We have these -- we get the benefit of these tremendous big players. But when you have one of these giant months where you win all the money, the next year, it always looks a little funny. In the end, it all evens out, but we see these volatility fluctuations. But our base business tends to be pretty steady. And Shaun, I guess, that's the best way to explain it. We had more Chinese play last year than we did this year, and I mean, a place like our own, we can make $60 million in a month in this hotel or $70 million. We can also make $25 million. And as I say, it evens out at the end. But when you look at it, short term as we do every 6 or 8 hours a day, I do at least. I'm in the casino every day and on the phone with my people. We've readjusted our floor on the Fourth of July. Interestingly enough, many of the games in Las Vegas have become marginally profitable. Years ago, down at, they started the crap table of giving 10x odds. If you bet $100 on the line, you could bet $1,000 on the free odds behind the line if you bet the past line, a little technical. But in the old days of dice, whatever you bet on the line, you could bet the same amount behind the line, and that was able percentage of a little under 1%. Then they started giving double odds to compared to the amount of money you bet on the pass line, and that lowered the house percentage to 0.57. And then there became a pattern on The Strip of what's called the 3, 4, 5 depending on what numbers you were betting on the crap table to come up before #7 came up, you could get 3x odds, 4x odds or 5x odds depending -- there are pairs of numbers on a dice table. 4 and 10 have 2 to 1 odds. 5 and 9 have a different set of odds, and 6 to 8 are 6 to 5. Well, depending on what number you were trying to get, you could get 3, 4 or 5x odds. That became a house advantage of 0.37 with 3 dealers and a box man and half of the floor man for every table. Craps is not a really profitable game at that level. So I changed the casino. In effect, that raised the price, and I went to double odds only except for extremely high play with $1,000 minimum bet. I also rearranged the floor in the casino to put our specialty games that are very popular with the public that have a higher margin, and I put them in the 100% location, and I moved my less -- my games with less of a margin to secondary locations. Those changes have worked out favorably to us in the past 3 weeks, and that kind of reexamination. Our slot floors has been redone. We win more money with less games now. These are some of the reasons why we make more money than anybody else in Las Vegas. Now some of the operators will copy us. We're not allowed to talk to one another because of obvious legal implications of price fixing, but we don't really care what the other guys do. We run our own business the way we see we should, and we're not in business to offer games that don't make money. I don't mind saying that publicly. So we've done quite a bit of work in tightening up the way the casino works, and I know our competitors are on the call, and they probably -- everybody knows it. The minute you make a change like that in Las Vegas, it goes around town like a wildfire. But those are some of the things we're doing, and it touches every aspect. We're constantly reexamining everything we do here. We sit in my office and discuss the most fundamental aspects of this industry every single week, and we take nothing. We are not so much concerned of what has been or what is as we are concerned about what might be, and that's a principal truth of our company, whether it's in China or in Las Vegas or Boston or wherever."

We have a continuing dialogue with the government because their major interest is to protect the security of the jobs of the people and the city, to keep harmony, tranquility and even a very positive attitude among the citizens, whether it's in Hong Kong or Macau about the future. Our job as agents of change is to give input to the government, in advance if possible, of what the consequences of a given change in public policy might be. We do so with respect, and as I say, we approach them with gratitude for being able to be there in the first place. It's been a wonderful business experience comparable to none that I'm aware of. And so when we talk to the government, we do so constructively. And what we can do appropriately is to tell them what we think the consequences of a given situation will be. We don't pound the table or make any demands. We strictly say, ""If you do that, this is likely to happen."" If you do that, then there'll be another result, and we'll do to our best to accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative to quote one of Johnny Mercer's old lyrics. So that -- so I was glad to see that they allowed the smoking rooms. There was no reason not to. And Secretary Tam, who is very concerned about public health, finally felt as if it was okay to allow the smoking rooms to continue, and that's a good thing. Relaxation of the visas to allow people in China to travel freely is consistent with the reform mindedness of Xi Jinping's government, and I think consistent with the attitude of the local government as well."

I am not an expert on China, and I'm not even a Wall Street expert, but I am a person who's been in a public company for 40 years. And my own experience, had I been consulted, I would have said don't do that exactly because if someone thinks that you're going to close the door in their ability to sell or trade their shares, you can only do that for a certain length of time, and then the minute you finish doing it, the people scamper for the door because there's a loss of trust. So interfering with the markets tend to produce -- is counterproductive. It tends to accentuate people's insecurity, which leads to selling. So I hope that they're relaxing that, they're backing out of that, and I hope they do it more affirmatively for the sake of the market. Now that's not really my concern because our stock can trade at level A or level B. We don't pay very much attention to our stock price per se.

Anytime that a construction project, a change in operating procedure or an acquisition or a merger would result in a stronger company at the conclusion of such a transaction, we are very interested in it. We discuss it extensively and then follow through if it's appropriate. As we sit here today, we've never had such a opportunity presented to us that we thought was acceptable. That doesn't mean that at some point in the future such a thing couldn't happen or that such an M&A, to use your term, a merger and acquisition would make sense. But big for the sake of big is not a thing that I subscribe to as you know, and I've said so before. We have a certain kind of a brand. It is flexible and adjustable for sure, but on the other hand, I'm more interested about tomorrow's newspaper than yesterday's newspaper, and we do a certain thing very well. We build and develop projects that usually room for room, inch for inch, pound for pound outperform the neighbors. The best place to see that at the present time is Las Vegas. As far as Cotai goes and Macau, when we open Wynn Palace, we're going to get a much more interesting comparison about the performance of the horses in the race. We're about to enter the starting gate in Cotai in a few months, and then we're going to have a real interesting -- we're going to have a real interesting turnaround to track. But as far as today, M&A is the kind of option that, of course, always exist. I mean, for a price, you can buy anything I suppose, and some people find it in their mutual best interest to join up from time to time because the net result is the 2 and 2 equals 5, but really it has to be 2 and 2 equals 5. If 2 and 2 equals 4, it seems to me a lot of trouble for nothing. I'd rather build our own stuff. Is that a helpful answer to you?"

You might -- you could surmise that by restricting the flow of construction workers that it had that effect, but there similarly other explanations for the amount of construction workers that were parsed out in the past, having to do with traffic and congestion and local population being distressed if the streets are overcrowded and things like that. The government is very sensitive to the mood of the public in Macau. They had those demonstrations in Hong Kong, and they didn't have any in Macau. And that, of course, is favorably observed by the central government and is one of the major goals of the Chief Executive Fernando Chui. He wants harmony in the city, and I think that most of the decisions he's made have been to create that environment.

We've never been or a riverboat operator. We build resorts that are much more extravagant and attractive than they would be were not for the fact that somewhere down the hall, there's a gaming room. But we're basically in the resort business that has casinos included, and what we're bringing to Boston is a destination resort. And we've -- as the publicity has shown that we've experienced a little bit of buffeting politically, and we're sort of plowing ahead anyway. We receive encouragement for a number -- for many quarters in that community, but we get resistance from others because the casinos seem to be such a prize for whatever local community could take advantage of its presence in that community that Boston has been rather critical of us because we weren't in Boston. But we are in Everett, and in Everett, Massachusetts. We once tried to go to Boston, but the near the convention center when this all started, and the man in charge of convention said no, forget it. That property's not available. It was right next door to the convention center. So Matt went down the street to another town, Everett, were glad to see us, but unfortunately, said that you have to clean up a chemical dump site in order to do it on the Mystic River. Well, we thought it was worth the trouble. So we went to Everett, where 86% of the population was delighted to see us and voted to say so, and then finally, the citizens of Massachusetts in a plebiscite voted to support the legislation that invited a company like ours to Massachusetts. So the table seemed to be set for -- the welcome mat seem to be out. We just haven't found the welcome yet, but I'm an optimistic, and I'm hoping it'll feel good when they stop hitting us, and I think that's my last comment today. Thanks, everybody.

They're sort of, I think, probably no surprise to anybody. Macau continues to be more of a question than a certainty as we head through 2015 and towards our opening on March 25 of Wynn Palace in 2016.",588,"Good afternoon, everybody. You've seen our numbers. They're sort of, I think, probably no surprise to anybody. 
Macau continues to be more of a question than a certainty as we head through 2015 and towards our opening on March 25 of Wynn Palace in 2016. Our construction, and our staffing is on schedule. We've made some adjustments in the staffing until we have a clearer picture of the game total that will be allocated to us by the government. But in the meantime, we're finishing this building. 
I would mention that, as I have in the past, that the design of this building and its creation over 5 years ago was done in anticipation of market conditions perhaps not as critical as they are today, but under the general assumption that the robust and unprecedented growth in the market would not be the kind of growth we'd be experiencing in 2016, and that we would face competition for which we had great respect. 
Our fellow operators in Macau are intelligent. They're extremely well financed, and they're quick to learn and to accommodate the things that they see in other hotels and to accommodate changes necessitated by their own experience in that market. It's a very, very sharp place. The buildings that are built represent remarkable diversifications into nongaming attractions. And of course, that adds to the competitive nature of our situation. 
We designed the hotel, as I say, in anticipation of just such an environment, perhaps not quite as critical as the one we are facing, but we said we had to be clearly, clearly a superior choice competitively. We enjoy a segment of the market that we wanted to continue to enjoy: the upper premium, the VIP business and the top end of the mass marketing. We enjoy that advantage today, and we intended to increase that advantage by the opening of Wynn Palace. 
Such were the assumptions of its creation, and I'm happy to say that, that was the results of the construction and the development. Our staff, headed by Mr. Gamal Aziz and Ian Coughlan and Linda Chen in China, are doing an excellent job in preparing the place to make a good opening and make a good impression on our guests, so that hopefully, the Wynn Palace will be everybody's first choice when they go to Cotai. 
In Las Vegas, we were enjoying a comfortable business, I think, is the right word for it. It's not an aggressive growth by any means, but we are enjoying noncasino revenue that is acceptable. 
Our game -- our slot machine and table games are growing with one exception, which should come as no surprise to professionals on this call, and that is that since we were the operator of choice for the international baccarat business, namely, from China that if anything interfered with that business, we would, of course, experience more of a penalty in that regard than our competitors since we had more of those kinds of people attending our hotel. When that group is diminished, we, of course, feel it critically. 
So our baccarat table business has suffered, mainly because of the absence of a number of Asian players. But business from Latin America is still good, and perhaps that explains why we had clearly, the most powerful performance in this quarter of any operator in America. 
And with that, I think I've sort of summarized whatever I can add to the conversation today, and I'll be glad to take questions along with my colleagues."

I think the right number is closer to 22 because of the dominance of baccarat. but you can -- if you look at this historically, and you -- in calculating hold percentage because we have so many buy-ins at the cage, which is completely atypical from the American experience, usually we know exactly what the drop or the handle is in a casino in Las Vegas for those of you who may not be quite familiar with this term. We count -- when someone gambles at a table, at any table in the world, they have to buy chips. They come to the table. They give the money to the dealer. The dealer drops the money in the box and slides the chips out of the rack to the customer, and that's the buy-in. The other way that people get chips is with credit, and when they take a marker, if they're approved by the supervisor in charge or the team leader then the chips are slid across the table out of the rack just as if they had paid cash, and a credit slip associated with the marker goes into the box in lieu of cash. Now there are other pieces of paper in the box that represent changes to the inventory in the rack, during the 8-hour shift, fills if there's a need for more chips when the customers are winning, or credit slips if the customers are losing, and the rack gets overcrowded with the chips that are taken back. We return them to the cage. They don't have anything to do with handle. What we measure is the cash and the credit slips associated with markers. That tells us the total amount of activity. We measure that against the changes in the opening and closing inventories of the shift, and that tells us the performance of the table, or the win. In China, and virtually no one buys chips at the cage in America, at least in our experience over the last 40-odd-years and then walks to a table and gambles. In China, they do, in fact, do exactly that. I don't know whether it's because they're using their credit card, or they're cashing in whatever RMBs they have or whatever, but people go to the cage, buy chips and then circulate around the casino and bring the gaming tokens to the table with them. That means that when we count the boxes, it's not a measurement truly of the drop or activity in the casino, the handle, it's referred to in the alternative. So we started now taking the buy-ins of the cage at the cashier and the money and credit slips in the box. Although in a mass casino, we don't give credit at the table, but we take the cash and the buy-ins at the cage, and we try as close as we can to then recreate a comparable number that all of you would understand as handle or drop, or the level of activity at the tables. I hope I'm being clear enough in this explanation. And based upon this, we've gone back and tried to give a comparison of the real hold compared to the theoretical hold of the mass table game activity in China. And my experience because of the dominance of baccarat, that, that number should be between 22 and 23. Matt thinks it should be 20 million, but at any rate, it's arbitrary. You can make an adjustment anyway you'd like. If you look at us historically, it's what I said 22, 23. Matt is -- the whole financial structure of this company is extremely conservative as you know. So Matt decided to say well, it's 20, and I think that's on the low side, but call it what you may. Go ahead, Matt. Anything else? I hope that was clarified how it works. Many people don't really understand casino accounting or what handle is, and I thought it might be a good idea to slide it in."

So we continue to watch it, but the big opportunity is when we build in labor into Wynn Palace, and we can reform back at Wynn Macau, we'll see a drop in headcount here, and we're getting ready for that. On the revenue side, clearly, the junket market continues to be challenged in the way it's being challenged for the last 12, 14 months. On the mass casino side, we've taken advantage as described previously of the additional room inventory. Currently, 51% of our room inventory is going to the mass table games and mass slot area, and that's worked out very successfully. We clearly see difficulty at the very high level of mass as those players are impacted in the same way, that the junket and direct players are impacted from a liquidity perspective. But we found a very rich stream of customers in the mid-tier, the business class of mass, and that continues to grow for us. The grind aspect of mass is stable. On the hotel side, you can see the numbers are still in the mid -- occupancy still around 96% with a decent average rate. The towns got a lot more competitive, particularly in Cotai, with the addition of more Galaxy room inventory and more to come with Studio City, but we continue to drive high occupancy with a good raise. Food and beverages impacted in fine dining, particularly because of the lack of junket complementaries, and that's been the pattern since late last year.

We have these -- we get the benefit of these tremendous big players. But when you have one of these giant months where you win all the money, the next year, it always looks a little funny. In the end, it all evens out, but we see these volatility fluctuations. But our base business tends to be pretty steady. And Shaun, I guess, that's the best way to explain it. We had more Chinese play last year than we did this year, and I mean, a place like our own, we can make $60 million in a month in this hotel or $70 million. We can also make $25 million. And as I say, it evens out at the end. But when you look at it, short term as we do every 6 or 8 hours a day, I do at least. I'm in the casino every day, and on the phone with my people. We've readjusted our floor on the 4th of July and interesting enough, many of the games in Las Vegas have become marginally profitable. Years ago, down at Binions, they started the crap table of giving 10x odds. If you bet $100 on the line, you could bet $1,000 on the free odds behind the line, if you bet the past line. I'm getting a little technical, but in the old days in dice, whatever you bet on the line, you could bet the same amount behind the line, and that was a whole percentage of a little under 1%. Then they started giving double odds to -- compared to the amount of money you bet on the pass line, and that lowered the house percentage to 0.57. Then that became a pattern on The Strip of what's called the 3, 4, 5 depending on what numbers you were betting on the crap table to come up before number seven came up, you could get 3x odds, 4x odds, or 5x odds depending -- there are pairs of numbers on a dice table. 4 and 10, they have 2:1 odds. 5 and 9 have a different set of odds, and 6:8 are 6:5. Well, depending on what number you were trying to get, you could get 3, 4 or 5x odds. That became a house advantage of 0.37, with 3 dealers and a box man and half of the floor man for every table. Craps is not a really profitable game at that level. So I changed the casino. In effect, I raised the price, and I went to double odds only except for extremely high play with a $1,000 minimum bet. I also rearranged the floor in the casino to put our specialty games that are very popular with the public that have a higher margin, and I put them in the 100% location, and I moved my less -- my games with less of a margin to secondary locations. Those changes have worked out favorably to us in the past 3 weeks, and that kind of reexamination. Our slot floors has been redone. We win more money with less games now. These are some of the reasons why we make more money than anybody else in Las Vegas. Now some of the operators will copy us. We're not allowed to talk to one another because of obvious legal implications of price fixing, but we don't really care what the other guys do. We run our own business the way we see we should, and we're not in business to offer games that don't make money. And I don't mind saying that publicly. So we've done quite a bit of work in tightening up the way the casino works, and I know our competitors are on the call, and they probably -- everybody knows it. The minute you make a change like that in Las Vegas, it goes around the town like a wildfire. But those are some of the things we're doing, and it touches every aspect. We're constantly reexamining everything we do here. We sit in my office and discuss the most fundamental aspects of this industry every single week, and we take nothing. We are not so much concerned of what has been or what is as we are concerned about what might be, and that's a principal truth of our company, whether it's in China or in Las Vegas or Boston or wherever."

We have a continuing dialogue with the government because their major interest is to protect the security of the jobs of the people in the city. To keep harmony, tranquility and even a very positive attitude among the citizens, whether it's in Hong Kong or Macau about the future. Our job as agents of change is to give input to the government, in advance if possible, of what the consequences of a given change in public policy might be. We do so with respect, and as I say, we approach them with gratitude for being able to be there in the first place. It's been a wonderful business experience comparable to none that I'm aware of. And so when we talk to the government, we do so constructively. And what we can do appropriately is to tell them what we think the consequences of a given situation will be. We don't pound the table, or make any demands. We strictly say, ""If you do that, this is likely to happen."" If you do that, then there'll be another result, and we'll do our best to accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative to quote one of Johnny Mercer's old lyrics. So that -- so I was glad to see that they allowed the smoking rooms. There was no reason not to. And Secretary Tam, who is very concerned about public health, finally felt as if it was okay to allow the smoking rooms to continue, and that's a good thing. The relaxation of the visas to allow people in China to travel freely is consistent with the reform mindedness of Xi Jinping's government, and I think consistent with the attitude of the local government as well."

I am not an expert on China, and I'm not even a Wall Street expert, but I am a person, who's been in a public company for 40 years. And my own experience, had I been consulted, I would have said don't do that exactly because if someone thinks that you're going to close the door and their ability to sell or trade their shares, you can only do that for a certain length of time, and then the minute you finish doing it, the people scamper for the door because there's a loss of trust. So interfering with the markets tend to produce -- is counterproductive. It tends to accentuate people's insecurity, which leads to selling. So I hope that they're relaxing that, they're backing out of that, and I hope they do it more affirmatively for the sake of the market. Now that's not really my concern because our stock can trade at level A or level B. We don't pay very much attention to our stock price per se. We pay attention to the underlying performance of the company, and those factors associated with performance are within our control, which is why every week, we grind on everything in this building from the use of every square foot of our real estate and our structures to our plans for the future.

Anytime that a construction project, a change in operating procedure, or an acquisition or a merger would result in a stronger company at the conclusion of such a transaction, we are very interested in it. We discuss it extensively and then follow through if it's appropriate. As we sit here today, we've never had such a opportunity presented to us that we thought was acceptable. That doesn't mean that at some point in the future such a thing couldn't happen, or that such an M&A, to use your term, a merger and acquisition would make sense. But big for the sake of big is not a thing that I subscribe to as you know, and I've said so before. We have a certain kind of a brand. It is flexible and adjustable for sure, but on the other hand, I'm more interested about tomorrow's newspaper than yesterday's newspaper, and we do a certain thing very well. We build and develop projects that usually room for room, inch for inch, pound for pound outperform the neighbors. The best place to see that at the present time is Las Vegas. As far as Cotai goes and Macau, when we open Wynn Palace, we're going to get a much more interesting comparison about the performance of the horses in the race. We're about to enter the starting gate in Cotai in a few months, and then we're going to have a real interesting -- we're going to have a real interesting turnaround to track. But as far as today, M&A is the kind of option that, of course, always exists, I mean, for a price, you can buy anything I suppose, and some people find it in their mutual best interest to join up from time to time because the net result is the 2 and 2 equals 5. But really it has to be 2 and 2 equals 5. If 2 and 2 equals 4, it seems to me a lot of trouble for nothing. I'd rather build our own stuff. Is that a helpful answer to you?"

As far as they want to spread out the openings they're actively, your suggestion, I guess, means would they do something to delay an opening in order to spread it out? Well, I've never been told that, that was their goal, nor as have I ever heard from a third party that they wanted to do that. You might -- you could surmise that by restricting the flow of construction workers that it had that effect, but there are similarly other explanations for the amount of construction workers that were parsed out in the past, having to do with traffic and congestion and local population being distressed if the streets are overcrowded and things like that. The government is very sensitive to the purpose, it is the mood of the public in Macau. They had those demonstrations in Hong Kong, and they didn't have any in Macau. And that of course, is favorably observed by the central government and is one of the major goals of the Chief Executive, Fernando Chui.

We've never been a racino or a riverboat operator. We've build resorts that are much more extravagant and attractive than they would be, were not for the fact that somewhere down the hall, there's a gaming room. But we're basically in the resort business that has casinos included, and what we're bringing to Boston is a destination resort. And we've -- as the publicity has shown that we've experienced a little bit of buffeting politically, and we're sort of plowing ahead anyway. We receive encouragement for a number -- for many quarters in that community, but we get resistance from others because the casinos seem to be such a prize for whatever local community could take advantage of its presence in that community, that Boston has been rather critical of us because we weren't in Boston. But we are in Everett, and in Everett, Massachusetts. We once tried to go to Boston, but the -- near the convention center when this all started, and the man in charge of convention said ""No, forget it, that property is not available."" It was right next door to the convention center. So Matt went down the street to another town, Everett, were glad to see us, but unfortunately, said you're going to have to cleanup a chemical dump site in order to do it on the Mystic River. Well, we thought it was worth the trouble. So we went to Everett, where 86% of the population was delighted to see us and voted to say so. And then finally, the citizens of Massachusetts in a plebiscite voted to support the legislation that invited a company like ours to Massachusetts. So the table seemed to be set for -- the welcome mat seemed to be out. We just haven't found the welcome bet yet, but I'm an eternal optimist, and I'm hoping it'll feel good when they stop hitting us. And I think that's my last comment today. Thanks, everybody.

They're sort of, I think, probably no surprise to anybody. Macau continues to be more of a question than a certainty as we head through 2015 and towards our opening on March 25 of Wynn Palace in 2016.",587,"Good afternoon, everybody. You've seen our numbers. They're sort of, I think, probably no surprise to anybody. 
Macau continues to be more of a question than a certainty as we head through 2015 and towards our opening on March 25 of Wynn Palace in 2016. Our construction, and our staffing is on schedule. We've made some adjustments in the staffing until we have a clearer picture of the game total that will be allocated to us by the government. But in the meantime, we're finishing this building. 
I would mention that, as I have in the past, that the design of this building and its creation over 5 years ago was done in anticipation of market conditions perhaps not as critical as they are today, but under the general assumption that the robust and unprecedented growth in the market would not be the kind of growth we'd be experiencing in 2016, and that we would face competition for which we had great respect. 
Our fellow operators in Macau are intelligent. They're extremely well financed, and they're quick to learn and to accommodate the things that they see in other hotels and to accommodate changes necessitated by their own experience in that market. It's a very, very sharp place. The buildings that are built represent remarkable diversifications into nongaming attractions. And of course, that adds to the competitive nature of our situation. 
We designed the hotel, as I say, in anticipation of just such an environment, perhaps not quite as critical as the one we are facing, but we said we had to be clearly, clearly a superior choice competitively. We enjoy a segment of the market that we wanted to continue to enjoy: the upper premium, the VIP business and the top end of the mass marketing. We enjoy that advantage today, and we intended to increase that advantage by the opening of Wynn Palace. 
Such were the assumptions of its creation, and I'm happy to say that, that was the results of the construction and the development. Our staff, headed by Mr. Gamal Aziz and Ian Coughlan and Linda Chen in China, are doing an excellent job in preparing the place to make a good opening and make a good impression on our guests, so that hopefully, the Wynn Palace will be everybody's first choice when they go to Cotai. 
In Las Vegas, we're enjoying a comfortable business, I think, is the right word for it. It's not an aggressive growth by any means, but we are enjoying noncasino revenue that is acceptable. 
Our game -- our slot machine and table games are growing with one exception, which should come as no surprise to professionals on this call, and that is that since we were the operator of choice for the international baccarat business, namely, from China that if anything interfered with that business, we would, of course, experience more of a penalty in that regard than our competitors since we had more of those kinds of people attending our hotel. When that group is diminished, we, of course, feel it critically. 
So our baccarat table business has suffered, mainly because of the absence of a number of Asian players. But business from Latin America is still good, and perhaps that explains why we had clearly, the most powerful performance in this quarter of any operator in America. 
And with that, I think I've sort of summarized whatever I can add to the conversation today, and I'll be glad to take questions along with my colleagues."

I think the right number is closer to 22 because of the dominance of baccarat. But you can -- if you look at this historically, and you -- in calculating hold percentage because we have so many buy-ins at the cage, which is completely atypical from the American experience, usually we know exactly what the drop or the handle is in a casino in Las Vegas for those of you who may not be quite familiar with this term. We count -- when someone gambles at a table, at any table in the world, they have to buy chips. They come to the table. They give the money to the dealer. The dealer drops the money in the box and slides the chips out of the rack to the customer, and that's the buy-in. The other way that people get chips is with credit, and when they take a marker, if they're approved by the supervisor in charge or the team leader then the chips are slid across the table out of the rack just as if they had paid cash, and a credit slip associated with the marker goes into the box in lieu of cash. Now there are other pieces of paper in the box that represent changes to the inventory in the rack, during the 8-hour shift, fills if there's a need for more chips when the customers are winning, or credit slips if the customers are losing, and the rack gets overcrowded with the chips that are taken back. We return them to the cage. They don't have anything to do with handle. What we measure is the cash and the credit slips associated with markers. That tells us the total amount of activity. We measure that against the changes in the opening and closing inventories of the shift, and that tells us the performance of the table, or the win. In China, and virtually no one buys chips at the cage in America, at least in our experience over the last 40-odd-years and then walks to a table and gambles. In China, they do, in fact, do exactly that. I don't know whether it's because they're using their credit card, or they're cashing in whatever RMBs they have or whatever, but people go to the cage, buy chips and then circulate around the casino and bring the gaming tokens to the table with them. That means that when we count the boxes, it's not a measurement truly of the drop or activity in the casino, the handle, it's referred to in the alternative. So we started now taking the buy-ins of the cage at the cashier and the money and credit slips in the box. Although in a mass casino, we don't give credit at the table, but we take the cash and the buy-ins at the cage, and we try as close as we can to then recreate a comparable number that all of you would understand as handle or drop, or the level of activity at the tables. I hope I'm being clear enough in this explanation. And based upon this, we've gone back and tried to give a comparison of the real hold compared to the theoretical hold of the mass table game activity in China. And my experience because of the dominance of baccarat, that, that number should be between 22 and 23. Matt thinks it should be 20 million, but at any rate, it's arbitrary. You can make an adjustment anyway you'd like. If you look at us historically, it's what I said 22, 23. Matt is -- the whole financial structure of this company is extremely conservative as you know. So Matt decided to say well, it's 20, and I think that's on the low side, but call it what you may. Go ahead, Matt. Anything else? I hope that was clarified. How it works. Many people don't really understand casino accounting or what handle is, and I thought it might be a good idea to slide it in."

On the mass casino side, we've taken advantage as described previously of the additional room inventory. Currently, 51% of our room inventory is going to the mass table games and mass slot area, and that's worked out very successfully. We clearly see difficulty at the very high level of mass as those players are impacted in the same way, that the junket and direct players are impacted from a liquidity perspective.

The towns got a lot more competitive, particularly in Cotai, with the addition of more Galaxy room inventory and more to come with Studio City, but we continue to drive high occupancy with a good raise. Food and beverages impacted in fine dining, particularly because of the lack of junket complementaries, and that's been the pattern since late last year. So where we can, we're driving revenues, and there has been some stability looking at junket turnover. That's been pretty stable over the last 6 months, and we've seen the retail revenue stabilize over the last 2 or 3 months. The decline has softened considerably."

We have these -- we get the benefit of these tremendous big players. But when you have one of these giant months where you win all the money, the next year, it always looks a little funny. In the end, it all evens out, but we see these volatility fluctuations. But our base business tends to be pretty steady. And Shaun, I guess, that's the best way to explain it. We had more Chinese play last year than we did this year, and I mean, a place like our own, we can make $60 million in a month in this hotel or $70 million. We can also make $25 million. And as I say, it evens out at the end. But when you look at it, short term as we do every 6 or 8 hours a day, I do at least. I'm in the casino every day, and on the phone with my people. We've readjusted our floor on the 4th of July and interesting enough, many of the games in Las Vegas have become marginally profitable. Years ago, down at Binions, they started, at the crap table, of giving 10x odds. If you bet $100 on the line, you could bet $1,000 on the free odds behind the line, if you bet the past line. I'm getting a little technical, but in the old days in dice, whatever you bet on the line, you could bet the same amount behind the line, and that was a whole percentage of a little under 1%. Then they started giving double odds to -- compared to the amount of money you bet on the pass line, and that lowered the house percentage to 0.57. Then that became a pattern on The Strip of what's called the 3, 4, 5 depending on what numbers you were betting on the crap table to come up before number 7 came up, you could get 3x odds, 4x odds, or 5x odds depending -- there are pairs of numbers on a dice table. 4 and 10, they have 2:1 odds. 5 and 9 have a different set of odds, and 6:8 are 6:5. Well, depending on what number you were trying to get, you could get 3, 4 or 5x odds. That became a house advantage of 0.37, with 3 dealers and a box man and half of the floor man for every table. Craps is not a really profitable game at that level. So I changed the casino. In effect, I raised the price, and I went to double odds only except for extremely high play with a $1,000 minimum bet. I also rearranged the floor in the casino to put our specialty games that are very popular with the public that have a higher margin, and I put them in the 100% location, and I moved my less -- my games with less of a margin to secondary locations. Those changes have worked out favorably to us in the past 3 weeks, and that kind of reexamination. Our slot floor has been redone. We win more money with less games now. These are some of the reasons why we make more money than anybody else in Las Vegas. Now some of the operators will copy us. We're not allowed to talk to one another because of obvious legal implications of price fixing, but we don't really care what the other guys do. We run our own business the way we see we should, and we're not in business to offer games that don't make money. And I don't mind saying that publicly. So we've done quite a bit of work in tightening up the way the casino works, and I know our competitors are on the call, and they probably -- everybody knows it. The minute you make a change like that in Las Vegas, it goes around the town like a wildfire. But those are some of the things we're doing, and it touches every aspect. We're constantly reexamining everything we do here. We sit in my office and discuss the most fundamental aspects of this industry every single week, and we take nothing. We are not so much concerned of what has been or what is as we are concerned about what might be, and that's a principal truth of our company, whether it's in China or in Las Vegas or Boston or wherever."

We have a continuing dialogue with the government because their major interest is to protect the security of the jobs of the people in the city. To keep harmony, tranquility and even a very positive attitude among the citizens, whether it's in Hong Kong or Macau about the future. Our job as agents of change is to give input to the government, in advance if possible, of what the consequences of a given change in public policy might be. We do so with respect, and as I say, we approach them with gratitude for being able to be there in the first place. It's been a wonderful business experience comparable to none that I'm aware of. And so when we talk to the government, we do so constructively. And what we can do appropriately is to tell them what we think the consequences of a given situation will be. We don't pound the table, or make any demands. We strictly say, ""If you do that, this is likely to happen."" If you do that, then there'll be another result, and we'll do our best to accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative to quote one of Johnny Mercer's old lyrics. So that -- so I was glad to see that they allowed the smoking rooms. There was no reason not to. And Secretary Tam, who is very concerned about public health, finally felt as if it was okay to allow the smoking rooms to continue, and that's a good thing. The relaxation of the visas to allow people in China to travel freely is consistent with the reform mindedness of Xi Jinping's government, and I think consistent with the attitude of the local government as well."

I am not an expert on China, and I'm not even a Wall Street expert, but I am a person, who's been in a public company for 40 years. And my own experience, had I been consulted, I would have said don't do that exactly because if someone thinks that you're going to close the door on their ability to sell or trade their shares, you can only do that for a certain length of time, and then the minute you finish doing it, the people scamper for the door because there's a loss of trust. So interfering with the markets tend to produce -- is counterproductive. It tends to accentuate people's insecurity, which leads to selling. So I hope that they're relaxing that, they're backing out of that, and I hope they do it more affirmatively for the sake of the market. Now that's not really my concern because our stock can trade at level A or level B. We don't pay very much attention to our stock price per se. We pay attention to the underlying performance of the company, and those factors associated with performance are within our control, which is why every week, we grind on everything in this building from the use of every square foot of our real estate and our structures to our plans for the future.

Anytime that a construction project, a change in operating procedure, or an acquisition or a merger would result in a stronger company at the conclusion of such a transaction, we are very interested in it.

It is flexible and adjustable for sure, but on the other hand, I'm more interested about tomorrow's newspaper than yesterday's newspaper, and we do a certain thing very well. We build and develop projects that usually room for room, inch for inch, pound for pound outperform the neighbors. The best place to see that at the present time is Las Vegas.

We're about to enter the starting gate in Cotai in a few months, and then we're going to have a real interesting -- we're going to have a real interesting turnaround the track. But as far as today, M&A is the kind of option that, of course, always exists, I mean, for a price, you can buy anything I suppose, and some people find it in their mutual best interest to join up from time to time because the net result is the 2 and 2 equals 5. But really it has to be 2 and 2 equals 5. If 2 and 2 equals 4, it seems to me a lot of trouble for nothing. I'd rather build our own stuff. Is that a helpful answer to you?"

You might -- you could surmise that by restricting the flow of construction workers that it had that effect, but there are similarly other explanations for the amount of construction workers that were parsed out in the past, having to do with traffic and congestion and local population being distressed if the streets are overcrowded and things like that.

And that of course, is favorably observed by the central government and is one of the major goals of the Chief Executive, Fernando Chui. He wants harmony in the city, and I think that most of the decisions he's made have been to create that environment. I don't think they've ever tried to stop somebody from opening, and I'd be surprised, Robin, if that philosophy was ever articulated, but it certainly hasn't been to us."

We've never been a racino or a riverboat operator. We've build resorts that are much more extravagant and attractive than they would be, were it not for the fact that somewhere down the hall, there's a gaming room. But we're basically in the resort business that has casinos included, and what we're bringing to Boston is a destination resort. And we've -- as the publicity has shown that we've experienced a little bit of buffeting politically, and we're sort of plowing ahead anyway. We receive encouragement for a number -- for many quarters in that community, but we get resistance from others because the casinos seem to be such a prize for whatever local community to take advantage of its presence in that community, that Boston has been rather critical of us because we weren't in Boston. But we are in Everett, and in Everett, Massachusetts. We once tried to go to Boston, but the -- near the convention center when this all started, and the man in charge of convention said ""No, forget it, that property is not available."" It was right next door to the convention center. So Matt went down the street to another town, Everett, were glad to see us, but unfortunately, said you're going to have to cleanup a chemical dump site in order to do it on the Mystic River. Well, we thought it was worth the trouble. So we went to Everett, where 86% of the population was delighted to see us and voted to say so. And then finally, the citizens of Massachusetts in a plebiscite voted to support the legislation that invited a company like ours to Massachusetts. So the table seemed to be set for -- the welcome mat seemed to be out. We just haven't found the welcome mat yet, but I'm an eternal optimist, and I'm hoping it'll feel good when they stop hitting us. And I think that's my last comment today. Thanks, everybody.

General comment covering both Las Vegas and Macau is this: We don't see any major change or new development in Macau concerning our existing operations other than all of the comments we've made in the past about the confusion, the ambiguity about what we face in terms of tables in the upcoming months as we were at about 170 days before the opening of The Palace, which is the most significant event in the company's near future. And based upon what's happened to Galaxy and what we expect to happen at the Studio City, which is just today found out how many tables are going to have in the last 2 days to a few weeks before they're open, the confusion and the rather mystical policies that are governing the assignment of equipment in these new hotels which are tremendous diversifications away from pure gaming into all other forms of non-gaming, that the confusion about the tables and the government's position in this regard has made it very difficult to plan for employees and other aspects of the facility. I mention this early in the conversation because it's become a major issue in Macau as to the impact of government policy on planning for employment, promotions, hiring and compensation. None of us are really clear on what our environment is going to be like going forward, and it makes planning and adjusting almost a mystical process. And this is the, I think, probably the major topic of conversation in the executive conference rooms as people try and resolve their planning on Human Resources in the Macau market. Our construction of our hotel in the Macau is on schedule. We're scheduled for March 25th opening. And the results of the last quarter were consistent with the things we've seen in previous quarters, and that is almost approximately half the business of the IP is gone and may be shrinking. It's caused us to review our credit policies and our attitudes towards our junket operators, and some of them have gone out of business. And I think others will indeed go out of business, which means you have to focus very intensely on the policies that you employ with regard to the credit that the junket people enjoy in terms of the chips that are advanced to them. 
Our mass business is sort of flat, and I think that's a general description of it. And that explains the earnings in Macau. Now in Las Vegas, we are in this market the principal beneficiary of international business, and we have been since we opened in 2005. So if a segment of the international market is impacted for extraneous reasons or external reasons like the change in government policy or whatever in China, then we would be the principal victims or we would suffer the most, and that's exactly what happened. Any change in our earnings in Las Vegas is strictly a reflection of a drop in Asian Pac for our business. The rest of the segments in our Las Vegas business are pretty good. Rome revenue and [indiscernible] is healthy, our convention business is healthy, our food and beverage business is healthy, and we're very satisfied with Las Vegas. And if anything, the problems of China are causing us to refocus our energies here in America even more intensely. We're happy that we're moving forward in Massachusetts in spite of the friction created by the mayor and the administration in Boston, which, for some reason, is unwilling to accept the decision, the Casino Control Condition gracefully and keeps trying to use various tactics to say that we are in Boston, not in Everitt. It may sound laughable at this point, and in a perverse way, it is a comedy. But it did cause us delays. But happily they're pretty much behind us now and underway with remediation and we're looking forward to groundbreaking in a few months. And the Massachusetts project, which we think is a very exciting thing, will be on its way and, hopefully, open in 2018. 
I'll leave the rest of any general remarks before we take any questions to Matt or Ian, or Gamal or Steve or Maurice, anybody on the call who would like to expand or alter what I've just said. And there are people on this call that have a tighter feeling -- I've been very much involved with design in the last several months. So if any of the operating executives want to close in on this, please feel free to do so.

We made a whole bunch of changes in the casino both physically and procedurally. We've even fooled with the rules of the game. It's been 15 years since Las Vegas increased the price of gaming. We're way overdue considering the cost of running games and payroll. We have adjusted our yield rate management approach, Maurice Wooden is here and he's very good at that in the whole American operation. We made a host of adjustments. We were off in 1 month by from $100 million at baccarat to 45, we're of $55 million baccarat but we made almost the same amount of money because of the adjustments we made. And they go across the board throughout the hotel and the way we price the hotel restaurants, entertainment and gaming. We don't sit by and allow ourselves become victims of anything, of any aspect of our operation over which we have any control. So in my long-term view of our operations in America and in China is still positive, it's the short-term that's bewildering. And it's bewildering enough to complain about it, but as far as adjusting here and in China, it's a constant process. I was in China last week and I kept my people up until 2 in the morning on the subject of VIP. And then we reconvened in 8:00 a.m. again and went for another 6 hours ago I think altogether got 15 hours. The most intense kind of consultation with every smart person we had that dealt with these subjects. So adjusting is what we do.

I mean, these facilities are enormously diversified, non-gaming buildings but they depend on their survival, their payroll, their operational viability depends on the gaming equipment that was always part of the whole construct. Here in America, we would never have a Las Vegas of the diversity we've had if the city have told us how many tables we could spread. The table cap is the single most counterintuitive and irrational decision that was ever made. Here we are spending billions of dollars creating non-gaming facilities and then arbitrarily someone says, well, you should only have this many tables. No jurisdiction ever has imposed such that kind of logic on us. And what it's done, it's turned our human resource planning inside out and upside down. And you could tell by the tone of my voice that the extended by frustration by this point. My frustration on behalf of our colleagues at Melco, who made commitments for 400 tables. Why on earth they have to deal with half as many is beyond my -- anything that I can understand in the 45 years of experience I've had. It isn't good for Macau, it's not good for the citizens of Macau, it's not good for the tens of thousands of employees in Macau. We're looking forward to promotions and raises and all kinds of benefits that accrue because of the viability of these resorts. We build tens of thousands of rooms and restaurants and attractions, but we say you're not allowed to gamble because you can't have the tables. But that's one of the reasons they come to Macau. If you wanted to undermine and scuttle the viability of that industry, you put in table caps and you could tell, I'm a tremendous critic of that decision because I don't understand it in terms of anything in my 45 years of experience that explains it. And to see the predicament that the Melco people find themselves in because they made covenant agreements is dazzling to me. And I've complained to the government about this and tried to understand what the rationale was for this thinking. And I've never gotten a reasonable answer. And hopefully, hopefully, the desire that you mentioned, statements by the central government or by the local government to support this industry, and mainly support the people that work in that industry that are the whole interior, all of the young people and the families of Macau that have become part of the hospitality industry, a huge amount of them are people that are related directly or indirectly to the casinos. And what we're getting now is unemployment. That mean the junket operators at the beginning of it because they employed all kinds of people from Macau. But forget the junket operators, what about the rank-and-file dealers in the mass casino? They cater to the tourists. What happens to their jobs? What happens to their promotions? I don't know whether the local government's been intimidated by the unions or something, but the unions are going to end up acting up about this subject before it's over. And we as operators are going to have to stand there on the sidelines bewildered at the position that the industry finds itself in. In my 45 years of experience, I've never seen anything like this before and hopefully, hopefully, the leadership of the community will intervene and correct this aberration that threatens the employment security of the citizens of Macau. And thereby also relieving the predicaments that people like the Loi family the Galaxy experience with the billions of dollars they spent and Lawrence Ho and Jamie Packer's company, Melco. But these are problems that when you say that there's been the government has made general statements about supporting us or supporting the people of Macau, I think it's time for them to put their actions where the rhetoric is. But the rhetoric won't solve the problem."

We cannot train people and maintain service levels in the non-casino and casino areas when we don't have the time to train our people. So the notion of finding out how many tables you're going to get 3 weeks before you open is outrageous and ridiculous. Ridiculous is the word for it. We never operated a business this way. We train people, that's how we give them a future, by training them. That contributes to their promotions, their pride and to the guest experience. And at the end of the day, guest experience is the only controlling factor in the survival of the hospitality industry. Go ahead, Ian.

Steve as you think about some of the government's conversation and some of maybe the comments that had been made about the diversifying of the economy of Macau, in your opinion, longer-term, you get a sense of that Macau has the potential to really transform itself away from being a predominantly gaming market much in the way that Las Vegas did over a number of years?"

Absolutely Las Vegas and -- Macau, rather, has transformed itself, not shall or can or will and has been transformed by the projects that have been built in direct response to the leadership and the suggestions made by the local government. Everything from promotions and to the creation of facilities, exactly that has already taken place. But understand that the reason that these extraordinary non-gaming attractions exist is because the damn casino is the cash register. That's what drives Las Vegas. 40 odd percent -- my hotels, the ones that you guys know that we built with this organization in the past, none of them have ever had even half of the revenue of gaming. Over half was nongaming, but none of them could have been built or would exist today if anybody had given us a table cap because the people that stay in the rooms want to go downstairs and play sometimes. Besides eating and entertaining and shopping and going to the spa, they want to play or they wouldn't come to Macau. So we support these extravagant, nongaming diversifications with the casino. That's the truth of it. That's the irrevocable, undeniable, inexorable truth of it. The gaming allows the nongaming to flourish, and that's the lesson we're trying to get to penetrate the leadership of Macau, that the very thing they want requires that they let us run our business based upon our experience, our long experience everywhere else. And that's where the heart of the frustration is, that somehow we haven't been able to get that truth really accepted. And I'm hopeful that before we have demonstrations or real angst or -- I had an employee  approach me when I was in Macau and say, Mr. Wynn, is the government angry at the union and trying to cut back on gaming employees? I said, well, I don't have any reason to think that, but that's the kind of stuff that's going around in the staff dining room. This confusion is not isolated to management. It's now spread to the employees. Very unhealthy situation both socially and politically. And when I'm asked questions like that, I don't have a clear answer and I want to get away from this kind of thing before it gets out of hand. Now Ian, you can ask the rest of it, the mass gaming. I'm not in a position to answer that question. Mass Table Revenue is flat as against a year ago."

You need 400 or 500 tables to do it effectively and to support the workforce, otherwise the workforce gets cut back and you have layoffs. And all these things that have never happened in my career in 45 years, I've never had a layoff. I think, we once dropped 100 people in this company. 45 years. We don't do layoffs.

It had to do with one of their people in their financing syndicate. The way these guys operate is that they get people to invest almost like a mutual fund or a hedge fund and then they give these people are return each month on the financial support that they get from these groups of lenders. And apparently, one of the employees who was interfacing with the lenders absconded with their money. It had nothing to do with us. And we went to 100% cash with DoRay they all had the liquidity they needed right in the cage and when we found out about it, we terminated any extension for us much as RMB 1 or HKD 1 to DoRay and they were able to cover it because they had the liquidity that allowed them to do it. Whether someone else is going to be another [indiscernible] or embezzlement is hard to predict. Criminals tend to be surreptitious until it comes to light. But I think all the junket operators took that as a signal to tighten up on their internal controls from what I'm told. So I don't suspect that, that will happen in the manner that it happened in Doray again. But the overall liability of the junkets themselves depends upon the liquidity and the wealth and the retained earnings that they've kept. We don't see their numbers, and so we're very conservative in how we deal with them. We don't know their retained earnings. Some of them have gone public, but the information that you study under those circumstances is, at best, described by the word murky. So we're left to manage our end of this transaction, which is too shorten the string and the length of time that we give these people how many non-redeemable chips we give them. And the amount of outstanding unredeemed chips has dropped dramatically almost by half, which reflects the level of business almost identically. Does that -- that's as deep an answer I can give you. Is it satisfactory?"

We went and did it for $10 billion or more, and if you count all of us, the largest being us at $4 billion. How in the hell can you run those places without employees? I mean, what are we supposed to do? Shut down a floor? Close a restaurant? Curtail the very thing that they told us that they wanted to see happen without employees? It so ludicrous that it defies rational conversation. Some of these places are going to close locally creating unemployment. We can absorb them, I think, in the industry, but still, the extent of the new operations are so comprehensive that in order to operate them appropriately, you still need more people to work. And the spectacle of these buildings being unattended is beyond imagination and will have dire consequences in the community on a couple of levels. The first level will be that it will negatively impact the job security of the local Macau citizens and undoubtedly result in rather severe complaining. What form that will take, I'm not sure. The second thing is that the hospitality profile of the city will be severely compromised, and that will take years to recover. Years. You only get one chance to make a good impression. And, if you bogey that impression, if you blow it, it's a long time to fix it and maybe never. What is important is that the Macau market as is viewed by the world, never loses its viability. Because the day that it loses its viability, it loses its long-term longevity and the entire thing gets really damaged severely. And that will impact the community of Macau in a very negative way. And that's one of the things that concerns me a lot because employee attitudes, everybody in the world, including all of us on this call today, it has been established that our present state of mind, our happiness, our sense of security, is fundamentally a function of how we view tomorrow or the future. You tell someone that's feeling poorly, suffering from an ailment or some discomfort that they're going to be better in 3 days and they feel better today. You tell someone who is feeling great today that they're going to be awfully sick next week and they get depressed today. So the attitude of the employees, their sense of security, safety, their notion of a positive future for themselves and their families is a critical management responsibility. Now to a certain extent, we control that within the walls of our buildings. But every once in a while, depending on public policy, we lose control of that because of factors that are outside of our control. And my feeling is that Macau, at the moment, is on the edge of that moment which should be avoided at all cost."

And he thought that was very malignant for the health of his party and the future of his country and made a decision to correct that and have a campaign against corruption. And considering the amount of people, if you believe the newspapers, that have been charged with misconduct of 1 degree or another, President Ji did the right thing for the right reasons. And because of the way China and mainland China works, every businessman in that country dealt in one way or another with the government official because the government controlled so many aspects of public policy and business interface. So businessmen who had nothing to hide, as well as those who might have had something to hide all went into  the foxholes or into a defensive posture because they didn't know if the next show was going to drop or what the next thing was going to happen. And it has caused, across the board, a contraction of all VIP consumer spending at the higher level, which includes Macau. And that explains the problem that the junket operators are having, plus the restriction on the credit cards and things like that. So in one respect, the junket operators faced a problem that was part of an intelligent central government policy. No argument about that, corruption's a bad thing, and President Ji did the right thing just as I would in my company if I thought there was corruption. To that extent for, Fernardo Choi, the head of the government of Macau, or President Xi Jinping or President of a public company or a private company, for that matter, it is bad business to have corruption, and it should be stopped because it's unhealthy and goes to the root of the viability of any organization or institution. So there's something that in our meetings we acknowledged and we accept as inconvenient perhaps in terms of junket operators, but not necessarily a bad thing. So we adjust to it. And that was the way we dealt with that in our conversations. Alternatively, the reason those conversations of 15 to 16 hours is we're square juggling the reassessment of our facilities and adjustments to our facilities to cater to the new reality that we face, which incidentally is much more like Las Vegas than what Macau was in the past, and that's fine with me. I have no argument with it. But in the process of adjusting, how do we run our facility under the new reality? And we can do that but we need tables in the casino to support the restaurants and the conventional meeting space and the entertainment. Of the $4 billion, the casino represents perhaps $400 million of it. The other's $3.6 billion went into other things that weren't part of the old way of looking at things. So on one hand, we understand went on with the campaign against corruption and we have no issue with that or the thinking that went into it. What we have an issue with is the leadership that we need to have in the government to help us make the transition to the new reality."

My job is to create a stable environment in terms of human resources, job security and a better future for people. Isn't that after all what governments are doing or hopefully doing? As I say at the eleventh hour, the government does the right thing and supports the health of its citizens as businessmen will support the health of their employees, because the ultimate truth is if the only thing that matters is the happiness of the people, whether they're employees or citizens of a community, and they're the ones that touch the public because only people make people happy. Only people make happy communities. Only people make successful companies. And the job of leaders are to do everything and anything in their power to create a happy and positive outlook to the future for their constituencies. And I strongly believe that when the dusts settles, leaders of companies and governments do the right thing. And that's the basis for my long-term confidence in the market and my long-term confidence in the leadership of the government. We all come to the same conclusion when we've had enough time to see. Hopefully, we come to the right conclusion before we avoid catastrophic, unpleasant or disruptive alternatives. We anticipate certain results and don't let them occur. So whether you're a CEO of a company or you're the head of a government, you have to have a little bit of ability to look around the corner and see what's coming ahead of you. And if that's not good, turn away from it. Amend your policies, learn from experience and come to a more sound conclusion.

It has been competitive already for quite some time. Look at Las Vegas with dozens of hotels, the thousands of tables, the tens of thousands, 150,000 rooms, millions upon millions feet of convention and meeting space, theaters, cabarets, public entertainment, volcanoes that erupt, fountains that dance, pirate ships that sink, trees that come out of the floor, gondolas that go across dancing fountains for $100 million. All of this is a fight for the audience that's here. Discounts given at the tables, complementaries. It's so intensely competitive in Macau and has been for some long time, for a long time that it will continue in the same fashion that it is enjoying now. There would still be a stratification of the public. People who can afford choice and who demand higher levels of service, better food, larger, more sumptuous rooms, better meeting facilities, more fascinating entertainment attractions, they will migrate to places that provide that. Other places the deal with the economy at the end of the market such as Circus Circus or in Las Vegas or in other places in Macau, they have their own level of competition. But you know there's Kmart and there's Louis Vuitton. There's Macy's and there's Neiman Marcus. They compete. Neiman Marcus competes with other companies of a similar nature. We do as well. Louis Vuitton competes with Chanel and Christian Dior and Prada, and we're at that level. We're the five-star operator. We offer choices for people that want the best. And when we do that, we, to a certain extent, give up another part of the market to other people. So it's good that a place like Macau or Las Vegas has choice for people. What's wonderful about Macau and Las Vegas is that if you come to that city, you can go from Wynn to Circus. You can go to a lower end casino to Wynn in Macau and you can dial up whatever it is that suits you at the moment. And that's the secret to making a great destination city. It's choice. The bigger the menu, the more
powerful the destination resort. But I assure you that at every level, there is competition. Am I being helpful of you?"

General comment covering both Las Vegas and Macau is this: We don't see any major change or new development in Macau concerning our existing operations other than all of the comments we've made in the past about t",777,"I think the numbers speak for themselves. General comment covering both Las Vegas and Macau is this: We don't see any major change or new development in Macau concerning our existing operations other than all of the comments we've made in the past about the confusion, the ambiguity about what we face in terms of tables in the upcoming months as we were at about 170 days before the opening of the Palace, which is the most significant event in the company's near future. And based upon what's happened to Galaxy and what we expect to happen at the Studio City, which has just today found out how many tables are going to have in the last 2 days to a few weeks before they're open. The confusion and the rather mystical policies that are governing the assignment of equipment in these new hotels, which are tremendous diversifications away from pure gaming into all other forms of non-gaming, that the confusion about the tables and the government's position in this regard has made it very difficult to plan for employees and other aspects of the facility. 
I mentioned this early in the conversation because it's become a major issue in Macau as to the impact of government policy on planning for employment, promotions, hiring and compensation. None of us are really clear on what our environment is going to be like going forward, and it makes planning and adjusting almost a mystical process. And this is the, I think, probably the major topic of conversation in the executive conference rooms as people try and resolve their planning on human resources in the Macau market. 
Our construction of our hotel in Macau is on schedule. We're scheduled for March 25th opening. And the results of the last quarter were consistent with the things we've seen in previous quarters, and that is almost approximately half the business of VIP is gone and may be shrinking. It's caused us to review our credit policies and our attitudes towards junket operators, and some of them have gone out of business. And I think others will, indeed, go out of business, which means you have to focus very intensely on the policies that you employ with regard to the credit that the junket people enjoy in terms of the chips that are advanced to them. 
Our mass business is sort of flat, and I think that's a general description of it. And that explains the earnings in Macau. Now in Las Vegas, we are in this market the principal beneficiary of international business, and we have been since we opened in 2005. So if a segment of the international market is impacted for extraneous reasons or external reasons like the change in government policy or whatever in China, then we would be the principal victims or we would suffer the most, and that's exactly what happened. Any change in our earnings in Las Vegas is strictly a reflection of a drop in Asian baccarat business. 
The rest of the segments in our Las Vegas business are pretty good. Room revenue and stuff like that is healthy. Our convention business is healthy. Our food and beverage business is healthy, and we're very satisfied with Las Vegas. And if anything, the problems of China are causing us to refocus our energies here in America even more intensely. We're happy that we're moving forward in Massachusetts in spite of the friction created by the mayor and the administration in Boston, which, for some reason, is unwilling to accept the decision of the Casino Control Commission gracefully and keeps trying to use various tactics to say that we are in Boston, not in Everett. It may sound laughable at this point, and in a perverse way, it is a comedy. But it did cause us delays. But happily, they're pretty much behind us now. And we're under way with remediation, and we're looking forward to groundbreaking in a few months. And the Massachusetts project, which we think is a very exciting thing, will be on its way and, hopefully, open in 2018. 
I'll leave the rest of any general remarks before we take questions to Matt or Ian or Gamal or Steve or Maurice or anybody on the call who would like to expand or alter what I've just said. And there are people on this call that have a tighter feeling -- I've been very much involved with design in the last several months. So if any of the operating executives want to close in on this, please feel free to do so.

And we run the business in uptimes and downtimes, and we adjust to the situations. We made a whole bunch of changes in the casino both physically and procedurally. We've even fooled with the rules of the game. It's been 50 years since Las Vegas increased the price of gaming. We're way overdue, considering the cost of running games and payroll. We have adjusted our yield rate management approach. Maurice Wooden is here, and he's very good at that in the whole American operation. We've made a host of adjustments. We were off in 1 month by -- from $100 million at baccarat to $45 million. We're off $55 million at baccarat, but we've made almost the same amount of money because of all the adjustments we made. And they go across the board throughout the hotel in the way we price the hotel restaurants and entertainment and gaming. We don't sit by and allow ourselves become victims of anything, of any aspect of our operation over which we have any control. So in my long-term view of our operations in America and in China is still positive. It's the short term that's bewildering. And it's bewildering enough to complain about it, but as far as adjusting here and in China, it's a constant process. I was in China last week, and I kept my people up until 2 in the morning on the subject of VIP. And then we reconvened at 8:00 a.m. again and went for another 6 hours. I think, all together, we spent 15 hours, the most intense kind of consultation with every smart person we had that dealt with these subjects. So adjusting is what we do.

I mean, these facilities are enormously diversified non-gaming buildings, but they depend on their survival. Their payroll, their operational viability depends on the gaming equipment that was always part of the whole construct. Here in America, we would never have a Las Vegas of the diversity we've had if the city have told us how many tables we could spread. The table cap is the single most counterintuitive and irrational decision that was ever made. Here we are spending billions of dollars creating non-gaming facilities, and then arbitrarily someone says, ""Well, you should only have this many tables."" No jurisdiction ever has imposed such -- that kind of logic on us. And what it's done, it's turned our human resource planning inside out and upside down. And you could tell by the tone of my voice the -- extended my frustration on this point, my frustration on behalf of our colleagues at Melco, who made commitments for 400 tables. Why on earth they have to deal with half as many is beyond my -- anything that I can understand in the 45 years of experience I've had. It isn't good for Macau. It's not good for the citizens of Macau. It's not good for the tens of thousands of employees of Macau who are looking forward to promotions and raises and all kinds of benefits that accrue because of the viability of these resorts. We build tens of thousands of rooms and restaurants and attractions, but we say you're not allowed to gamble because you can't have the tables. But that's one of the reasons they come to Macau. If you wanted to undermine and scuttle the viability of that industry, you put in table caps, and you could tell I'm a tremendous critic of that decision because I don't understand it in terms of anything in my 45 years of experience that explains it. And to see the predicament that the Melco people find themselves in because they made covenant agreements is dazzling to me. And I've complained to the government about this and tried to understand what the rationale was for this thinking, and I've never gotten a reasonable answer. And hopefully, hopefully, the desire that you mentioned, statements by the central government or by the local government to support this industry and mainly support the people that work in that industry that are the whole interior, the -- all of the young people and the families of Macau that have become part of the hospitality industry, a huge amount of them are people that are related directly or indirectly to the casinos. And what we're getting now is unemployment and, I mean, the junket operators at the beginning of it because they employed all kinds of people from Macau. But forgetting the junket operators, what about the rank-and-file dealers in the mass casino? They cater to the tourists. What happens to their jobs? What happens to their promotions? I don't know whether the local government's been intimidated by the unions because -- or something, but the unions are going to end up acting up about this subject before it's over. And we, as operators, are going to have to stand there on the sidelines bewildered at the position that the industry finds itself in. In my 45 years of experience, I've never seen anything like this before. And hopefully, hopefully, the leadership of the community will intervene and correct this aberration that threatens the employment security of the citizens of Macau and thereby also relieving the predicaments that people like the Lui family of Galaxy experienced with the billions of dollars they spent and Lawrence Ho and Jamie Packer's company, Melco. But these are problems that when you say that there's been the government has made general statements about supporting us or supporting the people of Macau, I think it's time for them to put their actions where the rhetoric is. But the rhetoric won't solve the problem."

I mentioned earlier that the people at Studio City found out a few weeks before opening what the story is about their tables. Now Macau is proud of the 5-star status, the legitimate 5-star status of Wynn Macau. It was hard to train people to get to that level of service, but it's been a source of pride for the community and for the employees themselves. We cannot train people and maintain service levels in the non-casino and casino areas when we don't have the time to train our people. So the notion of finding out how many tables you're going to get 3 weeks before your opening is outrageous and ridiculous. Ridiculous is the word for it. We've never operated a business this way. We train people. That's how we give them a future, by training them. That contributes to their promotions, their pride and to the guest experience. And at the end of the day, guest experience is the only controlling factor in the survival of the hospitality industry. Go ahead, Ian. The question that they want you to deal with is how much of the expense load you're carrying at Wynn on the Peninsula that would be relieved as people that were carrying on your payroll -- were heavy in our payroll -- on the Peninsula Hotel deliberately as part of our training routine to maintain a high level of service that Wynn enjoys and our reputation in Macau. So Ian, what I think his question is, how much -- how far will your expense load drop if you were to get the tables you were supposed to get, which was 500 when we started the building confirmed by the government?"

So the question is, are you guys starting to see any stability or feel any comfort in, at least, that portion of the Macau business? And then a bigger-picture question maybe for Steve. Steve, as you think about some of the government's conversation and some of maybe the comments that had been made over time about diversifying the economy of Macau, in your opinion longer term, do you get the sense that Macau has the potential to really transform itself away from being a predominantly gaming market much in the way that Las Vegas did over a number of years?"

Absolutely, Las Vegas and -- Macau, rather, has transformed itself, not shall or can or will, and has been transformed by the projects that have been built in direct response to the leadership and the suggestions made by the local government. Everything from promotions, to the creation of facilities, exactly that has already taken place. But understand that the reason that these extraordinary non-gaming attractions exist is because the damn casino is the cash register. That's what drives Las Vegas. 40-odd percent of my hotels, the ones that you guys know that we built with this organization in the past, none of them have ever had -- even half of the revenue will be gaming. Over half was non-gaming, but none of them could have been built or would exist today if anybody had given us a table cap because the people that stay in the rooms want to go downstairs and play sometimes. Besides eating and entertaining and shopping and going to the spa, they want to play or they wouldn't come to Macau. So we support these extravagant, non-gaming diversifications with the casino. That's the truth of it. That's the irrevocable, undeniable, inexorable truth of it. The gaming allows the non-gaming to flourish, and that's the lesson we're trying to get -- to penetrate the leadership of Macau, that the very thing they want requires that they let us run our business based upon our experience -- our long experience everywhere else. And that's where the heart of the frustration is, that somehow we haven't been able to get that truth really accepted. And I'm hopeful that before we have demonstrations or real angst or -- I had an employee approached me when I was in Macau and say, ""Mr. Wynn, is the government angry at the union and trying to cut back on gaming employees?"" I said, ""Well, I don't have any reason to think that."" But That's the kind of stuff that's going around in the staff dining room. This confusion is not isolated to management. It's now spread to the employees, very unhealthy situation both socially and politically. And when I'm asked questions like that, I don't have a clear answer, and I want to get away from this kind of thing before it gets out of hand. Now Ian, you can ask the rest of it. The mass gaming, I'm not in a position to answer that question. Mass table revenue is flat as against a year ago."

You need 400 or 500 tables to do it effectively and to support the workforce. Otherwise, the workforce gets cut back and you have layoffs. And all these things that have never happened in my career -- in 45 years, I've never had to lay off. I think, I've -- we once -- I think we once dropped 100 people in this company. 45 years, we don't do layoffs. People come to work for us. They get job security.

It had to do with one of their people in their financing syndicate. The way these guys operate is that they get people to invest almost like a mutual fund or a hedge fund, and then they give these people are return each month on the financial support that they get from these groups of lenders. And apparently, one of the employees who was interfacing with the lenders absconded with their money. It had nothing to do with us. And we went to 100% cash with Dore. They had all the liquidity they needed right in the cage. And when we found out about it, we terminated any extension for us much as RMB 1 or HKD 1 to Dore, and they were able to cover it because they had the liquidity that allowed them to do it. Whether someone else is going to -- there's going to be another defalcation or embezzlement is hard to predict. Criminals tend to be surreptitious until it comes to light, but I think all the junket operators took that as a signal to tighten up on their internal controls from what I'm told. So I don't suspect that, that will happen in the manner that it happened in Dore again. But the overall viability of the junkets themselves depends upon the liquidity and the wealth and the retained earnings that they've kept. We don't see their numbers, and so we're very conservative in how we deal with them. We don't know their retained earnings. Some of them have gone public, but the information that you study under those circumstances is, at best, described by the word murky. So we're left to manage our end of this transaction, which is to shorten the string and the length of time that we give these people, how many non-redeemable chips we give them. And the amount of outstanding unredeemed chips has dropped dramatically almost by half, which reflects the level of business almost identically. Does that -- that's as far as deep an answer I can give you. Is this satisfactory?"

The government wanted us to build highly diversified non-gaming structures. We went and did it for $10 billion or more. And if you count all of us, the largest being us at $4 billion, how in the hell can you run those places without employees? I mean, what are we supposed to do, shut down a floor, close a restaurant, curtail the very thing that they told us that they wanted to see happen without employees? It's so ludicrous that it defies rational conversation. Some of these places are going to close locally, creating unemployment. We can absorb them, I think, in the industry. But still, the extent of the new operations are so comprehensive that in order to operate them appropriately, you still need more people to work. And the spectacle of these buildings being unattended is beyond imagination and will have dire consequences in the community on a couple of levels. The first level will be that it will negatively impact the job security of the local Macau citizens and undoubtedly result in rather severe complaining. What form that will take, I'm not sure. The second thing is that the hospitality profile of the city will be severely compromised, and that will take years to recover, years. You only get one chance to make a good impression. And if you bogey that impression, if you blow it, it's a long time to fix it and maybe never. What is important is that the Macau market, as is viewed by the world, never loses its viability. Because the day that it loses its viability, it will lose its long-term longevity and the entire thing gets really damaged severely. And that will impact the community of Macau in a very negative way. And that's one of the things that concerns me a lot because employee attitudes, everybody in the world, including all of us on this call today, it has been established that our present state of mind, our happiness, our sense of security is fundamentally a function of how we view tomorrow or the future. You tell someone that's feeling poorly, suffering from an ailment or some discomfort that they're going to be better in 3 days, and they feel better today. You tell someone who is feeling great today that they're going to be awfully sick next week, and they get depressed today. So the attitude of the employees, their sense of security, safety, their notion of a positive future for themselves and their families is a critical management responsibility. Now to a certain extent, we control that within the walls of our buildings. But every once in a while, depending on public policy, we lose control of that because of factors that are outside of our control. And my feeling is that Macau, at the moment, is on the edge of that moment, which should be avoided at all cost."

And from what we understand, reading the South China Morning Post and other source of information available to us, President Xi discovered that the people of China felt the government officials were corrupt and feathering their own nest. And he thought that was very malignant for the health of his party and the future of his country and made a decision to correct that and have a campaign against corruption. And considering the amount of people, if you read -- if you believe the newspapers, that have been charged with misconduct of one degree or another, President Xi did the right thing for the right reasons. And because of the way China and Mainland China works, every businessman in that country dealt, in one way or another, with a government official because government -- the government controlled so many aspects of public policy and business interface. So businessmen who had nothing to hide, as well as those who might have had something to hide, all went into the foxholes or into a defensive posture because they didn't know if the next shoe was going to drop or what the next thing was going to happen. And it has caused, across the board, a contraction of all VIP consumer spending at the higher level, which includes Macau. And that explains the problem that the junket operators are having, plus the restriction on the credit cards and things like that. So in one respect, the junket operators faced a problem that was part of an intelligent central government policy. No argument about that. Corruption's a bad thing, and President Xi did the right thing, just as I would in my company if I thought there was corruption. To that extent, Fernando Chui, the head of the government of Macau, or President Xi Jinping or President of a public company or a private company, for that matter, it is bad business to have corruption. And it should be stopped because it's unhealthy and goes to the root of the viability of any organization or institution. So there's something that, in our meetings, we acknowledge and we accept as inconvenient, perhaps, in terms of junket operators but not necessarily a bad thing. So we adjust to it, and that was the way we dealt with that in our conversations. Alternatively, the reason those conversations of 15 or 16 hours is we're juggling the reassessment of our facilities and adjustments to our facilities to cater to the new reality that we face, which incidentally is much more like Las Vegas than what Macau was in the past, and that's fine with me. I have no argument with it. But in the process of adjusting, how do we run our facility under the new reality? And we can do that, but we need tables in the casino to support the restaurants and the convention and meeting space and the entertainment. Of the $4 billion, the casino represents, perhaps, $400 million of it. The others -- $3.6 billion went into other things that weren't part of the old way of looking at things. So on one hand, we understand, went on with the campaign against corruption and we have no issue with that or the thinking that went into it. What we have an issue with is the leadership that we need to have in the government to help us make the transition to the new reality."

And we have designed a remarkable Phase 2. But until we understand about Wynn Palace, it's our ability to look into the future and plan financially is, again, compromised at the moment. My long-term confidence in Macau is still strong. I love the position we're in, in terms of being part of that community. The issue here has to -- is short-term adjustments, not long-term confidence. At the end of the day, I'm in the same position as head of the Macau government and for that matter, President Xi Jinping. My job is to create a stable environment in terms of human resources, job security and a better future for people. Isn't that after all what governments are doing or hopefully doing? And I say at the 11th hour, the government does the right thing and supports the health of its citizens as businessmen will support the health of their employees. Because at the -- the ultimate truth is that the only thing that matters is the happiness of the people, whether they're employees or citizens of a community, and they're the ones that touch the public because only people make people happy. Only people make happy communities. Only people make successful companies. And the job of leaders are to do everything and anything in their power to create a happy and positive outlook to the future for their constituencies. And I strongly believe that when the dust settles, leaders of companies and governments do the right thing. And that's the basis for my long-term confidence in the market and my long-term confidence in the leadership of the government. We all come to the same conclusion when we've had enough time to see. Hopefully, we come to the right conclusion before we avoid catastrophic, unpleasant or disruptive alternatives. We anticipate certain results and don't let them occur. So whether you're a CEO of a company or you're the head of a government, you have to have a little bit of ability to look around the corner and see what's coming ahead of you. And if that's not good, turn away from it, amend your policies, learn from experience and come to a more sound conclusion. That's what I hope for businessmen and I hope for ourselves and, for that matter, for the government."

It has been competitive for quite some time. Look at Las Vegas, with the dozens of hotels, the thousands of tables, the tens of thousands -- 150,000 rooms, millions upon millions feet of convention and meeting space, theaters, cabarets, public entertainment, volcanoes that erupt, fountains that dance, pirate ships that sink, trees that come out of the floor, gondolas that go across dancing fountains for $100 million, all of this is a fight for the audience that's here. Discounts given at the tables, complementaries. It's so intensely competitive in Macau and has been for some long time -- for a long time that it will continue in the same fashion that it has gone -- that it's enjoying now. There will still be a stratification of the public. People who can afford choice and who demand higher levels of service, better food, larger, more sumptuous rooms, better meeting facilities, more fascinating entertainment attractions, they will migrate to places that provide that. Other places that deal to the economy end of the market, such as Circus Circus or -- in Las Vegas or other places in Macau, they have their own level of competition. But there's Kmart and there's Louis Vuitton. There's Macy's and there's Neiman Marcus. They compete. Neiman Marcus competes with other companies of a similar nature. We do as well. Louis Vuitton competes with Chanel and Christian Dior and Prada, and we're at that level. We're the 5-star operator. We offer choices for people that want the best. And when we do that, we, to a certain extent, give up another part of the market to other people. So it's good that a place like Macau or Las Vegas has choice for people. What's wonderful about Macau and Las Vegas is that if you come to that city, you can go from Wynn to Circus. You can go to a lower-end casino to Wynn in Macau, and you can dial up whatever it is that suits you at the moment. And that's the secret to making a great destination city is choice. The bigger the menu, the more powerful the destination resort. But I assure you that every level, there's competition. Am I being helpful of you?"

General comment covering both Las Vegas and Macau is this: We don't see any major change or new development in Macau concerning our existing operations other than all of the comments we've made in the past about the confusion, the ambiguity about what we face in terms of tables in the upcoming months as we -- we're at about 170 days before the opening of the Palace, which is the most significant event in the company's near future. And based upon what's happened to Galaxy and what we expect to happen at the Studio City, which has just today found out how many tables are going to have in the last 2 days to a few weeks before they're open. The confusion and the rather mystical policies that are governing the assignment of equipment in these new hotels, which are tremendous diversifications away from pure gaming into all other forms of non-gaming, that the confusion about the tables and the government's position in this regard has made it very difficult to plan for employees and other aspects of the facility. 
I mentioned this early in the conversation because it's become a major issue in Macau as to the impact of government policy on planning for employment, promotions, hiring and compensation. None of us are really clear on what our environment is going to be like going forward, and it makes planning and adjusting almost a mystical process. And this is the, I think, probably the major topic of conversation in the executive conference rooms as people try and resolve their planning on human resources in the Macau market. 
Our construction of our hotel in Macau is on schedule. We're scheduled for March 25th opening. And the results of the last quarter were consistent with the things we've seen in previous quarters, and that is almost approximately half the business of VIP is gone and may be shrinking. It's caused us to review our credit policies and our attitudes towards junket operators, and some of them have gone out of business. And I think others will, indeed, go out of business, which means you have to focus very intensely on the policies that you employ with regard to the credit that the junket people enjoy in terms of the chips that are advanced to them. 
Our mass business is sort of flat, and I think that's a general description of it. And that explains the earnings in Macau. Now in Las Vegas, we are in this market, the principal beneficiary of international business, and we have been since we opened in 2005. So if a segment of the international market is impacted for extraneous reasons or external reasons like the change in government policy or whatever in China, then we would be the principal victims or we would suffer the most, and that's exactly what happened. Any change in our earnings in Las Vegas is strictly a reflection of a drop in Asian baccarat business. 
The rest of the segments in our Las Vegas business are pretty good. Room revenue and stuff like that is healthy. Our convention business is healthy. Our food and beverage business is healthy, and we're very satisfied with Las Vegas. And if anything, the problems in China are causing us to refocus our energies here in America even more intensely. We're happy that we're moving forward in Massachusetts in spite of the friction created by the mayor and the administration in Boston, which, for some reason, is unwilling to accept the decision of the Casino Control Commission gracefully and keeps trying to use various tactics to say that we are in Boston, not in Everett. It may sound laughable at this point, and in a perverse way, it is a comedy. But it did cause us delays. But happily, they're pretty much behind us now. And we're under way with remediation, and we're looking forward to groundbreaking in a few months. And the Massachusetts project, which we think is a very exciting thing, will be on its way and, hopefully, open in 2018. 
I'll leave the rest of any general remarks before we take questions to Matt or Ian or Gamal or Steve or Maurice or anybody on the call who would like to expand or alter what I've just said. And there are people on this call that have a tighter feeling -- I've been very much involved with design in the last several months. So if any of the operating executives want to close in on this, please feel free to do so.

We've even fooled with the rules of the game. It's been 50 years since Las Vegas increased the price of gaming. We're way overdue, considering the cost of running games and payroll. We have adjusted our yield rate management approach. Maurice Wooden is here, and he's very good at that in the whole American operation. We've made a host of adjustments. We were off in 1 month by -- from $100 million at baccarat to $45 million. We're off $55 million at baccarat, but we've made almost the same amount of money because of all the adjustments we made. And they go across the board throughout the hotel in the way we price the hotel, restaurants and entertainment and gaming. We don't sit by and allow ourselves become victims of anything, of any aspect of our operation over which we have any control. So in my long-term view of our operations in America and in China is still positive. It's the short term that's bewildering.

Their payroll, their operational viability depends on the gaming equipment that was always part of the whole construct. Here in America",663,"Who knows? I mean, these facilities are enormously diversified non-gaming buildings, but they depend on their survival. Their payroll, their operational viability depends on the gaming equipment that was always part of the whole construct. Here in America, we would never had a Las Vegas of the diversity we've had if the city have told us how many tables we could spread. The table cap is the single most counterintuitive and irrational decision that was ever made. Here we are spending billions of dollars creating non-gaming facilities, and then arbitrarily someone says, ""Well, you should only have this many tables."" No jurisdiction ever has imposed such -- that kind of logic on us. And what it's done, it's turned our human resource planning inside out and upside down. And you could tell by the tone of my voice the extent of my frustration on this point, my frustration on behalf of our colleagues at Melco, who made commitments for 400 tables. Why on earth they have to deal with half as many is beyond my -- anything that I can understand in the 45 years of experience I've had. It isn't good for Macau. It's not good for the citizens of Macau. It's not good for the tens of thousands of employees of Macau who are looking forward to promotions and raises and all kinds of benefits that accrue because of the viability of these resorts. We build tens of thousands of rooms and restaurants and attractions, but we say you're not allowed to gamble because you can't have the tables. But that's one of the reasons they come to Macau. If you wanted to undermine and scuttle the viability of that industry, you'd put in table caps, and you could tell I'm a tremendous critic of that decision because I don't understand it in terms of anything in my 45 years of experience that explains it. And to see the predicament that the Melco people find themselves in because they made covenant agreements is dazzling to me. And I've complained to the government about this and tried to understand what the rationale was for this thinking, and I've never gotten a reasonable answer. And hopefully, hopefully, the desire that you mentioned, statements by the central government or by the local government to support this industry and mainly support the people that work in that industry that are the whole interior, the -- all of the young people and the families of Macau that have become part of the hospitality industry, a huge amount of them are people that are related directly or indirectly to the casinos. And what we're getting now is unemployment and, I mean, the junket operators are the beginning of it because they employed all kinds of people from Macau. But forgetting the junket operators, what about the rank-and-file dealers in the mass casino? They cater to the tourists. What happens to their jobs? What happens to their promotions? I don't know whether the local government's been intimidated by the unions because -- or something, but the unions are going to end up acting up about this subject before it's over. And we, as operators, are going to have to stand there on the sidelines bewildered at the position that the industry finds itself in. In my 45 years of experience, I've never seen anything like this before. And hopefully, hopefully, the leadership of the community will intervene and correct this aberration that threatens the employment security of the citizens of Macau and thereby also relieving the predicaments that people like the Lui family of Galaxy experienced with the billions of dollars they spent and Lawrence Ho and Jamie Packer's company, Melco. But these are problems that when you say that there's been the government has made general statements about supporting us or supporting the people of Macau, I think it's time for them to put their actions where the rhetoric is. But the rhetoric won't solve the problem."

I mentioned earlier that the people at Studio City found out a few weeks before opening what the story is about their tables. Now Macau is proud of the 5-star status, the legitimate 5-star status of Wynn Macau. It was hard to train people to get to that level of service, but it's been a source of pride for the community and for the employees themselves. We cannot train people and maintain service levels in the non-casino and casino areas when we don't have the time to train our people. So the notion of finding out how many tables you're going to get 3 weeks before your opening is outrageous and ridiculous. Ridiculous is the word for it. We've never operated a business this way. We train people. That's how we give them a future, by training them. That contributes to their promotions, their pride and to the guest experience. And at the end of the day, guest experience is the only controlling factor in the survival of the hospitality industry. Go ahead, Ian. The question that they want you to deal with is how much of the expense load you're carrying at Wynn on the Peninsula that would be relieved as people that we're carrying on your payroll. We're heavy in our payroll -- on the Peninsula Hotel deliberately as part of our training routine to maintain a high level of service that Wynn enjoys and our reputation in Macau. So Ian, what I think his question is, how much -- how far will your expense load drop if you were to get the tables you were supposed to get, which was 500 when we started the building confirmed by the government?"

Steve, as you think about some of the government's conversation and some of maybe the comments that had been made over time about diversifying the economy of Macau, in your opinion longer term, do you get the sense that Macau has the potential to really transform itself away from being a predominantly gaming market much in the way that Las Vegas did over a number of years?"

Absolutely, Las Vegas and -- Macau, rather, has transformed itself, not shall or can or will, and has been transformed by the projects that have been built in direct response to the leadership and the suggestions made by the local government. Everything from promotions, to the creation of facilities, exactly that has already taken place. But understand that the reason that these extraordinary non-gaming attractions exist is because the damn casino is the cash register. That's what drives Las Vegas. 40-odd percent of my hotels, the ones that you guys know that we built with this organization in the past, none of them have ever had -- even half of the revenue be gaming. Over half was non-gaming, but none of them could have been built or would exist today if anybody had given us a table cap because the people that stay in the rooms want to go downstairs and play sometimes. Besides eating and entertaining and shopping and going to the spa, they want to play or they wouldn't come to Macau. So we support these extravagant, non-gaming diversifications with the casino. That's the truth of it. That's the irrevocable, undeniable, inexorable truth of it. The gaming allows the non-gaming to flourish, and that's the lesson we're trying to get -- to penetrate the leadership of Macau, that the very thing they want requires that they let us run our business based upon our experience -- our long experience everywhere else. And that's where the heart of the frustration is, that somehow we haven't been able to get that truth really accepted. And I'm hopeful that before we have demonstrations or real angst or -- I had an employee approach me when I was in Macau and say, ""Mr. Wynn, is the government angry at the union and trying to cut back on gaming employees?"" I said, ""Well, I don't have any reason to think that."" But That's the kind of stuff that's going around in the staff dining room. This confusion is not isolated to management. It's now spread to the employees, very unhealthy situation both socially and politically. And when I'm asked questions like that, I don't have a clear answer, and I want to get away from this kind of thing before it gets out of hand. Now Ian, you can ask the rest of it. The mass gaming, I'm not in a position to answer that question. Mass table revenue is flat as against a year ago."

The way these guys operate is that they get people to invest almost like a mutual fund or a hedge fund, and then they give these people are return each month on the financial support that they get from these groups of lenders. And apparently, one of the employees who was interfacing with the lenders absconded with their money. It had nothing to do with us. And we went to 100% cash with Dore. They had all the liquidity they needed right in the cage. And when we found out about it, we terminated any extension for as much as RMB 1 or HKD 1 to Dore, and they were able to cover it because they had the liquidity that allowed them to do it. Whether someone else is going to -- there's going to be another defalcation or embezzlement is hard to predict. Criminals tend to be surreptitious until it comes to light, but I think all the junket operators took that as a signal to tighten up on their internal controls from what I'm told. So I don't suspect that, that will happen in the manner that it happened in Dore again. But the overall viability of the junkets themselves depends upon the liquidity and the wealth and the retained earnings that they've kept. We don't see their numbers, and so we're very conservative in how we deal with them. We don't know their retained earnings. Some of them have gone public, but the information that you study under those circumstances is, at best, described by the word murky. So we're left to manage our end of this transaction, which is to shorten the string and the length of time that we give these people, how many non-redeemable chips we give them. And the amount of outstanding unredeemed chips has dropped dramatically almost by half, which reflects the level of business almost identically.

The government wanted us to build highly diversified non-gaming structures. We went and did it for $10 billion or more. And -- if you count all of us, the largest being us at $4 billion, how in the hell can you run those places without employees? I mean, what are we supposed to do, shut down a floor, close a restaurant, curtail the very thing that they told us that they wanted to see happen without employees? It's so ludicrous that it defies rational conversation. Some of these places are going to close locally, creating unemployment. We can absorb them, I think, in the industry. But still, the extent of the new operations are so comprehensive that in order to operate them appropriately, you still need more people to work. And the spectacle of these buildings being unattended is beyond imagination and will have dire consequences in the community on a couple of levels. The first level will be that it will negatively impact the job security of the local Macau citizens and undoubtedly result in rather severe complaining. What form that will take, I'm not sure. The second thing is that the hospitality profile of the city will be severely compromised, and that will take years to recover, years. You only get one chance to make a good impression. And if you bogey that impression, if you blow it, it's a long time to fix it and maybe never. What is important is that the Macau market, as is viewed by the world, never loses its viability. Because the day that it loses its viability, it will lose its long-term longevity and the entire thing gets really damaged severely. And that will impact the community of Macau in a very negative way. And that's one of the things that concerns me a lot because employee attitudes, everybody in the world, including all of us on this call today, it has been established that our present state of mind, our happiness, our sense of security is fundamentally a function of how we view tomorrow or the future. You tell someone that's feeling poorly, suffering from an ailment or some discomfort that they're going to be better in 3 days, and they feel better today. You tell someone who is feeling great today that they're going to be awfully sick next week, and they get depressed today. So the attitude of the employees, their sense of security, safety, their notion of a positive future for themselves and their families is a critical management responsibility. Now to a certain extent, we control that within the walls of our buildings. But every once in a while, depending on public policy, we lose control of that because of factors that are outside of our control. And my feeling is that Macau, at the moment, is on the edge of that moment, which should be avoided at all cost."

And from what we understand, reading the South China Morning Post and other sources of information available to us, President Xi discovered that the people of China felt that government officials were corrupt and feathering their own nest. And he thought that was very malignant for the health of his party and the future of his country and made a decision to correct that and have a campaign against corruption. And considering the amount of people, if you read -- if you believe the newspapers, that have been charged with misconduct of one degree or another, President Xi did the right thing for the right reasons. And because of the way China and Mainland China works, every businessman in that country dealt, in one way or another, with a government official because government -- the government controlled so many aspects of public policy and business interface. So businessmen who had nothing to hide, as well as those who might have had something to hide, all went into the foxholes or into a defensive posture because they didn't know if the next shoe was going to drop or what the next thing was going to happen. And it has caused, across the board, a contraction of all VIP consumer spending at the higher level, which includes Macau. And that explains the problem that the junket operators are having, plus the restriction on the credit cards and things like that. So in one respect, the junket operators faced a problem that was part of an intelligent central government policy. No argument about that. Corruption's a bad thing, and President Xi did the right thing, just as I would in my company if I thought there was corruption. To that extent, Fernando Chui, the head of the government of Macau, or President Xi Jinping or President of a public company or a private company, for that matter, it is bad business to have corruption. And it should be stopped because it's unhealthy and goes to the root of the viability of any organization or institution. So there's something that, in our meetings, we acknowledge and we accept as inconvenient, perhaps, in terms of junket operators but not necessarily a bad thing. So we adjust to it, and that was the way we dealt with that in our conversations. Alternatively, the reason those conversations took 15 or 16 hours is we're juggling the reassessment of our facilities and adjustments to our facilities to cater to the new reality that we face, which incidentally is much more like Las Vegas than what Macau was in the past, and that's fine with me. I have no argument with it. But in the process of adjusting, how do we run our facility under the new reality? And we can do that, but we need tables in the casino to support the restaurants and the convention and meeting space and the entertainment. Of the $4 billion, the casino represents, perhaps, $400 million of it. The other $3.6 billion went into other things that weren't part of the old way of looking at things. So on one hand, we understand, went on with the campaign against corruption and we have no issue with that or the thinking that went into it. What we have an issue with is the leadership that we need to have in the government to help us make the transition to the new reality."

At the end of the day, I'm in the same position as head of the Macau government and for that matter, President Xi Jinping. My job is to create a stable environment in terms of human resources, job security and a better future for people. Isn't that after all what governments are doing or hopefully doing? And I say at the 11th hour, the government does the right thing and supports the health of its citizens as businessmen will support the health of their employees. Because at the -- the ultimate truth is that the only thing that matters is the happiness of the people, whether they're employees or citizens of a community, and they're the ones that touch the public because only people make people happy. Only people make happy communities. Only people make successful companies. And the job of leaders are to do everything and anything in their power to create a happy and positive outlook to the future for their constituencies. And I strongly believe that when the dust settles, leaders of companies and governments do the right thing. And that's the basis for my long-term confidence in the market and my long-term confidence in the leadership of the government. We all come to the same conclusion when we've had enough time to see. Hopefully, we come to the right conclusion before we avoid catastrophic, unpleasant or disruptive alternatives. We anticipate certain results and don't let them occur. So whether you're a CEO of a company or you're the head of a government, you have to have a little bit of ability to look around the corner and see what's coming ahead of you. And if that's not good, turn away from it, amend your policies, learn from experience and come to a more sound conclusion. That's what I hope for businessmen and I hope for ourselves and, for that matter, for the government."

It has been competitive for quite some time. Look at Las Vegas, with the dozens of hotels, the thousands of tables, the tens of thousands -- 150,000 rooms, millions upon millions feet of convention and meeting space, theaters, cabarets, public entertainment, volcanoes that erupt, fountains that dance, pirate ships that sink, trees that come out of the floor, gondolas that go across dancing fountains for $100 million, all of this is a fight for the audience that's here. Discounts given at the tables, complementaries. It's so intensely competitive in Macau and has been for some long time -- for a long time that it will continue in the same fashion that it has gone -- that it's enjoying now. There will still be a stratification of the public. People who can afford choice and who demand higher levels of service, better food, larger, more sumptuous rooms, better meeting facilities, more fascinating entertainment attractions, they will migrate to places that provide that. Other places that deal to the economy end of the market, such as Circus Circus or -- in Las Vegas or other places in Macau, they have their own level of competition. But there's Kmart and there's Louis Vuitton. There's Macy's and there's Neiman Marcus. They compete. Neiman Marcus competes with other companies of a similar nature. We do as well. Louis Vuitton competes with Chanel and Christian Dior and Prada, and we're at that level. We're the 5-star operator. We offer choices for people that want the best. And when we do that, we, to a certain extent, give up another part of the market to other people. So it's good that a place like Macau or Las Vegas has choice for people. What's wonderful about Macau and Las Vegas is that if you come to that city, you can go from Wynn to Circus. You can go to a lower-end casino to Wynn in Macau, and you can dial up whatever it is that suits you at the moment. And that's the secret to making a great destination city is choice. The bigger the menu, the more powerful the destination resort. But I assure you that every level, there's competition. Am I being helpful of you?"

General comment covering both Las Vegas and Macau is this: We don't see any major change or new development in Macau concerning our existing operations other than all of the comments we've made in the past about t",778,"I think the numbers speak for themselves. General comment covering both Las Vegas and Macau is this: We don't see any major change or new development in Macau concerning our existing operations other than all of the comments we've made in the past about the confusion, the ambiguity about what we face in terms of tables in the upcoming months as we -- we're at about 170 days before the opening of the Palace, which is the most significant event in the company's near future. And based upon what's happened to Galaxy and what we expect to happen at the Studio City, which has just today found out how many tables are going to have in the last 2 days to a few weeks before they're open. The confusion and the rather mystical policies that are governing the assignment of equipment in these new hotels, which are tremendous diversifications away from pure gaming into all other forms of non-gaming, that the confusion about the tables and the government's position in this regard has made it very difficult to plan for employees and other aspects of the facility. 
I mentioned this early in the conversation because it's become a major issue in Macau as to the impact of government policy on planning for employment, promotions, hiring and compensation. None of us are really clear on what our environment is going to be like going forward, and it makes planning and adjusting almost a mystical process. And this is the, I think, probably the major topic of conversation in the executive conference rooms as people try and resolve their planning on human resources in the Macau market. 
Our construction of our hotel in Macau is on schedule. We're scheduled for March 25th opening. And the results of the last quarter were consistent with the things we've seen in previous quarters, and that is almost approximately half the business of VIP is gone and may be shrinking. It's caused us to review our credit policies and our attitudes towards junket operators, and some of them have gone out of business. And I think others will, indeed, go out of business, which means you have to focus very intensely on the policies that you employ with regard to the credit that the junket people enjoy in terms of the chips that are advanced to them. 
Our mass business is sort of flat, and I think that's a general description of it. And that explains the earnings in Macau. Now in Las Vegas, we are in this market, the principal beneficiary of international business, and we have been since we opened in 2005. So if a segment of the international market is impacted for extraneous reasons or external reasons like the change in government policy or whatever in China, then we would be the principal victims or we would suffer the most, and that's exactly what happened. Any change in our earnings in Las Vegas is strictly a reflection of a drop in Asian baccarat business. 
The rest of the segments in our Las Vegas business are pretty good. Room revenue and stuff like that is healthy. Our convention business is healthy. Our food and beverage business is healthy, and we're very satisfied with Las Vegas. And if anything, the problems in China are causing us to refocus our energies here in America even more intensely. We're happy that we're moving forward in Massachusetts in spite of the friction created by the mayor and the administration in Boston, which, for some reason, is unwilling to accept the decision of the Casino Control Commission gracefully and keeps trying to use various tactics to say that we are in Boston, not in Everett. It may sound laughable at this point, and in a perverse way, it is a comedy. But it did cause us delays. But happily, they're pretty much behind us now. And we're under way with remediation, and we're looking forward to groundbreaking in a few months. And the Massachusetts project, which we think is a very exciting thing, will be on its way and, hopefully, open in 2018. 
I'll leave the rest of any general remarks before we take questions to Matt or Ian or Gamal or Steve or Maurice or anybody on the call who would like to expand or alter what I've just said. And there are people on this call that have a tighter feeling -- I've been very much involved with design in the last several months. So if any of the operating executives want to close in on this, please feel free to do so. 
Gamal, do you have anything to add? Ian? Either one of you."

And we run the business in uptimes and downtimes, and we adjust to the situations. We made a whole bunch of changes in the casino both physically and procedurally. We've even fooled with the rules of the game. It's been 50 years since Las Vegas increased the price of gaming. We're way overdue, considering the cost of running games and payroll. We have adjusted our yield rate management approach. Maurice Wooden is here, and he's very good at that in the whole American operation. We've made a host of adjustments. We were off in 1 month by -- from $100 million at baccarat to $45 million. We're off $55 million at baccarat, but we've made almost the same amount of money because of all the adjustments we made. And they go across the board throughout the hotel in the way we price the hotel, restaurants and entertainment and gaming. We don't sit by and allow ourselves become victims of anything, of any aspect of our operation over which we have any control. So in my long-term view of our operations in America and in China is still positive. It's the short term that's bewildering. And it's bewildering enough to complain about it, but as far as adjusting here and in China, it's a constant process. I was in China last week, and I kept my people up until 2 in the morning on the subject of VIP. And then we reconvened at 8:00 a.m. again and went for another 6 hours. I think, all together, we spent 15 hours, the most intense kind of consultation with every smart person we had that dealt with these subjects. So adjusting is what we do. And I mean, this -- the description of those -- detailed description of those adjustments could go on for 0.5 hour, but know that we are doing it and we're doing it successfully."

I mean, these facilities are enormously diversified non-gaming buildings, but they depend on their survival. Their payroll, their operational viability depends on the gaming equipment that was always part of the whole construct. Here in America, we would never had a Las Vegas of the diversity we've had if the city have told us how many tables we could spread. The table cap is the single most counterintuitive and irrational decision that was ever made. Here we are spending billions of dollars creating non-gaming facilities, and then arbitrarily someone says, ""Well, you should only have this many tables."" No jurisdiction ever has imposed such -- that kind of logic on us. And what it's done, it's turned our human resource planning inside out and upside down. And you could tell by the tone of my voice the extent of my frustration on this point, my frustration on behalf of our colleagues at Melco, who made commitments for 400 tables. Why on earth they have to deal with half as many is beyond my -- anything that I can understand in the 45 years of experience I've had. It isn't good for Macau. It's not good for the citizens of Macau. It's not good for the tens of thousands of employees of Macau who are looking forward to promotions and raises and all kinds of benefits that accrue because of the viability of these resorts. We build tens of thousands of rooms and restaurants and attractions, but we say you're not allowed to gamble because you can't have the tables. But that's one of the reasons they come to Macau. If you wanted to undermine and scuttle the viability of that industry, you'd put in table caps, and you could tell I'm a tremendous critic of that decision because I don't understand it in terms of anything in my 45 years of experience that explains it. And to see the predicament that the Melco people find themselves in because they made covenant agreements is dazzling to me. And I've complained to the government about this and tried to understand what the rationale was for this thinking, and I've never gotten a reasonable answer. And hopefully, hopefully, the desire that you mentioned, statements by the central government or by the local government to support this industry and mainly support the people that work in that industry that are the whole interior, the -- all of the young people and the families of Macau that have become part of the hospitality industry, a huge amount of them are people that are related directly or indirectly to the casinos. And what we're getting now is unemployment and, I mean, the junket operators are the beginning of it because they employed all kinds of people from Macau. But forgetting the junket operators, what about the rank-and-file dealers in the mass casino? They cater to the tourists. What happens to their jobs? What happens to their promotions? I don't know whether the local government's been intimidated by the unions because -- or something, but the unions are going to end up acting up about this subject before it's over. And we, as operators, are going to have to stand there on the sidelines bewildered at the position that the industry finds itself in. In my 45 years of experience, I've never seen anything like this before. And hopefully, hopefully, the leadership of the community will intervene and correct this aberration that threatens the employment security of the citizens of Macau and thereby also relieving the predicaments that people like the Lui family of Galaxy experienced with the billions of dollars they spent and Lawrence Ho and Jamie Packer's company, Melco. But these are problems that when you say that there's been the government has made general statements about supporting us or supporting the people of Macau, I think it's time for them to put their actions where the rhetoric is. But the rhetoric won't solve the problem."

It was hard to train people to get to that level of service, but it's been a source of pride for the community and for the employees themselves. We cannot train people and maintain service levels in the non-casino and casino areas when we don't have the time to train our people. So the notion of finding out how many tables you're going to get 3 weeks before your opening is outrageous and ridiculous. Ridiculous is the word for it. We've never operated a business this way. We train people. That's how we give them a future, by training them. That contributes to their promotions, their pride and to the guest experience. And at the end of the day, guest experience is the only controlling factor in the survival of the hospitality industry. Go ahead, Ian. The question that they want you to deal with is how much of the expense load you're carrying at Wynn on the Peninsula that would be relieved as people that we're carrying on your payroll. We're heavy in our payroll -- on the Peninsula Hotel deliberately as part of our training routine to maintain a high level of service that Wynn enjoys and our reputation in Macau.

Steve, as you think about some of the government's conversation and some of maybe the comments that had been made over time about diversifying the economy of Macau, in your opinion longer term, do you get the sense that Macau has the potential to really transform itself away from being a predominantly gaming market much in the way that Las Vegas did over a number of years?"

Absolutely, Las Vegas and -- Macau, rather, has transformed itself, not shall or can or will, and has been transformed by the projects that have been built in direct response to the leadership and the suggestions made by the local government. Everything from promotions, to the creation of facilities, exactly that has already taken place. But understand that the reason that these extraordinary non-gaming attractions exist is because the damn casino is the cash register. That's what drives Las Vegas. 40-odd percent of my hotels, the ones that you guys know that we built with this organization in the past, none of them have ever had -- even half of the revenue be gaming. Over half was non-gaming, but none of them could have been built or would exist today if anybody had given us a table cap because the people that stay in the rooms want to go downstairs and play sometimes. Besides eating and entertaining and shopping and going to the spa, they want to play or they wouldn't come to Macau. So we support these extravagant, non-gaming diversifications with the casino. That's the truth of it. That's the irrevocable, undeniable, inexorable truth of it. The gaming allows the non-gaming to flourish, and that's the lesson we're trying to get -- to penetrate the leadership of Macau, that the very thing they want requires that they let us run our business based upon our experience -- our long experience everywhere else. And that's where the heart of the frustration is, that somehow we haven't been able to get that truth really accepted. And I'm hopeful that before we have demonstrations or real angst or -- I had an employee approach me when I was in Macau and say, ""Mr. Wynn, is the government angry at the union and trying to cut back on gaming employees?"" I said, ""Well, I don't have any reason to think that."" But that's the kind of stuff that's going around in the staff dining room. This confusion is not isolated to management. It's now spread to the employees, very unhealthy situation both socially and politically. And when I'm asked questions like that, I don't have a clear answer, and I want to get away from this kind of thing before it gets out of hand. Now Ian, you can ask the rest of it. The mass gaming, I'm not in a position to answer that question. Mass table revenue is flat as against a year ago."

The way these guys operate is that they get people to invest almost like a mutual fund or a hedge fund, and then they give these people are return each month on the financial support that they get from these groups of lenders. And apparently, one of the employees who was interfacing with the lenders absconded with their money. It had nothing to do with us. And we went to 100% cash with Dore. They had all the liquidity they needed right in the cage. And when we found out about it, we terminated any extension for as much as RMB 1 or HKD 1 to Dore, and they were able to cover it because they had the liquidity that allowed them to do it. Whether someone else is going to -- there's going to be another defalcation or embezzlement is hard to predict. Criminals tend to be surreptitious until it comes to light, but I think all the junket operators took that as a signal to tighten up on their internal controls from what I'm told. So I don't suspect that, that will happen in the manner that it happened in Dore again. But the overall viability of the junkets themselves depends upon the liquidity and the wealth and the retained earnings that they've kept. We don't see their numbers, and so we're very conservative in how we deal with them. We don't know their retained earnings. Some of them have gone public, but the information that you study under those circumstances is, at best, described by the word murky. So we're left to manage our end of this transaction, which is to shorten the string and the length of time that we give these people, how many non-redeemable chips we give them.

The government wanted us to build highly diversified non-gaming structures. We went and did it for $10 billion or more. And -- if you count all of us, the largest being us at $4 billion, how in the hell can you run those places without employees? I mean, what are we supposed to do, shut down a floor, close a restaurant, curtail the very thing that they told us that they wanted to see happen without employees? It's so ludicrous that it defies rational conversation. Some of these places are going to close locally, creating unemployment. We can absorb them, I think, in the industry. But still, the extent of the new operations are so comprehensive that in order to operate them appropriately, you still need more people to work. And the spectacle of these buildings being unattended is beyond imagination and will have dire consequences in the community on a couple of levels. The first level will be that it will negatively impact the job security of the local Macau citizens and undoubtedly result in rather severe complaining. What form that will take, I'm not sure. The second thing is that the hospitality profile of the city will be severely compromised, and that will take years to recover, years. You only get one chance to make a good impression. And if you bogey that impression, if you blow it, it's a long time to fix it and maybe never. What is important is that the Macau market, as is viewed by the world, never loses its viability. Because the day that it loses its viability, it will lose its long-term longevity and the entire thing gets really damaged severely. And that will impact the community of Macau in a very negative way. And that's one of the things that concerns me a lot because employee attitudes, everybody in the world, including all of us on this call today, it has been established that our present state of mind, our happiness, our sense of security is fundamentally a function of how we view tomorrow or the future. You tell someone that's feeling poorly, suffering from an ailment or some discomfort that they're going to be better in 3 days, and they feel better today. You tell someone who is feeling great today that they're going to be awfully sick next week, and they get depressed today. So the attitude of the employees, their sense of security, safety, their notion of a positive future for themselves and their families is a critical management responsibility. Now to a certain extent, we control that within the walls of our buildings. But every once in a while, depending on public policy, we lose control of that because of factors that are outside of our control. And my feeling is that Macau, at the moment, is on the edge of that moment, which should be avoided at all cost."

And from what we understand, reading the South China Morning Post and other sources of information available to us, President Xi discovered that the people of China felt that government officials were corrupt and feath",576,"Well, the -- that's a good question. And from what we understand, reading the South China Morning Post and other sources of information available to us, President Xi discovered that the people of China felt that government officials were corrupt and feathering their own nest. And he thought that was very malignant for the health of his party and the future of his country and made a decision to correct that and have a campaign against corruption. And considering the amount of people, if you read -- if you believe the newspapers, that have been charged with misconduct of one degree or another, President Xi did the right thing for the right reasons. And because of the way China and Mainland China works, every businessman in that country dealt, in one way or another, with a government official because government -- the government controlled so many aspects of public policy and business interface. So businessmen who had nothing to hide, as well as those who might have had something to hide, all went into the foxholes or into a defensive posture because they didn't know if the next shoe was going to drop or what the next thing was going to happen. And it has caused, across the board, a contraction of all VIP consumer spending at the higher level, which includes Macau. And that explains the problem that the junket operators are having, plus the restriction on the credit cards and things like that. So in one respect, the junket operators faced a problem that was part of an intelligent central government policy. No argument about that. Corruption's a bad thing, and President Xi did the right thing, just as I would in my company if I thought there was corruption. To that extent, Fernando Chui, the head of the government of Macau, or President Xi Jinping or President of a public company or a private company, for that matter, it is bad business to have corruption. And it should be stopped because it's unhealthy and goes to the root of the viability of any organization or institution. So there's something that, in our meetings, we acknowledge and we accept as inconvenient, perhaps, in terms of junket operators but not necessarily a bad thing. So we adjust to it, and that was the way we dealt with that in our conversations. Alternatively, the reason those conversations took 15 or 16 hours is we're juggling the reassessment of our facilities and adjustments to our facilities to cater to the new reality that we face, which incidentally is much more like Las Vegas than what Macau was in the past, and that's fine with me. I have no argument with it. But in the process of adjusting, how do we run our facility under the new reality? And we can do that, but we need tables in the casino to support the restaurants and the convention and meeting space and the entertainment. Of the $4 billion, the casino represents, perhaps, $400 million of it. The other $3.6 billion went into other things that weren't part of the old way of looking at things. So on one hand, we understand, went on with the campaign against corruption and we have no issue with that or the thinking that went into it. What we have an issue with is the leadership that we need to have in the government to help us make the transition to the new reality."

My long-term confidence in Macau is still strong. I love the position we're in, in terms of being part of that community. The issue here has to -- is short-term adjustments, not long-term confidence. At the end of the day, I'm in the same position as head of the Macau government and for that matter, President Xi Jinping. My job is to create a stable environment in terms of human resources, job security and a better future for people. Isn't that after all what governments are doing or hopefully doing? And I say at the 11th hour, the government does the right thing and supports the health of its citizens as businessmen will support the health of their employees. Because at the -- the ultimate truth is that the only thing that matters is the happiness of the people, whether they're employees or citizens of a community, and they're the ones that touch the public because only people make people happy. Only people make happy communities. Only people make successful companies. And the job of leaders are to do everything and anything in their power to create a happy and positive outlook to the future for their constituencies. And I strongly believe that when the dust settles, leaders of companies and governments do the right thing. And that's the basis for my long-term confidence in the market and my long-term confidence in the leadership of the government. We all come to the same conclusion when we've had enough time to see. Hopefully, we come to the right conclusion before we avoid catastrophic, unpleasant or disruptive alternatives. We anticipate certain results and don't let them occur. So whether you're a CEO of a company or you're the head of a government, you have to have a little bit of ability to look around the corner and see what's coming ahead of you. And if that's not good, turn away from it, amend your policies, learn from experience and come to a more sound conclusion. That's what I hope for businessmen and I hope for ourselves and, for that matter, for the government."

Discounts given at the tables, complementaries. It's so intensely competitive in Macau and has been for some long time -- for a long time that it will continue in the same fashion that it has gone -- that it's enjoying now. There will still be a stratification of the public. People who can afford choice and who demand higher levels of service, better food, larger, more sumptuous rooms, better meeting facilities, more fascinating entertainment attractions, they will migrate to places that provide that. Other places that deal to the economy end of the market, such as Circus Circus or -- in Las Vegas or other places in Macau, they have their own level of competition. But there's Kmart and there's Louis Vuitton. There's Macy's and there's Neiman Marcus. They compete. Neiman Marcus competes with other companies of a similar nature. We do as well. Louis Vuitton competes with Chanel and Christian Dior and Prada, and we're at that level. We're the 5-star operator. We offer choices for people that want the best. And when we do that, we, to a certain extent, give up another part of the market to other people. So it's good that a place like Macau or Las Vegas has choice for people. What's wonderful about Macau and Las Vegas is that if you come to that city, you can go from Wynn to Circus. You can go to a lower-end casino to Wynn in Macau, and you can dial up whatever it is that suits you at the moment. And that's the secret to making a great destination city is choice.
