Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call this morning is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Senior Vice President in charge of Business Development and Investor Relations; and Ken Duane, the CEO of our Heritage Businesses and our North American Wholesale businesses. 
Overall, we are quite pleased with our fourth quarter results, which matched the top end of our earnings guidance despite the highly challenging market environment and foreign currency headwinds. 
In the fourth quarter, on a constant currency basis, revenues increased 5% and EPS grew 30%. Mike Shaffer will take you through the details of the financials for the quarter and our guidance, and I'll also highlight some of the issues surrounding foreign currencies, which I know there's a lot of interest in. I'm going to get into the business right now and talk about Calvin Klein. 
In the fourth quarter, revenues, on a constant currency basis, increased 6% while earnings increased about 9%, driven by strong sales performance in our North American business and higher international operating margins due to the elimination of clearance and off-price sales in Europe and Asia. 
Moving into the first quarter, we have seen a significant improvement in our international sales trends. Retail comp store sales are running ahead of plan in the first quarter and trending up high single-digits in Asia with particular strength in China and Southeast Asia. 
We are also seeing high single-digit increases in our European businesses on a comp store basis. So both regions really performing much stronger for us. 
In Europe, the CK wholesale business continues to improve with our 2015 spring and fall order books, excluding Russia, up about 10% over the prior year. In North America, our CK retail comps are running on plan up low single-digits. We are seeing strong sales in our domestic permanent population stores, while our stores located in international tourist destinations, like Miami, Orlando, New York and Las Vegas, are feeling the pressure from the weaker international tourist traffic, which we believe is a direct result of the strength in the U.S. dollars impact on international travel to the U.S. 
Focusing now some of the Calvin Klein brand initiatives and update. Our Calvin Klein jeans and underwear marketing initiatives have focused on reaching new consumers over the last 12 months. We have increasingly invested in and focused on our digital outreach through our #MyCalvinKlein's campaign and our subsequent extension of that campaign with our spring 2015 Calvin Klein jeans and underwear campaigns featuring Justin Bieber and Lara Stone, which launched in January. 
We have seen a significant increase in the number of fans since the launch, and we have generated well over 13 million fan interactions to date. From a business perspective, this has allowed Calvin Klein to engage with our existing and new customers and has helped to drive purchases of the brand. 
Further to the initial my Calvin Klein's campaign, the spring 2015 campaign featuring Justin Bieber was the #11 global trending topic on Twitter at launch. We have seen traffic more than double on calvinklein.com, and the campaign in the first 2 weeks achieved over $350 million of publicity value. We believe the campaign has helped to continue to fuel the momentum that we are seeing in our jeans and underwear businesses globally. 
From a product point of view, I'm going to focus on Calvin Klein underwear first. We have delivered new core product along with significantly improved and elevated packaging. We have launched 2 new men's programs globally Intense Power and Air FX for spring 2015 and have seen very promising additional selling results. 
As a reminder, Intense Power is what Justin Bieber was featured in and has sold well at retail. Air FX is more of a performance underwear, which taps into what is happening more broadly in the active arena. 
In the Women's area, our wanting top logo initiative leverages the best of what Calvin Klein underwear does for men and translates it for women's with an active appeal. Modern cotton continues to drive the improvement in all women's business in North America and Europe. 
We have also continued investing in our point-of-sale presentation with new graphics and new fixtures. In addition, we have upgraded and installed new shops in key markets in the U.S., in New York, Miami, the West Coast and California, San Francisco. Additionally, we have installed new shops and stores internationally in key markets throughout Europe and Asia. 
In the U.S. over the last 6 months, our Men's and Women's businesses have picked up market share across the department store landscape. Average unit retails continued to be up about 10% year-over-year, driven by full price selling of the new product launches. Overall, underwear sales are running up high single-digits at retail in the first quarter. 
In Europe, Men's continues to outperform with the Women's performance driven by elevated fashion components added to the business. Overall, sales in the first quarter are running up mid single-digits at retail. 
In Asia, we continue to see great performance on elevated back label product across both men's and women's. Our women's bra business in Asia continues to outperform every other region. And the perfectly fit collection for women's is ranked as the #1 or #2 performing collection in all key Asian regions. Overall sales in the first quarter are running up high single digits at retail. 
Moving to our Calvin Klein jeans. In the Jeans area, new product has been delivered and we have seen a good reaction from consumers, particularly where we have installed new jeans shops. 
In North America, we have installed 225 shops in 2014, 150 men's shops and 75 women's shops. In the newly installed shops, we have experienced a 40% retail sales increase over the prior year. For 2014, AURs were up about 15%, and that trend has continued into the first quarter of 2015. 
We are targeting 150 new shops installations in North America for fiscal 2015. In Europe, we are in early stages of a turnaround in the jeans business. We have installed over 60 [ph] new jeans shops throughout Europe. We have significantly improved the quality level of our jeans line with better fabrics, trends and packages. We are effectively out of all off-price retailers in Europe beginning in the first quarter of 2015. We have closed approximately 40 underperforming stores over the last 18 months. We have opened 11 Calvin Klein Jeans freestanding stores in the second half of 2014. 
During the first quarter of 2015, we are renovating our stores in London, Rome, Venice and Milan to our new jeans concept shops, and we expect them to open in the second quarter of '15. 
The jeans business in Europe is seeing improved sellthroughs and higher AURs in the first quarter with growth across all markets with the exception of Russia. At wholesale, our 2015 European order books, excluding Russia, are up about 10% over the prior year. 
Moving onto Tommy Hilfiger. On a constant currency basis, revenues for the Tommy Hilfiger business increased 9% for the fourth quarter, while operating earnings on a constant currency grew 10%. In North America, we posted a 1% comparable store sales increase. And as we move into the first quarter, comp sales trends have basically continued at this level, running about flat to date, primarily driven by lower international tourist traffic in those key centers, while domestic permanent population centers are running up low single-digits as well. 
At Wholesale, our European business continues to outpace the competition. As an indicator, our 2015 European order book ex-Russia is running up about 5% compared to the prior year. 
Internationally, we have seen growth on a constant currency basis throughout our international business. The growth in the fourth quarter was driven by strong European business, both at wholesale and retail. The European retail comp stores increased 6% in the fourth quarter. As we move into the first quarter, comps are on plan running up low single-digits quarter to date. 
From a brand perspective for the Tommy Hilfiger brand, we continue to focus on driving the brand globally through elevated product development and engaging marketing campaigns. In 2014, we successfully launched our new Tommy Hilfiger e-commerce site, which we believe effectively integrates commerce and brand experience. Since the new site has launched, we have seen a significant increase in traffic and consumer engagement on our site, which has resulted in strong growth in our fourth quarter e-commerce sales. We continue to evolve our consumer engagement through increased digital marketing and media spend. 
As we focus on driving some of our key brand initiatives, including growing our underdeveloped Tommy Tailored business and our Tommy Underwear business, we recently announced that Raffi L and Nadal will be our brand ambassador for the 4 marketing campaign. This campaign will focus on those key -- 2 key product categories, tailored and men's underwear, which we believe we have significant growth opportunities to capture. 
Moving to our heritage business. Our heritage business had a difficult fourth quarter with revenues down 3%, principally driven by poor performance of our dress shirt business. Operating income declined $12 million in the fourth quarter, as clearance markdowns were required to balance inventories and clear excess goods. We believe this dress shirt issue was behind us as we enter 2015 and we will begin to see this business turn around in fiscal 2015. 
Moving into the first quarter. Our sportswear businesses have continued to perform with retail comps running up about mid single-digits quarter to date. 
Before I turn it over to Mike, I just want to focus on the key initiatives as we move forward. As we move in over the next 3 years, our key objective will be capturing the long-term revenue and profit opportunities for our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands. There are really 5 key initiatives that we hope to accomplish over the next 3 years and that you should be monitoring as we go forward. The first is to continue to invest in product, presentation and the marketing of the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands. 
Second, we continue to invest in our global operating platforms to support our growth strategies, including key investments in our digital, commerce systems and platforms. Third significantly improving the operating results of the Calvin Klein European business over the next 3 years so that it is comparable to the strong operating performance of our Tommy Hilfiger business in Europe. 
Fourth, continue to invest in the expansion of our presence in Asia and Latin America for both Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein as we see these markets as our greatest growth opportunities for the brands. And finally, assuming more direct control over our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger's license businesses over the next 3 years, where we could maximize our core competencies through increased sales and our overall profitability. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Mike to quantify the fourth quarter results and to put more color on some of the guidance that we've given"

The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. I want to briefly touch on the fourth quarter of 2014 and move on to 2015.

I want to briefly touch on the fourth quarter of 2014 and move on to 2015. 
Our overall 2014 revenues were close to planned, excluding the impact of foreign currency. A strong growth in our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses was offset by a decline in our Heritage business. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 9% on a constant currency basis in the quarter with strong wholesale performance in North America. 
In Europe, Tommy Hilfiger retail posted 6% comps, combining the square footage expansion, while the wholesale business recorded mid single-digit growth. Calvin Klein also had a strong quarter with revenues up 6% on a constant currency basis, driven in large part by North America wholesale, in particular, our underwear business. In addition, both Tommy and Calvin experienced increases in the fourth quarter operating margins versus the prior year. 
Heritage revenues were down 3% for the quarter, due to poor performance in our dress shirt division. Within our dress shirt business, the shortfall in revenue was coupled with the decline in gross margin due to heavy markdowns as a result of excess inventory levels which significantly lowered our Heritage operating margins. Benefiting the fourth quarter versus the prior year and our guidance was a decrease in the tax region by discrete items. 
Overall, we delivered earnings per share growth of 23% even with the $0.10 per share negative impact from foreign currency exchange. As we look to 2015, we take a moment understand the mix of our businesses revenues and earnings and the impact of the strength in the U.S. dollar. 
As we called out in our press release, our earnings before unallocated U.S. corporate expenses are about 2/3 international with heavy -- which heavily exposes us to exchange rate fluctuations on both the transaction and translational basis. Our exposure at the transactional level is mostly due to our international divisions, purchasing their inventory in U.S. dollars. To partially protect against this, we bought forward exchange contracts about 9 to 12 months out for about 80% of our projected inventory purchases made by our international division in U.S. dollars. 
Our exposure at a translation level was due to converting the revenue and earnings of our international divisions into U.S. dollars. Like most companies, we do not hedge translation and we don't believe we should begin billing our currency fluctuations. 
In 2015, we're anticipating, based on current exchange rates, that we'll be impacted negatively by about $1.20 of earnings per share for foreign exchange. The $1.20 impact is approximately 2/3 driven by translation and 1/3 driven by transaction. Our largest currency exposures are the euro, the Canadian dollar and the Brazilian real. In addition to the impact of the strengthening dollar, the turbulent economic and political issues in Russia are projected to reduce earnings in our Russian business by about $0.10. The business remains profitable, but at a much lower level than in the prior year. Going forward, we'll be discussing these inventory when material and offering a constant currency view of our operations to measure the 2 health of our business. 
For the full year 2015, we are projecting earnings per share of $6.75 to $6.90. If we exclude the negative impact of FX in Russia of $1.30, we have earnings per share growth of 10% to 12% over the prior year. 
Overall, we're projecting revenues approximately $7.9 billion, which includes a negative impact of over $500 million related to foreign currency. On a constant currency basis, we are projecting revenues to increase about 3%. 
Overall, operating margins are expected to increase about 20 to 30 basis points, excluding a negative impact of about 60 basis points due to FX, driving the growth on excluding foreign currency is continued improvement in the cabin business, which is projecting revenues to grow 5% on a constant currency basis. We are also planning Calvin Klein operating margins to increase 30 to 50 basis points, excluding a negative impact of 20 basis points of FX. 
Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 3% on a constant currency basis with operating margins relatively flat, excluding a negative impact of approximately 100 basis points of FX. 
Our Heritage business is planned to have a revenue decrease of 4%, due mostly to exiting the IZOD retail business in 2015. Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to increase about 50 [ph] to 80 basis points as our wholesale business continues to show gross margin improvements, particularly in dress shirts. The impact of foreign currency in our Heritage business is immaterial. 
Interest expense for the year is planned to be between $100 million and $125 million compared to the prior year amount of $139 million, due to our average lower debt balances. Also favorably impacting interest for 2015 is the debt refinancing we did in the second half of last year's first quarter. 
Our tax rate for the year is planned at about 22%, which is mostly aligned with the prior year. First quarter earnings per share are planned at $1.35 to $1.40 and include $0.30 of estimated negative impact of foreign exchange and a decline in our Russian business. Excluding this impact, we're expecting earnings per share to increase 12% to 16% for the first quarter. Revenue in the first quarter is projected to increase 2% on a constant currency basis. Tommy Hilfiger's revenues are planned at 2% constant currency increase and Calvin Klein is planned at a 3% constant currency increase. Heritage brand's revenues are projected to decrease 1%. Interest expense is projected to be $30 million and taxes to be about 25% to 26% in the first quarter. And lastly, we currently expect debt paydown to be at least $425 million in 2015. 
And with that, we'll open it up for questions."

So we really are turning the percentages upside down. We're really trying to drive growing full price selling and at the same time, taking market share. I believe when you look at the business, where you'll see that manifest itself in the Calvin Klein North America business is on a constant currency basis, see operating margins continuing to improve in that business as we go forward. And we'll be reporting at retail with our key department store accounts the fact that we're seeing strong sellthroughs of that product. Hopefully, you'll also be seeing, because I know you shop, you'll also be seeing in North America a much more elevated presentation at retail with our key accounts, Macy's, Lawren Taylor, Dillard's, both in the jeans and the underwear area. And overall, you should be seeing higher average unit retails going out the door. In our international businesses, it's probably even more transparent because a bigger component of that business for us is direct-to-consumer, where we are in control both the environment and the selling space, so we put those results on a retail basis. So I think there, the business, particularly in Asia, which is a highly profitable business model there, it should be on top line growth in both of those categories as we go forward. And we're starting to see that in the first quarter this year with a real handful of product as we have rebalanced more of a selling into the full price area away from clearance and promotional sales, that comparison in Asia is pretty much behind us now so we're really getting up an apples-to-apples comparison beginning in 2015. So for us, that will be the driver. In Europe, continue to focus on the order book, continuing to see our price points increase at retail and our presentation across the board on the Calvin Klein brand. So I think that profitability will be very transparent when we report results."

But when you're really getting to the fundamental of the business, what's really driving, that is a very healthy business, both jeans, underwear, all product categories in those 2 regions of the world. So I believe the enhancements that you will see will be hopefully on a local currency basis, you'll see some continued operating margin improvement for which you really should start to see the beginning of '15 some top line growth as we're eliminating the off-price clearance sales that existed in the business. In the U.S. and European businesses, both of those businesses are basically a breakeven for jeans business model for us today. So we clearly believe that we have the opportunity there to bring those margins over the next 4 to 5 years to approach 10%. Every other Calvin Klein business that we run in those -- in Europe and in North America are running at double-digit operating margins for us. So it's really cleaning up the problems of the past, getting the brand presented, making those investments the last 18 months and continuing that into this year, but each year, seeing an improvement in the operating margins of our business as we go forward, so that when we get over the next 3 to 4 years, we'll start to approach those double-digit operating margins for Jeans in Europe and North America."

I think from a macro point of view, we're really dealing with some headwinds going forward. The Tommy business, the strength of the Tommy business has been its geographic diversity and the strong brand positioning and the strong operating and financial characteristics that the European business it carries. I think, fundamentally, when you think what's going on with currencies around the world in Europe in particular, but Brazil as well, 2 big markets for both Calvin and Tommy. I think with Tommy in Europe, there's a reason those currencies are under so much pressure. The underlying economic statistics there are just feeling the pressure. So it's the fact that our order book is running up mid, 4% to 6% depending on the season, in of itself is disappointing to us when you look on it on a historic basis, where we had double-digit increases in 2010, '11 and '12. But clearly, from what's going on from a macro point of view, we feel we are substantially getting market share during the same timeframe. But that doesn't change the dynamic that's going on that we're only planning our comps to grow low single-digit in Europe and we're planning the wholesale business to also grow in that 2% to 4% range for the second half of the year. So Tommy has consistently surprised us on the upside with the results, and we're in a little bit of a period of now being up against some really tough comparisons last year and prior years and going into the headwinds just a really challenging market. So I think there is the biggest issue that's facing us there. I think as things start to improve, there's no reason why that business doesn't get back to a blended growth rate of closer to 6% to 7% to 8%, which we think we're very comfortable with and really, for that brand, there continues to be substantial opportunities for us to really directly control some of the emerging markets throughout Asia and in Latin America as well. So those are real opportunities for us as we go forward and none of that is really factored into the financial guidance that's given."

I think, fundamentally, we're dealing with somewhat of an unprecedented situation, given the volatility and the speed of some of these declines.

I think, fundamentally, we're dealing with somewhat of an unprecedented situation, given the volatility and the speed of some of these declines. The euro moves from parity at one point in 2002 to $1.35 and has in 4 months, has gone from $1.35 to just above parity just a couple of days ago. So it's been a shockingly fast move, which you don't usually expect to see in currency markets. So we really are trying to pull all the levers as we think about 2016. We're also trying not to overreact to situation. We're clearly looking at potentially certain markets from more local production, that would be particularly for Europe, where we'd like to see 1,000 basis point increase potentially in some of our local production that goes on. So instead of being around 30% potentially moving to 40%, that does come with higher average cost that we experienced in 2014 and '15. But at the same time, gives us speed to market and efficiencies that we might be able to take advantage of. Leveraging our overall purchasing power with our vendor base, trying to be more efficient there, that will clearly be a level we look at. Opportunistically increasing average unit retail. That's the one that we're really focused on, looking at, we're trying to understand the competitive set there. We're also trying to understand market by market where we have the potential to raise prices, given the fragility of the European market, especially it feels in the short term like what we need to move cautiously as we're really start to experiment with raising prices. But we will be looking at it very closely. And then, lastly, looking at expense controls across the board everywhere. We clearly understand the situation we're in and we need to manage against that. So I think we're really trying to focus on all of those points as we move forward with a real balance to say we need to continue to invest in our brand so that we could drive long-term growth and the starts as what hopefully some of these currency headwinds starts to turn around over the next 2 years."

Our sportswear businesses, I'll talk about that specifically. We continue there to see good results, particularly with the IZOD business and the launch at Kohl's continued strongly. I think you'll see operating margin improvement there and some sales increases. But the retail trends right now, first 6 months, 6 [ph] weeks of the quarter, has been very satisfying to see what's been going on in our own stores and at retail, what we're seeing. Our dress shirt business for us, that was just a huge disappointment. It's that's just not an area where we should be missing. I mean, we are the dominant player. It is a tough category, but we at corporate some inventory and some movement of excess goods though we shouldn't have gotten. That's been addressed, that's behind us. And I think you'll start to see that business in '15 getting back to its historical levels of profitability. The real challenging business in that whole heritage component has historically been our retail direct-to-consumer business in North America. And we addressed that over the last 2 years with the close down of the Bass business and now, the close down of the IZOD retail business, both representing a little bit over $300 million in sales at breakeven operating businesses. So the efficiency is that we're gaining from that, we'll start to manifest itself in '15 and in '16. So a much more efficient business model. Historically, our wholesale business have been 10%, 11% operating margins. Even last year, in a very challenging market, we were over 8%. So -- and believe we have get closer to 9% this year with the whole retail double-digit level second half of this year. It's a focus area for us. We clearly manage that business from a cash flow point of view with little investment going into the heritage businesses besides working capital and some minor support for the brands that's required and we're able to take that cash flow from those businesses and reinvest it back into a high margin, high-growth Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses. So that strategy just continues."

It should continue. But I don't like quoting percentages because sometimes, it's not unlikely international business where an order is really something that stood behind and moves out. I think here, it's really, it's more of a retail business for us. We really have to manage itself. How does focus on how we're doing we do now and that's manifest. I think the Calvin Klein business overall, in North America, is up double digits from a sales point of view in the fourth quarter. That's really been a strong performance for us and it's really being driven by outside performance of the underwear business. The Men's as the bigger business just driving that. But also, women's also coming on very strong and really enhancing the overall brand presentation has been a big winner for us. So the underwear business double-digit increases in our wholesale business, the jeans business overall and the Men's Sportswear business up mid to high single-digits for us as we move forward. That trend hopefully will continue. It's going to be driven principally out of a lot of reorder, where training this that we are, the supply chain is set up this way to really active today and fulfill at a higher percentage as we go forward. So I think we're positioned really well. At retail, where we're seeing the shops go in. I think I mentioned we're looking at between 30% and 40% store on store kind of retail increases. That doesn't translate fully into wholesale sales increases, but it does higher margin, higher profitability, less markdown and allowance support as we go forward. At the same time, what you're seeing when you look at the overall business is that we're really eliminating both in the off-price channel, not eliminating, but significantly reducing the amount of off-price and clearance goods that go into the off-price channel, but also the sell in of promotional items into the full priced strategy as well. So we're really trying to enhance that overall business, and it's the only way to then drive the profitability of that business. So as we keep our inventories clean and with the ability to react on an easy basis on core product, I think it's all very healthy for us as we go forward."

The only region that's been soft in Asia for Tommy, as well as Calvin, has really been the Korean market, which has its own economic issue surrounding it. So really, the opportunity in Southeast Asia, the opportunity in China and clearly, in the long term, the opportunity in Latin America for the Tommy brand potentially should be running those businesses more directly, either through direct operations or potentially, with a strategic partner in a joint venture situation, really gives us tremendous amount of flexibility and we believe the best way to capture the growth in those regions."

The bridge opportunity, particularly on the women's side, which is the -- which would be the big sales opportunity potential, I think the strategy in-house has been reestablish the jeans business, reestablish our casual sportswear business throughout Europe, get that operating on a level that we're comfortable that we can deliver again, and then when that is at a level we get to introduce the bridge product. You really want to introduce that product when the brand has got strength, full strength at retail when you have the operating platforms in place to support it and we don't want to get ahead of ourselves and start to create short-term losses in a business that either will be -- that is very challenging in that market so I believe there's a real opportunity there. I think it's an easier road on the men's side and the women's side. So our focus will be in the next 3 years, underwear, jeans, accessories and then men's sportswear, along with a tailored component in men's dress shirt, suitings, comparable to what we do in Tommy. After that business is much more secured and established, we'll look at the bridge opportunity in Europe. As far as forecasting the growth, I don't think -- again, I can't feel that when I say this is I can't forecast to you with all the currencies ups and downs. But when we look at the underlying fundamentals of the business, we continue to target high single-digit growth somewhere between 7% and 8% top line growth, any kind of growth like that on a local currency basis will drive double-digit revenue growth. have to deal with the vagaries of each of the market the macro dynamics that's going on. But fundamentally, looking at the opportunity for the Calvin Klein brand is no reason that the brand, given its growth prospects globally, that, that brand shouldn't continue to grow at that kind of level overall. I think North America will be somewhat smaller just because it's as well developed as it is and where the opportunities are. And clearly, the opportunities in Europe, Asia and Latin America are closer to double-digit kind of growth. When you put it together, I think that's where we get that 7% to 8% target that we talked about that really should drive double-digit EBIT growth for the segment."

For Calvin, the strength really is the biggest growth that we're seeing on a percentage basis is the U.K., France and to German market, even though German market is challenging overall as a market, we're just significantly under develop their so the opportunity to take advantage of our infrastructure in Germany, where Tommy is by far the largest sportswear business in Germany, we really are able to take advantage of that strength to move Calvin Klein into that market. So I would say those are the 3 key markets for Calvin, where we see our challenges continues to be Italy, and continues -- and Russia, which for Calvin in particular, the Russian market, Moscow, that whole surrounding area, we have a very strong franchisee partner there and which is a very strong business for us. That business in 2015 is under pressure. So it's muting some of the growth. But even with that, you could see the kind of sales growth that we're talking about for the brand moving forward. On the Tommy side of the business, the most challenged market is Italy, followed by one of our bigger markets, which is Germany, which is flattish right now, given its extraordinarily high market share that we have there. I think we're actually, on a market share basis, growing as see as we talk about German apparel sales overall down about 3% last year. In that same period, our Tommy Hilfiger business was up about 2% to 2.5%. So I think we're growing. And as that economy hopefully improves, we should start to see some results there.

Our AURs in our men's sportswear business to just put it in comparison, is about $40 -- $45 out the door. And that's a full seasonal AUR, including clearance, markdowns, the ring out, the whole shebang, you would expect the jeans to be slightly less than that, more casual, much more of a T shirt business driven there. So anywhere between $38 to $40 for Calvin Klein would be a healthy business. So we need to move AURs 30% to 35% over the next 3 years to get to that level of profitability that we've achieved in every other product category that we operate in. So I always want to reiterate that the issue that we have in North America is not a brand issue, it's a product category issue that's under pressure on a macro basis and has been really mistreated as a product category from a quality level and the presentation. And we are just starting to make those investments and seeing we're just starting to see the turnaround in those businesses and when we, not to belabor it, but when we get the presentation, when we are able to show the product, we're clearly in Herald Square, we have a shop presentation that's comparable to everything else we have, we're clearly already delivering that $40 to $45 AUR. So for us, that's what we're going back to retail platforms and demanding more square footage, better doors, really improving our EDI replenishment capabilities with the jeans to really have a supply chain that supports jeans business.

I think we're at a moment in time. And since 2015 is really that transition year that we really need to look at that as we go forward and where we are in this moment in time is the priority has been, given the acquisition of Warnaco, paid down debt. And we've done that for 2 years, exceeded our expectations of paying down debt and targeting to pay down about $425 million of debt again this year, which I think is really critical important to position ourselves to grow to make those acquisitions that we were talking, that I've been talking about this morning. At the same time, the free cash flow of the business after the investment spending in persistent, in platforms in our CapEx expansion and our retail growth, and even if you coupled in debt repayment and a level of licensing acquisition that was rational year-by-year as opposed to a major acquisition in one chunk, presuming that way, we are generating ones all the integration restructuring that is behind us, we'll probably generate $500 million plus of free cash flow after those investments to pay down debt as we go out. So this year, I think the number will be $500 million. And it's really gives us the opportunity to look at potentially looking at stock buyback in 2015 going into '16, depending what the opportunities are out there from a strategic point of view. Our first priority will be to pay down, will be to invest and invest in licensing acquisitions once the balance sheet is squared away, which I think will be in '15. I hope that gives a little color of where we are. Okay. Operator, we'll take this as our last question please."

It's trying to drive healthy growth, not necessarily just to drive growth at the expense of brand or brand positioning in the market, or authenticity with the consumer, we want to be a full priced, particularly in Europe, we want to be a full priced retail resource. There's a lot of competitors out there that trying to grow in that market and you're seeing an over expansion into the outlet business and an over expansion into the off-price and promotional business. And I think that feels good in the short term because that could be a really profitable business. And we saw what happens with that Warnaco deploy that strategy in 2006 and 2007 and reported great financial results and really just completely damaged the Calvin Klein Jeans business in Europe and in North America. So the short-term gains to be gotten by doing that, that's not a gain we want to play in Europe or internationally at all. We're not really wide. We understand how to make money. We understand what our responsibilities are. But going overboard in that area just to drive some incremental growth that will come back to buy the slate is not an area where we want to be."

I think on the denim the side, on the men's side in denim business has stabilized from a category point of view. And I believe you're starting to see some positive trends in men's denim. I can't say that for women's. We're seeing some growth and we're seeing some positive results. But I think as a category at best, the business is flattish overall. And we see most competitors, I think they really continue to talk about negative growth and what's going on. So space is being reallocated in some cases. So it's critical that as given our historical position in denim with Calvin Klein jeans, the brand started the designer jeans craze, we need to really be an authority on department store floor in North America. And I think we are reestablishing ourselves in that area on the men's side and on the women's side. And I think the load is got some challenges in North America on the women's side because of the category. But I believe on the men's side, we're really start to see some overall improvement.

Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call this morning is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Senior Vice President in charge of business development and investor relationships; and Ken Duane, the CEO of our Heritage businesses and our North American Wholesale businesses. 
Overall, we were quite pleased with our fourth quarter results, which matched the top end of our earnings guidance despite the highly challenging market environment and foreign currency headwinds. 
In the fourth quarter, on a constant currency basis, revenues increased 5% and EPS grew 30%. Mike Shaffer will take you through the details of the financials for the quarter and our guidance and he'll also highlight some of the issues surrounding foreign currencies, which I know there is a lot of interest in. 
I'm going to get into the business right now and talk about Calvin Klein. 
In the fourth quarter, revenues, on a constant currency basis, increased 6% while earnings increased about 9%, driven by strong sales performance in our North American business and higher international operating margins due to the elimination of clearance and off-price sales in Europe and Asia. 
Moving in to the first quarter. We have seen a significant improvement in our international sales trends. Retail comp store sales are running ahead of plan in the first quarter and trending up high single digits in Asia with particular strength in China and Southeast Asia. We are also seeing high single-digit increases in our European businesses on a comp store basis, so both regions really performing much stronger for us. 
In Europe, the CK wholesale business continues to improve with our 2015 spring and fall order books, excluding Russia, up about 10% over the prior year. In North America, our CK retail comps are running on plan, up low single digits. We are seeing strong sales in our domestic permanent population stores while our stores located in international tourist destinations, like Miami, Orlando, New York and Las Vegas are feeling the pressure from the weaker international tourist traffic, which we believe is a direct result of the strengthening U.S. dollar's impact on international travel to the U.S. 
Focusing now on some of the Calvin Klein brand initiatives and update. Our Calvin Klein jeans and underwear marketing initiatives have focused on reaching new consumers over the last 12 months. We have increasingly invested in and focused on our digital outreach through our #mycalvinkleins campaign and our subsequent extension of that campaign with our spring 2015 Calvin Klein jeans and underwear campaigns featuring Justin Bieber and Lara Stone, which launched in January. We have seen a significant increase in the number of fans since the launch and we have generated well over 13 million fan interactions to date. From a business perspective, this has allowed Calvin Klein to engage with our existing and new customers and has helped to drive purchases of the brand. 
Further to the initial #mycalvins campaign, the spring 2015 campaign featuring Justin Bieber was the #11 global trending topic on Twitter at launch. We have seen traffic more than double on calvinklein.com and the campaign in the first 2 weeks achieved over $350 million of publicity value. We believe the campaign has helped to continue to fuel the momentum that we are seeing in our jeans and underwear businesses globally. 
From a product point of view, I'm going to focus on Calvin Klein underwear first. We have delivered new core product along with significantly improved and elevated packaging. We have launched 2 new men's programs globally, Intense Power and Air FX, for spring 2015 and have seen very promising initial selling results. As a reminder, Intense Power is what Justin Bieber was featured in and has sold well at retail. Air FX is more of a performance underwear, which taps into what is happening more broadly in the active arena. 
In the women's area, our Modern Cotton logo initiative leverages the best of what Calvin Klein underwear does for men's and translates it for women's with an active appeal. Modern Cotton continues to drive the improvement in our women's business in North America and Europe. 
We have also continued investing in our point-of-sale presentation with new graphics and new fixtures. In addition, we have upgraded and installed new shops in key markets in the U.S., in New York, Miami, the West Coast in California in San Francisco. Additionally, we have installed new shops and stores internationally in key markets throughout Europe and Asia. 
In the U.S. over the last 6 months, our men's and women's businesses have picked up market share across the department store landscape. Average unit retails continue to be up about 10% year-over-year, driven by full price selling of the new product launches. Overall, underwear sales are running up high single digits at retail in the first quarter. 
In Europe, men's continues to outperform with the women's performance driven by elevated fashion components added to the business. Overall, sales in the first quarter are running up mid-single digits at retail. 
In Asia, we continue to see great performance on elevated Back Label product across both men's and women's. Our women's bra business in Asia continues to outperform every other region, and the Perfectly Fit collection for women's is ranked as the #1 or #2 performing collection in all key Asian regions. Overall sales in the first quarter are running up high single digits at retail. 
Moving to our Calvin Klein jeans. In the jeans area, new product has been delivered and we have seen a good reaction from consumers, particularly where we have installed new jeans shops. In North America, we have installed 225 shops in 2014, 150 men's shops and 75 women's shops. In the newly installed shops, we have experienced a 40% retail sales increase over the prior year. Fall 2014 AURs were up about 15% and that trend has continued into the first quarter of 2015. 
We are targeting 150 new shops installations in North America for fiscal 2015. 
In Europe, we are in early stages of a turnaround in the jeans business. We have installed over 60 new jeans shops throughout Europe. We have significantly improved the quality level of our jeans line with better fabrics, trims and packaging. We are effectively out of all off-price retailers in Europe beginning in the first quarter of 2015. We have closed approximately 40 underperforming stores over the last 18 months. We have opened 11 Calvin Klein jeans freestanding stores in the second half of 2014. 
During the first quarter of 2015, we are renovating our stores in London, Rome, Venice and Milan to our new jeans concept shops and we expect them to open in the second quarter of '15. 
The jeans business in Europe is seeing improved sell-throughs and higher AURs in the first quarter with growth across all markets with the exception of Russia. At wholesale, our 2015 European order books, excluding Russia, are up about 10% over the prior year. 
Moving on to Tommy Hilfiger. On a constant currency basis, revenues for the Tommy Hilfiger business increased 9% for the fourth quarter while operating earnings on a constant currency grew 10%. In North America, we posted a 1% comparable store sales increase. And as we moved into the first quarter, comp sales trends have basically continued at this level, running about flat to date, primarily driven by lower international tourist traffic in those key centers while domestic permanent population centers are running up low single digits as well. 
At wholesale, our European business continues to outpace the competition. As an indicator, our 2015 European order book x Russia is running up about 5% compared to the prior year. 
Internationally, we have seen growth on a constant currency basis throughout our international business. The growth in the fourth quarter was driven by strong -- our strong European business, both at wholesale and retail. The European retail comp stores increased 6% in the fourth quarter. As we move into the first quarter, comps are on plan running up low single digits quarter-to-date. 
From a brand perspective, the Tommy -- for the Tommy Hilfiger brand, we continue to focus on driving the brand globally through elevated product development and engaging marketing campaigns. In 2014, we successfully launched our new Tommy Hilfiger e-commerce site, which we believe effectively integrates commerce and brand experience. Since the new site has launched, we have seen a significant increase in traffic and consumer engagement on our site, which has resulted in strong growth in our fourth quarter e-commerce sales. We continue to evolve our consumer engagement through increased digital marketing and media spend. 
As we focus on driving some of our key brand initiatives, including growing our underdeveloped Tommy Tailored business and our Tommy Underwear business, we recently announced that Rafael Nadal will be our brand ambassador for the fall marketing campaign. This campaign will focus on those key -- 2 key product categories, tailored and men's underwear, which we believe we have significant growth opportunities to capture. 
Moving to our Heritage business. Our Heritage business had a difficult fourth quarter with revenues down 3%, principally driven by poor performance of our dress shirt business. Operating income declined $12 million in the fourth quarter, as clearance markdowns were required to balance inventories and clear excess goods. We believe this dress shirt issue is behind us as we enter 2015 and we will begin to see this business turn around in fiscal 2015. 
Moving into the first quarter. Our sportswear businesses have continued to perform with retail comps running up about mid-single digits quarter-to-date. 
Before I turn it over to Mike, I just want to focus on the key initiatives as we move forward. As we move over the next 3 years, our key objective will be capturing the long-term revenue and profit opportunities for our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands. There are really 5 key initiatives that we hope to accomplish over the next 3 years and that you should be monitoring as we go forward. The first is to continue to invest in product, presentation and the marketing of the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands. Second, we continue to invest in our global operating platforms to support our growth strategies, including key investments in our digital commerce systems and platforms. Third, significantly improving the operating results of the Calvin Klein European business over the next 3 years so that it is comparable to the strong operating performance of our Tommy Hilfiger business in Europe. Fourth, continue to invest in the expansion of our presence in Asia and Latin America for both Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein as we see these markets as our greatest growth opportunities for the brands. And finally, assuming more direct control over our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger's license businesses over the next 3 years where we can maximize our core competencies through increased sales and our overall profitability. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Mike to quantify the fourth quarter results and to put more color on some of the guidance that we gave."

I'm going to briefly touch on the fourth quarter of 2014 and move on to 2015. 
Our overall 2014 revenues were close to planned, and excluding the impact of foreign currency, a strong growth in our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses was offset by a decline in our Heritage business. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 9% on a constant currency basis in the quarter with strong wholesale performance in North America. In Europe, Tommy Hilfiger retail posted 6% comps, combining the square footage expansion while the wholesale business recorded mid-single-digit growth. 
Calvin Klein also had a strong quarter with revenues up 6% on a constant currency basis, driven in large part by North America wholesale, in particular, our underwear business. 
In addition, both Tommy and Calvin experienced increases in the fourth quarter operating margins versus the prior year. 
Heritage revenues were down 3% for the quarter due to poor performance in our dress shirt division. Within our dress shirt business, the shortfall in revenue was coupled with a decline in gross margin due to heavy markdowns as a result of excess inventory levels, which significantly lowered our Heritage operating margins. 
Benefiting the fourth quarter versus the prior year and our guidance was a decrease in the tax rate driven by discrete items. 
Overall, we delivered earnings per share growth of 23% even with the $0.10 per share negative impact from foreign currency exchange. 
As we look to 2015, we need to take a moment to understand the mix of our businesses' revenues and earnings and the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar. 
As we called out in our press release, our earnings before unallocated U.S. corporate expenses are about 2/3 international with heavy -- which heavily exposes us to exchange rate fluctuations on both a transaction and translational basis. Our exposure at a transactional level is mostly due to our international divisions purchasing their inventory in U.S. dollars. To partially protect against this, we bought forward exchange contracts about 9 to 12 months out for about 80% of our projected inventory purchases made by our international division in U.S. dollars. 
Our exposure at a translation level is due to converting the revenue and earnings of our international divisions into U.S. dollars. Like most companies, we do not hedge translation and we don't believe we should begin gambling on currency fluctuations. 
In 2015, we are anticipating, based on current exchange rates, that we will be impacted negatively by about $1.20 of earnings per share for foreign exchange. The $1.20 impact is approximately 2/3 driven by translation and 1/3 driven by transaction. Our largest currency exposures are the euro, the Canadian dollar and the Brazilian real. 
In addition to the impact of the strengthening dollar, the turbulent economic and political issues in Russia are projected to reduce earnings in our Russian business by about $0.10. The business remains profitable, but at a much lower level than in the prior year. Going forward, we'll be discussing these impacts when material and offering a constant currency view of our operations to measure the true health of our business. 
For the full year 2015, we are projecting earnings per share at $6.75 to $6.90. If we exclude the negative impact of FX in Russia of $1.30, we have earnings per share growth of 10% to 12% over the prior year. 
Overall, we're projecting revenues approximately $7.9 billion, which includes a negative impact of over $500 million related to foreign currency. On a constant currency basis, we are projecting revenues to increase about 3%. 
Overall, operating margins are expected to increase about 20 to 30 basis points, excluding a negative impact of about 60 basis points due to FX. Driving the growth when excluding foreign currency is continued improvement in the Calvin business, which is projecting revenues to grow 5% on a constant currency basis. We are also planning Calvin Klein operating margins to increase 30 to 50 basis points, excluding a negative impact of 20 basis points of FX. 
Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 3% on a constant currency basis with operating margins planned relatively flat, excluding a negative impact of approximately 100 basis points of FX. 
Our Heritage business is planned to have a revenue decrease of 4% due mostly to exiting the IZOD retail business in 2015. Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to increase about 60 to 80 basis points as our wholesale business continues to show gross margin improvements, particularly in dress shirts. The impact of foreign currency in our Heritage business is immaterial. 
Interest expense for the year is planned to be between $100 million (sic) [ $120 million ] and $125 million compared to the prior year amount of $139 million due to our average lower debt balances. Also favorably impacting interest for 2015 is the debt refinancing we did in the second half of last year's first quarter. 
Our tax rate for the year is planned at about 22%, which is mostly in line with the prior year. 
First quarter earnings per share are planned at $1.35 to $1.40 and include $0.30 of estimated negative impact of foreign exchange and the decline in our Russian business. Excluding this impact, we're expecting earnings per share to increase 12% to 16% for the first quarter. 
Revenue in the first quarter is projected to increase 2% on a constant currency basis. Tommy Hilfiger's revenues are planned at 2% constant currency increase and Calvin Klein is planned at a 3% constant currency increase. Heritage Brand's revenues are projected to decrease 1%. 
Interest expense is projected to be $30 million and taxes to be about 25% to 26% in the first quarter. And lastly, we currently expect debt paydown to be at least $425 million in 2015. 
And with that, we'll open it up for questions."

So we really are turning the percentages upside down. We're really trying to drive growing full price selling and at the same time taking market share. I believe when you look at the business where you'll see that manifest itself in the Calvin Klein North America business is, on a constant currency basis, seeing operating margins continuing to improve in that business as we go forward and we'll be reporting at retail with our key department store accounts the fact that we're seeing strong sell-throughs of that product. Hopefully, you'll also be seeing, because I know you shop, you'll also be seeing in North America a much more elevated presentation at retail with our key accounts, Macy's, Lord & Taylor and Dillard's, both in the jeans and the underwear area. And overall, you should be seeing higher average unit retails going out the door. In our international businesses, it's probably even more transparent because a bigger component of that business for us is direct to consumer where we are in control of both the environment and the selling space, so we report those results on a retail basis. So I think, there, the business, particularly in Asia, which is a highly profitable business model, there it should be on top line growth in both of those categories as we go forward and we're starting to see that in the first quarter this year with a real enhancement of product as we have rebalanced more a selling into the full price area away from clearance and promotional sales. That comparison in Asia is pretty much behind us now so we're really getting an apples-to-apples comparison beginning in 2015. So for us, that will be the driver. In Europe, continuing to focus on the order book, continuing to see our price points increase at retail and our presentation across-the-board on the Calvin Klein brand. So I think that profitability will be very transparent when we report results."

But when you really get into the fundamentals of the business, what's really driving it, that's a very healthy business, both jeans, underwear, all product categories in those 2 regions of the world. So I believe the enhancements that you will see will be, hopefully on a local currency basis, you'll see some continued operating margin improvement for which you really should start to see beginning in '15 and some top line growth as we've eliminated the off-price clearance sales that existed in the business. In the U.S. and European businesses, both of those businesses are basically a breakeven for jeans business model for us today. So we clearly believe that we have the opportunity there to bring those margins over the next 4 to 5 years to approach 10%. Every other Calvin Klein business that we run in those -- in Europe and in North America are running at double-digit operating margins for us. So it's really cleaning up the problems of the past, getting the brand presented, making those investments the last 18 months and continuing that into this year, but each year seeing an improvement in the operating margins of those businesses as we go forward, so that when we get over the next 3 to 4 years, we'll start to approach those double-digit operating margins for jeans in Europe and North America."

I think from a macro point of view, we've -- we're really dealing with some headwinds going forward. The Tommy business -- the strength of the Tommy business has been its geographic diversity and the strong brand positioning and the strong operating and financial characteristics that the European business carries. I think, fundamentally, when you think what's going on with currencies around the world in Europe in particular, but Brazil as well, 2 big markets for both Calvin and Tommy, but in particular the Tommy in Europe, there's a reason those currencies are under so much pressure. The underlying economic statistics there are just feeling the pressure. So it's the fact that our order book is running up mid-single digits, 4% to 6% depending on the season, in and of itself is disappointing to us when you look on it on a historic basis where we've had double-digit increases in 2010, '11 and '12. But clearly, from what's going on from a macro point of view, we feel we are substantially getting market share during the same time frame. But that doesn't change the dynamic that's going on that we're only planning our comps to grow low single digits in Europe and we're planning the wholesale business to also grow in that 2% to 4% range for the second half of the year. So Tommy has consistently surprised us on the upside with their results and we're in a little bit of a period of now being up against some really tough comparisons last year and prior years and going into the headwinds of just a really challenging market. So I think that's the biggest issue that's facing us there. I think as things start to improve, there's no reason why that business doesn't get back to a blended growth rate of closer to 6% to 7% to 8%, which we think we're very comfortable with. And really, for that brand, there continues to be substantial opportunities for us to really directly control some of the emerging markets throughout Asia and in Latin America as well. So those are real opportunities for us as we go forward and none of that is really factored into the financial guidance that we've given."

I think, fundamentally, we're dealing with somewhat of an unprecedented situation given the volatility and the speed of some of these declines. The euro moves from parity at one point in 2002 to $1.35 and has, in 4 months, has gone from $1.35 to just above parity just a couple of days ago. So it's been a shockingly fast move, which you don't usually expect to see in currency markets. So we really are trying to pull all the levers as we think about 2016. We're also trying not to overreact to the situation. So we're clearly looking at potentially certain markets for more local production. That would be particularly for Europe, where we'd like to see 1,000 basis point increase potentially in some of our local production that goes on, so instead of being around 30%, potentially moving to 40%. That does come with higher average costs than we experienced in 2014 and '15, but at the same time gives us speed to market and efficiencies that we might be able to take advantage of. Leveraging our overall purchasing power with our vendor base, trying to be more efficient there, that will clearly be a lever we'll look at. Opportunistically increasing average unit retail, that's the one that we're really focused on, we're looking at. We're trying to understand the competitive set there. We're also trying to understand market by market where we have the potential to raise prices given the fragility of the European market, especially it feels in the short term like we need to move cautiously as we really start to experiment with raising prices, but we will be looking at it very closely. And then, lastly, looking at expense controls across-the-board everywhere. We clearly understand the situation we're in and we need to manage against that. So I think we're really trying to focus on all of those points as we move forward with a real balance to say we need to continue to invest in our brand so that we could drive long-term growth and this starts as we've -- as hopefully some of these currency headwinds start to turn around over the next 2 years."

Look, our sportswear businesses, I'll talk about that specifically, we continue there to see good results, particularly with the IZOD business, the launch at Kohl's continues strongly. I think you'll see operating margin improvement there and some sales increases. But the retail trends right now, the first 6 months -- 6 weeks of the quarter, has been very satisfying to see what's been going on in our own stores and at retail what we're seeing. Our dress shirt business for us, that was just a huge disappointment. That's just not an area where we should be missing. I mean, we are the dominant player. It is a tough category, but we got caught with some inventory and some movement of excess goods that we shouldn't have gotten caught with. That's been addressed, that's behind us and I think you'll start to see that business in '15 getting back to its historical levels of profitability. The real challenging business in that whole Heritage component has historically been our retail direct-to-consumer business in North America and we addressed that over the last 2 years with the closedown of the Bass business and now the closedown of the IZOD retail business, both representing a little bit over $300 million in sales at break-even operating businesses. So the efficiencies that we're gaining from that will start to manifest itself in '15 and in '16, so a much more efficient business model. Historically, our wholesale businesses have been at 10%, 11% operating margins. Even last year, in a very challenging market, we were over 8% so -- and believe we'll get closer to 9% this year with the hope to reach that double-digit level second half of this year. So it's a focus area for us. We clearly manage that business from a cash flow point of view with little investment going into the Heritage businesses besides working capital and some minor support for the brands that's required and we're able to take that cash flow from those businesses and reinvest it back into our high-margin, high-growth Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses. So that strategy just continues."

Joan, I'm very cautious whenever I talk about the North American order book because given the customer composition and the immediate cancellation of orders and margin support, suffice it to say it's very strong. It should continue. But I don't like quoting percentages because sometimes I'm not -- it's not -- unlike the international business where an order is really something that stood behind and moves out, I think, here, it's really -- it's more like a retail business for us. We really have to manage it. So I'll just focus on how we're doing at retail and that's manifest. I think the Calvin Klein business, overall, in North America, was up double digits from a sales point of view in the fourth quarter. That's really been a strong performance for us and it's really being driven by outside performance of the underwear business. The men's, as the bigger business, is just driving that, but also women's also coming on very strong and really enhancing the overall brand presentation has been a big winner for us. So the underwear business, double-digit increases in our wholesale business; the jeans business overall and the men's sportswear business, up mid to high single digits for us as we move forward, that trend we hopefully will continue. It's going to be driven principally out of a lot of reorder we're planning for the business that we are -- the supply chain is set up this way to really react to that today and fulfill at a greater -- at a higher percentage as we go forward. So I think we're positioned really well. At retail where we see the shops go in, I think I mentioned we're looking at between 30% and 40% store-on-store kind of retail increases. That doesn't translate fully into wholesale sales increases, but it does higher margin, higher profitability, less markdown and allowance support as we go forward. At the same time, what you're seeing when you look at the overall business is that we're really eliminating both in the off-price channel -- not eliminating, but significantly reducing the amount of off-price and clearance goods that are going to the off-price channel, but also the sell-in of promotional items into the full priced strategy as well. So we're really trying to enhance that overall business and it's the only way to then drive the profitability of that business. So as we keep our inventories clean and with an ability to react on an EDI basis on core product, I think it's all very healthy for us as we go forward."

The only region that's been soft in Asia for Tommy, as well as Calvin has really been the Korea market, which has its own economic issue surrounding it. So really the opportunity in Southeast Asia, the opportunity in China, and clearly, even more long term, the opportunity in Latin America for the Tommy brand potentially should be running those businesses more directly either through direct operations or potentially with a strategic partner in a joint venture situation really gives us tremendous amount of flexibility and we believe the best way to capture the growth in those regions."

Let me, I think -- let me take the first -- the last part first because it's the easier part of the question. On the bridge opportunity, particularly on the women's side, which is the -- which would be the big sales opportunity potential, I think the strategy in-house has been reestablish the jeans business, reestablish our casual sportswear business throughout Europe, get that operating on a level that we're comfortable that we can deliver again. And then when that is at a level, begin to introduce the bridge product. You really want to introduce that product when the brand has got strength, full strength at retail, when you have the operating platforms in place to support it and we don't want to get ahead of ourselves and start to create short-term losses in a business that will be even -- will be -- that is very challenging in that market. So I believe there's a real opportunity there. I think it's an easier road on the men's side and the women's side. So our focus will be in the next 3 years, underwear, jeans, accessories and then men's sportswear along with the tailored component in men's dress shirt suitings comparable to what we do in Tommy. After that, the business is much more secured and established, we'll look at the bridge opportunity in Europe. As far as forecasting the growth, I don't think -- again, I can't deal with the --- when I say this is I can't forecast to you with all the currencies ups and downs. But when we look at the underlying fundamentals of the business, we continue to target high single-digit growth somewhere between 7% and 8% top line growth. Any kind of growth like that on a local currency basis will drive double-digit revenue growth. Have to deal with the vagaries of each of the market, the macro dynamics that are going on, but fundamentally, looking at the opportunity for the Calvin Klein brand, there's no reason that the brand, given its growth prospects globally, that, that brand shouldn't continue to grow at that kind of level overall. I think North America will be somewhat smaller just because it's as well developed as it is and where the opportunities are. And clearly, the opportunities in Europe, Asia and Latin America are closer to double-digit kind of growth. When you put it together, I think that's where we get that 7% to 8% target that we talk about that really should drive double-digit EBIT growth for the segment."

For Calvin, the strength really is -- the biggest growth that we're seeing on a percentage basis is the U.K., France and the German market. Even though the German market is challenging overall as a market, we're just significantly underdeveloped there so the opportunity to take advantage of our infrastructure in Germany where Tommy is, by far, the largest sportswear business in Germany, we really are able to take advantage of that strength to move Calvin Klein into that market. So I would say those are the 3 key markets for Calvin. Where we see challenges continues to be Italy and continues -- and Russia, which for Calvin in particular, the Russia market, Moscow, that whole surrounding area, we have a very strong franchisee partner there and which is a very strong business for us. That business in 2015 is under pressure. So it's muting some of the growth. But even with that, you could see the kind of sales growth that we're talking about for the brand moving forward. On the Tommy side of the business, the most challenged market is Italy, followed by one of our bigger markets, which is Germany, which is flattish right now given its extraordinarily high market share that we have there. I think we're actually, on a market share basis, growing. I've seen statistics that talk about German apparel sales overall down about 3% last year. In that same period, our Tommy Hilfiger business was up about 2% to 2.5%. So I think we're growing. And as that economy hopefully improves, we should start to see some results there. So that's the 2 brands that's how I would describe what's going on."

We are, percentage-wise, I can quote you we're up 20%. But reality is in that business we're approaching $30 today, both men's and women's, which is very good progress for where we are, so we need to be closer to $40. Our AURs in our men's sportswear business, to just put it in comparison, is about $45 out the door and that's a full seasonal AUR, including clearance, markdowns zeroing out, the whole shebang. You would expect the jeans to be slightly less than that, more casual, much more of a T-shirt business driven there. So anywhere between $38 to $40 for Calvin Klein would be a healthy business. So we need to move AURs 30% to 35% over the next 3 years to get to that level of profitability that we've achieved in every other product category that we operate in. So I always want to reiterate that the issue that we have in North America is not a brand issue, it's a product category issue that's under pressure on a macro basis and has been really mistreated as a product category from a quality level and a presentation and we're just starting to make those investments and seeing -- we're just starting to see the turnaround in those businesses. And when we, not to belabor it, but when we get the presentation, when we are able to show the product, we're clearly in Herald Square, we have a shop presentation that's comparable to everything else we have, we're clearly already delivering that $40 to $45 AUR. So for us, that's what we're going back to our retail partners and demanding more square footage, better doors, really improving our EDI replenishment capabilities with jeans to really have a supply chain that supports our jeans business. So a lot of building blocks that are there and some still getting there, but I believe over the next 12 months we're really making headwind. And hopefully, as each quarter progresses, I can continue to be optimistic about where we're heading with that business."

So the opportunity for us is to bring that business in-house. It's not all retail business. It's probably about 50-50 retail, wholesale. So I would say the sales basis is probably closer to become $50 million. And we believe that our licensing partners are operating in the range of somewhere around at least a 10% operating margin. We believe we probably could enhance that just given scale and size and the synergies that would exist with the existing Calvin Klein businesses in those territories from a clearly a back office synergy point of view, not a front-of-house synergy. So those are -- that's the opportunity that we potentially see. We believe those businesses can be bought at attractive prices considering where the market is and considering where currencies are today. So we think, obviously, those would be accretive transactions with brand -- with 2 brands that we clearly understand, in markets that we clearly understand as well. So from a risk profile, I think it would be a lower risk kind of acquisition as well. So I think that's where our focus in the use of our cash over the next 3 years will really be."

Are there things that hold the margin back?

Before we start projecting that, we'd like to see a little bit more time. It's really 6 weeks, 7 weeks and we like to see a little bit more time understanding Easter shift, what's going on, understanding -- in North America, one of the biggest challenges we're dealing with and I think you'll probably hear more of this as more retailers start to report is how this international tourism is really impacting all retail sales, particularly if you have big stores in key cities in the United States be it Northeast, Florida, Vegas, the West Coast, I think you're going to probably hear from every major retailer that attracts the international tourists in North America that, that business in those markets will be under pressure while we perceive at the same time the permanent population centers, the Midwest, the north -- the Mid-Atlantic, the West Coast outside of L.A. and San Francisco and then the whole Southern tier of country, Texas and whatever, those businesses are actually pretty strong indicating that the local consumer there is doing well. So it's balancing that in North America as well as we go forward, especially with this Easter shift it's very hard to read.

I think it would give us a better sense as we start to look at cost of product going out for the fourth quarter of 2015 and beyond, that story hasn't been written yet and we're in the midst of that as we go forward, particularly since we're a January year-end. So that's -- all those things are really stopping us at this point from -- potentially, if the world was normal and we were talking -- instead of talking about currency this way, we were just talking about $8-plus of earnings per share growth if currencies were leveled, I think you'd see a different posture from a management team and I don't think it would just be us.

And where we are in this moment in time is the priority has been, given the acquisition of Warnaco, paid down debt and we've done that for 2 years, exceeded our expectations of paying down debt and targeting to pay down about $425 million of debt again this year, which I think is really critically important to position ourselves to grow to make those acquisitions that we were talking -- that I've been talking about this morning. At the same time, the free cash flow of the business after the investment spending in -- for systems and platforms and our CapEx expenses and our retail growth and even if you coupled in debt repayment and a level of licensing acquisition that was rational year-by-year as opposed to a major acquisition in one chunk, presented that way, we are generating, once all the integration and restructuring now is behind us, we're probably generating $500 million-plus of free cash flow after those investments to pay down debt as we go out. So this year, I think the number will be $500 million and it really gives us the opportunity to look at potentially looking at stock buyback end of 2015 going into '16, depending what the opportunities are out there from a strategic point of view. Our first priority will be to pay down -- will be to invest and invest in licensing acquisitions once the balance sheet is squared away, which I think it will be in '15. So I hope that gives a little color of where we are."

And I think that feels good in the short term because that could be a really profitable business and we saw what happens with that. Warnaco deployed that strategy in 2006 and 2007 and reported great financial results and really just completely damaged the Calvin Klein jeans business in Europe and in North America. So there are short-term gains to be gotten by doing that, but that's not a game we want to play in Europe or internationally at all. We're not lily white. We understand how to make money. We understand what our responsibilities are. But going overboard in that area just to drive some incremental growth that will come back to bite us later is not an area where we want to be."

I think, on the denim the side -- on the men's side in denim, the business has stabilized from a category point of view. And I believe you're starting to see some positive trends in men's denim. I can't say that for women's. We are seeing some growth and we're seeing some positive results. But I think as a category, at best, the business is flattish overall. And we see most competitors, I think they really continue to talk about negative growth in what's going on. So space is being reallocated in some cases. So it's critical that as -- given our historical position in denim with Calvin Klein jeans, the brand that started the designer jeans craze, we need to really be an authority on department store floor in America and I think we are reestablishing ourselves in that area on the men's side and on the women's side. And I think the road has got some challenges in North America on the women's side because of the category. But I believe on the men's side, we'll really start to see some overall improvement.

Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call this morning is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Senior Vice President in charge of business development and investor relationships; and Ken Duane, the CEO of our Heritage businesses and our North American Wholesale businesses. 
Overall, we were quite pleased with our fourth quarter results, which matched the top end of our earnings guidance despite the highly challenging market environment and foreign currency headwinds. 
In the fourth quarter, on a constant currency basis, revenues increased 5% and EPS grew 30%. Mike Shaffer will take you through the details of the financials for the quarter and our guidance and he'll also highlight some of the issues surrounding foreign currencies, which I know there is a lot of interest in. 
I'm going to get into the business right now and talk about Calvin Klein. 
In the fourth quarter, revenues, on a constant currency basis, increased 6% while earnings increased about 9%, driven by strong sales performance in our North American business and higher international operating margins due to the elimination of clearance and off-price sales in Europe and Asia. 
Moving in to the first quarter. We have seen a significant improvement in our international sales trends. Retail comp store sales are running ahead of plan in the first quarter and trending up high single digits in Asia with particular strength in China and Southeast Asia. We are also seeing high single-digit increases in our European businesses on a comp store basis, so both regions really performing much stronger for us. 
In Europe, the CK wholesale business continues to improve with our 2015 spring and fall order books, excluding Russia, up about 10% over the prior year. In North America, our CK retail comps are running on plan, up low single digits. We are seeing strong sales in our domestic permanent population stores while our stores located in international tourist destinations, like Miami, Orlando, New York and Las Vegas are feeling the pressure from the weaker international tourist traffic, which we believe is a direct result of the strengthening U.S. dollar's impact on international travel to the U.S. 
Focusing now on some of the Calvin Klein brand initiatives, an update. Our Calvin Klein jeans and underwear marketing initiatives have focused on reaching new consumers over the last 12 months. We have increasingly invested in and focused on our digital outreach through our #mycalvinkleins campaign and our subsequent extension of that campaign with our spring 2015 Calvin Klein jeans and underwear campaigns featuring Justin Bieber and Lara Stone, which launched in January. We have seen a significant increase in the number of fans since the launch and we have generated well over 13 million fan interactions to date. From a business perspective, this has allowed Calvin Klein to engage with our existing and new customers and has helped to drive purchases of the brand. 
Further to the initial #mycalvins campaign, the spring 2015 campaign featuring Justin Bieber was the #11 global trending topic on Twitter at launch. We have seen traffic more than double on calvinklein.com and the campaign in the first 2 weeks achieved over $350 million of publicity value. We believe the campaign has helped to continue to fuel the momentum that we are seeing in our jeans and underwear businesses globally. 
From a product point of view, I'm going to focus on Calvin Klein underwear first. We have delivered new core product along with significantly improved and elevated packaging. We have launched 2 new men's programs globally, Intense Power and Air FX, for spring 2015 and have seen very promising initial selling results. As a reminder, Intense Power is what Justin Bieber was featured in and has sold well at retail. Air FX is more of our performance underwear, which taps into what is happening more broadly in the active arena. 
In the women's area, our Modern Cotton logo initiative leverages the best of what Calvin Klein underwear does for men's and translates it for women's with an active appeal. Modern Cotton continues to drive the improvement in our women's business in North America and Europe. 
We have also continued investing in our point-of-sale presentations with new graphics and new fixtures. In addition, we have upgraded and installed new shops in key markets in the U.S., in New York, Miami, the West Coast in California, in San Francisco. Additionally, we have installed new shops and stores internationally in key markets throughout Europe and Asia. 
In the U.S. over the last 6 months, our men's and women's businesses have picked up market share across the department store landscape. Average unit retails continue to be up about 10% year-over-year, driven by full price selling of the new product launches. Overall, underwear sales are running up high single digits at retail in the first quarter. 
In Europe, men's continues to outperform with the women's performance driven by elevated fashion components added to the business. Overall, sales in the first quarter are running up mid-single digits at retail. 
In Asia, we continue to see great performance on the elevated Back Label product across both men's and women's. Our women's bra business in Asia continues to outperform every other region, and the Perfectly Fit collection for women's is ranked as the #1 or #2 performing collection in all key Asian regions. Overall sales in the first quarter are running up high single digits at retail. 
Moving to our Calvin Klein jeans. In the jeans area, new product has been delivered and we are seeing a good reaction from consumers, particularly where we have installed new jeans shops. In North America, we have installed 225 shops in 2014, 150 men's shops and 75 women's shops. In the newly installed shops, we have experienced a 40% retail sales increase over the prior year. Fall 2014 AURs were up about 15% and that trend has continued into the first quarter of 2015. 
We are targeting 150 new shops installations in North America for fiscal 2015. 
In Europe, we are in the early stages of a turnaround in the jeans business. We have installed over 60 new jeans shops throughout Europe. We have significantly improved the quality level of our jeans line with better fabrics, trims and packaging. We are effectively out of all off-price retailers in Europe beginning in the first quarter of 2015. We have closed approximately 40 underperforming stores over the last 18 months. We have opened 11 Calvin Klein jeans freestanding stores in the second half of 2014. 
During the first quarter of 2015, we are renovating our stores in London, Rome, Venice and Milan to our new jeans concept shops and we expect them to open in the second quarter of '15. 
The jeans business in Europe is seeing improved sell-throughs and higher AURs in the first quarter with growth across all markets with the exception of Russia. At wholesale, our 2015 European order books, excluding Russia, are up about 10% over the prior year. 
Moving on to Tommy Hilfiger. On a constant currency basis, revenues for the Tommy Hilfiger business increased 9% for the fourth quarter while operating earnings on a constant currency grew 10%. In North America, we posted a 1% comparable store sales increase. And as we've moved into the first quarter, comp sales trends have basically continued at this level, running about flat to date, primarily driven by lower international tourist traffic in those key centers while domestic permanent population centers are running up low single digits as well. 
At wholesale, our European business continues to outpace the competition. As an indicator, our 2015 European order book x Russia is running up about 5% compared to the prior year. 
Internationally, we have seen growth on a constant currency basis throughout our international business. The growth in the fourth quarter was driven by strong -- our strong European business, both at wholesale and retail. The European retail comp stores increased 6% in the fourth quarter. As we've moved into the first quarter, comps are on plan running up low single digits quarter-to-date. 
From a brand perspective, the Tommy -- for the Tommy Hilfiger brand, we continue to focus on driving the brand globally through elevated product development and engaging marketing campaigns. In 2014, we successfully launched our new Tommy Hilfiger e-commerce site, which we believe effectively integrates commerce and brand experience. Since the new site has launched, we have seen a significant increase in traffic and consumer engagement on our site, which has resulted in strong growth in our fourth quarter e-commerce sales. We continue to evolve our consumer engagement through increased digital marketing and media spend. 
As we focus on driving some of our key brand initiatives, including growing our underdeveloped Tommy Tailored business and our Tommy Underwear business, we recently announced that Rafael Nadal will be our brand ambassador for the fall marketing campaign. This campaign will focus on those key -- 2 key product categories, tailored and men's underwear, which we believe we have significant growth opportunities to capture. 
Moving to our Heritage business. Our Heritage business had a difficult fourth quarter with revenues down 3%, principally driven by poor performance of our dress shirt business. Operating income declined $12 million in the fourth quarter, as clearance markdowns were required to balance inventories and clear excess goods. We believe this dress shirt issue is behind us as we enter 2015 and we will begin to see this business turn around in fiscal 2015. 
Moving into the first quarter. Our sportswear businesses have continued to perform with retail comps running up about mid-single digits quarter-to-date. 
Before I turn it over to Mike, I just want to focus on the key initiatives as we move forward. As we move over the next 3 years, our key objective will be capturing the long-term revenue and profit opportunities for our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands. There are really 5 key initiatives that we hope to accomplish over the next 3 years and that you should be monitoring as we go forward. The first is to continue to invest in product, presentation and the marketing of the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands. Second, we continue to invest in our global operating platforms to support our growth strategies, including key investments in our digital commerce systems and platforms. Third, significantly improving the operating results of the Calvin Klein European business over the next 3 years so that it is comparable to the strong operating performance of our Tommy Hilfiger business in Europe. Fourth, continue to invest in the expansion of our presence in Asia and Latin America for both Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein as we see these markets as our greatest growth opportunities for the brands. And finally, assuming more direct control over our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger's license businesses over the next 3 years where we can maximize our core competencies to increased sales and our overall profitability. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Mike to quantify the fourth quarter results and to put more color on some of the guidance that we gave."

Our overall 2014 revenues were close to plan when excluding the impact of foreign currency. A strong growth in our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses was offset by a decline in our Heritage business. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 9% on a constant currency basis in the quarter with strong wholesale performance in North America. In Europe, Tommy Hilfiger retail posted 6% comps combined with square footage expansion, while the wholesale business recorded mid-single-digit growth. 
Calvin Klein also had a strong quarter with revenues up 6% on a constant currency basis, driven in large part by North America wholesale, in particular, our underwear business. 
In addition, both Tommy and Calvin experienced increases in the fourth quarter operating margins versus the prior year. 
Heritage revenues were down 3% for the quarter due to poor performance in our dress shirt division. Within our dress shirt business, the shortfall in revenue was coupled with a decline in gross margin due to heavy markdowns as a result of excess inventory levels which significantly lowered our Heritage operating margins. 
Benefiting the fourth quarter versus the prior year and our guidance was a decrease in the tax rate driven by discrete items. 
Overall, we delivered earnings per share growth of 23% even with the $0.10 per share negative impact from foreign currency exchange. 
As we look to 2015, we need to take a moment to understand the mix of our businesses' revenues and earnings and the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar. 
As we called out in our press release, our earnings before unallocated U.S. corporate expenses are about 2/3 international with heavy -- which heavily exposes us to exchange rate fluctuations on both a transaction and translational basis. Our exposure at a transactional level is mostly due to our international divisions purchasing their inventory in U.S. dollars. To partially protect against this, we buy forward exchange contracts about 9 to 12 months out for about 80% of our projected inventory purchases made by our international division in U.S. dollars. 
Our exposure at a translation level is due to converting the revenue and earnings of our international divisions into U.S. dollars. Like most companies, we do not hedge translation and we don't believe we should begin gambling on currency fluctuations. 
In 2015, we are anticipating, based on current exchange rates, that we will be impacted negatively by about $1.20 of earnings per share for foreign exchange. The $1.20 impact is approximately 2/3 driven by translation and 1/3 driven by transaction. Our largest currency exposures are the euro, the Canadian dollar and the Brazilian real. 
In addition to the impact of the strengthening dollar, the turbulent economic and political issues in Russia are projected to reduce earnings in our Russian business by about $0.10. The business remains profitable, but at a much lower level than in the prior year. Going forward, we'll be discussing these impacts when material and offering a constant currency view of our operations to measure the true health of our business. 
For the full year 2015, we are projecting earnings per share at $6.75 to $6.90. If we exclude the negative impact of FX in Russia of $1.30, we have earnings per share growth of 10% to 12% over the prior year. 
Overall, we're projecting revenues approximately $7.9 billion, which includes a negative impact of over $500 million related to foreign currency. On a constant currency basis, we are projecting revenues to increase about 3%. 
Overall, operating margins are expected to increase about 20 to 30 basis points, excluding a negative impact of about 60 basis points due to FX. Driving the growth when excluding foreign currency is continued improvement in the Calvin business, which is projecting revenues to grow 5% on a constant currency basis. We are also planning Calvin Klein operating margins to increase 30 to 50 basis points, excluding a negative impact of 20 basis points of FX. 
Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 3% on a constant currency basis with operating margins planned relatively flat, excluding a negative impact of approximately 100 basis points of FX. 
Our Heritage business is planned to have a revenue decrease of 4% due mostly to exiting the IZOD retail business in 2015. Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to increase about 60 to 80 basis points as our wholesale business continues to show gross margin improvements, particularly in dress shirts. The impact of foreign currency in our Heritage business is immaterial. 
Interest expense for the year is planned to be between $100 million (sic)[$120 million] and $125 million compared to the prior year amount of $139 million due to our average lower debt balances. Also favorably impacting interest for 2015 is the debt refinancing we did in the second half of last year's first quarter. 
Our tax rate for the year is planned at about 22%, which is mostly in line with the prior year. 
First quarter earnings per share are planned at $1.35 to $1.40 and include $0.30 of estimated negative impact from foreign exchange and the decline in our Russian business. Excluding this impact, we're expecting earnings per share to increase 12% to 16% for the first quarter. 
Revenue in the first quarter is projected to increase 2% on a constant currency basis. Tommy Hilfiger's revenues are planned at 2% constant currency increase and Calvin Klein is planned at a 3% constant currency increase. Heritage Brand's revenues are projected to decrease 1%. 
Interest expense is projected to be $30 million and taxes to be about 25% to 26% in the first quarter. And lastly, we currently expect debt paydown to be at least $425 million in 2015. 
And with that, we'll open it up for questions."

So we really are turning the percentages upside down. We're really trying to drive growing full price selling and at the same time taking market share. I believe when you look at the business where you'll see that manifest itself in the Calvin Klein North America business is, on a constant currency basis, seeing operating margins continuing to improve in that business as we go forward and we'll be reporting at retail with our key department store accounts the fact that we're seeing strong sell-throughs of that product. Hopefully, you'll also be seeing, because I know you shop, you'll also be seeing in North America a much more elevated presentation at retail with our key accounts, Macy's, Lord & Taylor and Dillard's, both in the jeans and the underwear area. And overall, you should be seeing higher average unit retails going out the door. In our international businesses, it's probably even more transparent because a bigger component of that business for us is direct to consumer where we are in control of both the environment and the selling space, and we report those results on a retail basis. So I think, there, the business, particularly in Asia, which is a highly profitable business model, there it should be on top line growth in both of those categories as we go forward and we're starting to see that in the first quarter of this year with a real enhancement of product as we have rebalanced more of our selling into the full price area away from clearance and promotional sales. That comparison in Asia is pretty much behind us now so we're really getting an apples-to-apples comparison beginning in 2015. So for us, that will be the driver. In Europe, continuing to focus on the order book, continuing to see our price points increase at retail and our presentation across-the-board on the Calvin Klein brand. So I think that profitability will be very transparent when we report results."

But when you really get into the fundamentals of the business, what's really driving it, that's a very healthy business, both jeans, underwear, all product categories in those 2 regions of the world. So I believe the enhancements that you will see will be, hopefully on a local currency basis, you'll see some continued operating margin improvement, but what you really should start to see beginning in '15 is some top line growth as we've eliminated the off-price clearance sales that existed in the business. In the U.S. and European businesses, both of those businesses are basically a breakeven for jeans business model for us today. So we clearly believe that we have the opportunity there to bring those margins over the next 4 to 5 years to approach 10%. Every other Calvin Klein business that we run in those -- in Europe and in North America are running at double-digit operating margins for us. So it's really cleaning up the problems of the past, getting the brand presented, making those investments the last 18 months and continuing that into this year. But each year seeing an improvement in the operating margins of those businesses as we go forward, so that when we get over the next 3 to 4 years, we'll start to approach those double-digit operating margins for jeans in Europe and North America."

I think from a macro point of view, we've -- we're really dealing with some headwinds going forward. The Tommy business -- the strength of the Tommy business has been its geographic diversity and the strong brand positioning and the strong operating and financial characteristics that the European business carries. I think, fundamentally, when you think what's going on with currencies around the world in Europe in particular, but Brazil as well, 2 big markets for both Calvin and Tommy, but in particular for Tommy in Europe, there's a reason those currencies are under so much pressure. The underlying economic statistics there are just feeling the pressure. So it's the fact that our order book is running up mid-single digits, 4% to 6% depending on the season, in and of itself is disappointing to us when we look on it on a historic basis where we've had double-digit increases in 2010, '11 and '12. But clearly, from what's going on from a macro point of view, we feel we are substantially gaining market share during the same time frame. But that doesn't change the dynamic that's going on that we're only planning our comps to grow low single digits in Europe and we're planning the wholesale business to also grow in that 2% to 4% range for the second half of the year. So Tommy has consistently surprised us on the upside with their results and we're in a little bit of a period of now of being up against some really tough comparisons last year and prior years and going into the headwinds of just a really challenging market. So I think that's the biggest issue that's facing us there. I think as things start to improve, there's no reason why that business doesn't get back to a blended growth rate of closer to 6% to 7% to 8%, which we think we're very comfortable with. And really, for that brand, there continues to be substantial opportunities for us to really directly control some of the emerging markets throughout Asia and in Latin America as well. So those are real opportunities for us as we go forward and none of that is really factored into the financial guidance that we've given."

I think, fundamentally, we're dealing with somewhat of an unprecedented situation given the volatility and the speed of some of these declines. The euro moves from parity at one point in 2002 to $1.35 and has, in 4 months, has gone from $1.35 to just above parity just a couple of days ago. So it's been a shockingly fast move, which you don't usually expect to see in currency markets. So we are really trying to pull all the levers as we think about 2016. We're also trying not to overreact to the situation. So we're clearly looking at potentially certain markets for more local production. That would be particularly for Europe, where we'd like to see 1,000 basis point increase potentially in some of our local production that goes on, so instead of being around 30%, potentially moving to 40%. That does come with higher average costs than we experienced in 2014 and '15, but at the same time gives us speed to market and efficiencies that we might be able to take advantage of. Leveraging our overall purchasing power with our vendor base, trying to be more efficient there, that will clearly be a lever we'll look at. Opportunistically increasing average unit retail, that's the one that we're really focused on, we're looking at. We're trying to understand the competitive set there. We're also trying to understand market by market where we have the potential to raise prices given the fragility of the European market, especially as it feels in the short term like we need to move cautiously as we really start to experiment with raising prices, but we will be looking at it very closely. And then, lastly, looking at expense controls across-the-board everywhere. We clearly understand the situation we're in and we need to manage against that. So I think we're really trying to focus on all of those points as we roll forward with a real balance to say we need to continue to invest in our brand so that we can drive long-term growth and this starts as we've -- as hopefully some of these currency headwinds start to turn around over the next 2 years."

Look, our sportswear businesses, I'll talk about that specifically, we continue there to see good results, particularly with the IZOD business, the launch at Kohl's continues strongly. I think you'll see operating margin improvement there and some sales increases. The retail trends right now, the first 6 months -- 6 weeks of the quarter, have been very satisfying to see what's been going on in our own stores and at retail what we're seeing. Our dress shirt business for us, that was just a huge disappointment. That's just not an area where we should be missing. I mean, we are the dominant player. It is a tough category, but we got caught with some inventory and some movement of excess goods that we shouldn't have gotten caught with. That's been addressed, that's behind us and I think you'll start to see that business in '15 getting back to its historical levels of profitability. The real challenging business in that whole Heritage component has historically been our retail direct-to-consumer business in North America and we addressed that over the last 2 years with the closedown of the Bass business and now the closedown of the IZOD retail business, both representing a little bit over $300 million in sales at break-even operating businesses. So the efficiencies that we're gaining from that will start to manifest itself in '15 and in '16, so a much more efficient business model. Historically, our wholesale businesses have been at 10%, 11% operating margins. Even last year, in a very challenging market, we were over 8% so -- and believe we'll get closer to 9% this year with the hope to reach that double-digit level second half of this year. So it's a focus area for us. We clearly manage that business from a cash flow point of view . There's little investment going into the Heritage businesses besides working capital and some minor support for the brands that's required and we're able to take that cash flow from those businesses and reinvest it back into our high margin, higher growth Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses. So that strategy just continues."

It should continue. But I don't like quoting percentages because sometimes I'm not -- it's not -- unlike the international businesses where an order is really something that's stood behind and moves out, I think, here, it's really -- it's more like a retail business for us. We really have to manage it. So I'll just focus on how we're doing at retail and that's manifest. I think the Calvin Klein business, overall, in North America, was up double digits from a sales point of view in the fourth quarter. That's really been a strong performance for us and it's really being driven by outsized performance of the underwear business. The men's, as the bigger business, is just driving that, but also women's also coming on very strong and really enhancing the overall brand presentation has been a big winner for us. So the underwear business, double-digit increases in our wholesale business; the jeans business overall and the men's sportswear business, up mid to high single digits for us as we move forward. That trend we -- hopefully will continue. It's going to be driven principally out of a lot of reorder, replenishing the business that we are -- the supply chain is set up this way to really react to that today and fulfill at a greater -- at a higher percentage as we go forward. So I think we're positioned really well. At retail where we see the shops go in, I think I mentioned we're looking at between 30% and 40% store-on-store kind of retail increases. That doesn't translate fully into wholesale sales increases, but it does higher margin, higher profitability, less markdown and allowance support as we go forward. At the same time, what you're seeing when you look at the overall business is that we're really eliminating both in the off-price channel -- not eliminating, but significantly reducing the amount of off-price and clearance goods that are going to the off-price channel, but also the sell-in of promotional items into the full priced strategy as well. So we're really trying to enhance that overall business and it's the only way to then drive the profitability of that business. So as we keep our inventories clean and with an ability to react on an EDI basis on core product, I think it's all very healthy for us as we go forward."

The only region that's been soft in Asia for Tommy, as well as Calvin has really been the Korea market, which has had its own economic issues surrounding it. So really the opportunity in Southeast Asia, the opportunity in China, and clearly, even more long term, the opportunity in Latin America for the Tommy brand potentially to be running those businesses more directly either through direct operations or potentially with a strategic partner in a joint venture situation really gives us a tremendous amount of flexibility and we believe the best way to capture the growth in those regions."

Let me, I think -- let me take the first -- the last part first because it's the easier part of the question. On the bridge opportunity, particularly on the women's side, which is the -- which would be the big sales opportunity potential, I think the strategy in-house has been reestablish the jeans business, reestablish our casual sportswear business throughout Europe, get that operating on a level that we're comfortable that we can deliver against. And then when that is at a level, begin to introduce the bridge product. You really want to introduce that product when the brand is at strength -- full strength at retail, when you have the operating platform in place to support it and we don't want to get ahead of ourselves and start to create short-term losses in a business that will be even -- will be -- that is very challenging in that market. So I believe there's a real opportunity there. I think it's an easier road on the men's side than the women's side. So our focus will be in the next 3 years, underwear, jeans, accessories and then men's sportswear along with the tailored component in men's dress shirts, suitings comparable to what we do in Tommy. After that, the business is much more secure and established, we'll look at the bridge opportunity in Europe. As far as forecasting the growth, I don't think -- again, I can't deal with --- when I say this is I can't forecast for you with all the currencies ups and downs. But when we look at the underlying fundamentals of the business, we continue to target high single-digit growth somewhere between 7% and 8% top line growth. Any kind of growth like that on a local currency basis will drive double-digit revenue growth. Have to deal with the vagaries of each of the markets, the macro dynamics that are going on, but fundamentally, looking at the opportunity for the Calvin Klein brand, there's no reason that the brand, given its growth prospects globally, that, that brand shouldn't continue to grow at that kind of level overall. I think North America will be somewhat smaller just because it's as well developed as it is and where the opportunities are. And clearly, the opportunities in Europe, Asia and Latin America are closer to double-digit kind of growth. When you put it together, I think that's where we get that 7% to 8% target that we talk about that really should drive double-digit EBIT growth for the segment."

For Calvin, the strength is really -- the biggest growth that we're seeing on a percentage basis is the U.K., France and the German market. Even though the German market is challenging overall as a market, we're just significantly underdeveloped there. So the opportunity to take advantage of our infrastructure in Germany where Tommy is, by far, the largest sportswear business in Germany, we really are able to take advantage of that strength to move Calvin Klein into that market. So I would say those are the 3 key markets for Calvin. Where we're seeing challenges continues to be Italy and continues -- and Russia, which for Calvin in particular, the Russia market, Moscow, that whole surrounding area, we have a very strong franchisee partner there and which is a very strong business for us. That business in 2015 is under pressure. So it's muting some of the growth. But even with that, you could see the kind of sales growth that we're talking about for the brand moving forward. On the Tommy side of the business, the most challenged market is Italy, followed by one of our bigger markets, which is Germany, which is flattish right now given its extraordinarily high market share that we have there. I think we're actually, on a market share basis, growing. I've seen statistics that talk about German apparel sales overall down about 3% last year. In that same period, our Tommy Hilfiger business was up about 2% to 2.5%. So I think we're growing. And as that economy hopefully improves, we should start to see some results there. So that's the 2 brands, that's how I would describe what's going on."

We are, percentage-wise, I can quote you, we're up 20%. The reality is in that business we're approaching $30 today, both men's and women's, which is very good progress for where we are, but we need to be closer to $40. Our AURs in our men's sportswear business, to just put it in comparison, is about $45 out the door and that's a full seasonal AUR, including clearance, markdowns zeroing out, the whole shebang. You would expect the jeans to be slightly less than that, more casual, much more of a T-shirt business driven there. So anywhere between $38 to $40 for Calvin Klein would be a healthy business. So we need to move AURs 30% to 35% over the next 3 years to get to that level of profitability that we've achieved in every other product category that we operate in. So I always want to reiterate that the issue that we have in North America is not a brand issue, it's a product category issue that's under pressure on a macro basis and had been really mistreated as a product category from a quality level and a presentation and we're just starting to make those investments and seeing -- we're just starting to see the turnaround in those businesses. And where we, not to belabor it, but where we get the presentation, where we are able to show the product, we're clearly in Herald Square, we have a shop presentation that's comparable to everything else we have, we're clearly already delivering that $40 to $45 AUR. So for us, that's what we're going back to our retail partners and demanding more square footage, better doors, really improving our EDI replenishment capabilities with jeans to really have a supply chain that supports our jeans business. So a lot of building blocks that are there and some still getting there, but I believe over the next 12 months we're really making headwind. And hopefully, as each quarter progresses, I can continue to be optimistic about where we're heading with that business."

We believe we probably could enhance that just given scale and size and the synergies that would exist with the existing Calvin Klein businesses in those territories from a clearly a back office synergy point of view, not a front-of-house synergy. So those are -- that's the opportunity that we potentially see. We believe those businesses can be bought at attractive prices considering where the market is and considering where currencies are today.

It's really 6 weeks, 7 weeks and we like to see a little bit more time, understanding the Easter shift and what's going on, understanding -- in North America, one of the biggest challenges we're dealing with, and I think you'll probably hear more of this as more retailers start to report, is how this international tourism is really impacting all retail sales, particularly if you have big stores in key cities in the United States be it the Northeast, Florida, Vegas, the West Coast, I think you're going to probably hear from every major retailer that attracts an international tourist in North America that, that business in those markets will be under pressure while we see at the same time the permanent population centers, the Midwest, the north -- the Mid-Atlantic, the West Coast outside of L.A. and San Francisco and then the whole Southern tier of country, Texas and whatever, those businesses are actually pretty strong indicating that the local consumer there is doing well.

So that's -- all those things are really stopping us at this point from -- potentially, if the world was normal and we were talking -- instead of talking about currency this way, we were just talking about $8-plus of earnings per share growth if currencies were leveled, I think you'd see a different posture from the management team and I don't think it would just be us.

And where we are in this moment in time is the priority has been, given the acquisition of Warnaco, pay down debt and we've done that for 2 years, exceeded our expectations of paying down debt and targeting to pay down about $425 million of debt again this year, which I think is really critically important to position ourselves to grow to make those acquisitions that we were talking -- that I've been talking about this morning. At the same time, the free cash flow of the business after the investment spending in -- for systems and platforms and our CapEx expenses and our retail growth and even if you coupled in debt repayment and a level of licensing acquisition that was rational year-by-year as opposed to a major acquisition in one chunk, if you did it that way, we are generating, once all the integration and restructuring now is behind us, we'll probably generate $500 million-plus of free cash flow after those investments to pay down debt as we go out. So this year, I think the number will be $500 million and it really gives us the opportunity to look at potentially looking at stock buyback end of 2015 going into '16, depending what the opportunities are out there from a strategic point of view. Our first priority will be to pay down -- will be to invest and invest in licensing acquisitions once the balance sheet is squared away, which I think it will be in '15.

Warnaco deployed that strategy in 2006 and 2007 and reported great financial results and really just completely damaged the Calvin Klein jeans business in Europe and in North America.

Good morning. Joining me on the call are Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Senior Vice President on Business Development and Investor Relations.
Overall, we were quite pleased with our results for the first quarter, which exceeded our earnings guidance by $0.10 per share. In the first quarter, on a constant currency basis, revenues increased 3% and EPS grew 20%. This outperformance was driven by strong underlying results in our international Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses. At the same time, we did see softness in our U.S. Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses, where a strong U.S. dollar negatively impacted international tourist spending.
Moving onto Calvin Klein. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 5% while operating earnings increased 25% in the first quarter, driven by the strong performance of our international businesses. The Calvin Klein brand initiatives are taking hold, and we continue to be pleased with our latest Justin Bieber spring campaign and our recently announced denim series featuring Kendall Jenner. We believe we are beginning to connect with a much younger consumer.
Moving into the second quarter. Our international businesses continued to post strong sales gains. International retail comp store sales are running ahead of plan in the second quarter and are trending up high single-digits in Europe, while our Asia business is posting mid single-digit increases. We are seeing particular strength in China, France, the U.K. and the Middle East.
In Europe, the Calvin Klein wholesale business continues to improve with our 2015 spring and fall order books, excluding Russia, up about 10% over the prior year. In North America in the second quarter, our Calvin Klein retail comps are running flat and on plan. We are seeing strong sales in our permanent population stores, while stores located in tourist destination locations, like Miami, Orlando, New York and Las Vegas, are feeling a pressure from weaker international tourist traffic and spending.
Speaking on some product initiatives. On Calvin Klein underwear, globally, we continue to drive our iconic basics while delivering new elevated product. In Men's, we have launched 2 new programs globally for spring, Intense Power and Air FX. And we are seeing very strong first quarter selling, which has continued into the second quarter.
Overall, the Calvin Klein North America men's underwear business has gained 300 basis points of market share in the first quarter. As a reminder, Intense Power is what Justin Bieber was featured in and which has sold so well in retail. Air FX is more of a performance underwear, which taps into what is happening broadly in the active arena.
In the Women's area, ARMADA and logo product leverages the best of what Calvin Klein does for men and translate it -- translates it for women's with an active appeal. Modern top continues to drive the improvement in all women's business in North America and Europe.
Overall, our Calvin Klein North America women's intimate business has gained over 200 basis points of market share in the first quarter of 2015. We continue to see great performance from our elevated black label product across both men's and women's in Asia and Europe. Our women's bra business in Asia continues to outperform the competition through the tailored bra category in both the push-up and solutions category. Overall sales for Asia in the first quarter ran up mid single-digits at retail and our strong sales trend has continued into the second quarter.
Moving into Calvin Klein Jeans. The new product that we have delivered, we are seeing a strong reaction from the consumer, particularly where we have installed new jeans shops. We continue to see men's outpace women's across North America and Europe, but women's continues to see an improvement. In North America, in the newly installed shops, we experienced a 25% retail sales increase over the prior year.
First quarter overall AURs were up about 10%, and that trend continues into the second quarter of 2015. We are targeting 150 new jeans shops installations in North America for fiscal 2015.
In Europe, we are in the early stages of a turnaround in the jeans business. We have significantly improve the quality level of our jeans line with better fabrics, trends and packaging. This has resulted in strong sell-throughs and higher AURs in the first quarter with growth across all European markets, excluding Europe -- excluding Russia. Second quarter jeans sales trends in Europe have continued to improve and are running up high single-digits.
Moving to our Tommy Hilfiger business. Revenues on a constant currency basis increased 1% in the first quarter. The increase was driven by solid performance in our International business, including a 2% increase in European retail comp store sales. In North America, revenues declined 1%, resulting from a 3% decrease in retail comp store sales. As with Calvin Klein, we experienced the decline in international tourist traffic and spending in our Tommy U.S. stores. Operating earnings, on a constant currency basis, decreased 6% in the first quarter, due to weak international tourist traffic in the U.S., which drove more promotional selling and higher markdowns.
Moving into the second quarter. We have seen significant improvement in our Tommy Hilfiger sales trends. Retail comp store sales at Tommy have accelerated in the second quarter with international comps up mid single-digits and North America comp store sales up low single-digits. In Europe, we have seen a significant improvement on our men's side of the business across all key categories, in particular, in our largest market, Germany.
We believe we continue outperform in men's in denim relative to the market and our womenswear business is also seeing an improvement quarter to date.
At wholesale, our Tommy European business continues to outperform the competition. As an indicator, our 2015 full year European order books, excluding Russia, are running up about 5% for the year. The strongest performing regions continue to be Germany, France and the Middle East.
Moving to our Heritage business. First quarter revenues for the Heritage business increased 5%, while operating earnings increased $5 million over the prior year. This increase is principally driven by a shift in the Tommy shipments into the first quarter of 2015 from the second quarter of that year -- of this year and also driven by a strong retail comp store increase for our Van Heusen business of about 14%.
Our Heritage sportswear business continues to perform very well, both at wholesale and retail. We expect that our dress shirt business will continue to underperform through the first half of 2015. However, we believe that this business will significantly improve in the second half of the year.
Finally, we were very pleased to announce a $500 million 3-year stock buyback program, which reflects our confidence in our ability to generate strong free cash flow. Our first priority will be to continue to strategically invest in our 2 global powerhouse brands in order to fully maximize our organic growth opportunities.
That said, given our strong balance sheet and growing free cash flow, which we estimate to be up $450 million in 2015, we are confident that we have the financial flexibility to, one, acquire and take more direct ownership in certain Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger license businesses, continue to pay down debt and return capital to our shareholders through our new stock buyback program.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Mike Shaffer, our CFO, to quantify further some of these results."

Driving revenues was o",828,"Thanks, Manny. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and reconciled on the press release.
On a constant currency basis, revenue for the first quarter was up 3% versus the prior year and ahead of our guidance. Driving revenues was our Calvin Klein business, which delivered a 5% increase over the prior year, fueled by an 8% increase in our Calvin Klein international business with comps of 10% benefiting in part from the timing of Chinese New Year. On a normalized basis, international comps were mid single-digits.
Also favorably impacting the current quarter at Calvin Klein was the timing of wholesale shipments. Our Calvin Klein strategies are taking hold and we are seeing improved performance, particularly in our international businesses. 
Our Heritage business revenues were up 5%, also ahead of plan, but heavily influenced by earlier than planned wholesale shipments. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 1% and misplan due to softness in the rest, where strong dollar negatively impacted international tourist spending.
Earnings per share for the first quarter was $1.50 and included a $0.27 negative impact related to foreign currency and expected weakness in our Russian business. Excluding this negative impact, EPS would have increased 20% over the prior year. Our quarter 1 EPS was $0.10 ahead of the top end of our guidance. The $0.10 deep versus our guidance was driven by $0.02 of taxes, $0.02 of favorable foreign currency and $0.06 related to the business performance, which was predominantly Calvin Klein and favorably impacted by the timing of shipments.
For the full year 2015, we raised our guidance and are now projected earnings per share of $6.85 to $6.95. If excluding negative impact related to foreign currency and weakness in our Russian business of $1.25, our earnings per share growth is projected to be 11% to 12% over the prior year.
Overall, we are projecting revenues of approximately $8 billion, which includes a negative impact of about $500 million related to foreign currency.
On a constant currency basis, we are projecting overall revenues to increase 3%. Overall operating margins are expected to increase about 20 to 30 basis points, excluding a negative impact of about 60 basis points due to foreign currency. Driving the growth when excluding foreign currency is the continued improvement in the Calvin Klein business, which is projecting revenues to grow 6% on a constant currency basis. We are also planning Calvin Klein operating margins to increase 70 to 80 basis points, excluding the negative impact of approximately 30 basis points of FX.
Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 3% on a constant currency basis with operating margins planned slightly down, excluding a negative impact of approximately 80 basis points of FX. Our Heritage business is planned to have a revenue decrease of 3% to mostly our exiting of the IZOD retail business in 2015.
Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to increase about 60 to 80 basis points, driven by the second half planned turnaround of our dress shirt business. The impact of foreign currency on our Heritage businesses is relatively immaterial.
Interest expense for the year is planned to be between $100 million and $125 million compared to the prior year of $139 million due to the average lower debt balances. Also favorably impacting interest for 2015 is the debt refinancing we completed in the second half of last year's first quarter.
We currently expect to generate approximately $400 million -- $450 million of free cash flow in 2015, which will be used to pay down debt of about $350 million and allow for license buybacks and stock repurchases under our newly announced planned.
Our tax rate for the year is planned at about 21.5% to 22%, which is in line with the prior year. Our revenue and earnings comparisons for the second quarter are heavily impacted by launches in the prior year for our Calvin Klein underwear business, which had a major repackaging initiative than last year's second quarter, as well as the initial selling of IZOD at Kohl's in our Heritage businesses. In addition, we saw earlier shipments in this year's first quarter versus the prior year and recognized about 25 shipments in quarter 1 that shipped in quarter 2 of last year.
These launches were coupled with earlier shipments driving flat overall revenues in the second quarter on a constant currency basis. By business, we're estimating second quarter revenues on a constant currency basis to increase 3% for Tommy, flat for Calvin and to decrease 8% for Heritage. Second quarter earnings per share is planned at $1.25 to $1.30 and includes approximately $0.30 of estimated negative impact for foreign currency and the decline in our Russia business. Excluding this negative impact in EPS is projected to increase 3% to 6% over the prior year. Interest expense is projected to be $30 million and taxes in the quarter about 19% to 20%. 
And with that, we'll open it up for questions."

In addition, I think, when you think about the overall market, the women's denim category has been under just greater pressure around this whole active at leisure trend in the market. So I think that's also pressured the women's business in a much stronger way. And I guess is really -- we're starting to really been understand our consumer the women's side, what drives their purchasing decisions. And I think that our marketing campaigns are really starting to align with that, particularly with the Kendall Jenner campaign that just kicked off in last month or 2. I think that's really start to connecting more directly with our female consumer. So I feel very optimistic about what's going on.

I think there's 2 things that go on. First is you raise ticket prices to balance you retail partners. And that's what we're really in significant discussions with our key retail partners about what they're seeing and where we are. And then also, that particularly in our North America, but around the globe in Europe, in particular, how much do we have to promote off of that and how much regular prices selling will come off of that? So there's a number of levers to press. And we're really going to determine that over the next 3 to 6 months as it plays itself out. And we're trying to give ourselves much flexibility as we go forward. We'll also be testing and following holiday some price increases as we go forward to see how the market is receiving that. Competitively, we know a number of our competitors, particularly in Europe, are starting to move prices up for fall. We're following that trend and watching it very carefully. But we also want to make sure, as a market leader, and in a turnaround situation with Calvin Klein, market share gains are critical to us. So we want to make sure that we're not over pricing ourselves in the markets. We're really trying to bring a balance to it. But clearly, there will be an opportunity to raise prices in the spring 2016 timeframe, given what's going on competitively."

On the -- let's talk about Europe first. I think we have, on the Tommy side of the business, in our own retail stores, each month in the first quarter, as we move through the quarter, the retail comp performance improve. And as we move into May and just finished the month of May, that was by far the strongest month. So I think we're really starting to see improvements in the European overall environment. Our men's business is really working very strongly, both on the sportswear side and the denim side of the men's category. And I think we just -- we're getting paid real dividends given our strong position in the market. Inventories are very clean, not a need to be overly promotional. So in Europe, given what's going on in the external environment, Tommy's significant exposure to that European market is by far our largest market for Tommy. It's about 45% of our sales. So it has a much bigger impact to the business as we went through what I would describe in 2014 a softer kind of environment, second half of the year, into the beginning of this year. That seems -- the overall economic backdrop seems to be improving and our business seems to be capturing that. Hopefully, that continues. In North America, I think we are going to potentially struggle with this international tourist spending. The Tommy business had such a strong following internationally in the United States. That business, I think, particularly in our biggest, most profitable stores, we're seeing traffic trends down in the 8% to 10% area in the Tommy Hilfiger business. And I think that -- although in the second quarter, that trend improved. And I think some of that has to do, we believe, with the World Cup that we're up against last year, where we first saw the second quarter. I think that, that trend will probably continue into the third quarter of this year. As we get into the fourth quarter, which is by far our largest quarter for our retail business, the comparisons start to get easier. The differential from a currency point of view also starts to balance out a little bit. So we're hopeful, as we get into the late third quarter and into fourth quarter, that, that trend will start to improve. We've got a little bit more promotional in those tourist destination locations, and we've seen a reaction to that and have been able to drive the comps on a very profitable basis there. So from the first quarter, where our retail comps in the U.S. in North America were down about 3%, we're actually seeing them up 2% to 3% in the second quarter. So hopefully, that's a sign that we're starting to see an inflection point. But we'll have to watch it on for a little bit more data as we move forward."

We have a $500 million Calvin Klein European business that is marginally profitable today from money-losing over the last 2 years. So our long-term target in Europe is to get that to about a 10% operating margin within the next 4 years. I think we're on track to deliver against that. The currency headwinds are just causing us some question on that as we continue to look at the pressure that's going to move from a coursing point of view. But clearly, those opportunities from pricing and better sell-throughs to significantly improve the Calvin Klein European operating margins. Putting into perspective Tommy Hilfiger European operating margins for the full year 2014, we're at 14% operating margins. So it's clearly with the low run business of some scale, there should be the opportunity to get to double-digit operating margins in Europe. Overall, I think we continue to talk about 15% operating margins for the Calvin Klein business. And as we bring in some of the licensing businesses, which carry almost 100% operating margins, today, convert those into much larger direct control businesses in those parts of the world, you would expect that our operating margins in Latin America and Asia should be in the high-teens as we go forward. So again, I think there continues to be that opportunity and overall goal to get our operating margins in Calvin Klein to about 15% and then take it from there."

I think retail is planned it more tightly. So it's becoming a category that should be nicely profitable because there's not a real issue for us. We'll focus on fall with all the retailers on the denim area. So I think you'll see a lot of marketing around denim and from by retails and the wholesale community. And I think there's other type on the consumer side in men's to really refill the -- their closets, some real fashion statements that are going on there that I think that category overall will start to improve over the next 2 or 3 years and see significant improvement in 2015. Calvin men's business, in particular, I think I quoted numbers, missing double-digit increases. So clearly, we're gaining market share. But we have to be honest with ourselves, our market share, we've lost about 50% of our market share for from where we were 4 or 5 years ago. So really recovering that, getting new doors that are opening in North America and larger footprints in some of the key doors in North America, I think, will be critical as that business goes forward. On the women's side, I think the improvement, from a category point of view, is not been strong as in the men's side, but it has been an improvement. I think it's kind of flattish at this point. The best data that I see, you hear different things when we talk to different retailers. But I think there, I think the pressure from the activewear at leisure side has been more intense on the women's side. And I think we're really seeing that business start to turn around on the women's side, but I think it's going to be behind the men's turnaround as we go forward. Our women's business, we're really seeing a lot of improvement. We're seeing in the denim bottoms, but we're also seeing in the non-denim bottoms with the jeans construction. So really seeing a big change there and we're trying to really take advantage of that both from a supply chain and a logistics point of view to really capture some of that innovation that's going on, on the women's side of the floor.

And I think should give us more financial flexibility as we go in forward. We really look at as a balance approach to return capital to our shareholders as appropriate and to also take care -- to take advantage of what we see as the growth, both in our Calvin and Tommy Hilfiger businesses. The opportunity to bring back license business, we think, is our #1 priority that we really have to go after. The way that lays itself out, given the nature of length of some of our license agreements, the buyback calls that we have in those license agreement, I think the triggering point to that is really 2016 that you really would see an impact for that. So we're working on that diligently. The opportunities from a geographic point of view continue to be Asia and to some degree, Latin America. Those are both growth regions for both brands, both Calvin and Tommy. And they give us the greatest opportunity to take advantage of our operating platforms in those regions to really see some outsized growth as we move forward. So that would be our priorities. We're also looking at some product categories that would make some sense to either bring it in-house directly or to take a trend venture ownership position in those businesses depending on the category and the region, what vehicle would make the most sense. But there's been no change in that being our #1 strategic priority, along with investing in the organic growth of the 2 global powerhouse brands."

We're still not looking to make major investments there at this point. But I think we -- as the year progresses and we turn into 2016, we're optimistic that we could actually see some small increases as we go forward there and really stop the bleeding in that country. In Spain, which is our other big Southern market, there's clearly been a change in the direction of the consumer spending habits there. And we're seeing it with our biggest retail partner, El Doko and Lace. Our business in Spain is more of our wholesale, our concession driven model. We have some stores, but really not that significantly significant. It's really driven through our Lace, and that business has improved significantly over the last 6 months. We're actually seeing the business in our order book grow in Spain. And I would expect that, that would continue to happen. We're seeing it in the mid single-digit kind of range.

I think rushing, especially when we have on strategic partners in these regions, it's not like these are areas that are being mismanaged or the brand is not being treated appropriately or not seeing appropriate growth. This is really an opportunity to just capture more of that growth internally. So we're not under the pressure of we have a bad licensee or a bad strategic partner, we have to take them out.

But when I compare our presentation in men's, sportswear, tailored clothing, dress shirts with our jeans presentation, I would say it's 25% of the presentation that we get in sportswear on jeans. And it doesn't -- that's not logical if we execute. We should be very -- will be brand like Calvin with its Heritage and jeans of the men's side, our jeans shops should be as big as our men's sportswear shops around the country. And there are currently running about 25% of that size. So performance would dictate getting more square footage, take it -- they're not bigger stores. It's going to be taking it away step-by-step from some of our competitors. But over the last 5 years, we've given it up. It's the same thing on the women's side of the floor. If you look at the amount of space the G-III has captured in the major department stores in the United States with Calvin Klein, and the kind of growth that they've experienced with the Calvin Klein brand, which has been high double-digit teens kind of growth, and if you look at our presentation in jeans, it's not 25% of what it is in some of the other categories.

Still a healthy business, as long as you don't get into inventory problems and margins, particularly in the business, like for PVH, Calvin and Tommy, where clearly accessory margins are much higher, when our apparel margins. And we're an apparel company that has a complementary accessory business as opposed to an accessory business that's trying to develop some type of a lifestyle brand or apparel business. I think that's a much harder formula to navigate given the high operating margin and accessories versus probably half those kind of margins when you talk about apparel."

But we think it has a real chance to have some legs to the business at slightly higher margins and price points. The -- what we are counting on for the turnaround of the business is just getting the inventories completely rightsized and getting the business rightsized. If you'll recall, we had a very tough third quarter in dress shirts and a disaster in the fourth quarter. So to be honest, all we're counting on is that we're going to grow the business as we normally do and comparatively, you'll see the improvement, particularly in the fourth quarter."

Also, the men's tailored side of the business for both Calvin and Tommy continues to do very well for us. That's fearless our graph. G-III, on the women's side, though speak probably tomorrow, and then come on their call. So they'll put more color on that. But we're seeing really healthy growth there. They are great licensing partner and just do a fantastic job for us. On the off-price channel, we've talked about it. The Warnaco business was overly dependent on the business in Europe in North America. In Europe, we are exactly where we want to be and the only business doing done in the off-price channel is selling off clearance at the end of the season, which is normal as opposed to selling in business in season and treating it as if it was a department store account. That's behind it. On the underwear business, we are exactly where we want to be from a channeled distribution diversification. Very well-balanced. 80% of our business is being done in the regular price channel distribution, exactly like we would want it to be. Premium positioning, both in North America and Europe. That's very healthy. The jeans business has continued to be a story. We have the -- in North America, we're at the right sales level at this point, as we particularly turn into the second half of this year. So the comparisons will be fine. But we really need to do is to grow the department store business to a healthier level. So I think that -- the financial hits that we've had to take by eliminating profitable off-price sales, that is behind us, particularly as we get out of this first quarter. And that's completely behind us and should be a real topic of discussion as we go forward. So I feel good about where we are, and I think as we grow that jeans regular price business, we'll be -- it will be in balance with the rest of the Calvin Klein businesses over the next 2 years.
Okay. Thanks, Eric. I'd like to thank everybody for joining us. We look forward to speaking with you at our second quarter earnings call, which will be in August, late August of this year. Everyone, enjoy their summer. And have a great day. Bye-bye."

Good morning. Joining me on the call are Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Senior Vice President on Business Development and Investor Relations.
Overall, we were quite pleased with our results for the first quarter, which exceeded our earnings guidance by $0.10 per share. In the first quarter, on a constant currency basis, revenues increased 3% and EPS grew 20%. This outperformance was driven by strong underlying results in our international Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses. At the same time, we did see softness in our U.S. Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses where a strong U.S. dollar negatively impacted international tourist spending.
Moving on to Calvin Klein. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 5% while operating earnings increased 25% in the first quarter, driven by the strong performance of our international businesses. The Calvin Klein brand initiatives are taking hold, and we continue to be pleased with our latest Justin Bieber spring campaign and our recently announced Denim Series featuring Kendall Jenner. We believe we are beginning to connect with a much younger consumer.
Moving into the second quarter. Our international businesses continue to post strong sales gains. International retail comp store sales are running ahead of plan in the second quarter and are trending up high single digits in Europe while our Asia business is posting mid-single-digit increases. We are seeing particular strength in China, France, the U.K. and the Middle East. In Europe, the Calvin Klein wholesale business continues to improve with our 2015 spring and fall order books, excluding Russia, up about 10% over the prior year. 
In North America in the second quarter, our Calvin Klein retail comps are running flat and on plan. We are seeing strong sales in our permanent population stores while stores located in tourist destination locations like Miami, Orlando, New York and Las Vegas are feeling the pressure from weaker international tourist traffic and spending.
Speaking on some product initiatives. On Calvin Klein underwear. Globally, we continue to drive our Iconic basics while delivering new, elevated product. In men's, we have launched 2 new programs globally for spring, Intense Power and Air Fx, and we are seeing very strong first quarter selling, which has continued into the second quarter. Overall, the Calvin Klein North America men's underwear business has gained 300 basis points of market share in the first quarter. As a reminder, Intense Power is what Justin Bieber was featured in and which has sold so well at retail. Air Fx is more of a performance underwear, which taps into what is happening broadly in the active arena.
In the women's area, our Modern Cotton logo product leverages the best of what Calvin Klein underwear does for men and translate it -- translates it for women's with an active appeal. Modern Cotton continues to drive the improvement in our women's business in North America and Europe. Overall, our Calvin Klein North America women's intimate business has gained over 200 basis points of market share in the first quarter of 2015. 
We continue to see great performance from our elevated Black Label product across both men's and women's in Asia and Europe. Our women's bra business in Asia continues to outperform the competition through the tailored bra category in both the push-up and solutions category. Overall sales for Asia in the first quarter ran up mid-single digits at retail and a strong sales trend has continued into the second quarter.
Moving into Calvin Klein jeans. The new product that we have delivered we are seeing a strong reaction from the consumer, particularly where we have installed new jeans shops. We continue to see men's outpace women's across North America and Europe, but women's continues to see an improvement. In North America, in the newly installed shops, we experienced a 25% retail sales increase over the prior year. First quarter overall AURs were up about 10% and that trend continues into the second quarter of 2015. We are targeting 150 new jeans shops installations in North America for fiscal 2015.
In Europe, we are in the early stages of a turnaround in the jeans business. We have significantly improved the quality level of our jeans line with better fabrics, trends and packaging. This has resulted in strong sell-throughs and higher AURs in the first quarter with growth across all European markets, excluding Europe -- excluding Russia. Second quarter jeans sales trends in Europe have continued to improve and are running up high single digits.
Moving to our Tommy Hilfiger business. Revenues on a constant currency basis increased 1% in the first quarter. The increase was driven by solid performance in our international business, including a 2% increase in European retail comp store sales. In North America, revenues declined 1% resulting from a 3% decrease in retail comp store sales. As with Calvin Klein, we experienced the decline in international tourist traffic and spending in our Tommy U.S. stores. Operating earnings on a constant currency basis decreased 6% in the first quarter due to weak international tourist traffic in the U.S., which drove more promotional selling and higher markdowns.
Moving into the second quarter. We have seen significant improvement in our Tommy Hilfiger sales trends. Retail comp store sales at Tommy have accelerated in the second quarter with international comps up mid-single digits and North America comp store sales up low single digits. In Europe, we have seen a significant improvement on our men's side of the business across all key categories, in particular, in our largest market, Germany. We believe we continue to outperform in men's in denim relative to the market and our Women's Wear business is also seeing improvement quarter-to-date.
At wholesale, our Tommy European business continues to outperform the competition. As an indicator, our 2015 full year European order books, excluding Russia, are running up about 5% for the year. The strongest performing regions continue to be Germany, France and the Middle East.
Moving to our Heritage business. First quarter revenues for the Heritage business increased 5% while operating earnings increased $5 million over the prior year. This increase is principally driven by a shift in the Tommy shipments to the first quarter of 2015 from the second quarter of that year -- of this year and also driven by a strong retail comp store increase for our Van Heusen business of about 14%. Our Heritage sportswear business continues to perform very well, both at wholesale and retail. We expect that our dress shirt business will continue to underperform through the first half of 2015. However, we believe that this business will significantly improve in the second half of the year.
Finally, we were very pleased to announce a $500 million 3-year stock buyback program, which reflects our confidence in our ability to generate strong free cash flow. Our first priority will be to continue to strategically invest in our 2 global powerhouse brands in order to fully maximize our organic growth opportunities.
That said, given our strong balance sheet and growing free cash flow, which we estimate to be up $450 million in 2015, we are confident that we have the financial flexibility to: one, acquire and take more direct ownership in certain Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger license businesses; continue to pay down debt; and return capital to our shareholders through our new stock buyback program.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Mike Shaffer, our CFO, to quantify further some of these results."

On a constant currency basis, revenue for the first quarter was up 3% versus the prior year and ahead of our guidance. Driving revenues was our Calvin Klein business, which delivered a 5% increase over the prior year, fueled by an 8% increase in our Calvin Klein international business with comps of 10% benefiting in part from the timing of Chinese New Year. On a normalized basis, international comps were mid-single digits. 
Also favorably impacting the current quarter at Calvin Klein was the timing of wholesale shipments. Our Calvin Klein strategies are taking hold and we are seeing improved performance, particularly in our international businesses. Our Heritage business revenues were up 5%, also ahead of plan, but heavily influenced by earlier-than-planned wholesale shipments. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 1% and missed plan due to softness in the U.S. where a strong dollar negatively impacted international tourist spending.
Earnings per share for the first quarter was $1.50 and included a $0.27 negative impact related to foreign currency and expected weakness in our Russian business. Excluding this negative impact, EPS would have increased 20% over the prior year. Our quarter 1 EPS was $0.10 ahead of the top end of our guidance. The $0.10 beat versus our guidance was driven by $0.02 of taxes, $0.02 of favorable foreign currency and $0.06 related to the business performance, which was predominantly Calvin Klein and favorably impacted by the timing of shipments.
For the full year 2015, we raised our guidance and are now projecting earnings per share of $6.85 to $6.95. If we exclude the negative impact related to foreign currency and weakness in our Russian business of $1.25, our earnings per share growth is projected to be 11% to 12% over the prior year. Overall, we are projecting revenues of approximately $8 billion, which includes the negative impact of about $500 million related to foreign currency.
On a constant currency basis, we are projecting overall revenues to increase 3%. Overall operating margins are expected to increase about 20 to 30 basis points, excluding a negative impact of about 60 basis points due to foreign currency. 
Driving the growth, when excluding foreign currency, is the continued improvement in the Calvin Klein business, which is projecting revenues to grow 6% on a constant currency basis. We are also planning Calvin Klein operating margins to increase 70 to 80 basis points, excluding the negative impact of approximately 30 basis points of FX.
Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 3% on a constant currency basis with operating margins planned slightly down, excluding a negative impact of approximately 80 basis points of FX. 
Our Heritage business is planned to have a revenue decrease of 3% due mostly our exiting of the IZOD retail business in 2015. Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to increase about 60 to 80 basis points, driven by the second half planned turnaround of our dress shirt business. The impact of foreign currency on our Heritage businesses is relatively immaterial.
Interest expense for the year is planned to be between $100 million and $125 million (sic) [ $120 million to $125 million ] compared to the prior year of $139 million due to the average lower debt balances. Also favorably impacting interest for 2015 is the debt refinancing we completed in the second half of last year's first quarter.
We currently expect to generate approximately $400 million -- $450 million of free cash flow in 2015, which will be used to pay down debt of about $350 million and allow for license buybacks and stock repurchases under our newly announced plan.
Our tax rate for the year is planned at about 21.5% to 22%, which is in line with the prior year. 
Our revenue and earnings comparisons for the second quarter are heavily impacted by launches in the prior year for our Calvin Klein underwear business, which had a major repackaging initiative than last year's second quarter as well as the initial selling of IZOD at Kohl's in our Heritage businesses. In addition, we saw earlier shipments in this year's first quarter versus the prior year and recognized about 25 shipments in quarter 1 that shipped in quarter 2 of last year. These launches, when coupled with earlier shipments, are driving flat overall revenues in the second quarter on a constant currency basis. 
By business, we're estimating second quarter revenues on a constant currency basis to increase 3% for Tommy, flat for Calvin and to decrease 8% for Heritage. 
Second quarter earnings per share is planned at $1.25 to $1.30 and includes approximately $0.30 of estimated negative impact for foreign currency and the decline in our Russia business. Excluding this negative impact, EPS is projected to increase 3% to 6% over the prior year. Interest expense is projected to be $30 million and taxes in the quarter about 19% to 20%. 
And with that, we'll open it up for questions."

I think the thing I'm most optimistic is about the product improvements that I see in the pipeline.

So I really feel as we get into the second half of this year into '17, into '16 as well, that you'll see more dramatic improvement in that business because of those initiatives. In addition, and I think when you think about the overall market, the women's denim category has been under just greater pressure around this whole active at leisure trend in the market. So I think that's also pressured the women's business in a much stronger way. And I guess, it's really -- we're starting to really better understand our consumer on the women's side, what drives their purchasing decisions and I think that our marketing campaigns are really starting to align with that, particularly with the Kendall Jenner campaign that just kicked off in the last month or 2. I think that's really starting to connecting even more directly with our female consumer. So I feel very optimistic about what's going on.

I think now the question is to what degree, what opportunity is -- what opportunity that presents, what competitive positions that are out there. I think there's 2 things that go on. First is you raise ticket prices to balance your retail partners and that's what we're really in significant discussions with our key retail partners about, what they're seeing and where we are. And then also that, particularly in North America but around the globe in Europe, in particular, how much do we have to promote off of that and how much regular price selling will come off of that. So there's a number of levers to press and we're really going to determine that over the next 3 to 6 months as it plays itself out and we're trying to give ourselves much flexibility as we go forward. We'll also be testing in the fall and holiday some price increases as we go forward to see how the market is receiving that. Competitively, we know a number of our competitors, particularly in Europe, are starting to move prices up for fall. We're following that trend and watching it very carefully. But we also want to make sure, as a market leader and in a turnaround situation with Calvin Klein, market share gains are critical to us so we want to make sure that we're not overpricing ourselves in the markets. We're really trying to bring a balance to it. But clearly, there will be an opportunity to raise prices in the spring 2016 time frame given what's going on competitively."

Our men's business is really working very strongly both on the sportswear side and the denim side of the men's category. And I think we just -- we're getting paid real dividends given our strong position in the market. Inventories are very clean, not a need to be overly promotional.

So it is -- has a much bigger impact to the business as we went through what I would describe in 2014 a softer kind of environment, second half of the year into the beginning of this year. That seems -- the overall economic backdrop seems to be improving and our business seems to be capturing that. Hopefully, that continues. In North America, I think we are going to potentially struggle with this international tourist spending. The Tommy business had such a strong following internationally in the United States. That, that business, I think, was -- particularly in our biggest, most profitable stores, we're seeing traffic trends down in the 8% to 10% area in the Tommy Hilfiger business. And I think that -- although in the second quarter, that trend improved and I think some of that has to do, we believe, with the World Cup that we're up against last year where we saw a softer second quarter. I think that, that trend will probably continue into the third quarter of this year. As we get into the fourth quarter, which is by far our largest quarter for our retail business, the comparisons start to get easier. The differential from a currency point of view also starts to balance out a little bit. So we're hopeful, as we get into the late third quarter and into fourth quarter, that, that trend will start to improve. We've gotten a little bit more promotional in those tourist destination locations and we've seen a reaction to that and have been able to drive the comps on a very profitable basis there. So from the first quarter where our retail comps in the U.S. -- in North America were down about 3%, we're actually seeing them up 2% to 3% in the second quarter. So hopefully, that's a sign that we're starting to see an inflection point. But we'll have to watch it for a little bit more data as we move forward."

I think the European -- just purely on an operating basis -- operating margin basis, I think the biggest opportunity is Europe to see a significant improvement in the Calvin Klein margins. We have a $500 million Calvin Klein European business that is marginally profitable today from money-losing over the last 2 years. So our long-term target in Europe is to get that to about a 10% operating margin within the next 4 years. I think we're on track to deliver against that. The currency headwinds are just causing us some caution on that as we continue to look at the pressure that it's going to put from a costing point of view. But clearly, there's opportunities from pricing and better sell-throughs to significantly improve the Calvin Klein European operating margins. Putting it into perspective, Tommy Hilfiger European operating margins for the full year of 2014 were at 14% operating margins. So it's clearly, with a well-run business of some scale, there should be the opportunity to get to double-digit operating margins in Europe. Overall, I think we continue to talk about 15% operating margins for the Calvin Klein business. And as we bring in some of the licensing businesses, which carry almost 100% operating margins today, convert those into much larger direct control businesses in those parts of the world, you would expect that our operating margins in Latin America and Asia should be in the high teens as we go forward. So again, I think there continues to be that opportunity and overall goal to get our operating margins in Calvin Klein to about 15% and then take it from there."

I think on the men's side, you see the category has improved. The negatives have now turned to low positives. So the bleeding has stopped and I think the business feels better. I think retailers have planned it more tightly. So it's becoming a category that should be nicely profitable because there's not a real issue for us. We will focus on fall with all the retailers on the denim area. So I think you're going to see a lot of marketing around denim from -- by retailers and the wholesale community. And I think there's appetite on the consumer side in men's to really refill the -- to refill their closets, some real fashion statements that are going on there that I think that category overall will start to improve over the next 2 or 3 years and see significant improvement in 2015. Calvin men's business, in particular, I think I quoted the numbers, we're seeing double-digit increases. So clearly, we're gaining market share. But we have to be honest with ourselves, our market share, we've lost about 50% of our market share for from where we were 4 or 5 years ago. So really recovering that, getting new doors that are opening in North America and larger footprints in some of the key doors in North America, I think, will be critical as that business goes forward. On the women's side, I think the improvement, from a category point of view, has not been as strong as in the men's side, but it has been an improvement. I think it's kind of flattish at this point. The best data that I see, you hear different things when we talk to different retailers, but I think, there, I think the pressure from the activewear at leisure side has been more intense on the women's side. And I think we're really seeing that business start to turn around on the women's side, but I think it's going to be behind the men's turnaround as we go forward. Our women's business, we're really seeing a lot of improvement. We're seeing it in the denim bottoms, but we're also seeing it in nondenim bottoms with the jeans construction. So really seeing a big change there and we're trying to really take advantage of that both from a supply chain and a logistics point of view to really capture some of that innovation that's going on, on the women's side of the floor. So I -- it's better than it's been, but I still wouldn't characterize the jeans denim area as a hot category at this point. It's just not bleeding like it was and it seems to actually be slightly growing."

We really look at it as a balanced approach to return capital to our shareholders as appropriate and to also take care -- to take advantage of what we see as the growth, both in our Calvin and Tommy Hilfiger businesses. The opportunity to bring back license business, we think, is our #1 priority that we really have to go after. The way that lays itself out, given the nature and length of some of our license agreements, the buyback calls that we have in those license agreements, I think the triggering point to that is really 2016 that you really would see an impact from that. So we're working on that diligently. The opportunities from a geographic point of view continue to be Asia, and to some degree, Latin America. Those are both growth regions for both brands, both Calvin and Tommy, and they give us the greatest opportunity to take advantage of our operating platforms in those regions to really see some outsized growth as we move forward. So that would be our priorities. We're also looking at some product categories that would make some sense to either bringing in-house directly or to take a joint venture ownership position in those businesses, depending on the category and the region, what vehicle would make the most sense. But there's been no change in that being our #1 strategic priority, along with investing in the organic growth of the 2 global powerhouse brands."

But I think we -- as the year progresses and we turn into 2016, we are optimistic that we could actually see some small increases as we go forward there and really stop the bleeding in that country. In Spain, which is our other big Southern market, there's clearly been a change in the direction of the consumer spending habits there and we're seeding it with our biggest retail partner, El Corte Inglés. Our business in Spain is more of a wholesale or concession-driven model. We have some stores, but really not that significantly -- significant. It's really driven through El Corte Inglés and that business has improved significantly over the last 6 months.

I think rushing, especially where we have strong strategic partners in these regions, it's not like these are areas that are being mismanaged or the brand is not being treated appropriately or not seeing appropriate growth, this is really an opportunity to just capture more of that growth internally. So we're not under the pressure of we have a bad licensee or a bad strategic partner and we have to take them out. So I think the urgency of that, that might have created is not there.

I think what's more important is that we need to get bigger square foot presentations, particularly in the top 150 doors in the United States. If you were to walk the floors in some of the best department stores in the United States and when you walk into a Macy's or if you walk into a Belk's or Dillard's and look at the Calvin Klein presentation, I think it's as strong as any brand in the market. But when I compare our presentation in men's sportswear, tailored clothing, dress shirts, with our jeans presentation, I would say it's 25% of the presentation that we get in sportswear on jeans and it doesn't -- that's not logical if we execute. We should be very -- with a brand like Calvin with its heritage in jeans on the men's side, our jeans shops should be as big as our men's sportswear shops around the country and they're currently running about 25% of that size. So performance will dictate getting more square footage, taking it from -- they're not building bigger stores. It's going to be taking it away step-by-step from some of our competitors. But over the last 5 years, we've given it up. It's the same thing on the women's side of the floor. If you look at the amount of space that G-III has captured in the major department stores in the United States with Calvin Klein and the kind of growth that they've experienced with the Calvin Klein brand, which has been high double-digit teens kind of growth, and if you look at our presentation in jeans, it's not 25% of what it is in some of the other categories. It's more like 10% or 15%. So we need -- although we've gotten position and now we're in the game and we've got the -- we have presentations to compete, we clearly have an opportunity to grow the square footage in North America and that is going to be the key to driving the success of the Calvin Klein business in jeans in this part of the world."

But I think that leveled out and as you get that behind you, unless there's another drop in currencies again, but I think at this level, I think that consumer finds their footing and I think the strength of the Tommy Hilfiger and the Calvin Klein business globally really allows us to capture that international tourist that travels to the United States consistently. And I think we should be in a better profit position. We should be better in 2016, late 2015 in managing the flow of the inventory into those stores, getting it right, less need to be maybe as promotional as we were in the first quarter of this year.

I think some of the places we have seen softer business that may have been more impacted by the international tourists, I think those retailers are aggressively moving to get inventories down. We don't really have any bulge in inventory sitting anywhere. We've been very diligent about moving goods. We haven't -- our flow of goods hasn't really been impacted by the port situation. We've got ahead of that and really was -- were moving goods to the Northeast and are really now just getting back to our normal balance of how goods are coming into the country. So we don't specifically see it. I think there are -- look, I think it continues to be promotional at retail. I think it's going to be a promotional Father's Day. And as we get into June and July, some -- nothing is really changing. But I don't see anything that would directly impact our business or the trends we're seeing at retail. So I think it's a little higher in some places than people would like, but I think they're taking steps to deal with it and I still feel pretty good about that overall. Accessories, we kind of -- we always tend to just pool that together with our apparel businesses when we talk about comps, when we talk about trends only because we don't want to confuse people and start talking about big increases on, what I would say, 3 years ago were relatively small numbers but has become big businesses for us over the last 3 years, both at wholesale here in North America, our business is growing double digit with department stores -- with both Calvin and our Tommy Hilfiger business with department stores. And in our own retail stores, we've really grown the square footage associated with accessories. And that business has been healthy for us overall. I think that the accessories, in general, I think there is what I would say is the category is not as robust and I'm not speaking now about our business, I'm speaking just in general terms. I don't think we are as significantly exposed as some of our competitors to that category. We have a big, healthy business there that's doing well and I think there's runway in growth for us particularly as we're price positioned in the market. But I think there's -- the kind of growth that's been experienced the last 4 or 5 years, I think that growth, be it watches and jewelry or be it handbags directly, I think it's starting to level out in general. It's still a healthy business as long as you don't get into inventory problems and margins, particularly in a business like, for PVH, Calvin and Tommy where clearly accessory margins are much higher than our apparel margins. And we're an apparel company that has a complementary accessory business as opposed to an accessory business that's trying to develop some type of a lifestyle brand or apparel business. I think that's a much harder formula to navigate given the high operating margins in accessory versus probably half those kind of margins when you talk about apparel."

Let's talk about the licensing business, it was healthy both for Calvin and for Tommy. The Tommy business just continued good performance with a number of key businesses, particularly internationally is where we really saw it. Our Asia business continuing to do well and our South America business doing well. On the Calvin side, the real growth driver has been G-III, that continues. Also the men's tailored side of the business for both Calvin and Tommy continues to do very well for us, that's Peerless and Marcraft. G-III, on the women's side, they'll speak probably tomorrow, I think, on their call so they'll put more color on that. But we're seeing really healthy growth there. They are a great licensing partner and just do a fantastic job for us. On the off-price channel, we've talked about it. The Warnaco business was overly dependent on the business in Europe and North America. In Europe, we are exactly where we want to be and the only business being done in the off-price channel is selling off clearance at the end of the season, which is normal as opposed to selling in business in season and treating it as if it was a department store account that's behind it. On the underwear business, we're exactly where we want to be from a channel or distribution diversification, very well-balanced. 80% of our business is being done in the regular price channel or distribution, exactly like we would want it to be. Premium positioning both in North America and Europe, that's very healthy. The jeans business has continued to be a story. We have the -- in North America, we're at the right sales level at this point as we particularly turn into the second half of this year. So the comparisons will be fine. What we really need to do is to grow the department store business to a healthier level. So I think there, the financial hits that we've had to take by eliminating profitable off-price sales, that is behind us, particularly as we get out of this first quarter. And that's completely behind us and shouldn't be a real topic of discussion as we go forward. So I feel good about where we are, and I think as we grow that jeans regular price business, we'll be -- it will be in balance with the rest of the Calvin Klein businesses over the next 2 years.

Good morning. Joining me on the call are Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Senior Vice President on Business Development and Investor Relations.
Overall, we were quite pleased with our results for the first quarter, which exceeded our earnings guidance by $0.10 per share. In the first quarter, on a constant currency basis, revenues increased 3% and EPS grew 20%. This outperformance was driven by strong underlying results in our international Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses. At the same time, we did see softness in our U.S. Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses where a strong U.S. dollar negatively impacted international tourist spending.
Moving on to Calvin Klein. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 5% while operating earnings increased 25% in the first quarter, driven by the strong performance of our international businesses. The Calvin Klein brand initiatives are taking hold, and we continue to be pleased with our latest Justin Bieber spring campaign and our recently announced Denim Series featuring Kendall Jenner. We believe we are beginning to connect with a much younger consumer.
Moving into the second quarter. Our international businesses continue to post strong sales gains. International retail comp store sales are running ahead of plan in the second quarter and are trending up high single digits in Europe, while our Asia business is posting mid-single-digit increases. We are seeing particular strength in China, France, the U.K. and the Middle East. In Europe, the Calvin Klein wholesale business continues to improve with our 2015 spring and fall order books, excluding Russia, up about 10% over the prior year. 
In North America in the second quarter, our Calvin Klein retail comps are running flat and on plan. We are seeing strong sales in our permanent population stores while stores located in tourist destination locations like Miami, Orlando, New York and Las Vegas are feeling the pressure from weaker international tourist traffic and spending.
Speaking on some product initiatives. On Calvin Klein underwear. Globally, we continue to drive our Iconic basics while delivering new, elevated product. In men's, we have launched 2 new programs globally for spring, Intense Power and Air Fx, and we are seeing very strong first quarter selling, which has continued into the second quarter. Overall, the Calvin Klein North America men's underwear business has gained 300 basis points of market share in the first quarter. As a reminder, Intense Power is what Justin Bieber was featured in, and which has sold so well at retail. Air Fx is more of a performance underwear, which taps into what is happening broadly in the active arena.
In the women's area, our Modern Cotton logo product leverages the best of what Calvin Klein underwear does for men and translate it -- translates it for women's with an active appeal. Modern Cotton continues to drive the improvement in our women's business in North America and Europe. Overall, our Calvin Klein North America women's intimate business has gained over 200 basis points of market share in the first quarter of 2015. 
We continue to see great performance from our elevated Black Label product across both men's and women's in Asia and Europe. Our women's bra business in Asia continues to outperform the competition through the tailored bra category in both the push-up and solutions category. Overall sales for Asia in the first quarter ran up mid-single digits at retail and a strong sales trend has continued into the second quarter.
Moving into Calvin Klein jeans. The new product that we have delivered we are seeing a strong reaction from the consumer, particularly where we have installed new jeans shops. We continue to see men's outpace women's across North America and Europe, but women's continues to see an improvement. In North America, in the newly installed shops, we experienced a 25% retail sales increase over the prior year. First quarter overall AURs were up about 10% and that trend continues into the second quarter of 2015. We are targeting 150 new jeans shops installations in North America for fiscal 2015.
In Europe, we are in the early stages of a turnaround in the jeans business. We have significantly improved the quality level of our jeans line with better fabrics, trends and packaging. This has resulted in strong sell-throughs and higher AURs in the first quarter with growth across all European markets, excluding Europe -- excluding Russia. Second quarter jeans sales trends in Europe have continued to improve and are running up high single digits.
Moving to our Tommy Hilfiger business. Revenues on a constant currency basis increased 1% in the first quarter. The increase was driven by solid performance in our international business, including a 2% increase in European retail comp store sales. In North America, revenues declined 1% resulting from a 3% decrease in retail comp store sales. As with Calvin Klein, we experienced the decline in international tourist traffic and spending in our Tommy U.S. stores. Operating earnings on a constant currency basis decreased 6% in the first quarter due to weak international tourist traffic in the U.S., which drove more promotional selling and higher markdowns.
Moving into the second quarter. We have seen significant improvement in our Tommy Hilfiger sales trends. Retail comp store sales at Tommy have accelerated in the second quarter with international comps up mid-single digits and North America comp store sales up low single digits. In Europe, we have seen a significant improvement on our men's side of the business across all key categories, in particular, in our largest market, Germany. We believe we continue to outperform in men's in denim relative to the market, and our Women's Wear business is also seeing improvement quarter-to-date.
At wholesale, our Tommy European business continues to outperform the competition. As an indicator, our 2015 full year European order books, excluding Russia, are running up about 5% for the year. The strongest performing regions continue to be Germany, France and the Middle East.
Moving to our Heritage business. First quarter revenues for the Heritage business increased 5% while operating earnings increased $5 million over the prior year. This increase is principally driven by a shift in the timing of shipments to the first quarter of 2015 from the second quarter of that year -- of this year and also driven by a strong retail comp store increase for our Van Heusen business of about 14%. Our Heritage sportswear business continues to perform very well, both at wholesale and retail. We expect that our dress shirt business will continue to underperform through the first half of 2015. However, we believe that this business will significantly improve in the second half of the year.
Finally, we were very pleased to announce a $500 million 3-year stock buyback program, which reflects our confidence in our ability to generate strong free cash flow. Our first priority will be to continue to strategically invest in our 2 global powerhouse brands in order to fully maximize our organic growth opportunities.
That said, given our strong balance sheet and growing free cash flow, which we estimate to be up $450 million in 2015, we are confident that we have the financial flexibility to: one, acquire and take more direct ownership in certain Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger license businesses; continue to pay down debt; and return capital to our shareholders through our new stock buyback program.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Mike Shaffer, our CFO, to quantify further some of these results."

Driving revenues was our Calvin Klein business, which delivered a 5% increase over the prior year, fueled by an 8% increase in our Calvin Klein international business with comps of 10% benefiting in part from the timing of Chinese New Year. On a normalized basis, international comps were mid-single digits. 
Also favorably impacting the current quarter at Calvin Klein was the timing of wholesale shipments. Our Calvin Klein strategies are taking hold and we are seeing improved performance, particularly in our international businesses. Our Heritage business revenues were up 5%, also ahead of plan, but heavily influenced by earlier-than-planned wholesale shipments. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 1% and missed plan due to softness in the U.S., where a strong dollar negatively impacted international tourist spending.
Earnings per share for the first quarter was $1.50 and included a $0.27 negative impact related to foreign currency and expected weakness in our Russian business. Excluding this negative impact, EPS would have increased 20% over the prior year. Our quarter 1 EPS was $0.10 ahead of the top end of our guidance. The $0.10 beat versus our guidance was driven by $0.02 of taxes, $0.02 of favorable foreign currency and $0.06 related to the business performance, which was predominantly Calvin Klein and favorably impacted by the timing of shipments.
For the full year 2015, we raised our guidance and are now projecting earnings per share of $6.85 to $6.95. If we exclude the negative impact related to foreign currency and weakness in our Russian business of $1.25, our earnings per share growth is projected to be 11% to 12% over the prior year. Overall, we are projecting revenues of approximately $8 billion, which includes the negative impact of about $500 million related to foreign currency.
On a constant currency basis, we are projecting overall revenues to increase 3%. Overall operating margins are expected to increase about 20 to 30 basis points, excluding a negative impact of about 60 basis points due to foreign currency. 
Driving the growth, when excluding foreign currency, is the continued improvement in the Calvin Klein business, which is projecting revenues to grow 6% on a constant currency basis. We are also planning Calvin Klein operating margins to increase 70 to 80 basis points, excluding the negative impact of approximately 30 basis points of FX.
Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 3% on a constant currency basis with operating margins planned slightly down, excluding a negative impact of approximately 80 basis points of FX. 
Our Heritage business is planned to have a revenue decrease of 3% due mostly our exiting of the IZOD retail business in 2015. Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to increase about 60 to 80 basis points, driven by the second half planned turnaround of our dress shirt business. The impact of foreign currency on our Heritage businesses is relatively immaterial.
Interest expense for the year is planned to be between $100 million and $125 million (sic) [ $120 million to $125 million ] compared to the prior year of $139 million due to the average lower debt balances. Also favorably impacting interest for 2015 is the debt refinancing we completed in the second half of last year's first quarter.
We currently expect to generate approximately $400 million -- $450 million of free cash flow in 2015, which will be used to pay down debt of about $350 million and allow for license buybacks and stock repurchases under our newly announced plan.
Our tax rate for the year is planned at about 21.5% to 22%, which is in line with the prior year. 
Our revenue and earnings comparisons for the second quarter are heavily impacted by launches in the prior year for our Calvin Klein underwear business, which had a major repackaging initiative in last year's second quarter, as well as the initial selling of IZOD at Kohl's in our Heritage businesses. In addition, we saw earlier shipments in this year's first quarter versus the prior year and recognized about 25 shipments in quarter 1 that shipped in quarter 2 of last year. These launches, when coupled with earlier shipments, are driving flat overall revenues in the second quarter on a constant currency basis. 
By business, we're estimating second quarter revenues on a constant currency basis to increase 3% for Tommy, flat for Calvin and to decrease 8% for Heritage. 
Second quarter earnings per share is planned at $1.25 to $1.30 and includes approximately $0.30 of estimated negative impact for foreign currency and the decline in our Russia business. Excluding this negative impact, EPS is projected to increase 3% to 6% over the prior year. Interest expense is projected to be $30 million and taxes in the quarter about 19% to 20%. 
And with that, we'll open it up for questions."

I think the thing I'm most optimistic is about the product improvements that I see in the pipeline.

So I really feel as we get into the second half of this year into '17, into '16 as well, that you'll see more dramatic improvement in that business because of those initiatives. In addition, I think when you think about the overall market, the women's denim category has been under just greater pressure around this whole active at leisure trend in the market. So I think that's also pressured the women's business in a much stronger way. And I guess, is really -- we're starting to really better understand our consumer on the women's side, what drives their purchasing decisions and I think that our marketing campaigns are really starting to align with that, particularly with the Kendall Jenner campaign that just kicked off in the last month or 2. I think that's really starting to connect even more directly with our female consumer. So I feel very optimistic about what's going on. But clearly, we're seeing bigger improvements on the men's side of the business today."

I think now the question is to what degree, what opportunity is -- what opportunity that presents, what's the competitive positions that are out there. I think there's 2 things that go on. First is you raise ticket prices, sit down with your retail partners and that's what we're really in significant discussions with our key retail partners about, what they're seeing and where we are. And then also that, particularly in North America but around the globe in Europe, in particular, how much do we have to promote off of that and how much regular price selling will come off of that. So there's a number of levers to press and we're really going to determine that over the next 3 to 6 months as it plays itself out and we're trying to give ourselves much flexibility as we go forward. We'll also be testing in fall and holiday some price increases as we go forward to see how the market is receiving that. Competitively, we know a number of our competitors, particularly in Europe, are starting to move prices up for fall. We're following that trend and watching it very carefully. But we also want to make sure, as a market leader and in a turnaround situation with Calvin Klein, market share gains are critical to us so we want to make sure that we're not overpricing ourselves in the markets. We're really trying to bring a balance to it. But clearly, there will be an opportunity to raise prices in the spring 2016 time frame given what's going on competitively."

On the -- let's talk about Europe first. I think we have, on the Tommy side of the business in our own retail stores, each month in the first quarter as we move through the quarter, the retail comp performance improved. And as we've moved into May and just finished the month of May, that was by far the strongest month. So I think we're really starting to see improvements in the European overall environment. Our men's business is really working very strongly both on the sportswear side and the denim side of the men's category. And I think we just -- we're getting paid real dividends given our strong position in the market. Inventories are very clean, not a need to be overly promotional. So in Europe, given what's gone on in the external environment, Tommy's significant exposure to that European market, it is by far our largest market for Tommy. It's about 45% of our sales. So it is -- has a much bigger impact to the business as we went through what I would describe in 2014 a softer kind of environment, second half of the year into the beginning of this year. That seems -- the overall economic backdrop seems to be improving and our business seems to be capturing that. Hopefully, that continues. In North America, I think we are going to potentially struggle with this international tourist spending. The Tommy business had such a strong following internationally in the United States. That, that business, I think, was -- particularly in our biggest, most profitable stores, we're seeing traffic trends down in the 8% to 10% area in the Tommy Hilfiger business. And I think that -- although in the second quarter, that trend improved and I think some of that has to do, we believe, with the World Cup that we're up against last year where we saw a softer second quarter. I think that, that trend will probably continue into the third quarter of this year. As we get into the fourth quarter, which is by far our largest quarter for our retail business, the comparisons start to get easier. The differential from a currency point of view also starts to balance out a little bit. So we're hopeful, as we get into the late third quarter and into fourth quarter, that, that trend will start to improve. We've gotten a little bit more promotional in those tourist destination locations and we've seen a reaction to that and have been able to drive the comps on a very profitable basis there. So from the first quarter where our retail comps in the U.S. -- in North America were down about 3%, we're actually seeing them up 2% to 3% in the second quarter. So hopefully, that's a sign that we're starting to see an inflection point. But we'll have to watch it for a little bit more data as we move forward."

I think the European -- just purely on an operating basis -- operating margin basis, I think the biggest opportunity is Europe to see a significant improvement in the Calvin Klein margins. We have a $500 million Calvin Klein European business that is marginally profitable today from money-losing over the last 2 years. So our long-term target in Europe is to get that to about a 10% operating margin within the next 4 years. I think we're on track to deliver against that. The currency headwinds are just causing us some caution on that as we continue to look at the pressure that it's going to put from a costing point of view. But clearly, there's opportunities from pricing and better sell-throughs to significantly improve the Calvin Klein European operating margins. Putting it into perspective, Tommy Hilfiger European operating margins for the full year of 2014 were at 14% operating margins. So it's clearly, with a well-run business of some scale, there should be the opportunity to get to double-digit operating margins in Europe. Overall, I think we continue to talk about 15% operating margins for the Calvin Klein business. And as we bring in some of the licensing businesses, which carry almost 100% operating margins today, convert those into much larger direct control businesses in those parts of the world, you would expect that our operating margins in Latin America and Asia should be in the high teens as we go forward. So again, I think there continues to be that opportunity and overall goal to get our operating margins in Calvin Klein to about 15% and then take it from there."

I think retailers have planned it more tightly. So it's becoming a category that should be nicely profitable because there's not a real issue for us. Real focus on fall with all the retailers on the denim area. So I think you're going to see a lot of marketing around denim from -- by retailers and the wholesale community. And I think there's appetite on the consumer side in men's to really refill the -- to refill their closets, some real fashion statements that are going on there that I think that category overall will start to improve over the next 2 or 3 years and see significant improvement in 2015. Calvin men's business, in particular, I think I quoted the numbers, we're seeing double-digit increases. So clearly, we're gaining market share. But we have to be honest with ourselves, our market share, we've lost about 50% of our market share from where we were 4 or 5 years ago. So really recovering that, getting new doors that are opening in North America and larger footprints in some of the key doors in North America, I think, will be critical as that business goes forward. On the women's side, I think the improvement, from a category point of view, has not been as strong as in the men's side, but it has been an improvement. I think it's kind of flattish at this point. The best data that I see, you hear different things when we talk to different retailers, but I think, there, I think the pressure from the activewear at leisure side has been more intense on the women's side. And I think we're really seeing that business start to turn around on the women's side, but I think it's going to be behind the men's turnaround as we go forward. Our women's business, we're really seeing a lot of improvement. We're seeing it in denim bottoms, but we're also seeing it in nondenim bottoms with the jeans construction. So really seeing a big change there and we're trying to really take advantage of that both from a supply chain and a logistics point of view to really capture some of that innovation that's going on, on the women's side of the floor. So I -- it's better than it's been, but I still wouldn't characterize the jeans denim area as a hot category at this point. It's just not bleeding like it was and it seems to actually be slightly growing."

We really look at it as a balanced approach to return capital to our shareholders as appropriate and to also take care -- to take advantage of what we see as the growth, both in our Calvin and Tommy Hilfiger businesses. The opportunity to bring back license business, we think, is our #1 priority that we really have to go after. The way that lays itself out, given the nature and length of some of our license agreements, the buyback calls that we have in those license agreements, I think the triggering point to that is really 2016 that you really would see an impact from that. So we're working on that diligently. The opportunities from a geographic point of view continue to be Asia, and to some degree, Latin America. Those are both growth regions for both brands, both Calvin and Tommy, and they give us the greatest opportunity to take advantage of our operating platforms in those regions to really see some outsized growth as we move forward. So that would be our priorities. We're also looking at some product categories that would make some sense to either bringing in-house directly or to take a joint venture ownership position in those businesses, depending on the category and the region, what vehicle would make the most sense. But there's been no change in that being our #1 strategic priority, along with investing in the organic growth of the 2 global powerhouse brands."

But I think we -- as the year progresses and we turn into 2016, we are optimistic that we could actually see some small increases as we go forward there and really stop the bleeding in that country. In Spain, which is our other big Southern market, there's clearly been a change in the direction of the consumer spending habits there and we're seeing it with our biggest retail partner, El Corte Inglés. Our business in Spain is more of a wholesale or concession-driven model. We have some stores, but really not that significantly -- significant. It's really driven through El Corte Inglés and that business has improved significantly over the last 6 months. We're actually seeing the business and our order book grow in Spain and I would expect that, that would continue to happen. We're seeing it in the mid-single-digit kind of range. So I think the bleeding there has stopped and that gives us -- that's been a big market, particularly for Calvin and Tommy. So I think, hopefully, as we get into 2016, we should start to see improvement there as well."

So as we were buying contracts at that point and hedging as we go forward, that's -- it's kind of when I think you'll start to see some of the impacts. So we've talked about that, this year, fiscal 2015, that 70% or thereabouts of the foreign currency hit was translation and transaction was about 30%, but that 30% really sat predominantly in the second half of 2015. So there is going to be some pressure third, fourth quarter. We are trying to increase some prices there and to adjust some costing there, but I think that's where you'll start to see some of the pressure associated with it and not be able to really significantly offset some of the cost increases since they happened so quickly at that point. So early fall deliveries, we're not touching our retail prices at this point. As we get into -- resort deliveries that hit November, December, I think there we are trying to really change some of our pricing as we move forward and then to be even more aggressive as we get into 1.25 deliveries."

So there is a capacity issue and that's one of the reasons I don't see us being able to execute all of these in a 12- or 18-month period. These are going to have to be stretched out over a 3- to 4-year period beyond the [indiscernible] -- when the contracts come up. So clearly, we're looking at the opportunities that we feel we can execute best and that would deliver the most strategically and from a financial point of view. So we're doing that together with our management teams. And I think it's important for us to be diligent and prudent about how we bring these in. That'll be the key to success. I think rushing, especially where we have strong strategic partners in these regions, it's not like these are areas that are being mismanaged or the brand is not being treated appropriately or not seeing appropriate growth, this is really an opportunity to just capture more of that growth internally. So we're not under the pressure of we have a bad licensee or a bad strategic partner and we have to take them out. So I think the urgency of that, that might have created is not there. We clearly had that situation in India, in Australia and South America with the Warnaco acquisition and we moved very quickly to deal with that by replacing licensees or taking more direct control of those businesses. So I think that answers the question."

Yes, I think what we are seeing really is second half of the year, not necessarily second quarter, but second half of the year, we're seeing a significant improvement in business. We're seeing the Calvin Klein underwear business really to significantly start to grow, particularly on the women's side of the business. The Modern Cotton business really starts to take off second half of the business. Our bra business, in general, the opportunity, getting our supply chain in order to meet the demand as we start to roll those new programs out with our key retail partners, I think we feel very strongly about that and that's what's driving the big piece of the growth. Continuation of the jeans progression as we move forward is really starting to pay off. We have some significant store openings and -- throughout Asia that's driving the business. And as we get into the second half of the year, we're not up against a number of the launches that we had last year from a wholesale point of view. We have a significant fixture sell-in and that's first half of 2014 had a lot of fixture sell-ins. We saw the improvement in the Calvin Klein businesses because of that and we're up against it, but still putting up increases. As we get into the second half of the year, that fixture fill-in is behind us, both in North America and in Europe and I think our -- we really think there's a big opportunity for our direct EDI replenishment business, never out-of-stock businesses, particularly underwear, but also basic denim categories that we should be able to capture on the Calvin Klein side of the businesses. So that's really what's driving it. We think the big opportunity is really third and fourth quarter."

I think what's more important is that we need to get bigger square foot presentations, particularly in the top 150 doors in the United States. If you were to walk the floors in some of the best department stores in the United States and when you walk into a Macy's or if you walk into a Belk's or Dillard's and look at the Calvin Klein presentation, I think it's as strong as any brand in the market. But when I compare our presentation in men's sportswear, tailored clothing, dress shirts, with our jeans presentation, I would say it's 25% of the presentation that we get in sportswear on jeans and it doesn't -- that's not logical if we execute. We should be very -- with a brand like Calvin with its heritage in jeans on the men's side, our jeans shops should be as big as our men's sportswear shops around the country and they're currently running about 25% of that size. So performance will dictate getting more square footage, taking it from -- they're not building bigger stores. It's going to be taking it away step-by-step from some of our competitors. But over the last 5 years, we've given it up. It's the same thing on the women's side of the floor. If you look at the amount of space that G-III has captured in the major department stores in the United States with Calvin Klein and the kind of growth that they've experienced with the Calvin Klein brand, which has been high double-digit teens kind of growth, and if you look at our presentation in jeans, it's not 25% of what it is in some of the other categories. It's more like 10% or 15%. So we need -- although we've gotten position and now we're in the game and we've got the -- we have presentations to compete, we clearly have an opportunity to grow the square footage in North America and that is going to be the key to driving the success of the Calvin Klein business in jeans in this part of the world."

But I think that leveled out and as you get that behind you, unless there's another drop in currencies again, but I think at this level, I think that consumer finds their footing and I think the strength of the Tommy Hilfiger and the Calvin Klein business globally really allows us to capture that international tourist that travels to the United States consistently. And I think we should be in a better profit position. We should be better in 2016, late 2015 in managing the flow of the inventory into those stores, getting it right, less need to be maybe as promotional as we were in the first quarter of this year.

I think some of the places where you have seen softer business that may have been more impacted by the international tourists, I think those retailers are aggressively moving to get inventories down. We don't really have any bulge in inventory sitting anywhere. We've been very diligent about moving goods. We haven't -- our flow of goods hasn't really been impacted by the port situation. We got ahead of that and really was -- were moving goods to the Northeast and are really now just getting back to our normal balance of how goods are coming into the country. So we don't specifically see it. I think there are -- look, I think it continues to be promotional at retail. I think it's going to be a promotional Father's Day. And as we get into June and July, some -- nothing is really changing. But I don't see anything that would directly impact our business or the trends we're seeing at retail. So I think it's a little higher in some places than people would like, but I think they're taking steps to deal with it and I feel pretty good about that overall. Accessories, we kind of -- we always tend to just pull that together with our apparel businesses when we talk about comps, when we talk about trends only because we don't want to confuse people and start talking about big increases on, what I would say, 3 years ago were relatively small numbers but has become big businesses for us over the last 3 years, both at wholesale here in North America, our business is growing double digit with department stores -- with both Calvin and our Tommy Hilfiger business with department stores. And in our own retail stores, we've really grown the square footage associated with accessories. And that business has been healthy for us overall. I think that the accessories, in general, I think there is what I would say is the category is not as robust and I'm not speaking now about our business, I'm speaking just in general terms. I don't think we are as significantly exposed as some of our competitors to that category. We have a big, healthy business there that's doing well and I think there's runway in growth for us particularly as we're price positioned in the market. But I think there's -- the kind of growth that's been experienced the last 4 or 5 years, I think that growth, be it watches and jewelry or be it handbags directly, I think it's starting to level out in general. It's still a healthy business as long as you don't get into inventory problems and margins, particularly in a business like, for PVH, Calvin and Tommy where clearly accessory margins are much higher than our apparel margins. And we're an apparel company that has a complementary accessory business as opposed to an accessory business that's trying to develop some type of a lifestyle brand or apparel business. I think that's a much harder formula to navigate given the high operating margins in accessory versus probably half those kind of margins when you talk about apparel."

Let's talk about the licensing business, it was healthy both for Calvin and for Tommy. The Tommy business just continued good performance with a number of key businesses, particularly internationally is where we really saw it. Our Asia business continuing to do well and our South America business doing well. On the Calvin side, the real growth driver has been G-III, that continues. Also the men's tailored side of the business for both Calvin and Tommy continues to do very well for us, that's Peerless and Marcraft. G-III, on the women's side, they'll speak probably tomorrow, I think, on their call so they'll put more color on that. But we're seeing really healthy growth there. They are a great licensing partner and just do a fantastic job for us. On the off-price channel, we talked about it. The Warnaco business was overly dependent on the business in Europe and North America. In Europe, we are exactly where we want to be and the only business being done in the off-price channel is selling off clearance at the end of the season, which is normal as opposed to selling in business in season and treating it as if it was a department store account that's behind it. On the underwear business, we're exactly where we want to be from a channel or distribution diversification, very well-balanced. 80% of our business is being done in the regular price channel of distribution, exactly like we would want it to be. Premium positioning both in North America and Europe, that's very healthy. The jeans business has continued to be a story. We have the -- in North America, we're at the right sales level at this point as we particularly turn into the second half of this year. So the comparisons will be fine. What we really need to do is to grow the department store business to a healthier level. So I think there, the financial hits that we've had to take by eliminating profitable off-price sales, that is behind us, particularly as we get out of this first quarter. And that's completely behind us and shouldn't be a real topic of discussion as we go forward. So I feel good about where we are, and I think as we grow that jeans regular price business, we'll be -- it will be in balance with the rest of the Calvin Klein businesses over the next 2 years.
Okay. Thanks, Eric. I'd like to thank everybody for joining us. We look forward to speaking with you at our second quarter earnings call, which will be in August -- late August of this year. Everyone, enjoy their summer and have a great day. Bye-bye."

Overall, we were quite pleased with our results for the second quarter, which exceeded the top end of our earnings guidance by $0.07. In the second quarter, on a constant currency basis, revenues increased 2% and EPS grew 11%. In the first half of 2015, there were significant sales shifts into the first quarter and out of the second quarter that makes comparisons to the prior year somewhat confusing.
So from a brand and business perspective, I plan to review the first half results in order to give you a better sense of the underlying sales trends. Rest assured that Mike Shaffer, in his comments, will quantify and break down all of our second quarter financial results. Overall, for the first 6 months of 2015, on a constant currency basis, revenue increased 3% and EPS grew 16%. This outperformance was driven by strong underlying results in our international Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses. At the same time, we did see softness in our U.S. Calvin and Tommy retail businesses, where a strong U.S. dollar negatively impacted international tourist traffic and spending in some of our larger stores located in tourist destinations locations like Orlando, Las Vegas, Miami and in New York Metropolitan area. At the same time, our retail stores located in U.S. permanent population locations continued to post low to mid-single digits same-store sales increases, which we were very encouraged by.
Moving at each of the brand. Calvin Klein. Looking at the first half on a constant currency basis, our CK revenues increased 4% over the prior year's first half, driven by strong performance of our international businesses. From a retail comp sales perspective, international comps increased 6%, while North American comps increased 2% in the quarter and a half, despite being negatively impacted by the international tourist traffic and spending.
The Calvin Klein brand continues to gain traction and is increasingly becoming more visible, both digitally and at point-of-sale. Our 4 marketing campaigns are out now with in-store signage and media and marketing launching, as we speak. We have major initiatives before holiday.
For jeans, our Meet Me campaign is about sexting and hooking up, where we are digitally connecting with our consumer, which is right up the Calvin Klein DNA. For women's underwear, our campaign, the original Sext Me, features Kendall Jenner. Both campaigns are creating a lot of buzz around the market, and we are connecting with our consumers to drive our commercial business.
Globally, the Underwear business continues to gain share in each market. Interestingly, our women's underwear sales trends for the first half are outpacing our men's sales trends worldwide. Men's, with our key spring launches of Intense Power and Air FX, have been very well-received with great sell-throughs. And for fall, we just launched our magnetic waistband product with positively early indicators from sales.
In North America, we have seen our 2015 men's market share grow by over 200 basis points with growth across all of our major retail partners.
Moving to women's, our Modern Cotton logo product continues to be the big story for women, especially those under the age of 30. Along with our talent broad offering by region in which we have significantly grown over the last 12 months with our push-up styles leading the business in Asia, our perfectly fixed now leading the business in Europe and our new invisibles bra in North America driving sales grains. In North America, we have seen our 2015 women's market share grow by over 100 basis points with gross across all of our major retail partners.
Moving to Jeans. We continue to make very good progress around the jeans turnaround in North America and Europe. Women's jeans are still performing better than Men's, but our Women's business is significantly gaining traction. Over the last 12 months, we have installed in North America over 180 men's shops in over 100 women's shops, which are performing well above last year's levels. In Men's, we're looking at sales increases in those shops in excess of 30%. And in Women's, the sales are in excess of 25% in those shops. We have also expanded our distribution to include Urban Outfitters globally and Topshop in Europe.
These 2 retailers target a younger consumer than our traditional department store consumer. We've delivered some initial capsules for 6 25 and have seen significant sell-throughs with great performance at Urban, and we have seen significant reorders and expansion of doors as we move into the holiday season. We're very excited about this business as it opens our brand up to a much younger consumer. 
In Europe, we have seen a significant improvement in same-store sales, as well as where we have installed new shops or have refitted our existing base, particularly in London and Rome, our sales performance is running well ahead of our comps, which are in the double-digit area.
Our Calvin Klein Asia jeans business continues to be very healthy with solid performance throughout the first half, which is best documented by our comps store performance in that region. We have also seen very strong performance in many of the other Calvin Klein product categories.
For the first half of 2015, our Calvin Klein loyalty revenue has increased by over 11%. This strong performance is driven by our women's apparel, our women's footwear in our accessory businesses in those areas. These categories are posting mid-teens sales increases in all the major retailers throughout North America. This business is predominantly run by Jimlar and our partner, G-III, and they are seeing great sell-throughs at this time on those product categories.
Moving to Tommy Hilfiger. The business after the first half of 2015 revenues, on a constant currency basis, increased 3% over the prior year. The increase was driven by solid performance in our international businesses, which grew 4% in the first half of 2015, including a 6% comp store increase throughout Europe. At wholesale, our Tommy European business continues to outperform the competition. As an indicator, our 2015 full year European order books, excluding Russia, are running up 5% for the units. The strongest markets continue to be Germany, the U.K., France and the Middle East.
In North America, revenues increased 1%, resulting from retail square footage growth, partially offset by a 2% decrease in retail comp store sales. Our Tommy business continues to perform well despite the pressure on the retail business in U.S. market, primarily driven by the lack of international tourist in our tourist destination locations.
As we have previously mentioned, this fall, we have Rafa Nadal as our band ambassador. And boy, did he make a big splash in Bryant Park on Tuesday for the kickoff of our fall underwear and fragrance campaign. We believe that Rafa's association will be a positive for our overall men's business, but certainly, will leave our Underwear business globally. Our full order books reflects this uptick in our Underwear business, and Rafa will continue as our brand ambassador for spring 2015 where the focus will be on tailored clothing, and our initial order results in that category continue to be very strong.
Moving to our Heritage business. First half revenues for the Heritage businesses were relatively flat, while operating income increased about 3%. This increase was driven by our Heritage sportswear businesses, which continued to perform well, both at wholesale and retail. We have also see strong performance in our wonders core intimate business, particularly in the mid-tier channel distribution, where we have seen our year-to-date market share grow by over 100 basis points.
Our dress shirt business continues to perform -- underperform in the first half of the year. However, we believe that business will significantly improve in the second half of the year. New fall product deliveries, especially our Van Heusen flex collar, have seen strong early sell-throughs in August and give us confidence in our second half sales increases for dress shirts. 
Let me take a moment and talk about our early third quarter back-to-school sales trends. Our international Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger business continues to post strong sales. By region, we are seeing very strong performance for Europe and China for both brands. In Korea and Brazil, where we have a large Calvin Klein business, sales trends continue to be challenging, as we aren't being negatively impacted by the macroeconomic environment for each of those countries. Overall, international same-store sales are up mid single-digits at Tommy Hilfiger and are up low single-digit at our Calvin Klein business.
Moving to our wholesale business in Europe. Our order books for Spring 2016, excluding our Russia business, is projected to be up 4% to 5% at Tommy and is up about 15% at Calvin Klein, as our marketing initiatives are starting to pay dividends, along with our new product deliveries. In North America, we're dealing with a later back-to-school selling season due to weak later Labor Day holiday, which is making it more difficult to read the business.
Our retail same-store sales are running negative low single-digit at Calvin Klein and negative mid single-digit at Tommy Hilfiger. Those 2 businesses are running on plan given the later back-to-school season and are continued to be impacted by international tourist traffic and spending. Before I turn it over to Mike, I just want to focus on some of the key initiatives we outlined at the beginning of the year.
As we move over the next 3 years, our objectives will be capturing the long-term revenue and profit opportunities for our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands. There are really 4 key initiatives that we hope to accomplish over the next 3 years that you should be monitoring as we go forward.
The first is to continue to invest in product, presentation and the marketing of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands. Second, we continue to invest in our global operating platforms to support our growth strategies, including key investments in our general commerce systems and platforms.
Third, significantly improving operating results of the Calvin Klein European business over the next 3 years. Although we have seen strong performance in there, we believe we have a long way to go to reach the comparable levels of profitability that exist at our Tommy Hilfiger business in European market, and this is a big opportunity for us as we move forward.
And fourth is to continue to invest in the expansion of the presence of both brands in Asia and Latin America, including more direct control over the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger licensing businesses, where we can maximize our core competency to increase sales and improve the overall profitability of both brands.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Mike to quantify some of the second quarter results."

The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in the press release. On a constant currency basis, revenues for the second quarter were up 2% versus prior year and ahead of our guidance. Driving our revenue increase was our Calvin Klein business, which delivered a 3% constant currency increase over the prior year. Our Calvin Klein international business was up 7% in constant currency, driven by strong wholesale shipments and international retail comps of 3%. Our Calvin Klein strategies are taking hold, and we are seeing improved performance, particularly in gross margin and in our international businesses.
Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 5% in constant currency, also ahead of our guidance with strong revenues in our international business, which had revenues up 6% in constant currency and Europe comps of 9%. Our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein U.S. retail stores located in international tourist destinations continue to be under pressure from a lack of traffic and spending, but these declines were more than offset by performance in other areas of these brands.
Our Heritage business revenues were down 6%, also ahead of guidance and heavily influenced by the earlier than planned wholesale shipments, which benefited quarter 1, as well as the launch of IZOD of course in last year's second quarter.
Earnings per share for the second quarter was $1.37, a $0.31 negative impact related to foreign currency and expected weakness in our Russian business. Excluding this negative impact, EPS would have increased 11% over the prior year. Our Q2 EPS was $0.07 ahead of the top end of our guidance. The $0.07 beat was comprised of $0.10 related to business outperformance, which was predominantly at Calvin Klein and an interest expense benefit of $0.02, partially offset by $0.05 of headwinds related to taxes and FX.
For the full year 2015, we raised our guidance and are now projecting earnings per share of $6.90 to $7, which includes an additional $0.05 hit for foreign currency versus our previous guidance. If we exclude the negative impact related to foreign currency and weakness in our Russia business of $1.30, our earnings per share growth is projected to be 12% to 14% over the prior year. We also raised our revenue guidance. We are now projecting revenues to grow approximately 4% on a constant currency basis. Overall, operating margins are expected to increase about 10 to 20 basis points, excluding a negative impact of about 60 basis points due to foreign currency.
Driving the growth, when excluding foreign currencies continued improvement in the Calvin Klein business, which is projecting revenues to grow 8% on a constant currency basis. We also plan in Calvin Klein operating margins to increase 80 to 90 basis points, excluding a negative impact of approximately 40 basis points of FX.
Tommy Hilfiger revenues have planned to increase 4% on a constant currency basis with operating margins planned down 60 to 70 basis points, excluding a negative impact of approximately 80 basis points of FX. Tommy Hilfiger international operating margins are planned up with North America operating margins planned down after excluding FX. This is due to pressure on U.S. stores located in international tourist locations.
Our Heritage business is planned to have a revenue decrease of 3%, due mostly to our exiting the IZOD retail business in 2015. Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to increase about 70 to 80 basis points. The impact of foreign currency in our Heritage businesses is relatively material.
Interest expense for the year is planned to be about $120 million and compares to the prior year amount of $139 million, due to our average lower debt balances. Also favorably impacting interest for 2015 is the debt refinancing we did in last year's first quarter. We currently expect to generate approximately $450 million of free cash flow in 2015. This will be used to pay down debt of about $350 million and allow for opportunistic stock repurchases and the license buybacks.
Our tax rate for the year is planned at about 21.5%. Our revenue for the third quarter is planned at 3% on a constant currency basis. By business, we're estimating the third quarter revenues, on a constant currency basis, to increase 7% for Calvin, 4% for Tommy Hilfiger and to decrease 5% for Heritage brands. Heritage Brands revenues are being negatively impacted by the closing of our IZOD retail division.
Third quarter earnings per share is planned at $2.45 to $2.50 and includes approximately $0.40 of estimated negative impact for foreign currency and the decline in our Russia business. Excluding this negative impact, EPS is projected to increase 11% to 13% over the prior year. Interest expense for the quarter is planned at $30 million and taxes about 18% in the third quarter.
And with that, we'll open it up to questions."

Our business in China, both for Calvin that we operate directly, our comps have been running between mid single-digits to high single-digit for the first 6 months of the year. And that trend has more or less continued into through August so far. The challenge, as trying to operate that business is trying to get beyond a lot of the noise that's going on from the stock market point of view and where we see the business moving and going. So you can't help but look at our business and be a little bit more conservative about how we project that business out, both for the balance of this year and then moving into 2016 and beyond. So it just gives us pause. We've seen how the luxury market has been hit from a sales point of view. We haven't experienced anything like that. I think our brands, both Calvin and Tommy, are very well-positioned in that market. It's premium brands, affordable luxury. So I think that works to our advantage, and we are -- we have strong brands that are really executing. So from that point. On point 2 on Tommy, potentially, we're acquiring the 55% on the Tommy Hilfiger license business that we don't own throughout China, which is very healthy and very profitable. I don't think -- I try not to make those macro issues really impact that decision strategically. It makes all the sense in the worked for us to own that business. I think, from a valuation point of view, although that market has taken hits, if you look at PEs valuations, it's still relatively high. So we will be diligent as we look at that. But clearly, one of our goals would be to all own that business sooner rather than later. It just makes too much sense from a brand point of view. And I think, financially, it should be a nice transaction for us."

I think geographically, I think it's much more of a northeast, southeast phenomena with the whole back-to-school in being somewhat later. I think, as you move across the country, some of those schools come back earlier. And since most of our retail and ourselves have a concentration of business in those regions, it's having a significant impact on trying to read business.

So we're really seeing the kind of sales performance that we've seen at retail with jeans and underwear. As you can imagine, when you get into kind of sales increases we've gotten, we've been chasing business all year. We really get into a position where we could fulfill at what we would feel like an acceptable rate of the consumer demand. I think underway, which is a replenishment business, really stopped as we get into the holiday season probably late September, early October. So I think you're seeing a bit of that. So really healthy trends in the underlying business. We also had some pretty significant square footage growth in Calvin and Tommy, to a degree, due to the transfer of our -- in North America, of our IZOD stores to the Calvin Klein underwear and accessory stores. So square footage growth there that will really come in the holiday selling season, which is very strong. And then last thing is internationally, even with all the strength, we are going to benefit in the fourth quarter, like everyone else, from early Chinese New Year, which really impacts a lot of the Asia markets. It's about 2 to 3 weeks earlier this year. And you'll get -- you get 2 things happen. You'll get earlier actual retails sales in the stores we are operating. But also because of the early Chinese New Year, wholesale shipments are falling into January out of February. So a little bit of a timing shift there that we have to just deal with every year with Chinese New Year. But underlying business just continues to be very strong. Looking into '16, we're not getting into all the guidance discussion about it. But obviously, there's more momentum in the Calvin Klein business. And we think that momentum will help us offset, partially offset some of the headwinds we're seeing with continued pressure on FX, particularly on the transaction basis going forward from inventory purchases in some of our foreign markets, Europe, Brazil, Mexico and Canada. So we've talked about those issues. So that's in front of us in '16."

So I mean, that is what -- at this point, what that might pretend as the world -- as you extrapolate that and if there's more pressure along the Chinese currency, clearly, that might make an opportunity for fall '16 and beyond. But right now, at this point, with the pressure we're seeing on labor rates, offset by some currency benefits, it's very marginal just on that particular front. You hit the 3 buckets we really are trying to focus on. As you can imagine, the challenge, the biggest challenge we're looking at is how aggressive to raise prices, particularly in a world that as you look out that is facing extraordinary deflation area of pressure in just general terms across where most economies speak, the biggest concern is deflation, not inflation. So the challenge we're facing, although our cost increases, say, in Europe or Canada, are increasing anywhere from 12% to 18% because of a big piece of that being in currency, offset by some products savings, how much can you raise prices in 1 season? And that continues to be an ongoing discussion with our retail partners. And we'll give more color to that as we get into the end of the third quarter going to the fourth quarter. But we talked about that there'll be pressure in the neighborhood just in a pure mathematical basis, in excess of $1 a share in 2016. And we're hoping to be able to offset -- partially offset some of that. So that's what we have right now, David."

We have the pipeline in the sourcing network in order to go really after the business in '16 if it really starts to roll out.

And then, I guess, fundamentally, currencies are usually -- I mean, there's a lot -- I don't want to play economist, but those are usually indicative of what's going on in the underlying economies. So on a -- as we -- the biggest market for us is Europe. It's gone through some macro issues. But we're actually seeing positive sales trends in Europe. We believe that economy is coming back and that consumer is reengaging. The challenge we are facing in Europe with '16 will be cost increases that are double-digit cost increases and how much of that is reasonable in 1 or 2 seasons to pass on to the consumer. That's the biggest challenge we're facing in Europe. As you get into some of the other markets that you talked about, some of the emerging markets, Brazil. Brazil for us has been, for Calvin Klein in particular and Tommy, just really getting started with a joint venture there. We've seen over the last 5 years dramatic growth in that market. But clearly, as we're planning 2016, we're planning that business flat to down slightly. And that is just different than what we've had to do over the last 5 years. And it's totally a reflection of what's going on in that macroenvironment, how that consumers being impacted by everything politically and economically that's going on in that business. So I think in some regards, given that we were -- we as an international brand are really a pioneer in Brazil developing a business, we're probably more impacted by that business as we go forward. The China market continues to be a growth market for us. We continue to expand there. We continue to add square footage. We continue to expand our brand offering throughout China, both Calvin and Tommy, as those businesses develop. The challenge there is it's more of what's going to happen question and how much growth is there. Clearly, this is not the heydays of 3 years ago, where from 2007 through 2010, the business grew 15% top line. We're planning the business to grow more mid single-digit. I think that's reasonable. We are currently outperforming that. But there's just a lot of noise in the environment. So I guess, the biggest thing we're dealing with is uncertainty and what that does, potentially does to the consumer? How that forces us to plan our business and reacting to the macro environment. But I think as a brand, as a company, we are as well-positioned as anyone to really weather those headwinds. Our portfolio of brands gives us diversification. Our geographic diversification is second to none, which I think is the long-term success, although we miss a market. The more of North America you are the better you are. But I think on a long-term basis, being the global powerhouse brand is the place to be. So we're just dealing with a lot of those macro issues. That's the biggest headwind we're dealing with."

Add it all up, $150 million in sales, just taking everything into consideration. It's a growing dramatically, but again, off of a small base. And we really target that as a growth area. The -- in the Calvin Klein area in particular, if you think about 3 Warnaco acquisition, we were a licensor. And getting the model right internationally for -- in e-commerce platform, direct e-commerce platform, was very difficult as a licensee with so many different partners doing business, and Warnaco being the biggest partner at the time. Postacquisition, that focus has completely changed. We now control probably, in apparel, we probably control 65% of the categories today, and with our relation with G-III are able to really aggressively go after the women's area as well. So that's been the area where the biggest investments have been made. We now have active, highly functioning, performing e-commerce direct-to-consumer platforms China throughout most of Asia. Europe, launching in Brazil, launching in Mexico. North America, obviously, both brands Tommy and Calvin, are really are there. And now we're making those connections with the consumer that needs to be made, not only from a commercial point of view. But today, I would say, between Calvin and Tommy, 60% of our marketing budget are directed at digital marketing and connecting with consumer there, converting them to our in-store platforms, our wholesale customers in-store online platforms or our own brick and mortar stores as well. So it's really a 360 campaign. It's requiring capital investment, there's no doubt about it. But that's just a price of growth and where we are, and it's factored into all of our plans as we go forward. So it's a big opportunity. And it's both an opportunity for us to sell direct to the consumer, but it will also sell through our key wholesale accounts on e-commerce platform, where we're really seeing growth. And if you look at our dot-com business with some of our partners, those businesses are up depending on the player, anywhere from 30% to 50%. So clearly, our penetration continues to grow online."

We're seeing much better sell-throughs, more regular price sell-throughs or prices that are first kind of markdown. Denim tends -- is a category that will be promoted no matter what your brand is. But I think what we're really seeing is it's been a cycle for the last going into this year, last 3 or 4 years, where, particularly in the Women's side. Men's has been more stable. But women's in particular, it's really been a sharp decline in overall market share in denim. And what that really done is, as you move through the seasons were inventory and historically have been building up, it's required more promotions, more clearance and a real take down in AURs overall for the season. For the first to last 9 months in our Jeans business, our AURs are up about 20% in men's and women's. In North America, I think that's a sign of the health in the overall denim market, but also a lot of the initiatives that we have in place that have moved the product outcome improved the product up. I am optimistic about the category as you move forwards because it's an important category at every retail and it's historically been one of their most profitable categories. So there's a real focus on continuing focus in that area. And on the women's side, in particular, there's been a lot of product innovation around stretch jeans, really try to take advantage of that whole at leisure as it relates to a denim component of that. So we're really starting to see the knit jeans really starting to become a bigger component of the business as well. So for Calvin, we've always had a very healthy tops denim business, which is -- seems counter intuitive. It's really about reestablishing our bottoms items business, where we are a significantly under developed against the competitive set. We're most of our competitive set like Levi's and some of the other brands, denim bottoms will represent well in excess of 50% of their overall sale. And for Calvin, it's been hovering around 30%, moving into 40%. So this is huge bottoms opportunity that I think our fits now are much more well defined and consumer starting to refine us. And I think it's like anything else with denim, it's really a fit issue as well, as that consumers starts to wear the products, start to have a positive response to product, they become a more loyal consumer. And I think we're price positioned right in the sweet spot of the market. We are not sitting at some $200 denim prestige that represents 5% of the market. We are at a designer denim jean that's going out the door $59 to $89 in North America. That's a real sweet spot for all department stores and we really starting to see it."

It could be very profitable. But even more important is what it means about the brand and your positioning with the consumer. And I think, obviously, all the -- every major department store, both in Europe and North America, when you sit down with them, where they continue to talk about is trying to continue to try to attract a younger consumer. I don't think it's a surprise to anyone that department stores tend to skew somewhat older. And I think as your brand can be more -- the Calvin brand continues to be more relevant to a younger consumer, given our strong position in some of these specialty retailers. I think -- and our strong underwear components, which is usually introduction to a consumer. That is, by far, our youngest consumer. If you have that in action between underwear and jeans, I think your brand now becomes more relevant to younger consumer. So the opportunity with some of the retailers you talked about, Urban Outfitters, with the Topshop, particularly the buccal as we move forward, some other players, opening ceremony you mentioned, it's as much -- it's as important as it is commercially. It's also very important from a brand positioning point of view, how we connect with a younger consumer, how we connect digitally, how we sell online to that consumer? So we're seeing really great growth there and just makes our brand relevant to the consumer. And I think it makes us a cool brand that we'll see stronger sell-throughs. It's just, I think, another indication of if we're in that channel of distribution, the product has to be right. You don't get accepted into that channel of distribution unless your product is positioned appropriately."

You could make a case of while as we move into August, your comps have decelerated from plus 9 to mid single-digits. But I think some of the fact is the fact that it was such a successful first half of the year, full-price selling that we had significantly less merchandise to promote and sell off during the traditionally sales season throughout Europe. So we just weren't as aggressive in July and August from a promotional calendar because we didn't need to be. And I think we manage our gross profit. So as returning into August and that's starting to wind down, we're seeing business continue to improve. So I think it's -- I think there's 2 things going on. I really think our line is fantastic. I think the consumer's connecting with. I think the product is right. But I also think that there's also something just going on in the overall environment in Europe. I think there's 2 basic things. I think the environment is improving. And I think because of the currency situation that's going on, I think a lot more Europeans are staying home. And by staying home, you mean they're vacationing this summer within Continental Europe, where the euros are buying more were if they come to the United States, they're getting everything else. The hotel and food just from a currency point of view, is up 20% to 25%. So I think we're benefiting from that. We're also, I think benefiting from the fact that the -- that our Chinese consumer, they should consumer, instead of being in the United States more so in Europe, and as you -- I was in Paris and I was in Amsterdam this last month, you can see the tourist and Wilmer that's going on there and helping their economy. So long ended way to say. I think the underlying product and the brand strength continues to be second to none, particularly in Europe for the Tommy Hilfiger brand. And then I think the environment continues to improve and that consumer is back out opening up their wallets and spending money, and we're getting a larger share of that."

So they're that ongoing issues. And I've also talked about the fact that we've been chasing business constantly. So you don't necessarily see it all on the top line. Although where we have some top line growth, which are really seen, I think, in the operating margins in business, despite the currency -- the currency impact, which is taking that away. But the operating margins of the business just continues to improve. So I think the inflection point I touched on is really fourth quarter. I think you'll start to see that more.

So -- but again, not to put too definite a timeframe on things. Nothing has really changed. Buyback licenses is a delicate situation. You had a partner usually for a number of years that's built the business and clearly, it's creating value to the brand and to themselves. So there needs to be a reasonable negotiation that goes on. So that you secure a business and don't have -- you don't want to have a situation where you break a license or just terminate license at the end and just take back a business. I think there's too many example of that we want to be leaving money on the table and hurt the underlying business. And that's not our goal. Our goal is to negotiate fair, reasonable transaction with our partners. And to do it in a way that doesn't economically hurt them. But more importantly, from our perspective is really give them some business that's on-going momentum and then as we go forward. And that's the push and the pull that goes on there. So clearly, the biggest driver of that is licensing term. Somebody's got 2 to 3 years ago on license and you clearly give them an indication that the plan is to bring a back in. That's a very reasonable negotiation to go on. Some of them are 8 to 10 years or 20 years and depending on the situation. It's a much more challenging discussion similar to these kind of discussions we have with Warnaco when we wanted to buy their business back besides the complication of being a public company, it was a very long-term license. So there was much more value there that had to be determined. So this is really about sitting down with partners with more or less, for the most part, short-term licenses balances less probably only accepted is China, where really, are trying to come up with a reasonable way and a smooth transition. So I believe, over the next -- over '15 and '16, we'd be very disappointed if you haven't seen some progress in that area. And we're beginning process of being some of those businesses in. And ringnecked start, I think it become obvious what the next potential licensee take that to be. Those would be very strategic and accretive transactions as we move forward."

But the -- if you walk into the store, the exposure has just grown. So there's been a continuing expansion of the square footage. And that's directly aligned with new product innovations, new products that's been delivered. On the women's side of the business, we always had a very strong bottoms, panties business. The focus is really been to grow the bra business, which from a price point is 4x the unit cost of panties. So the growth is really been to really try and grow that square footage. So if you went to Macy's Herald Square, you'll see a women's shop that's 20 -- that's 2,500 square feet. You'll see a men's shop that's 2,500 square feet. We are clearly the -- their largest brand there and I think the best positioning on the floor. On men and on women's trying to move the number 2, 3 position for the #1 for that store from a sales volume point of view. So that's really been the opportunity. We're so dominant in men's. I think men's will continue to grow nicely. But to be honest, the bigger market opportunity for us is women's. Markets much bigger and our market share, although significant, is not nearly as dominant as it is in men's. So the -- that opportunity is really in front of us to grow. In Europe, it's been a growth in customer, better retail presentation, better customer presentation, true to cleaning up of the brand into department stores in key specialty stores. Offsetting that has been getting out of the off-price channel in getting out of some terrible distribution that they were in -- that the brand was in. So that's been a balancing act. But what you really seeing in the last 6, 9 months, the growth that you've seen in the business is really been driven by both square footage growth, which we think will continue, and also growing the customer base, which we also think will continue throughout Europe. In Asia, we basically -- it's basically a retail business, whether that's our own stores or department store concession business. And there, we continued to open doors. It continues to be the player in the market. We continue to raise AURs throughout Asia, lifting the product up a black label product has gone from 3% of the business in Asia to today, 10% with a goal to get to 20%. That product is price positioned a good 30% to 40% higher than our base business. So those are the initiatives that really driven the presence of underwear and the market share gains by region."

I think there's -- if you look at the number of centers in the outlet environment, the number of centers significantly skews towards permanent population location. Good, solid store that this year continue to comp overall single-digit comp store increases. So probably 2% to 4% kind of growth in that market. Healthy, along with the American consumer, I think being healthy. So the channel continues to be just, from our perspective, very, very healthy. What is going on is there are 15 key centers around the country in these tourist destination locations that are extraordinarily large. Think of Harry in New York in this location, think of Orlando down in Florida, where the normal size of the store is 5 to 10x a largest average store in the permanent location. Those are the in-store in the channel that are being impacted most dramatically. And I think the brands that are being impacted most dramatically are the global brands. Our sales, Calvin and Tommy, we talked about. I guess, Ralph Lauren has talked about. Coach has talked about to a degree. So some of it -- if you're a global player that really attracts a global consumer in those centers, like Orlando or Harriman, your customer base in those centers for those brands, 50% of the credit card sales are international tourist, from South America, Europe and Asia. If that -- if tourism is down in the United States, which we know just in general terms, it is, those are the centers that are being impacted. And those 15 or so centers are the ones, because of the size of their business, are being dragged down accordingly because of that. As we look out, we believe as we get into the fourth quarter of '15 and clearly, the into the first quarter of '15, we saw the anniversary of that business. And it should become less and less of an issue for us. But clearly, third quarter is going to continue to be an issue. Last year, our comps for both Calvin and Tommy were high single-digit positive comps in North America. So we're up against some of our most challenging comps in the third quarter driven by that international tourism. So that's the best I can do for you. There is really nothing at all along that channel distribution. It's like saying there's a problem with Herald Square Macy's because tourism is down in Macy's. It's still the largest department store in the world and probably the most profitable department store in the world, but it is being impacted by just tourism trends."

The last 5 years at Warnaco, that business was 0 in one way. You need to be cool. You need to be connected. And the Calvin Klein product wasn't cool, wasn't cutting-edge. There was other brands that was much hotter. And we were living of -- the that business was living off the Heritage of the brand. And all depends on all off-price channel the submission. I think a 1 minute what's indicated was broadly about the fact that we are in Urban Outfitters, we are in Topshop, is the brand, the product is connecting with that younger consumer. Combination of our marketing and how we really gone after that market, combination of the product and what it is and that it's executing, and we're seeing really strong sell-throughs. The product income if you walk just going to Urban Outfitters you don't see presentation of Calvin that you have never seen before. It's going to be front and center. I would tell you, it's still relatively a very small business. But is great in a lot of buzz and its holding or department store business. And then finally, I think is also very important. Look, our partner channel distribution department stores. They want to continue to attract the younger consumer. So it's important to really -- really one of those brands, particularly Calvin, that skews younger the department store customer. I think its accommodation of our Underwear business and our jeans business that does that are our department store cap. So the same time, just go die more muncher. So we will have differentiated product and services the needs of both of those consumers from a fit point of view and from a steady point of view. So I think that -- hopefully, that makes it clear what that channel is -- why that channel is important.

Overall, we are quite pleased with our results for the second quarter, which exceeded the top end of our earnings guidance by $0.07. In the second quarter, on a constant currency basis, revenues increased 2% and EPS grew 11%. In the first half of 2015, there were significant sales shifts into the first quarter and out of the second quarter that makes comparisons to the prior year somewhat confusing.
So from a brand and business perspective, I plan to review the first half results in order to give you a better sense of the underlying sales trends. Rest assured that Mike Shaffer, in his comments, will quantify and break down all of our second quarter financial results. 
Overall, for the first 6 months of 2015, on a constant currency basis, revenue increased 3% and EPS grew 16%. This outperformance was driven by strong underlying results in our international Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses. At the same time, we did see softness in our U.S. Calvin and Tommy retail businesses where a strong U.S. dollar negatively impacted international tourist traffic and spending in some of our larger stores located in tourist destination locations like Orlando, Las Vegas, Miami and the New York Metropolitan area. At the same time, our retail stores located in U.S. permanent population locations continued to post low to mid-single-digit same-store sales increases, which we were very encouraged by.
Moving into each of the brands. Calvin Klein. Looking at the first half, on a constant currency basis, our CK revenues increased 4% over the prior year's first half, driven by strong performance of our international businesses. From a retail comp sales perspective, international comps increased 6%, while North American comps increased 2% in the quarter and the half despite being negatively impacted by the international tourist traffic and spending.
The Calvin Klein brand continues to gain traction and is increasingly becoming more visible both digitally and at point-of-sale. Our fall marketing campaigns are out now with in-store signage and media and marketing launching, as we speak. 
We have major initiatives for fall holiday. For jeans, our Meet Me campaign is about sexting and hooking up where we are digitally connecting with our consumer, which is right up the Calvin Klein DNA. For women's underwear, our campaign, The Original Sexy, features Kendall Jenner. Both campaigns are creating a lot of buzz around the market, and we are connecting with our consumers to drive our commercial business.
Globally, the underwear business continues to gain share in each market. Interestingly, our women's underwear sales trends for the first half are outpacing our men's sales trends worldwide. 
Men's, with our key spring launches of Intense Power and Air Fx, have been very well received with great sell-throughs. And for fall, we just launched a magnetic waistband product with positively early indicators from sales. In North America, we have seen our 2015 men's market share grow by over 200 basis points with growth across all of our major retail partners.
Moving to women's. Our Modern Cotton logo product continues to be the big story for women, especially those under the age of 30. Along with our tailored bra offering by region in which we have significantly grown over the last 12 months with our push-up styles leading the business in Asia, our perfectly fit style leading the business in Europe and our new invisibles bra in North America driving sales grains. In North America, we have seen our 2015 women's market share grow by over 100 basis points with growth across all of our major retail partners.
Moving to jeans. We continue to make very good progress around the jeans turnaround in North America and Europe. Women's jeans are still performing better than men's, but our women's business is significantly gaining traction. Over the last 12 months, we have installed in North America over 180 men's shops and over 100 women's shops, which are performing well above last year's levels. In men's, we're looking at sales increases in those shops in excess of 30%, and in women's, the sales are in excess of 25% in those shops. We have also expanded our distribution to include Urban Outfitters globally and Topshop in Europe. These 2 retailers target a younger consumer than our traditional department store consumer. We've delivered some initial capsules for 6 25 [ph] and have seen significant sell-throughs with great performance at Urban and we have seen significant reorders and expansion of doors as we move into the holiday season. We're very excited about this business as it opens our brand up to a much younger consumer. 
In Europe, we have seen a significant improvement in same-store sales as well as where we have installed new shops or have refitted our existing base, particularly in London and Rome, our sales performance is running well ahead of our comps, which are in the double-digit area.
Our Calvin Klein Asia jeans business continues to be very healthy with solid performance throughout the first half, which is best documented by our comp store performance in that region. 
We have also seen very strong performance in many of the other Calvin Klein product categories. For the first half of 2015, our Calvin Klein royalty revenue has increased by over 11%. This strong performance is driven by our women's apparel, our women's footwear in our accessory businesses in those areas. These categories are posting mid-teens sales increases in all the major retailers throughout North America. This business is predominantly run by Jimlar and our partner, G-III, and they are seeing great sell-throughs at this time on those product categories.
Moving to Tommy Hilfiger business. After the first half of 2015, revenues on a constant currency basis increased 3% over the prior year. The increase was driven by solid performance in our international businesses, which grew 4% in the first half of 2015, including a 6% comp store increase throughout Europe. At wholesale, our Tommy European business continues to outperform the competition. As an indicator, our 2015 full year European order books, excluding Russia, are running up 5% for the year. The strongest markets continue to be Germany, the U.K., France and the Middle East.
In North America, revenues increased 1%, resulting from retail square footage growth, partially offset by a 2% decrease in retail comp store sales. Our Tommy business continues to perform well despite the pressure on the retail business in the U.S. market, primarily driven by the lack of international tourists in our tourist destination locations.
As we have previously mentioned, this fall, we have Rafael Nadal as our brand ambassador, and boy, did he make a big splash in Bryant Park on Tuesday for the kickoff of our fall underwear and fragrance campaign. We believe that Rafa's association will be a positive for our overall men's business, but certainly will lift our Underwear business globally. Our fall order books reflect this uptick in our Underwear business, and Rafa will continue as our brand ambassador for spring 2015 where the focus will be on tailored clothing and our initial order results in that category continue to be very strong.
Moving to our Heritage business. First half revenues for the Heritage businesses were relatively flat while operating income increased about 3%. This increase was driven by our Heritage sportswear businesses, which continued to perform well, both at wholesale and retail. We have also seen strong performance in our Warner's core intimate business, particularly in the mid-tier channel distribution where we have seen our year-to-date market share grow by over 100 basis points.
Our dress shirt business continued to perform -- underperform in the first half of the year. However, we believe that business will significantly improve in the second half of the year. New fall product deliveries, especially our Van Heusen flex collar, have seen strong early sell-throughs in August and give us confidence in our second half sales increases for dress shirts. 
Let me take a moment and talk about our early third quarter back-to-school sales trends. Our international Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger business continues to post strong sales. By region, we are seeing very strong performance for Europe and China for both brands. In Korea and Brazil, where we have a large Calvin Klein business, sales trends continue to be challenging, as we aren't being negatively impacted by the macroeconomic environment for each of those countries. Overall, international same-store sales are up mid-single digits at Tommy Hilfiger and are up low single digit at our Calvin Klein business.
Moving to our wholesale business in Europe. Our order books for spring 2016, excluding our Russia business, is projected to be up 4% to 5% at Tommy and is up about 15% at Calvin Klein as our marketing initiatives are starting to pay dividends, along with our new product deliveries. 
In North America, we are dealing with a later back-to-school selling season due to weak Labor Day holiday, which is making it more difficult to read the business. Our retail same-store sales are running negative low single digit at Calvin Klein and negative mid-single digit at Tommy Hilfiger. Those 2 businesses are running on plan given the later back-to-school season and are continued to be impacted by international tourist traffic and spending. 
Before I turn it over to Mike, I just want to focus on some of the key initiatives we outlined at the beginning of the year.
As we move over the next 3 years, our objectives will be capturing the long-term revenue and profit opportunities for our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands. There are really 4 key initiatives that we hope to accomplish over the next 3 years that you should be monitoring as we go forward.
The first is to continue to invest in product, presentation and the marketing of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands. 
Second, we continue to invest in our global operating platforms to support our growth strategies including key investments in our digital commerce systems and platforms.
Third, significantly improving operating results of the Calvin Klein European business over the next 3 years. Although we have seen strong performance in there, we believe we have a long way to go to reach the comparable levels of profitability that exists at our Tommy Hilfiger business in the European market and this is a big opportunity for us as we move forward.
And fourth is to continue to invest in the expansion of the presence of both brands in Asia and Latin America including more direct control over the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger licensing businesses where we can maximize our core competency to increase sales and improve the overall profitability of both brands.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Mike to quantify some of the second quarter results."

Our Calvin Klein international business was up 7% in constant currency driven by strong wholesale shipments and international retail comps of 3%. Our Calvin Klein strategies are taking hold and we are seeing improved performance, particularly in gross margin in our international businesses.
Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 5% in constant currency, also ahead of our guidance with strong revenues in our international business, which had revenues up 6% in constant currency and Europe comps of 9%. Our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein U.S. retail stores located in international tourist destinations continued to be under pressure from a lack of traffic and spending, but these declines were more than offset by performance in other areas of these brands.
Our Heritage business revenues were down 6%, also ahead of guidance and heavily influenced by the earlier-than-planned wholesale shipments, which benefited quarter 1 as well as the launch of IZOD at Kohl's course in last year's second quarter.
Earnings per share for the second quarter was $1.37, a $0.31 negative impact related to foreign currency and expected weakness in our Russian business. Excluding this negative impact, EPS would have increased 11% over the prior year. Our Q2 EPS was $0.07 ahead of the top end of our guidance. The $0.07 beat was comprised of $0.10 related to business outperformance, which was predominantly at Calvin Klein, and an interest expense benefit of $0.02, partially offset by $0.05 of headwinds related to taxes and FX.
For the full year 2015, we raised our guidance and are now projecting earnings per share at $6.90 to $7, which includes an additional $0.05 hit for foreign currency versus our previous guidance. If we exclude the negative impact related to foreign currency and weakness in our Russian business of $1.30, our earnings per share growth is projected to be 12% to 14% over the prior year. 
We also raised our revenue guidance. We are now projecting revenues to grow approximately 4% on a constant currency basis. Overall, operating margins are expected to increase about 10 to 20 basis points, excluding a negative impact of about 60 basis points due to foreign currency. 
Driving the growth, when excluding foreign currency, is continued improvement in the Calvin Klein business, which is projecting revenues to grow 8% on a constant currency basis. We are also planning Calvin Klein operating margins to increase 80 to 90 basis points, excluding a negative impact of approximately 40 basis points of FX. 
Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 4% on a constant currency basis with operating margins planned down 60 to 70 basis points, excluding a negative impact of approximately 80 basis points of FX. Tommy Hilfiger international operating margins are planned up with North America operating margins planned down after excluding FX. This is due to pressure on U.S. stores located in international tourist locations. 
Our Heritage business is planned to have a revenue decrease of 3%, due mostly to our exiting the IZOD retail business in 2015. Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to increase about 70 to 80 basis points. The impact of foreign currency in our Heritage businesses is relatively material.
Interest expense for the year is planned to be about $120 million and compares to the prior year amount of $139 million due to our average lower debt balances. Also favorably impacting interest for 2015 is the debt refinancing we did in last year's first quarter. 
We currently expect to generate approximately $450 million of free cash flow in 2015. This will be used to pay down debt of about $350 million and allow for opportunistic stock repurchases and license buybacks.
Our tax rate for the year is planned at about 21.5%. 
Our revenue for the third quarter is planned at 3% on a constant currency basis. By business, we're estimating that third quarter revenues, on a constant currency basis, to increase 7% for Calvin, 4% for Tommy Hilfiger and to decrease 5% for Heritage brands. Heritage Brands revenues are being negatively impacted by the closing of our IZOD retail division.
Third quarter earnings per share is planned at $2.45 to $2.50 and includes approximately $0.40 of estimated negative impact for foreign currency and the decline in our Russian business. Excluding this negative impact, EPS is projected to increase 11% to 13% over the prior year. Interest expense for the quarter is planned at $30 million and taxes about 18% in the third quarter.
And with that, we'll open it up to questions."

Our business in China both for Calvin that we operate directly, our comps have been running between mid-single digits to high single digit for the first 6 months of the year and that trend has more or less continued into -- through August so far. The challenge as trying to operate that business is trying to get beyond a lot of the noise that's going on from the stock market point of view and where we see the business moving and going. So you can't help but look at that business and be a little bit more conservative about how we project that business out, both for the balance of this year and then moving into 2016 and beyond. So it just gives us pause. We see now the luxury market has been hit from a sales point of view. We haven't experienced anything like that. I think our brands, both Calvin and Tommy, are very well positioned in that market. It's premium brands, affordable luxury, so I think that works to our advantage and we are -- we have strong brands that are really executing. So from that point. On point 2 on Tommy, of potentially reacquiring the 55% of the Tommy Hilfiger license business that we don't own throughout China, which is very healthy and very profitable, I don't think -- I try not to make those macro issues really impact that decision strategically. It makes all the sense in the world for us to own that business. I think, from a valuation point of view, although that market has taken hits, if you look at P/E valuations, they're still relatively high. So we will be diligent as we look at that. But clearly, one of our goals would be to own that business sooner rather than later. It just makes too much sense from a brand point of view and I think financially it should be a nice transaction for us."

When you put both months together, I think you get a much more natural feel for the business running -- continuing to run up low single-digit positive comps in our own businesses and at retail generally speaking. I think geographically, I think it's much more of a Northeast-Southeast phenomenon with the whole back-to-school in being somewhat later. I think, as you move across the country, some of those schools come back earlier. And since most of our retailers and ourselves have a concentration of business in those regions, it's having a significant impact on trying to read business. I think when we get to September 15 or whatever, we'll have a real clear understanding of how this back-to-school period is trending.

So we're really seeing the kind of sales performance that we've seen at retail with jeans and underwear. As you can imagine, when you're getting the kind of sales increases we've gotten, we've been chasing business all year. We're really getting to a position where we could fulfill at what we would feel like an acceptable rate. The consumer demand, particularly in underwear, which is a replenishment business, really starts as we get into the holiday season probably late September, early October, so I think you're seeing a bit of that. So real healthy trends in the underlying business. We also had some pretty significant square footage growth in Calvin and Tommy, to a degree, due to the transfer of our -- in North America of our IZOD stores to the Calvin Klein underwear and accessory stores. So square footage growth there that'll really come in the holiday selling season, which is very strong. And then last thing is internationally, even with all the strength, we are going to benefit in the fourth quarter, like everyone else from early Chinese New Year, which really impacts a lot of the Asia markets. It's about 2 to 3 weeks earlier this year. And you'll get -- you get 2 things happening. You'll get earlier actual retail sales in the stores we're operating. But also because of the early Chinese New Year, wholesale shipments are falling into January out of February. So there's a little bit of a timing shift there that we have to just deal with every year with Chinese New Year. But underlying business just continues to be very strong. Looking into '16, we're not getting into all the guidance discussion about it, but obviously there's momentum in the Calvin Klein business and we think that momentum will help us offset -- partially offset some of the headwinds we're seeing with continued pressure on FX, particularly on a transaction basis going forward from inventory purchases in some of our foreign markets, Europe, Brazil, Mexico and Canada. So we've talked about those issues. So that's in front of us in '16."

You hit the 3 buckets we really are trying to focus on. As you can imagine, the challenge -- the biggest challenge we're looking at is how aggressive to raise prices, particularly in a world that, as you look out, that's facing extraordinary deflationary pressure in just general terms across where most economists speak the biggest concern is deflation, not inflation. So the challenge we're facing, although our cost increases, say, in Europe or Canada, are increasing anywhere from 12% to 18% because of a big piece of that being currency, offset by some products savings, how much can you raise prices in one season. And that continues to be an ongoing discussion with our retail partners and we'll give more color to that as we get into the end of the third quarter going into the fourth quarter. But we talked about that there'll be pressure in the neighborhood, just on a pure mathematical basis, in excess of $1 a share in 2016.

And yet -- then, I guess, fundamentally, currencies are usually -- I mean, there's a lot -- I don't want to play economist, but those are usually indicative of what's going on in the underlying economies. So on a -- as we -- the biggest market for us is Europe. It's gone through some macro issues. But we're actually seeing positive sales trends in Europe. We believe that economy is coming back and that consumer is reengaging. The challenge we are facing in Europe with '16 will be cost increases that are double-digit cost increases and how much of that is reasonable in 1 or 2 seasons to pass on to the consumer, that's the biggest challenge we're facing in Europe. As you get into some of the other markets that you talked about, some of the emerging markets, Brazil. Brazil for us has been, for Calvin Klein in particular and Tommy, just really getting started with a joint venture there. We've seen over the last 5 years dramatic growth in that market. But clearly, as we're planning 2016, we're planning that business flat to down slightly and that is just different than what we've had to do over the last 5 years and it's totally a reflection of what's going on in that macro environment, how that consumer is being impacted by everything politically and economically that's going on in that business. So I think in some regards, given that we were -- we as an international brand are really a pioneer in Brazil developing a business, we're probably more impacted by that business as we go forward. The China market continues to be a growth market for us. We continue to expand there. We continue to add square footage. We continue to expand our brand offering throughout China, both Calvin and Tommy, as those businesses develop. The challenge there is it's more of ""what's going to happen"" question and how much growth is there. Clearly, this is not the heydays of 3 years ago, where from 2007 through 2010, the business grew 15% top line. We're planning the business to grow more mid-single digit. I think that's reasonable. We are currently outperforming that. But there's just a lot of noise in the environment. So I guess, the biggest thing we're dealing with is uncertainty and what that does -- potentially does to the consumer, how that forces us to plan our business and reacting to the macro environment. But I think as a brand, as a company, we are as well positioned as anyone to really weather those headwinds. Our portfolio of brands gives us diversification. Our geographic diversification is second to none, which I think is the long-term success. Although we missed a market, the more of North America you are, the better you are. But I think on a long-term basis, being the global powerhouse brand is the place to be. So we're just dealing with a lot of those macro issues. That's the biggest headwind we're dealing with."

Add it all up, $150 million in sales, just taking everything into consideration. It's a growing dramatically, but again, off of a small base and we really target that as a growth area. The -- in the Calvin Klein area in particular, if you think about pre-Warnaco acquisition, we were a licensor. And getting the model right internationally for an e-commerce platform, direct e-commerce platform, was very difficult as a licensee with so many different partners doing business and Warnaco being the biggest partner at the time. Postacquisition, that focus has completely changed. We now control probably -- in apparel, we probably control 65% of the categories today, and with our relation with G-III, are able to really aggressively go after the women's area as well. So that's been the area where the biggest investments have been made. We now have active, highly functioning, performing e-commerce direct-to-consumer platforms in China, throughout most of Asia, Europe, launching in Brazil, launching in Mexico. North America, obviously, both brands Tommy and Calvin, really are there. And now we're making those connections with the consumer that needs to be made, not only from a commercial point of view, but today, I would say, between Calvin and Tommy, 60% of our marketing budget are directed at digital marketing and connecting with consumer there, converting them to our in-store platforms, our wholesale customers in-store -- online platforms or our own brick-and-mortar stores as well. So it's really a 360 campaign. It's requiring capital investment, there's no doubt about it. But that's just a price of growth and where we are and it's factored into all of our plans as we go forward. So it's a big opportunity and it's both an opportunity for us to sell direct to the consumer, but also sell through our key wholesale accounts e-commerce platform where we're really seeing growth. And if you look at our dot-com business with some of our partners, those businesses are up, depending on the player, anywhere from 30% to 50%. So clearly, our penetration continues to grow online."

We're seeing much better sell-throughs, more regular priced sell-throughs or prices that are first kind of markdown. Denim tends -- is a category that will be promoted no matter what your brand is. But I think what we're really seeing is it's been a cycle for the last going into this year, the last 3 or 4 years where, particularly on the women's side, men's has been more stable, but women's in particular it's really been a sharp decline in overall market share in denim. And what that really done is, as you move through the seasons were inventory and historically have been building up, it's required more promotions, more clearance and a real takedown in AURs overall for the season. For the first to last 9 months in our Jeans business, our AURs are up about 20% in men's and women's. In North America, I think that's a sign of the health in the overall denim market, but also a lot of the initiatives that we have in place that have moved the product up, improved the problem. I am optimistic about the category as it moves forward because it's an important category for every retailer and it's historically been one of their most profitable categories. So there's a real focus on continuing focus in that area. And on the women's side, in particular, there's been a lot of product innovation around stretch jeans, really trying to take advantage of that whole at leisure as it relates to a denim component of that. So we're really starting to see the knit jeans really starting to become a bigger component of the business as well. So for Calvin, we've always had a very healthy tops denim business, which is -- seems counterintuitive. It's really about reestablishing our bottoms business where we are a significantly under developed against the competitive set. Where most of our competitive set like Levi's and some of the other brands, denim bottoms will represent well in excess of 50% of their overall sale, and for Calvin, it's been hovering around 30%, moving into 40%. So this is huge bottoms opportunity that, I think, our fits now are much more well defined, the consumer is starting to refind us. And I think it's like anything else with denim, it's really a fit issue as well. As that consumers starts to wear the product, start to have a positive response to product, they become a more loyal consumer and I think we're price positioned right in the sweet spot of the market. We are not sitting at some $200 denim prestige that represents 5% of the market. We are at a designer denim jean that's going out the door $59 to $89 in North America. That's a real sweet spot for all department stores and we really starting to see it."

It could be very profitable. But even more important is what it means about the brand and your positioning with the consumer. And I think, obviously, all the -- every major department store, both in Europe and North America, when you sit down with them what they continue to talk about is trying -- to continue to try to attract a younger consumer. I don't think it's a surprise to anyone that department stores tend to skew somewhat older. And I think as your brand can be more -- the Calvin brand continues to be more relevant to a younger consumer given our strong position in some of these specialty retailers. I think -- and our strong underwear components, which is usually introduction to a consumer. That is, by far, our youngest consumer. If you have that connection between underwear and jeans, I think your brand now becomes more relevant to a younger consumer. So the opportunity with some of the retailers you talked about, Urban Outfitters, with Topshop, particularly The Buckle as we move forward, some other players, opening ceremony you mentioned, it's as much -- it's as important as it is commercially. It's also very important from a brand positioning point of view how we connect with the younger consumer, how we connect digitally, how we sell online to that consumer. So we're seeing really great growth there and it just makes our brand relevant to that consumer and I think it makes us a cooler brand that we'll see stronger sell-throughs. So it's just, I think, another indication of if we're in that channel of distribution, the product has to be right. You don't get accepted into that channel of distribution unless your product is positioned appropriately."

You could make a case of while as we move into August, your comps have decelerated from plus 9 to mid-single digits. But I think some of that is the fact that it was such a successful first half of the year full price selling that we had significantly less merchandise to promote and sell off during the traditionally sales season throughout Europe. So we just weren't as aggressive in July and August from a promotional calendar because we didn't need to be and I think we managed our gross profit. So as we're turning into August and that's starting to wind down, we're seeing business continue to improve. So I think it's -- I think there's 2 things going on. I really think our line is fantastic. I think the consumer's connecting with it. I think the product is right. But I also think that there's also something just going on in the overall environment in Europe. I think there's 2 basic things: I think the environment is improving; and I think because of the currency situation that's going on, I think a lot more Europeans are staying home. And by staying home, I mean I think they're vacationing this summer within Continental Europe, we would say, where the euros are buying more where if they come to the United States, forgetting everything else, the hotel and food just from a currency point of view is up 20% to 25%. So I think we're benefiting from that. We're also I think benefiting from the fact that the -- that our Chinese consumer or the Asian consumer instead of being in the United States more so in Europe and as you -- I was in Paris and I was in Amsterdam this last month, you can see the tourist boom that's going on there and helping their economy. So long-winded way to say, I think, the underlying product and the brand strength continues to be second to none, particularly in Europe for the Tommy Hilfiger brand. And then I think the environment continues to improve and that consumer is back out opening up their wallets and spending money and we're getting a larger share of that."

And I've also talked about the fact that we've been chasing business constantly, so you don't necessarily see it all on the top line, although there has been top line growth, which you're really seeing that, I think, is in the operating margins in business despite the currency -- the currency impact, which is taking that away. But the operating margins of the business just continued to improve. So I think the inflection point I touched on is really fourth quarter. I think you'll start to see that more.

So -- but again, not to put too definite a time frame on things, nothing's really changed. Buying back licenses is a delicate situation. You've had a partner usually for a number of years that's built a business and clearly it's creating value to the brand and to themselves. So there needs to be a reasonable negotiation that goes on, so that you secure a business and don't have -- you don't want to have a situation where you break a license or just terminate license at the end and just take back a business. I think there's too many examples of that where you wind up leaving money on the table and hurt the underlying business. That's not our goal. Our goal is to negotiate fair, reasonable transactions with our partners and to do it in a way that doesn't economically hurt them. But more importantly, from our perspective, this really gives us a business that's ongoing with momentum in it as we go forward. And that's the push and the pull that goes on there. So clearly, the biggest driver of that is licensing term. If somebody's got 2 to 3 years ago on license and you've clearly given them an indication that the plan is to bring it back in, that's a very reasonable negotiation you could go on. If somebody has 8 to 10 years or 20 years, depending on the situation, it's a much more challenging discussion, similar to the kind of discussions we had with Warnaco when we want to buy their business back. Besides the complication of being a public company, it was a very long-term license, so there was much more value there that had to be determined. So this is really about sitting down with partners with, more or less, for the most part, short-term licenses balances left, probably the only exception to that is China where really are trying to come up with a reasonable way and a smooth transition. So I believe, over the next -- over '15 and '16, we'd be very disappointed if you haven't seen some progress in that area that we're beginning process of bringing some of those businesses in. And when that starts, I think it'd become obvious what the next potential licensee take back would be and those would be very strategic and accretive transactions as we move forward."

But the -- if you walk into the store, the exposure has just grown. So there's been a continuing expansion of the square footage. And that's directly aligned with new product innovations, new products that's been delivered. On the women's side of the business, we always had a very strong bottoms, panties business. The focus has really been to grow the bra business, which from a price point is 4x the unit cost of panties. So the growth has really been to really try and grow that square footage. So if you went to Macy's Herald Square, you'll see a women's shop that's 20 -- that's 2,500 square feet. You'll see a men's shop that's 2,500 square feet. We are clearly the largest brand there and I think with the best positioning on the floor. On men's, yes, and on women's trying to move the #2 or 3 position to the #1 in that store from a sales volume point of view. So that's really been the opportunity. We're so dominant in men's, I think men's will continue to grow nicely. But to be honest, the bigger market opportunity for us is women's. Market is much bigger and our market share, although significant, is not nearly as dominant as it is in men's. So the -- that opportunity is really in front of us to grow. In Europe, it's been a growth in customer, better retail presentation, better customer presentation, true cleaning up of the brand into department stores and key specialty stores. Offsetting that has been getting out of the off-price channel and getting out of some terrible distribution that the brand was in. So that's been a balancing act. But what you've really seen in the last 6, 9 months, the growth that you've seen in the business, has really been driven both by square footage growth, which we think can continue, and also growing the customer base, which we also think can continue throughout Europe. In Asia, we basically -- it's basically a retail business, whether that's our own stores or department store concession business. And there, we continue to open doors. It continues to be the player in the market. We continue to raise AURs throughout Asia, lifting the product up. A Black Label product has gone from 3% of the business in Asia to today 10% with a goal to get to 20%. And that product is price positioned a good 30% to 40% higher than our base business. So those are the initiatives that's really driven the presence of underwear and the market share gains by region."

I think there's -- okay, if you look at the number of centers in the outlet environment, the number of centers significantly skews towards permanent population locations. Good, solid store that this year continue to comp overall single-digit comp store increases, probably 2% to 4% kind of growth in that market. Healthy, along with the American consumer, I think being healthy. So the channel continues to be just, from our perspective, very, very healthy. What is going on is there are 15 key centers around the country in these tourist destination locations that are extraordinarily large. Think of Harriman in New York in this location, think of Orlando down in Florida where the normal size of a store is 5 to 10x as large as an average store in a permanent population location. Those are the stores in the channel that are being impacted most dramatically. And I think the brands that are being impacted most dramatically are the global brands: our sales, Calvin and Tommy, we talked about, I guess Ralph Lauren has talked about, that COACH has talked about it to a degree. So some of it -- if you're a global player that really attracts a global consumer in those centers, like Orlando or Harriman, your customer base in those centers for those brands, 50% of the credit card sales are international tourists from South America, Europe and Asia. If that -- if tourism is down in the United States, which we know just in general terms it is, those are the centers that are being impacted. And those 15-or-so centers are the ones, because of the size of their business, are being dragged down accordingly because of that. As we look out, we believe as we get into the fourth quarter of '15 and clearly into the first quarter of '15, we sought to anniversary that business and -- which become less and less of an issue for us. But clearly, third quarter is going to continue to be an issue. Last year, our comps for both Calvin and Tommy were high single-digit positive comps in North America. So we're up against some of our most challenging comps in the third quarter driven by that international tourism. So that's the best I can do for you. There is really nothing at all along with that channel distribution. It's like saying there's a problem with Herald Square Macy's because tourism is down in Macy's. It's still the largest department store in the world and probably the most profitable department store in the world, but it is being impacted by just tourism trends."

The last 5 years at Warnaco, that business was 0 in one way. You need to be cool. You need to be connected. And the Calvin Klein product wasn't cool, wasn't cutting-edge. There were other brands that were much hotter. And we were living of -- that business was living off the heritage of the brand and over depended on an off-price channel distribution. I think what's indicative most importantly about the fact that we are in Urban Outfitters, we are in Topshop is the brand, the product is connecting with that younger consumer. Combination of our marketing and how we've really gone after that market, combination of the product and what it is and that it's executing and we're seeing really strong sell-throughs, the product hitting. If you walk -- just go into an Urban Outfitters, you're going to see a presentation of Calvin that you've never seen before. It's going to be front and center. I would tell you it's still relatively a very small business, but it's creating a lot of buzz and it's helping our department store business. And then finally, I think it's also very important, look, our primary channel distribution is department stores. They want to continue to attract the younger consumer. So it's important to really -- we're one of those brands, particularly Calvin, that skews younger than the department store customer. I think it's a combination of our underwear business and our jeans business that does that for our department store accounts. At the same time, we don't want to alienate our department -- our more mature department store accounts, so we really have differentiated product and services, the needs of both of those consumers from a fit point of view and from aesthetic point of view. So I think that -- hopefully, that makes it clear what that channel is -- why that channel is important.
Okay. Well, that ends our call. I'd like to thank everybody for joining. We look forward to speaking to you in December for our third quarter press release. And I wish everybody a happy and safe Labor Day holiday weekend. Enjoy the balance of the summer. Have a good day."

I'd like to introduce also on the call Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer; Dana Perlman, our Head of Investor Relationships and our Treasurer; as well as Ken Duane who runs all of our wholesale businesses throughout North America.
Overall, we are quite pleased with our results for the second quarter, which exceeded the top end of our earnings guidance by $0.07. In the second quarter, on a constant currency basis, revenues increased 2% and EPS grew 11%. In the first half of 2015, there were significant sales shifts into the first quarter and out of the second quarter that makes comparisons to the prior year somewhat confusing.
So from a brand and business perspective, I plan to review the first half results in order to give you a better sense of the underlying sales trends. Rest assured that Mike Shaffer, in his comments, will quantify and break down all of our second quarter financial results. 
Overall, for the first 6 months of 2015, on a constant currency basis, revenue increased 3% and EPS grew 16%. This outperformance was driven by strong underlying results in our international Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses. At the same time, we did see softness in our U.S. Calvin and Tommy retail businesses where a strong U.S. dollar negatively impacted international tourist traffic and spending in some of our larger stores located in tourist destination locations like Orlando, Las Vegas, Miami and the New York Metropolitan area. At the same time, our retail stores located in U.S. permanent population locations continued to post low to mid-single-digit same-store sales increases, which we were very encouraged by.
Moving into each of the brands. Calvin Klein. Looking at the first half, on a constant currency basis, our CK revenues increased 4% over the prior year's first half, driven by strong performance of our international businesses. From a retail comp sales perspective, international comps increased 6%, while North American comps increased 2% in the quarter and the half despite being negatively impacted by the international tourist traffic and spending.
The Calvin Klein brand continues to gain traction and is increasingly becoming more visible both digitally and at point-of-sale. Our fall marketing campaigns are out now with in-store signage and media and marketing launching, as we speak. 
We have major initiatives for fall holiday. For jeans, our Meet Me campaign is about sexting and hooking up where we are digitally connecting with our consumer, which is right up the Calvin Klein DNA. For women's underwear, our campaign, The Original Sexy, features Kendall Jenner. Both campaigns are creating a lot of buzz around the market, and we are connecting with our consumers to drive our commercial business.
Globally, the underwear business continues to gain share in each market. Interestingly, our women's underwear sales trends for the first half are outpacing our men's sales trends worldwide. 
Men's, with our key spring launches of Intense Power and Air Fx, have been very well received with great sell-throughs. And for fall, we just launched a magnetic waistband product with positively early indicators from sales. In North America, we have seen our 2015 men's market share grow by over 200 basis points with growth across all of our major retail partners.
Moving to women's. Our Modern Cotton logo product continues to be the big story for women, especially those under the age of 30. Along with our tailored bra offering by region in which we have significantly grown over the last 12 months with our push-up styles leading the business in Asia, our perfectly fit style leading the business in Europe and our new invisibles bra in North America driving sales grains. In North America, we have seen our 2015 women's market share grow by over 100 basis points with growth across all of our major retail partners.
Moving to jeans. We continue to make very good progress around the jeans turnaround in North America and Europe. Women's jeans are still performing better than men's, but our women's business is significantly gaining traction. Over the last 12 months, we have installed in North America over 180 men's shops and over 100 women's shops, which are performing well above last year's levels. In men's, we're looking at sales increases in those shops in excess of 30%, and in women's, the sales are in excess of 25% in those shops. We have also expanded our distribution to include Urban Outfitters globally and Topshop in Europe. These 2 retailers target a younger consumer than our traditional department store consumer. We've delivered some initial capsules for 6 25 [ph] and have seen significant sell-throughs with great performance at Urban and we have seen significant reorders and expansion of doors as we move into the holiday season. We're very excited about this business as it opens our brand up to a much younger consumer. 
In Europe, we have seen a significant improvement in same-store sales as well as where we have installed new shops or have refitted our existing base, particularly in London and Rome, our sales performance is running well ahead of our comps, which are in the double-digit area.
Our Calvin Klein Asia jeans business continues to be very healthy with solid performance throughout the first half, which is best documented by our comp store performance in that region. 
We have also seen very strong performance in many of the other Calvin Klein product categories. For the first half of 2015, our Calvin Klein royalty revenue has increased by over 11%. This strong performance is driven by our women's apparel, our women's footwear in our accessory businesses in those areas. These categories are posting mid-teens sales increases in all the major retailers throughout North America. This business is predominantly run by Jimlar and our partner, G-III, and they are seeing great sell-throughs at this time on those product categories.
Moving to Tommy Hilfiger. The business after the first half of 2015, revenues on a constant currency basis increased 3% over the prior year. The increase was driven by solid performance in our international businesses, which grew 4% in the first half of 2015, including a 6% comp store increase throughout Europe. At wholesale, our Tommy European business continues to outperform the competition. As an indicator, our 2015 full year European order books, excluding Russia, are running up 5% for the year. The strongest markets continue to be Germany, the U.K., France and the Middle East.
In North America, revenues increased 1%, resulting from retail square footage growth, partially offset by a 2% decrease in retail comp store sales. Our Tommy business continues to perform well despite the pressure on the retail business in the U.S. market, primarily driven by the lack of international tourists in our tourist destination locations.
As we have previously mentioned, this fall, we have Rafael Nadal as our brand ambassador, and boy, did he make a big splash in Bryant Park on Tuesday for the kickoff of our fall underwear and fragrance campaign. We believe that Rafa's association will be a positive for our overall men's business, but certainly will lift our Underwear business globally. Our fall order books reflect this uptick in our Underwear business, and Rafa will continue as our brand ambassador for spring 2015 where the focus will be on tailored clothing and our initial order results in that category continue to be very strong.
Moving to our Heritage business. First half revenues for the Heritage businesses were relatively flat while operating income increased about 3%. This increase was driven by our Heritage sportswear businesses, which continued to perform well, both at wholesale and retail. We have also seen strong performance in our Warner's core intimate business, particularly in the mid-tier channel distribution where we have seen our year-to-date market share grow by over 100 basis points.
Our dress shirt business continued to perform -- underperform in the first half of the year. However, we believe that business will significantly improve in the second half of the year. New fall product deliveries, especially our Van Heusen flex collar, have seen strong early sell-throughs in August and give us confidence in our second half sales increases for dress shirts. 
Let me take a moment and talk about our early third quarter back-to-school sales trends. Our international Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger business continues to post strong sales. By region, we are seeing very strong performance for Europe and China for both brands. In Korea and Brazil, where we have a large Calvin Klein business, sales trends continue to be challenging, as we aren't being negatively impacted by the macroeconomic environment for each of those countries. Overall, international same-store sales are up mid-single digits at Tommy Hilfiger and are up low single digit at our Calvin Klein business.
Moving to our wholesale business in Europe. Our order books for spring 2016, excluding our Russia business, is projected to be up 4% to 5% at Tommy and is up about 15% at Calvin Klein as our marketing initiatives are starting to pay dividends, along with our new product deliveries. 
In North America, we are dealing with a later back-to-school selling season due to a weak Labor Day holiday, which is making it more difficult to read the business. Our retail same-store sales are running negative low single digit at Calvin Klein and negative mid-single digit at Tommy Hilfiger. Those 2 businesses are running on plan given the later back-to-school season and are continued to be impacted by international tourist traffic and spending. 
Before I turn it over to Mike, I just want to focus on some of the key initiatives we outlined at the beginning of the year.
As we move over the next 3 years, our objectives will be capturing the long-term revenue and profit opportunities for our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands. There are really 4 key initiatives that we hope to accomplish over the next 3 years that you should be monitoring as we go forward.
The first is to continue to invest in product, presentation and the marketing of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands. 
Second, we continue to invest in our global operating platforms to support our growth strategies including key investments in our digital commerce systems and platforms.
Third, significantly improving operating results of the Calvin Klein European business over the next 3 years. Although we have seen strong performance there, we believe we have a long way to go to reach the comparable levels of profitability that exists at our Tommy Hilfiger business in the European market and this is a big opportunity for us as we move forward.
And fourth is to continue to invest in the expansion of the presence of both brands in Asia and Latin America including more direct control over the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger licensing businesses where we can maximize our core competency to increase sales and improve the overall profitability of both brands.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Mike to quantify some of the second quarter results."

The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. 
On a constant currency basis, revenues for the second quarter were up 2% versus prior year and ahead of our guidance. Driving our revenue increase was our Calvin Klein business, which delivered a 3% constant currency increase over the prior year. Our Calvin Klein international business was up 7% in constant currency driven by strong wholesale shipments and international retail comps of 3%. Our Calvin Klein strategies are taking hold and we are seeing improved performance, particularly in gross margin and in our international businesses.
Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 5% in constant currency, also ahead of our guidance with strong revenues in our international business, which had revenues up 6% in constant currency and Europe comps of 9%. Our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein U.S. retail stores located in international tourist destinations continued to be under pressure from a lack of traffic and spending, but these declines were more than offset by performance in other areas of these brands.
Our Heritage business revenues were down 6%, also ahead of guidance and heavily influenced by the earlier-than-planned wholesale shipments, which benefited quarter 1 as well as the launch of IZOD at Kohl's in last year's second quarter.
Earnings per share for the second quarter was $1.37, a $0.31 negative impact related to foreign currency and expected weakness in our Russian business. Excluding this negative impact, EPS would have increased 11% over the prior year. Our Q2 EPS was $0.07 ahead of the top end of our guidance. The $0.07 beat was comprised of $0.10 related to business outperformance, which was predominantly at Calvin Klein, and an interest expense benefit of $0.02, partially offset by $0.05 of headwinds related to taxes and FX.
For the full year 2015, we raised our guidance and are now projecting earnings per share at $6.90 to $7, which includes an additional $0.05 hit for foreign currency versus our previous guidance. If we exclude the negative impact related to foreign currency and weakness in our Russian business of $1.30, our earnings per share growth is projected to be 12% to 14% over the prior year. 
We also raised our revenue guidance. We are now projecting revenues to grow approximately 4% on a constant currency basis. Overall, operating margins are expected to increase about 10 to 20 basis points, excluding a negative impact of about 60 basis points due to foreign currency. 
Driving the growth, when excluding foreign currency, is continued improvement in the Calvin Klein business, which is projecting revenues to grow 8% on a constant currency basis. We are also planning Calvin Klein operating margins to increase 80 to 90 basis points, excluding a negative impact of approximately 40 basis points of FX. 
Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 4% on a constant currency basis with operating margins planned down 60 to 70 basis points, excluding a negative impact of approximately 80 basis points of FX. Tommy Hilfiger international operating margins are planned up with North America operating margins planned down after excluding FX. This is due to pressure on U.S. stores located in international tourist locations. 
Our Heritage business is planned to have a revenue decrease of 3%, due mostly to our exiting the IZOD retail business in 2015. Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to increase about 70 to 80 basis points. The impact of foreign currency in our Heritage businesses is relatively immaterial.
Interest expense for the year is planned to be about $120 million and compares to the prior year amount of $139 million due to our average lower debt balances. Also favorably impacting interest for 2015 is the debt refinancing we did in last year's first quarter. 
We currently expect to generate approximately $450 million of free cash flow in 2015. This will be used to pay down debt of about $350 million and allow for opportunistic stock repurchases and license buybacks.
Our tax rate for the year is planned at about 21.5%. 
Our revenue for the third quarter is planned at 3% on a constant currency basis. By business, we're estimating that third quarter revenues, on a constant currency basis, to increase 7% for Calvin, 4% for Tommy Hilfiger and to decrease 5% for Heritage brands. Heritage Brands revenues are being negatively impacted by the closing of our IZOD retail division.
Third quarter earnings per share is planned at $2.45 to $2.50 and includes approximately $0.40 of estimated negative impact for foreign currency and the decline in our Russian business. Excluding this negative impact, EPS is projected to increase 11% to 13% over the prior year. Interest expense for the quarter is planned at $30 million and taxes about 18% in the third quarter.
And with that, we'll open it up to questions."

Our business in China both for Calvin that we operate directly, our comps have been running between mid-single digits to high single digit for the first 6 months of the year and that trend has more or less continued into -- through August so far. The challenge as trying to operate that business is trying to get beyond a lot of the noise that's going on from the stock market point of view and where we see the business moving and going. So you can't help but look at that business and be a little bit more conservative about how we project that business out, both for the balance of this year and then moving into 2016 and beyond. So it just gives us pause. We see now the luxury market has been hit from a sales point of view. We haven't experienced anything like that. I think our brands, both Calvin and Tommy, are very well positioned in that market. It's premium brands, affordable luxury, so I think that works to our advantage and we are -- we have strong brands that are really executing. So from that point. On point 2 on Tommy, of potentially reacquiring the 55% of the Tommy Hilfiger license business that we don't own throughout China, which is very healthy and very profitable, I don't think -- I try not to make those macro issues really impact that decision strategically. It makes all the sense in the world for us to own that business. I think, from a valuation point of view, although that market has taken hits, if you look at P/E valuations, they're still relatively high. So we will be diligent as we look at that. But clearly, one of our goals would be to own that business sooner rather than later. It just makes too much sense from a brand point of view and I think financially it should be a nice transaction for us."

When you put both months together, I think you get a much more natural feel for the business running -- continuing to run up low single-digit positive comps in our own businesses and at retail generally speaking. I think geographically, I think it's much more of a Northeast-Southeast phenomenon with the whole back-to-school in being somewhat later. I think, as you move across the country, some of those schools come back earlier. And since most of our retailers and ourselves have a concentration of business in those regions, it's having a significant impact on trying to read business. I think when we get to September 15 or whatever, we'll have a real clear understanding of how this back-to-school period is trending.

So we're really seeing the kind of sales performance that we've seen at retail with jeans and underwear. As you can imagine, when you're getting the kind of sales increases we've gotten, we've been chasing business all year. We're really getting to a position where we could fulfill at what we would feel like an acceptable rate. The consumer demand, particularly in underwear, which is a replenishment business, really starts as we get into the holiday season probably late September, early October, so I think you're seeing a bit of that. So real healthy trends in the underlying business. We also had some pretty significant square footage growth in Calvin and Tommy, to a degree, due to the transfer of our -- in North America of our IZOD stores to the Calvin Klein underwear and accessory stores. So square footage growth there that'll really come in the holiday selling season, which is very strong. And then last thing is internationally, even with all the strength, we are going to benefit in the fourth quarter, like everyone else from early Chinese New Year, which really impacts a lot of the Asia markets. It's about 2 to 3 weeks earlier this year. And you'll get -- you get 2 things happening. You'll get earlier actual retail sales in the stores we're operating. But also because of the early Chinese New Year, wholesale shipments are falling into January out of February. So there's a little bit of a timing shift there that we have to just deal with every year with Chinese New Year. But underlying business just continues to be very strong. Looking into '16, we're not getting into all the guidance discussion about it, but obviously there's momentum in the Calvin Klein business and we think that momentum will help us offset -- partially offset some of the headwinds we're seeing with continued pressure on FX, particularly on a transaction basis going forward from inventory purchases in some of our foreign markets, Europe, Brazil, Mexico and Canada. So we've talked about those issues. So that's in front of us in '16."

But right now, at this point, with the pressure we're seeing on labor rates offset by some currency benefit, it's very marginal just on that particular front. You hit the 3 buckets we really are trying to focus on. As you can imagine, the challenge -- the biggest challenge we're looking at is how aggressive to raise prices, particularly in a world that, as you look out, that's facing extraordinary deflationary pressure in just general terms across where most economists speak the biggest concern is deflation, not inflation. So the challenge we're facing, although our cost increases, say, in Europe or Canada, are increasing anywhere from 12% to 18% because of a big piece of that being currency, offset by some products savings, how much can you raise prices in one season. And that continues to be an ongoing discussion with our retail partners and we'll give more color to that as we get into the end of the third quarter going into the fourth quarter. But we talked about that there'll be pressure in the neighborhood, just on a pure mathematical basis, in excess of $1 a share in 2016. And we're hoping to be able to offset -- partially offset some of that. So that's where we are right now, David."

I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves. It's 3 weeks of selling. It's -- as you would expect, it's at the 3 key retailers, Kohl's, Penney's and Macy's, in a substantial way and it's getting a reaction.

And yet -- then, I guess, fundamentally, currencies are usually -- I mean, there's a lot -- I don't want to play economist, but those are usually indicative of what's going on in the underlying economies. So on a -- as we -- the biggest market for us is Europe. It's gone through some macro issues. But we're actually seeing positive sales trends in Europe. We believe that economy is coming back and that consumer is reengaging. The challenge we are facing in Europe with '16 will be cost increases that are double-digit cost increases and how much of that is reasonable in 1 or 2 seasons to pass on to the consumer, that's the biggest challenge we're facing in Europe. As you get into some of the other markets that you talked about, some of the emerging markets, Brazil. Brazil for us has been, for Calvin Klein in particular and Tommy, just really getting started with a joint venture there. We've seen over the last 5 years dramatic growth in that market. But clearly, as we're planning 2016, we're planning that business flat to down slightly and that is just different than what we've had to do over the last 5 years and it's totally a reflection of what's going on in that macro environment, how that consumer is being impacted by everything politically and economically that's going on in that business. So I think in some regards, given that we were -- we as an international brand are really a pioneer in Brazil developing a business, we're probably more impacted by that business as we go forward. The China market continues to be a growth market for us. We continue to expand there. We continue to add square footage. We continue to expand our brand offering throughout China, both Calvin and Tommy, as those businesses develop. The challenge there is it's more of ""what's going to happen"" question and how much growth is there. Clearly, this is not the heydays of 3 years ago, where from 2007 through 2010, the business grew 15% top line. We're planning the business to grow more mid-single digit. I think that's reasonable. We are currently outperforming that. But there's just a lot of noise in the environment. So I guess, the biggest thing we're dealing with is uncertainty and what that does -- potentially does to the consumer, how that forces us to plan our business and reacting to the macro environment. But I think as a brand, as a company, we are as well positioned as anyone to really weather those headwinds. Our portfolio of brands gives us diversification. Our geographic diversification is second to none, which I think is the long-term success. Although we missed a market, the more of North America you are, the better you are. But I think on a long-term basis, being the global powerhouse brand is the place to be. So we're just dealing with a lot of those macro issues. That's the biggest headwind we're dealing with."

Add it all up, $150 million in sales, just taking everything into consideration. It's a growing dramatically, but again, off of a small base and we really target that as a growth area. The -- in the Calvin Klein area in particular, if you think about pre-Warnaco acquisition, we were a licensor. And getting the model right internationally for an e-commerce platform, direct e-commerce platform, was very difficult as a licensee with so many different partners doing business and Warnaco being the biggest partner at the time. Post acquisition, that focus has completely changed. We now control probably -- in apparel, we probably control 65% of the categories today, and with our relation with G-III, are able to really aggressively go after the women's area as well. So that's been the area where the biggest investments have been made. We now have active, highly functioning, performing e-commerce direct-to-consumer platforms in China, throughout most of Asia, Europe, launching in Brazil, launching in Mexico. North America, obviously, both brands Tommy and Calvin, really are there. And now we're making those connections with the consumer that needs to be made, not only from a commercial point of view, but today, I would say, between Calvin and Tommy, 60% of our marketing budget are directed at digital marketing and connecting with consumer there, converting them to our in-store platforms, our wholesale customers in-store -- online platforms or our own brick-and-mortar stores as well. So it's really a 360 campaign. It's requiring capital investment, there's no doubt about that. But that's just a price of growth and where we are and it's factored into all of our plans as we go forward. So it's a big opportunity and it's both an opportunity for us to sell direct to the consumer, but also sell through our key wholesale accounts e-commerce platform where we're really seeing growth. And if you look at our dot-com business with some of our partners, those businesses are up, depending on the player, anywhere from 30% to 50%. So clearly, our penetration continues to grow online."

We're seeing much better sell-throughs, more regular priced sell-throughs or prices that are first kind of markdown. Denim tends -- is a category that will be promoted no matter what your brand is. But I think what we're really seeing is it's been a cycle for the last going into this year, the last 3 or 4 years where, particularly on the women's side, men's has been more stable, but women's in particular it's really been a sharp decline in overall market share in denim. And what that's really done is, as you move through the seasons were inventory and historically have been building up, it's required more promotions, more clearance and a real takedown in AURs overall for the season. For the first to last 9 months in our Jeans business, our AURs are up about 20% in men's and women's. In North America, I think that's a sign of the health in the overall denim market, but also a lot of the initiatives that we have in place that have moved the product up, improved the problem. I am optimistic about the category as it moves forward because it's an important category for every retailer and it's historically been one of their most profitable categories. So there's a real focus on continuing focus in that area. And on the women's side, in particular, there's been a lot of product innovation around stretch jeans, really trying to take advantage of that whole at leisure as it relates to a denim component of that. So we're really starting to see the knit jeans really starting to become a bigger component of the business as well. So for Calvin, we've always had a very healthy tops denim business, which is -- seems counterintuitive. It's really about reestablishing our bottoms business where we are a significantly under developed against the competitive set. Where most of our competitive set like Levi's and some of the other brands, denim bottoms will represent well in excess of 50% of their overall sales, and for Calvin, it's been hovering around 30%, moving into 40%. So this is huge bottoms opportunity that, I think, our fits now are much more well defined, the consumer is starting to refind us. And I think it's like anything else with denim, it's really a fit issue as well. As that consumers starts to wear the product, start to have a positive response to product, they become a more loyal consumer and I think we're price positioned right in the sweet spot of the market. We are not sitting at some $200 denim prestige that represents 5% of the market. We are a designer denim jean that's going out the door $59 to $89 in North America. That's a real sweet spot for all department stores and we really starting to see it."

It could be very profitable. But even more important is what it means about the brand and your positioning with the consumer. And I think, obviously, all the -- every major department store, both in Europe and North America, when you sit down with them what they continue to talk about is trying -- to continue to try to attract a younger consumer. I don't think it's a surprise to anyone that department stores tend to skew somewhat older. And I think as your brand can be more -- the Calvin brand continues to be more relevant to a younger consumer given our strong position in some of these specialty retailers. I think -- and our strong underwear components, which is usually introduction to a consumer. That is, by far, our youngest consumer. If you have that connection between underwear and jeans, I think your brand now becomes more relevant to a younger consumer. So the opportunity with some of the retailers you talked about, Urban Outfitters, with Topshop, particularly The Buckle as we move forward, some other players, Opening Ceremony you mentioned, it's as much -- it's as important as it is commercially. It's also very important from a brand positioning point of view how we connect with the younger consumer, how we connect digitally, how we sell online to that consumer. So we're seeing really great growth there and it just makes our brand relevant to that consumer and I think it makes us a cooler brand that we'll see stronger sell-throughs. So it's just, I think, another indication of if we're in that channel of distribution, the product has to be right. You don't get accepted into that channel of distribution unless your product is positioned appropriately."

You could make a case of while as we move into August, your comps have decelerated from plus 9 to mid-single digits. But I think some of that is the fact that it was such a successful first half of the year full price selling that we had significantly less merchandise to promote and sell off during the traditionally sales season throughout Europe. So we just weren't as aggressive in July and August from a promotional calendar because we didn't need to be and I think we managed our gross profit. So as we're turning into August and that's starting to wind down, we're seeing business continue to improve. So I think it's -- I think there's 2 things going on. I really think our line is fantastic. I think the consumer's connecting with it. I think the product is right. But I also think that there's also something just going on in the overall environment in Europe. I think there's 2 basic things: I think the environment is improving; and I think because of the currency situation that's going on, I think a lot more Europeans are staying home. And by staying home, I mean I think they're vacationing this summer within Continental Europe, we would say, where the euros are buying more where if they come to the United States, forgetting everything else, the hotel and food just from a currency point of view is up 20% to 25%. So I think we're benefiting from that. We're also I think benefiting from the fact that the -- that our Chinese consumer or the Asian consumer instead of being in the United States, is more so in Europe and as you -- I was in Paris and I was in Amsterdam this last month, you can see the tourist boom that's going on there and helping their economy. So long-winded way to say, I think, the underlying product and the brand strength continues to be second to none, particularly in Europe for the Tommy Hilfiger brand. And then I think the environment continues to improve and that consumer is back out opening up their wallets and spending money and we're getting a larger share of that."

And I've also talked about the fact that we've been chasing business constantly, so you don't necessarily see it all on the top line, although there has been top line growth, which you're really seeing that, I think, is in the operating margins in business despite the currency -- the currency impact, which is taking that away. But the operating margins of the business just continued to improve. So I think the inflection point I touched on is really fourth quarter. I think you'll start to see that more.

So -- but again, not to put too definite a time frame on things, nothing's really changed. Buying back licenses is a delicate situation. You've had a partner usually for a number of years that's built a business and clearly it's creating value to the brand and to themselves. So there needs to be a reasonable negotiation that goes on, so that you secure a business and don't have -- you don't want to have a situation where you break a license or just terminate license at the end and just take back a business. I think there's too many examples of that where you wind up leaving money on the table and hurt the underlying business. That's not our goal. Our goal is to negotiate fair, reasonable transactions with our partners and to do it in a way that doesn't economically hurt them. But more importantly, from our perspective, this really gives us a business that's ongoing with momentum in it as we go forward. And that's the push and the pull that goes on there. So clearly, the biggest driver of that is licensing term. If somebody's got 2 to 3 years to go on license and you've clearly given them an indication that the plan is to bring it back in, that's a very reasonable negotiation you could go on. If somebody has 8 to 10 years or 20 years, depending on the situation, it's a much more challenging discussion, similar to the kind of discussions we had with Warnaco when we want to buy their business back. Besides the complication of being a public company, it was a very long-term license, so there was much more value there that had to be determined. So this is really about sitting down with partners with, more or less, for the most part, short-term licenses balances left, probably the only exception to that is China where really are trying to come up with a reasonable way and a smooth transition. So I believe, over the next -- over '15 and '16, we'd be very disappointed if you haven't seen some progress in that area that we're beginning process of bringing some of those businesses in. And when that starts, I think it'd become obvious what the next potential licensee take back would be and those would be very strategic and accretive transactions as we move forward."

But the -- if you walk into the store, the exposure has just grown. So there's been a continuing expansion of the square footage. And that's directly aligned with new product innovations, new products that's been delivered. On the women's side of the business, we always had a very strong bottoms, panties business. The focus has really been to grow the bra business, which from a price point is 4x the unit cost of panties. So the growth has really been to really try and grow that square footage. So if you went to Macy's Herald Square, you'll see a women's shop that's 20 -- that's 2,500 square feet. You'll see a men's shop that's 2,500 square feet. We are clearly the largest brand there and I think with the best positioning on the floor. On men's, yes, and on women's trying to move the #2 or 3 position to the #1 in that store from a sales volume point of view. So that's really been the opportunity. We're so dominant in men's, I think men's will continue to grow nicely. But to be honest, the bigger market opportunity for us is women's. Market is much bigger and our market share, although significant, is not nearly as dominant as it is in men's. So the -- that opportunity is really in front of us to grow. In Europe, it's been a growth in customer, better retail presentation, better customer presentation, true cleaning up of the brand into department stores and key specialty stores. Offsetting that has been getting out of the off-price channel and getting out of some terrible distribution that the brand was in. So that's been a balancing act. But what you've really seen in the last 6, 9 months, the growth that you've seen in the business, has really been driven both by square footage growth, which we think can continue, and also growing the customer base, which we also think can continue throughout Europe. In Asia, we basically -- it's basically a retail business, whether that's our own stores or department store concession business. And there, we continue to open doors. It continues to be the player in the market. We continue to raise AURs throughout Asia, lifting the product up. A Black Label product has gone from 3% of the business in Asia to today 10% with a goal to get to 20%. And that product is price positioned a good 30% to 40% higher than our base business. So those are the initiatives that's really driven the presence of underwear and the market share gains by region."

I think there's -- okay, if you look at the number of centers in the outlet environment, the number of centers significantly skews towards permanent population locations. Good, solid stores that this year continue to comp overall single-digit comp store increases, probably 2% to 4% kind of growth in that market. Healthy, along with the American consumer, I think being healthy. So the channel continues to be just, from our perspective, very, very healthy. What is going on is there are 15 key centers around the country in these tourist destination locations that are extraordinarily large. Think of Harriman in New York in this location, think of Orlando down in Florida where the normal size of a store is 5x to 10x as large as an average store in a permanent population location. Those are the stores in the channel that are being impacted most dramatically. And I think the brands that are being impacted most dramatically are the global brands: ourselves, Calvin and Tommy, we talked about, I guess Ralph Lauren has talked about, that COACH has talked about it to a degree. So some of it -- if you're a global player that really attracts a global consumer in those centers, like Orlando or Harriman, your customer base in those centers for those brands, 50% of the credit card sales are international tourists from South America, Europe and Asia. If that -- if tourism is down in the United States, which we know just in general terms it is, those are the centers that are being impacted. And those 15-or-so centers are the ones, because of the size of their business, are being dragged down accordingly because of that. As we look out, we believe as we get into the fourth quarter of '15 and clearly into the first quarter of '15, we sought to anniversary that business and -- which become less and less of an issue for us. But clearly, third quarter is going to continue to be an issue. Last year, our comps for both Calvin and Tommy were high single-digit positive comps in North America. So we're up against some of our most challenging comps in the third quarter driven by that international tourism. So that's the best I can do for you. There is really nothing at all along with that channel distribution. It's like saying there's a problem with Herald Square Macy's because tourism is down in Macy's. It's still the largest department store in the world and probably the most profitable department store in the world, but it is being impacted by just tourism trends."

The last 5 years at Warnaco, that business was 0 and went away. You need to be cool. You need to be connected. And the Calvin Klein product wasn't cool, wasn't cutting-edge. There were other brands that were much hotter. And we were living of -- that business was living off the heritage of the brand and over dependent on an off-price channel distribution. I think what's indicative most importantly about the fact that we are in Urban Outfitters, we are in Topshop is the brand, the product is connecting with that younger consumer. Combination of our marketing and how we've really gone after that market, combination of the product and what it is and that it's executing and we're seeing really strong sell-throughs, the product hitting. If you walk -- just go into an Urban Outfitters, you're going to see a presentation of Calvin that you've never seen before. It's going to be front and center. I would tell you it's still relatively a very small business, but it's creating a lot of buzz and it's helping our department store business. And then finally, I think it's also very important, look, our primary channel distribution is department stores. They want to continue to attract the younger consumer. So it's important to really -- we're one of those brands, particularly Calvin, that skews younger than the department store customer. I think it's a combination of our underwear business and our jeans business that does that for our department store accounts. At the same time, we don't want to alienate our department -- our more mature department store accounts, so we really have differentiated product that services the needs of both of those consumers from a fit point of view and from aesthetic point of view. So I think that -- hopefully, that makes it clear what that channel is -- why that channel is important.

So overall, we were quite pleased with our results for the third quarter, which exceeded the top end of our guidance by $0.16 despite the volatile overall market environment. Our results continue to highlight the strength of our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger International businesses, as well as improving trends in our Heritage businesses.
Let me give you a quick update by region what we see going on in the third quarter and as we move into the fourth quarter. In the U.S, the U.S. market during the third quarter and currently into the fourth quarter continues to experience increased softness in traffic trends in large part driven by a decline in international tourist traffic and spending trends, coupled with unseasonally warm miter. Not surprising, given all the news reports that the U.S. is almost challenged macro environment. We had a good Thanksgiving Black Friday weekend. But overall, November was a soft month driven by highly promotional microenvironment as a result of elevated inventory levels throughout the industry. For the fourth quarter, we expect these trends to continue and are anticipating a highly promotional holiday selling season.
Moving to Europe. Europe continues to be our strongest market. Both Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger posted double-digit comp store increases in the third quarter. As we move into the fourth quarter, we continue to see strong comp store sales performance at both of our European businesses.
The trend of plus mid single-digit comp continues despite a brief slowdown due to the Paris attacks. We have seen improving trends in all major European markets, including Spain and Italy, which had been under pressure, and those markets seem to have significantly turned around. We expect these positive trends to continue throughout the fourth quarter.
In Asia, Asia continue to post healthy sales gains with Calvin and Tommy in the third quarter driven by our China business. These trends continue into the fourth quarter as China continues to demonstrate strong results. However, we anticipate continued weakness in Korea, driven by more -- driven more by the broader market environment and softness in Hong Kong in large part due to the lack of Mainland Chinese tourists coming to the island.
Brazil, Latin America continues to be difficult and volatile, but very profitable for us. We expect this business to continue to be under pressure and volatile. We believe we are gaining share from our peers and the business continues to be highly profitable. However, growth levels are significantly lower than we would have anticipated at the beginning of the year, given the volatility that's going on, particularly in Brazil.
On a brand basis, moving to Calvin Klein. Overall, we continue to see great momentum with the brand and our business more broadly. Calvin Klein revenues increased 7% on a constant currency basis for the quarter. We have seen great progress across our businesses as we continue to expand our directly operated businesses across jeans, underwear, sportswear and accessories. In addition, our Calvin Klein royalties increased 10% in the quarter, further demonstrating the overall strength of the brand. We are seeing strong growth in women's apparel and accessories, women's and men's footwear and men's tailored clothing.
Globally, our underwear performance continues to be a great -- continues with great momentum with the women's performance outperforming our strong men's business with a lot of opportunity ahead of us. Key initiatives in this business include faster replenishment; maximizing our high-end Black Label fashion product in all international markets; and most significantly, keeping up with the growth of our women's Modern Cotton logo business, which continues to grow dramatically in North America and Europe. To give you a sense of how we're doing with the brand in the United States on the men's side, on the men's underwear bottoms business, our market share has grown to over 30% in department stores, and that's up high single-digits for the year.
On the top side of the business, we have historically been the #3 player in department stores. And in the third quarter, we moved into the #2 position for the first time in the brand's history. On the women's side of the business, the bra category overall is up low single-digits and the Calvin Klein business is up 15% year-to-date. And we are one of the top categories in all major department stores. Our panty -- the panty category overall in the U.S. market is flat, and the Calvin Klein business is up double digits for the year.
We have also seen strong performance in our Calvin Klein jeans business with a continued improvement in product, which has been evidenced across all our markets. We are increasingly focused on key initiatives to drive the business forward, including supply chain initiatives around our denim efforts across the company, significant number of capsule collections and faster overall replenishment.
Asia and Latin America continue to be our 2 strongest markets in jeans with continued mid single-digit sales growth and improving profitability. As it relates to our to 2 turnaround markets, the U.S. and Europe for jeans, we have seen an acceleration in our European jeans business, as our improved product execution and customer satisfaction is paying off. On lifelike product, we are seeing outperformance against both genders. Our best performing markets include Spain, the U.K. and the Italian market for jeans.
Overall, for Calvin Klein Europe across all product categories, our spring/summer 2016 order book is up midteens, excluding the Russia business. We continue to see increase in acceptance and performance for the brand across all wholesale accounts in all major European markets. 
As we look at our U.S. jeans turnaround, we saw solid performance in the first half of the year in this business. But as we move into full holiday season, as a result of the softness of the overall U.S. Retail landscape primarily driven by unseasonably warm weather, we have begun to see a softness in this business.
Overall, department stores sales growth decelerated in the quarter to 2% to 4% increase by major account, with strong performance at some of our other retail partners, including Urban Outfitters and Amazon.
Moving on to Tommy Hilfiger. Overall, our Tommy Hilfiger sales increased 4% on a constant currency basis, driven by our Tommy Hilfiger International businesses. In 3Q, we saw strong performance with growth of about 7%, driven by a tremendous 10% increase in comp store sales, which further highlights the strength of the Tommy business across Europe. These strong comp store sales increases have continued into the fourth quarter of this year with comp trends up mid single-digits. Given this strong trends, we believe we are growing our market share in all major European markets.
We saw a great feedback from our marketing campaigns with all our major retail accounts. The wrath and Nadal fall marketing campaign, which focus on underway until it clothings have positive results. The Nadal marketing campaign will continue with a spring/summer 2016. As a reminder, our European spring/summer 2016 wholesale order book is up about 4%, excluding Russia, driven by 2% increase in retail selling prices and a 2% unit volume increase. The categories experiencing the most growth included underwear and our denim category for Europe.
In North America, the U.S. market in particular was plagued by further deterioration in traffic and consumer spending trends in the company's U.S. stores. These stores are highly penetrated in international tourist location and were affected by the unseasonably warm weather. Margins in the U.S. Tommy business were under pressure throughout the quarter as we were forced to be much more promotional in order to manage inventory levels.
As we have moved into the fourth quarter, we have seen these challenging sales and margin trends continue. We expect the holiday season to be highly promotional, especially on cold-weather product, and we are planning the fourth quarter accordingly. It is critical that we move through inventory and in the year, clean from an inventory perspective so that Spring 2016 is not burdened with carryover merchandise. That's what's driving our plans for the fourth quarter.
As we move to our Heritage business. Heritage had a good third quarter and is in the midst of a strong turnaround. Earnings for the group was up 18%, and this improvement should continue into the fourth quarter. We have seen strong performance in just about all of our divisions. Just some quick highlights. 
In the dress shirt division, the Van Heusen flex color has been an extraordinary success for us. We're seeing much higher average shoe unit retails out of the door, and we believe that consumer's reacting very favorably to our marketing campaign.
This new technology will be introduced into our other major dress shirt brands, including Calvin Klein, Ken Cole and Tommy Hilfiger. 
We're also seeing strength in our Warner's intimate business in the midtier channel, especially at Kohl's, and we expect that trend to continue into the fourth quarter with strong selling through Black Friday holiday weekend. We also in our wholesale sports business seen improvement from the prior year, led by the IZOD division with strong performances throughout its account chain.
Our direct-to-consumer retail business also saw operating profit improvement in the quarter with Van Heusen posting 11% comps store increase for the third quarter. And those positive trends have continued into the fourth quarter with mid single-digit increases for the Heritage division.
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Mike to quantify some of these results."

The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. On a constant currency basis, revenues for the third quarter were up 3% versus the prior year and in line with our guidance. Driving our revenue increase was our Calvin Klein business, which delivered a 7% constant currency increase over the prior year. Both our North America and our international business had revenue growth of 7% in constant currency, driven by strong wholesale shipments.
Our Calvin Klein strategies are taking hold and we are seeing improved performance in underwear globally, as well as strong performance in our international business, particularly in Europe and China. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 4% in constant currency, also in line with our guidance, with strong revenues in our international businesses, which had revenues up 6% from constant currency and Europe comps up 10% with all major markets showing increases.
Our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein United States retail stores located in international tourist destinations continued to be under significant pressure from a lack of traffic and spending, but these declines were more than offset by the performance in other areas. In addition, our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein U.S. retail stores located in centers that are not heavily penetrated the international tourists performed well and had positive comps for the third quarter.
Our Heritage business revenues were down 5%, due to the continued rationalization of our Heritage business, which included exiting the IZOD retail business, as well as several license dress shirt product lines in our dress shirt business. Earnings per share for the second quarter was $2.66 and included a $0.44 negative impact related to foreign currency and continued weakness in our Russia business. Excluding this negative impact, EPS would have increased 21% over the prior year.
Our quarter 3 EPS was $0.16 ahead of the top end of our guidance. The $0.16 beat was comprised of $0.10 related to the business outperformance, which was predominantly in Calvin Klein, an interest expense benefit of $0.02 and a tax benefit of $0.08, and that was partially offset by $0.04 of FX headwinds.
For the full year 2015, our earnings per share guidance remains unchanged with $6.90 to $7. This includes an additional $0.05 for foreign currency versus our previous guidance. If we exclude the negative impact related to foreign currency and weakness in Russia business of $1.35, our earnings per share growth is projected to be 13% to 14% over the prior year.
Revenue is now projected to be up 3% for the year, excluding the foreign currency impact of 6%. Our new revenue guidance reflects a decrease of 1% for the prior year versus our previous guidance on a constant currency basis.
Overall operating margins are expected to be flat to the prior year, excluding a negative impact of about 80 basis points due to foreign currency. Our Calvin Klein business is projecting revenues to grow 8% on a constant currency basis and operating margins to increase 80 to 90 basis points, excluding a negative impact of approximately 40 basis points of FX.
Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 3% on a constant currency basis, with operating margins planned down 120 to 130 basis points, excluding the negative impact of approximately 100 basis points of FX. Tommy Hilfiger International margins are planned went up with North America operating margins planned down after FX. This decline in North America is due to pressure on newer stores located in international tourist locations. 
Our Heritage business is planned to have a revenue decrease of 3%, due mostly to the exit of our IZOD retail business in 2015. Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to increase about 120 to 130 basis points. The impact of currency on a Heritage business is relatively immaterial.
Interest for the year is planned to be $150 million compared to the prior year amount of $139 million, due to our lower average debt balances. Also favorably impacting interest for 2015 is the debt refinancing we did in last year's first quarter, as well as lower revolver borrowers. We currently expect to generate approximately 450 free cash flow in 2015, which will be used pay down debt of about $350 million and allow for continued stock repurchases. Our tax rate for the year is planned at about 20%.
Our revenue for the fourth quarter is planned up 5% on a constant currency basis. By business, we are estimating third quarter revenues on a constant currency basis to increase 15% for Calvin Klein, driven in part by the Chinese New Year, increase 1% for Tommy Hilfiger and decrease 4% for our Heritage brands. Heritage brand revenues are negatively impacted by the closing of the IZOD retail division.
Fourth quarter earnings per share is planned at $1.37 to $1.47 and includes approximately $0.33 of estimated negative impact from foreign currency and the decline in our Russia business. If we exclude the this negative impact, EPS is projected to be in the range of a 3% decrease to a 2% increase over the prior year.
Interest expense is projected to be $30 million and taxes to be about 20.5% in the fourth quarter. Finally, as we look forward to 2016, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar will negatively impact our 2016 earnings versus 2015 earnings by between $1.50 and $1.60 per share based on current exchange rates. Approximately 80% of the 2016 projected negative foreign currency impact is expected to be on transaction basis, while 20% of the negative impact is expected to be on a translation basis. Our exposure at a transactional level is mostly due to the purchasing of inventory in U.S. dollars by our international divisions.
And with that, I'll open up to questions."

I think we'll get back to our historical rates of growth in the low single-digit range, moving our profitability close to the 10%. And I think that from an earnings point of view for at least the next 12 to 15 months, we'd anticipate that the Heritage business will be a contributed to our earnings growth. On -- from a Tommy point of view, I think for the next short term, I think that business will be under more pressure. It's, I think, the pressure will come, as you rightly said, much more from the U.S. business, which is feeling even more dramatically the strengthening dollar and the impact it has on tourism in the United States. Our Tommy business, it has benefited in the past from growing that tourist trade and really has benefited from both South American and Latin American travel, as well as European travels. And both of those currencies are anywhere from 20% to 25% weaker. And in the case of Brazil, closer to 40% to 45% weaker. And that have discouraged travel into the United States. So I think that clearly will continue into the first quarter -- fourth quarter of this year and probably into the first and second quarter of next year, as we go forward, as we cycle the strengthening dollars as we move forward. 
Long-term, I don't think it's really changed what we see with the Tommy business. We think that business should continue to grow in the mid to high single-digits. I think that growth will be driven more substantially from outside the United States, particularly Asia, South America and Latin America, where we hope to be adding new businesses to our portfolio that today are either joint ventures or license businesses today. On the Calvin business, we see nothing but momentum in the business, both on the underwear side, which is clearly really outperforming all of our expectations, and on the jeans outside of the United States. That business continues to outperform for us as well. And there, I think our goal will be on a local currency basis to continue to grow that business in the high single-digit range. So that's where we are, David."

But I think it is with us and clearly, it's going to be with us for all of '16 since we're hedged down 12 to 18 months is where we -- as we try to position ourselves as we go forward. So the difficulty we are facing is given that European market, given the significant lack of any sign of inflation in that European market so far, we've been challenged to really raise prices dramatically. I think, as I mentioned in my comments, we raised retail selling prices into the market about 2% in spring. We've continued to grow units. We think it's challenging in this environment. Most other players I think will agree with us to really going to market and start to raise price, especially when you're a market leader in every major department store throughout Europe with the Tommy Hilfiger brand. It's very challenging in key core categories, classification businesses really have major positions to start to raise prices too dramatically. So we're looking at other levers. But I think, unfortunately, the offsets that we'll be able to create surely, from a pricing point of view and a sourcing point of view, are probably -- we'll probably be able to offset 20% of it. But that's what we're looking on right now. And then I think the improvement of the business as we go forward, as we go into fall at, I think the secretory opportunities potentially raise prices if the market starts to accept and it as it starts to really take hold hopefully, in the market, and as we start to see some of its improving sales trends that we're seeing in our business, hopefully, cascade throughout the entire retail industry."

But at the same time, that we had a strong August and September, October was weaker. And then as we got into November, we saw weakness. So this unseasonably warm weather pressure pictures I built particularly in cold weather categories. And it's going to be an accepted fourth quarter to that through a lot of that. I think, competitively, we are in a good position as anyone. Our 2 fashion brands aren't overexposed from a pure Cold-weather category. We've got out of way of our business but it tends to be much more fashionable and more lightweight. So we don't have some of the exposure some other brands might have those years. But we think we do have a big center business, big flannel business, big headwind business, began late Underwear business. To be honest, given some of the lightweight categories, we're just not getting attracted of the sword that you would hope for that usually called driver tribespeople in. So it is the holiday season. Christmas will come. People will shop. And consumer's is in relatively good shape. But the consumer is really getting some great bargains out there and the mall is definitely on sale, especially at specialty apparel. You're really seeing prices that are 50% to 70% off store wide. In this weekend, I think it's going to be pretty aggressive. You even see it online. So long-winded answer to. I expect margins to be under pressure in the U.S. and inventory levels to come down, but we'll come down over the fourth quarter into the first quarter as people move through its, and it's all been factored into our guidance, I believe."

But as retailers, when the miss of their sales plan and then they adjust their sales plans going forward, you have to adjust accordingly. So we won't get caught with inventory. But it will put pressure on sales growth in the U.S. as we go forward. And it's a reason that we've always tried to be as balanced as possible with our distribution strategy. Our own stores, both out with regular price, not only in North America, but globally. Selling online directly to consumers on sales and also using third-party Internet players to sell through that makes sense. It's all about how that our brand is appropriately positioned. What's the holistic outlook for that, and trying to position ourselves that we are agnostic about where we sell the goods, whether it's through our own brick-and-mortar or through wholesale department stores or direct to the consumer on the Internet. Now the only thing that's challenged is in the last few years as we in fact, scale up of the Internet business, the -- that business has not been as profitable as it's been cannibalized. But over time, as we go into '16 and '17, that business should get to a profit level that equates pretty much with our wholesale and retail business just as that business scales up. So we feel we're on track. We've made the investments systemically. We've made the investments from a marketing point of view. And Calvin Klein, I would tell you that over 50% of our advertising today direct to consumer is digital, and Tommy's probably close to 40%. On both of those, I think, that exposure will continue because that's where I think it really could connect with the consumer and do business. And we are will be moving more and more towards of that in engaging with consumer on a divisional basis. So I think the wall is changing and we need -- and our brands need to move related in our distribution channel needs to move with it as well."

So we benefit from that. We are, in the Tommy business, our license business. So we don't see the topline growth there in the same fashion. So that's the difference between the 2. Secondarily, we've also converted to a number of stores, our accessory stores and underwear stores in North America, which came on, which really came on in late third quarter and will be in place for the fourth quarter. That's really helping the business. Those stores are really off to a start for us. And real positive about that. So their number -- I think 15% is, by its nature, if you look at our guidance too high, but I think the similar 7% to 9% kind of growth. That's what's factored into the ongoing business and nothing has really slowed down there didn't give us any concerns."

I think what you'll see next year is, if you look at how its progressed is, last year, we really didn't feel much of an impact as currency started to move in last year's fourth quarter. As we got into the first and second quarter, we saw some impact, but I think that the full impact that came through starting in the third quarter this year, July and August of this year in particular. And I think that's, for a couple of the reasons, one is people tend to book vacations 6 months out and they book them and there was, I think, there was a tempting not to cancel this much. So that will start to factor in as we go forward. So I think quarter-by-quarter, I think will be impacted in the first quarter and then to a degree and second quarter. And then it should hopefully, start to level out as we go into the second half of next year. And that's the way we're probably going to be planning our business unless we see some change."

The Italian market, we are very encouraged about what we see mainly because in the last 3 years, it's been a drain, both at Calvin and Tommy. And by that I mean, it's probably down over a 3-year period from where it had been 45%. So it's been down 10% to 15% a year for the last 3 years. This year, second half is the first time we saw that trend start to turn. I wouldn't, just to put things in perspective. I wouldn't classify the Italian market as healthy and vibrant. But I would say it's their midst beginnings of the turnaround. It's stabilized, and we're growing working off of it in the high single-digit kind of range. So that feels good, particularly in Calvin, we're really seeing stronger growth because I think we won exposure in that market in the consumers acceptance of the Calvin Klein brand in Italy and how well done historically there, think are starting to get paid back for some of the product advancements we've made, for some of the close down of the innovation stores to better stores direct to consumer and even in the wholesale channel there, we really got in the business back on track. So I think we can continue to see outside growth on the Calvin Klein business there. But I guess I would say is we are encouraged by what we see in Europe overall. Spain, in particular, we -- it's been -- the telling market. But if you go back, it went through a tough period of time with our largest wholesale account really struggling during the period of time. We see that period we stabilize in saw strength and as we go forward. So our business in Spain continues to grow. And then with the Calvin product, the U.K, France, the Scandinavian market, Germany in particular, which is by far the biggest market in Europe, where Calvin had 3 years ago, a very limited presence, it will probably become our biggest market for the Calvin Klein brand in 2016.

Right now, for the spring season, that's where we are. We hope that can improve as we go into the third quarter. So the $1.20 number, $1.25 number that we talked about last time really increased to the $1.50 to $1.60 number totally based on what's really gone into the euro into a limited degree, what's going on with the Canadian dollar. So that's the fundamental change. And then, that -- as we've now, we are probably 85% locked in to 90% locked in with hedges for 2016. This is where it's kind of looks like it's actually falling out.

And what safe is beginning -- regard sites getting hurt on the top line. They're really getting rid on the margin line. So what I would like to say, there are some years that are sales years and there are some years that our margin years. And I think for retailers and probably foremost apparel companies next year is got to be a margin year because the margins are depressed. You can see it in front of you so that you can really plan better for that and then they'll tend to change goods into the fall season as of those opportunities percent themselves. So we'll maybe try to be smart inventory and decide where it's appropriate to take some risk next year in the second half with some inventory if we start to see some positive trends and some selling.

So overall, we were quite pleased with our results for the third quarter, which exceeded the top end of our guidance by $0.16, despite the volatile overall market environment. Our results continue to highlight the strength of our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger international businesses as well as improving trends in our Heritage businesses.
Let me give you a quick update by region what we see going on in the third quarter and as we move into the fourth quarter. In the U.S., the U.S. market during the third quarter and currently into the fourth quarter continues to experience increased softness in traffic trends in large part driven by a decline in international tourist traffic and spending trends, coupled with unseasonably warm weather. Not surprising, giving all the news reports that the U.S. is almost challenged macro environment. We had a good Thanksgiving, Black Friday weekend. But overall, November was a soft month driven by highly promotional macro environment as a result of elevated inventory levels throughout the industry. For the fourth quarter, we expect these trends to continue and are anticipating a highly promotional holiday selling season.
Moving to Europe. Europe continues to be our strongest market. Both Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger posted double-digit comp store increases in the third quarter. As we moved into the fourth quarter, we continued to see strong comp store sales performance at both of our European businesses.
The trend of plus mid-single-digit comp continues despite a brief slowdown due to the Paris attacks. We have seen improving trends in all major European markets, including Spain and Italy, which had been under pressure, and those markets seem to have significantly turned around. We expect these positive trends to continue throughout the fourth quarter.
In Asia, Asia continued to post healthy sales gains with Calvin and Tommy in the third quarter driven by our China business. These trends continue into the fourth quarter as China continues to demonstrate strong results. However, we anticipate continued weakness in Korea driven by more -- driven more by the broader market environment and softness in Hong Kong in large part due to the lack of Mainland Chinese tourists coming to the Island.
Brazil, Latin America continues to be difficult and volatile but very profitable for us. We expect this business to continue to be under pressure and volatile. We believe we are gaining share from our peers, and the business continues to be highly profitable. However, growth levels are significantly lower than we would have anticipated at the beginning of the year, given the volatility that's going on, particularly in Brazil.
On a brand basis, moving to Calvin Klein. Overall, we continue to see great momentum with the brand and our business more broadly. Calvin Klein revenues increased 7% on a constant currency basis for the quarter. We have seen great progress across our businesses as we continue expand our directly operated businesses across jeans, underwear, sportswear and accessories. In addition, our Calvin Klein royalties increased 10% in the quarter, further demonstrating the overall strength of the brand. We are seeing strong growth in women's apparel and accessories, women's and men's footwear and men's tailored clothing.
Globally, our underwear performance continues to be a great -- continues with great momentum, with the women's performance outperforming our strong men's business with a lot of opportunity ahead of us. Key initiatives in this business include faster replenishment; maximizing our high-end Black Label fashion product in all international markets; and most significantly, keeping up with the growth of our women's Modern Cotton logo business, which continues to grow dramatically in North America and Europe. To give you a sense of how we're doing with the brand in the United States on the men's side, on the men's underwear bottoms business, our market share has grown to over 30% in department stores, and that's up high single digits for the year.
On the top side of the business, we have historically been the #3 player in department stores. And in the third quarter, we moved into the #2 position for the first time in the brand's history. 
On the women's side of the business, the bra category overall is up low single digits, and the Calvin Klein business is up 15% year-to-date. And we are one of the top categories in all major department stores. Our panty -- the panty category overall in the U.S. market is flat, and the Calvin Klein business is up double digits for the year.
We have seen -- we have also seen strong performance in our Calvin Klein jeans business with the continued improvement in product, which has been evidenced across all our markets. We are increasingly focused on key initiatives to drive the business forward, including supply chain initiatives around our denim efforts across the company, significant number of capsule collections and faster overall replenishment.
Asia and Latin America continue to be our 2 strongest markets for jeans with continued mid single-digit sales growth and improving profitability. As it relates to our to 2 turnaround markets, the U.S. and Europe for jeans, we have seen an acceleration in our European jeans business, as our improved product execution and customer satisfaction is paying off. 
On like-for-like product, we are seeing outperformance against our -- against both genders. Our best performing markets include Spain, the U.K. and the Italian market for jeans.
Overall, for Calvin Klein Europe across all product categories, our spring/summer 2016 order book is up mid-teens, excluding the Russia business. We continue to see increasing acceptance and performance for the brand across all wholesale accounts in all major European markets.
As we look at our U.S. jeans turnaround, we saw solid performance in the first half of the year in this business. But as we moved into full holiday season, as a result of the softness in the overall U.S. retail landscape, primarily driven by unseasonably warm weather, we have begun to see a softness in this business.
Overall, department store sales growth decelerated in the quarter to 2% to 4% increase by major account, with strong performance at some of other retail partners, including Urban Outfitters and Amazon.
Moving on to Tommy Hilfiger. Overall, our Tommy Hilfiger sales increased 4% on a constant currency basis, driven by our Tommy Hilfiger International businesses. In 3Q, we saw strong performance with growth of about 7%, driven by a tremendous 10% increase in comp store sales, which further highlights the strength of the Tommy business across Europe. These strong comp store sales increases have continued into the fourth quarter of this year with comp trends up mid single-digits. Given these strong trends, we believe we are growing our market share in all major European markets.
We saw a great feedback from our marketing campaigns with all our major retail accounts. The Rafael Nadal fall marketing campaign, which focused on underwear and tailored clothing had positive results. The Nadal marketing campaign will continue with the spring/summer 2016. As a reminder, our European spring/summer 2016 wholesale order book is up about 4%, excluding Russia, driven by 2% increase in retail selling prices and a 2% unit volume increase. The categories experiencing the most growth included underwear and our denim category for Europe.
In North America, the U.S. market in particular, was plagued by further deterioration of traffic and consumer spending trends in the company's U.S. stores. These stores are highly penetrated in international tourist locations and were affected by the unseasonably warm weather. Margins in the U.S. Tommy business were under pressure throughout the quarter as we were forced to be much more promotional in order to manage inventory levels.
As we have moved into the fourth quarter, we have seen these challenging sales and margin trends continue. We expect the holiday season to be highly promotional, especially on cold weather product, and we are planning the fourth quarter accordingly. It is critical that we move through inventory and in the year clean from an inventory perspective, so that spring 2016 is not burdened with carryover merchandise. That's what's driving our plans for the fourth quarter.
As we move to our Heritage business. Heritage had a good third quarter and is in the midst of a strong turnaround. Earnings for the group was up 18%, and this improvement should continue into the fourth quarter. We have seen strong performance in just about all of our divisions. 
Just some quick highlights.  In the dress shirt division, the Van Heusen flex color has been an extraordinary success for us. We're seeing much higher average unit retails out the door, and we believe that consumer is reacting very favorably to our marketing campaign.  This new technology will be introduced into our other major dress shirt brands, including Calvin Klein, Kenneth Cole and Tommy Hilfiger. 
We are also seeing strength in our Warner's intimate business in the mid-tier channel, especially at Kohl's, and we expect that trend to continue into the fourth quarter with strong selling through Black Friday holiday weekend. We are also in our wholesale sportswear business seeing improvement from the prior year, led by the IZOD division with strong performances throughout its account chain.
Our direct-to-consumer retail business also saw operating profit improvement in the quarter, with Van Heusen posting 11% comps store increase for the third quarter. And those positive trends have continued into the fourth quarter with mid-single-digit increases for the Heritage division.
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Mike to quantify some of these results."

The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. On a constant currency basis, revenues for the third quarter were up 3% versus the prior year and in line with our guidance. Driving our",965,"Thanks, Manny. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. 
On a constant currency basis, revenues for the third quarter were up 3% versus the prior year and in line with our guidance. Driving our revenue increase was our Calvin Klein business, which delivered a 7% constant currency increase over the prior year. Both our North America and our international business had revenue growth of 7% in constant currency, driven by strong wholesale shipments.
Our Calvin Klein strategies are taking hold, and we are seeing improved performance in underwear globally as well as strong performance in our international business, particularly in Europe and China. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 4% in constant currency, also in line with our guidance, with strong revenues in our international businesses, which had revenues up 6% from constant currency and Europe comps up 10% with all major markets showing increases.
Our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein United States retail stores located in international tourist destinations continued to be under significant pressure from a lack of traffic and spending, but these declines were more than offset by the performance in other areas. 
In addition, our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein U.S. retail stores located in centers that are not heavily penetrated by international tourists performed well and had positive comps for the third quarter.
Our Heritage business revenues were down 5%, due to the continued rationalization of our Heritage business, which included exiting the IZOD retail business as well as several license dress shirt product lines in our dress shirt business. Earnings per share for the second quarter was $2.66 and included a $0.44 negative impact related to foreign currency and continued weakness in our Russia business. Excluding this negative impact, EPS would have increased 21% over the prior year.
Quarter 3 EPS was $0.16 ahead of the top end of our guidance. The $0.16 beat was comprised of $0.10 related to the business outperformance, which was predominantly in Calvin Klein; an interest expense benefit of $0.02; and a tax benefit of $0.08. And that was partially offset by $0.04 of FX headwinds.
For the full year 2015, our earnings per share guidance remains unchanged at $6.90 to $7. This includes an additional $0.05 for foreign currency versus our previous guidance. If we exclude the negative impact related to foreign currency and weakness in the Russia business of $1.35, our earnings per share growth is projected to be 13% to 14% over the prior year.
Revenue is now projected to be up 3% for the year, excluding the foreign currency impact of 6%. Our new revenue guidance reflects a decrease of 1% for the prior year versus our previous guidance on a constant currency basis.
Overall operating margins are expected to be flat to the prior year, excluding a negative impact of about 80 basis points due to foreign currency. Our Calvin Klein business is projecting revenues to grow 8% on a constant currency basis and operating margins to increase 80 to 90 basis points, excluding a negative impact of approximately 40 basis points of FX.
Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 3% on a constant currency basis, with operating margins planned down 120 to 130 basis points, excluding the negative impact of approximately 100 basis points of FX. Tommy Hilfiger International margins are planned up with North America operating margins planned down after FX. This decline in North America is due to pressure on U.S. stores located in international tourist locations. 
Our Heritage business is planned to have a revenue decrease of 3%, due mostly to the exit of our IZOD retail business in 2015. Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to increase about 120 to 130 basis points. The impact of currency on a Heritage business is relatively immaterial.
Interest for the year is planned to be $150 million compared to the prior year amount of $139 million, due to our lower average debt balances. Also favorably impacting interest for 2015 is the debt refinancing we did in last year's first quarter as well as lower revolver borrowers. We currently expect to generate approximately $450 free cash flow in 2015, which will be used to pay down debt of about $350 million and allow for continued stock repurchases. Our tax rate for the year is planned at about 20%.
Our revenue for the fourth quarter is planned up 5% on a constant currency basis. By business, we are estimating third quarter revenues on a constant currency basis to increase 15% for Calvin Klein, driven in part by the Chinese New Year, increase 1% for Tommy Hilfiger and decrease 4% for our Heritage brands. Heritage brand revenues are negatively impacting by the closing of the IZOD retail division.
Fourth quarter earnings per share is planned at $1.37 to $1.47 and includes approximately $0.33 of estimated negative impact from foreign currency and the decline in our Russia business. If we exclude the this negative impact, EPS is projected to be in the range of a 3% decrease to a 2% increase over the prior year.
Interest expense is projected to be $30 million and taxes to be about 20.5% in the fourth quarter. Finally, as we look forward to 2016, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar will negatively impact our 2016 earnings versus 2015 earnings by between $1.50 and $1.60 per share based on current exchange rates. Approximately 80% of the 2016 projected negative foreign currency impact is expected to be on transaction basis, while 20% of the negative impact is expected to be on a translation basis. Our exposure at a transactional level is mostly due to the purchasing of inventory in U.S. dollars by our international divisions.
And with that, I'll open it up to questions."

I think Heritage will start to be -- will not be a headwind any longer. I think we'll get back to our historical rate of growth that's in the low single-digit range, moving our profitability close to the 10%. And I think that from an earnings point of view, for at least the next 12 to 15 months, we'd anticipate that the Heritage business will be a contributed to our earnings growth. On -- from a Tommy point of view, I think for the next -- in the short term, I think that business will be under more pressure. It's -- I think the pressure will come, as you rightly said, much more from the U.S. business, which is feeling even more dramatically the strengthening dollar and the impact it has on tourism in the United States. Our Tommy business, it has benefited in the past from growing that tourist trade and really has benefited from both South American and Latin American travel as well as European travel. And both of those currencies are anywhere from 20% to 25% weaker and in the case of Brazil, closer to 40% to 45% weaker. And that has discouraged travel into the United States. So I think that clearly will continue into the first quarter -- fourth quarter of this year and probably into the first and second quarter of next year, as we go forward, as we cycle the strengthening dollars as we move forward.  Long term, I don't think it's really changed what we see with the Tommy business. We think that business should continue to grow in the mid- to high single digits. I think that growth will be driven more substantially from outside the United States, particularly Asia, South America and Latin America, where we hope to be adding new businesses to our portfolio that today are either joint ventures or license businesses today. On the Calvin business, we see nothing but momentum in the business, both on the underwear side, which is clearly really outperforming all of our expectations.  And on the jeans, outside of the United States, that business continues to outperform for us as well. And there, I think, our goal would be on a local currency basis to continue to grow that business in the high single-digit range. So that's where we are, David."

But I think it's with us and clearly, it's going to be with us for all of '16 since we're hedged down 12 to 18 months is where we go -- as we try to position ourselves as we go forward. So the difficulty we are facing is, given the European market, given the significant lack of any sign of inflation in that European market, so far, we've been challenged to really raise prices dramatically. I think, as I mentioned in my comments, we raised retail selling prices into the market about 2% in spring. We've continued to grow units. We think it's challenging in this environment. Most other players, I think, have agreed with us to really going to that market and start to raise price, especially when you're a market leader in every major department store throughout Europe with the Tommy Hilfiger brand. It's very challenging in key core categories, classification businesses really have major positions to start to raise prices too dramatically. So we're looking at other levers. But I think, unfortunately, the offsets that we'll be able to create, surely from a pricing point of view and a sourcing point of view, are probably -- we'll probably able to offset 20% of it. But that's what we're looking at right now. And then I think the improvement of the business as we go forward, as we go into fall, I think, there is a greater opportunity to potentially raise prices, if the market starts to accept it and as it starts to really take hold hopefully in the market. As we start to see some of this improving sales trends that we're seeing in our business, hopefully cascade throughout the entire retail industry."

And our 2 biggest -- our 3 biggest are Canada, Brazil and then Europe, and we've known what's happened with those currencies.

And I think, as we look at '16, that's the position we're going to be in. And as we get into the -- as we report fourth quarter, obviously, we'll give guidance and give more clarity.

We had a big earnings beat in the third quarter. And normally, if things were much more reasonable, we'd be anticipating -- we would have anticipated that we would have taken the year up. But at the same time that we had a strong August and September, October was weaker, and as we got into November, we saw weakness. So this unseasonably warm weather is putting a lot of pressure on it. Inventories are built, particularly in cold weather categories. And it's going to be an expensive fourth quarter to get through a lot of that. I think, competitively, we are in a good position as anyone. Our 2 fashion brands aren't overexposed from a pure cold-weather category. We've got out of way of our business, but it tends to be much more fashionable and more lightweight. So we don't have some of the exposure that some other brands might have in those areas, but we do have a big sweater business, big flannel business, big [indiscernible] business, big heavyweight outerwear business and -- to be honest, even some of the lighter weight categories, we're just not getting the traffic in the store that you would hope for, that usually cold weather drives people in. So it is the holiday season, Christmas will come, people will shop, the consumer is in relatively good shape. But the consumer is really getting some great bargains out there and the mall is definitely on sale, especially at specialty apparel. You're really seeing prices that are 50% to 70% off storewide. And this weekend, I think it's going to be pretty aggressive. You even see it online. So long-winded answer to, I expect margins to be under pressure in the U.S. and inventory levels to come down, but we'll come down over the fourth quarter into the first quarter as people move through it.

The concern we have right now and [indiscernible] really been focused on is given the softer selling retailers are now looking at turns as they get into the spring season, they trying to be much more cautious -- look, they're coming out of the season with higher inventory positions and they're trying to reposition it. So what we're trying to do is help work with them to deal with some takedowns and some sales estimates right now and reallocate the goods to do our price market, but do it in the most efficient fashion. The challenge that that's going to face as we go into spring is that the off-price channel has just got about anything they'd want right now. There's more inventory in that channel than ever before. They're being very aggressive in the pricing point of view. So we're being very aggressive about using our own retail stores to clear the goods in the most efficient way possible and trying to really capture that business in especially warm weather, store locations as we go -- as we start to turn into January. So we are proactively working through it, but I think it's an industry problem. It's going to be with us as we go through first quarter."

I think what it does highlight is that the wholesale model is built in a way that you don't necessarily feel all the pain as sell-through is happening. Now in the U.S. markets [indiscernible] gross margins and allowances, you feel it. But as retailers, when they miss their sales plan and then they adjust their sales plans going forward, you have to adjust accordingly. So we won't get caught with inventory. But it will put pressure on sales growth in the U.S. as we go forward. And it's a reason that we've always tried to be as balanced as possible with our distribution strategy. Our own stores, both outlet and regular price, not only in North America, but globally; selling online directly to consumers on sales; and also using third-party Internet players to sell-through that makes sense. It's all about how that our brand is appropriately positioned. What's the holistic outlook for that, and trying to position ourselves that we are agnostic about where we sell the goods, whether it's through our own brick and mortar or through wholesale department stores or direct to the consumer on the Internet. Now the only thing that's challenged is in the last few years as we had scaled up the Internet business, the -- that business has not been as profitable as it's been cannibalized, but over time, as we go into '16 and '17, that business should get to a profit level that equates pretty much with our wholesale and retail business just as that business scales up. So we feel we're on track. We've made the investments systemically. We've made the investments from a marketing point of view. And Calvin Klein, I would tell you that over 50% of our advertising today direct to consumer is digital, and Tommy is probably close to 40%. On both of those -- that exposure will continue, because that's where I think you really could connect with the consumer and do business. And we are really moving more and more towards that and engaging with consumer on a digital basis. So I think the world is changing and we need -- and our brands need to move with it and our distribution channel needs to move with it as well."

As we got into the first and second quarter, we saw some impact, but I think the full impact that came through starting in the third quarter of this year, July and August of this year in particular. And I think that's for a couple of the reasons: One is people tend to book vacations 6 months out and they book them and there was, I think, they were attempting not to cancel as much. And so that will start to factor in as we go forward.

The Italian market, we are very encouraged about what we see mainly because in the last 3 years, it's been a drain, both the Calvin and Tommy.

This year, second half is the first time we saw that trend start to turn. I wouldn't, just to put things in perspective, I wouldn't classify the Italian market as healthy and vibrant, but I would say it's in the midst of beginnings of the turnaround, it's stabilized, and we're growing off of it in the high single-digit kind of range. So that feels good. Particularly in Calvin, we're really seeing stronger growth, because I think we won our exposure in that market and the consumer's acceptance of the Calvin Klein brand in Italy and how well we've done historically there, I think we are starting to get paid back for some of the product advancements we've made, for some of the close down of the inefficient stores to better stores, direct to consumer; and even in the wholesale channel there, we really got into business back on track. So I think we can continue to see outsized growth on the Calvin Klein business there. But I guess I would say is we are encouraged by what we see in Europe overall. Spain, in particular, we -- it's been ahead of the Italian market. But if you go back, it went through a tough period of time with our largest wholesale account [indiscernible] really struggling during a period of time. We've seen that business really stabilize and stop strengthen as we go forward. So our business in Spain continues to grow.

So what I would like to say, there are some years that are sales years and there are some years that are margin years. And I think for retailers and probably for most apparel companies, next year is got to be a margin year, because the margins are depressed. You can see it in front of you so you can really plan better for that and then they'll tend to chase goods into the fall season as those opportunities present themselves. So we'll also maybe try to be smart inventory and decide where it's appropriate to take some risk next year in the second half with some inventory if we start to see some positive trends and some selling.

We think that even if it's accepted by the retailer, it's got a dramatically affect your sell-throughs. And you have to really look at your competitor set and what you're doing. You can look at it in isolation. So we're really trying to manage that and think it through very thoughtfully about managing gross margin percentage versus gross margin dollars to see what will give us the optimal answer. And as we are trying to protect with the Tommy business, a very large market position, we're not giving up market share. They're competitive sets, so they can come and underbid us for potential categories. So that's the balancing act that's going on right now.
Well, I would like to thank everybody for joining us. I look forward to seeing you on the new year. I wish everybody happy holidays, Merry Christmas and a happy and healthy new year to you and your families. Thank you very much. Have a great day."

So overall, we were quite pleased with our results for the third quarter, which exceeded the top end of our guidance by $0.16, despite the volatile overall market environment. Our results continue to highlight the strength of our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger international businesses as well as improving trends in our Heritage businesses.
Let me give you a quick update by region, what we see going on in the third quarter and as we move into the fourth quarter. In the U.S., the U.S. market during the third quarter and currently into the fourth quarter continues to experience increased softness in traffic trends in large part driven by a decline in international tourist traffic and spending trends, coupled with unseasonably warm weather. Not surprising, giving all the news reports that the U.S. is our most challenged macro environment. We had a good Thanksgiving, Black Friday weekend. But overall, November was a soft month driven by highly promotional macro environment as a result of elevated inventory levels throughout the industry. For the fourth quarter, we expect these trends to continue and are anticipating a highly promotional holiday selling season.
Moving to Europe. Europe continues to be our strongest market. Both Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger posted double-digit comp store increases in the third quarter. As we moved into the fourth quarter, we continued to see strong comp store sales performance at both of our European businesses.
The trend of plus mid-single digit comp continues despite a brief slowdown due to the Paris attacks. We have seen improving trends in all major European markets, including Spain and Italy, which had been under pressure, and those markets seem to have significantly turned around. We expect these positive trends to continue throughout the fourth quarter.
In Asia, Asia continued to post healthy sales gains with Calvin and Tommy in the third quarter driven by our China business. These trends continue into the fourth quarter as China continues to demonstrate strong results. However, we anticipate continued weakness in Korea driven by more -- driven more by the broader market environment and softness in Hong Kong in large part due to the lack of Mainland Chinese tourists coming to the Island.
Brazil, Latin America continues to be difficult and volatile, but very profitable for us. We expect this business to continue to be under pressure and volatile. We believe we are gaining share from our peers, and the business continues to be highly profitable. However, growth levels are significantly lower than we would have anticipated at the beginning of the year, given the volatility that's going on, particularly in Brazil.
On a brand basis, moving to Calvin Klein. Overall, we continue to see great momentum with the brand and our business more broadly. Calvin Klein revenues increased 7% on a constant currency basis for the quarter. We have seen great progress across our businesses as we continue to expand our directly operated businesses across jeans, underwear, sportswear and accessories. In addition, our Calvin Klein royalties increased 10% in the quarter, further demonstrating the overall strength of the brand. We are seeing strong growth in women's apparel and accessories, women's and men's footwear and men's tailored clothing.
Globally, our underwear performance continues to be a great -- continues with great momentum, with the women's performance outperforming our strong men's business with a lot of opportunity ahead of us. Key initiatives in this business include faster replenishment; maximizing our high-end Black Label fashion product in all international markets; and most significantly, keeping up with the growth of our women's Modern Cotton logo business, which continues to grow dramatically in North America and Europe. To give you a sense of how we're doing with the brand in the United States on the men's side, on the men's underwear bottoms business, our market share has grown to over 30% in department stores, and that's up high single digits for the year.
On the top side of the business, we have historically been the #3 player in department stores. And in the third quarter, we moved into the #2 position for the first time in the brand's history. 
On the women's side of the business, the bra category overall is up low single digits, and the Calvin Klein business is up 15% year-to-date. And we are one of the top categories in all major department stores. Our panty -- the panty category overall in the U.S. market is flat, and the Calvin Klein business is up double digits for the year.
We have seen -- we have also seen strong performance in our Calvin Klein jeans business with the continued improvement in product, which has been evidenced across all our markets. We are increasingly focused on key initiatives to drive the business forward, including supply chain initiatives around our denim efforts across the company, significant number of capsule collections and faster overall replenishment.
Asia and Latin America continue to be our 2 strongest markets for jeans with continued mid-single digit sales growth and improving profitability. As it relates to our to 2 turnaround markets, the U.S. and Europe for jeans, we have seen an acceleration in our European jeans business, as our improved product execution and customer satisfaction is paying off. 
On like-for-like product, we are seeing outperformance against our -- against both genders. Our best performing markets include Spain, the U.K. and the Italian market for jeans.
Overall, for Calvin Klein Europe across all product categories, our spring/summer 2016 order book is up mid-teens, excluding the Russia business. We continue to see increasing acceptance and performance for the brand across all wholesale accounts in all major European markets.
As we look at our U.S. jeans turnaround, we saw solid performance in the first half of the year in this business. But as we moved into fall holiday season, as a result of the softness in the overall U.S. retail landscape, primarily driven by unseasonably warm weather, we have begun to see a softness in this business.
Overall, department store sales growth decelerated in the quarter to 2% to 4% increase by major account, with strong performance at some of our other retail partners, including Urban Outfitters and Amazon.
Moving on to Tommy Hilfiger. Overall, our Tommy Hilfiger sales increased 4% on a constant currency basis, driven by our Tommy Hilfiger International businesses. In 3Q, we saw strong performance with growth of about 7%, driven by a tremendous 10% increase in comp store sales, which further highlights the strength of the Tommy business across Europe. These strong comp store sales increases have continued into the fourth quarter of this year with comp trends up mid-single digits. Given these strong trends, we believe we are growing our market share in all major European markets.
We saw a great feedback from our marketing campaigns with all our major retail accounts. The Rafael Nadal fall marketing campaign, which focused on underwear and tailored clothing had positive results. The Nadal marketing campaign will continue with the spring/summer 2016. As a reminder, our European spring/summer 2016 wholesale order book is up about 4%, excluding Russia, driven by a 2% increase in retail selling prices and a 2% unit volume increase. The categories experiencing the most growth included underwear and our denim category for Europe.
In North America, the U.S. market in particular, was plagued by further deterioration of traffic and consumer spending trends in the company's U.S. stores. These stores are highly penetrated in international tourist locations and were affected by the unseasonably warm weather. Margins in the U.S. Tommy business were under pressure throughout the quarter as we were forced to be much more promotional in order to manage inventory levels.
As we have moved into the fourth quarter, we have seen these challenging sales and margin trends continue. We expect the holiday season to be highly promotional, especially on cold weather product, and we are planning the fourth quarter accordingly. It is critical that we move through inventory and end the year clean from an inventory perspective, so that spring 2016 is not burdened with carryover merchandise. That's what's driving our plans for the fourth quarter.
As we move to our Heritage business. Heritage had a good third quarter and is in the midst of a strong turnaround. Earnings for the group was up 18%, and this improvement should continue into the fourth quarter. We have seen strong performance in just about all of our divisions. 
Just some quick highlights. In the dress shirt division, the Van Heusen flex collar has been an extraordinary success for us. We're seeing much higher average unit retails out the door, and we believe that the consumer is reacting very favorably to our marketing campaign. This new technology will be introduced into our other major dress shirt brands, including Calvin Klein, Kenneth Cole and Tommy Hilfiger. 
We are also seeing strength in our Warner's intimate business in the mid-tier channel, especially at Kohl's, and we expect that trend to continue into the fourth quarter with strong selling through Black Friday holiday weekend. We are also in our wholesale sportswear business seeing improvement from the prior year, led by the IZOD division with strong performances throughout its account chain.
Our direct-to-consumer retail business also saw operating profit improvement in the quarter, with Van Heusen posting 11% comp store increase for the third quarter. And those positive trends have continued into the fourth quarter with mid-single digit increases for the Heritage division.
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Mike to quantify some of these results."

The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release.

The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. 
On a constant currency basis, revenues for the third quarter were up 3% versus the prior year and in line with our guidance. Driving our revenue increase was our Calvin Klein business, which delivered a 7% constant currency increase over the prior year. Both our North America and our international business had revenue growth of 7% in constant currency, driven by strong wholesale shipments.
Our Calvin Klein strategies are taking hold, and we are seeing improved performance in underwear globally as well as strong performance in our international business, particularly in Europe and China. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 4% in constant currency, also in line with our guidance, with strong revenues in our international businesses, which had revenues up 6% from constant currency and Europe comps up 10% with all major markets showing increases.
Our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein United States retail stores located in international tourist destinations continued to be under significant pressure from a lack of traffic and spending, but these declines were more than offset by the performance in other areas. 
In addition, our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein U.S. retail stores located in centers that are not heavily penetrated by international tourists performed well and had positive comps for the third quarter.
Our Heritage business revenues were down 5%, due to the continued rationalization of our Heritage business, which included exiting the IZOD retail business as well as several licensed dress shirt product lines in our dress shirt business. 
Earnings per share for the second quarter was $2.66 and included a $0.44 negative impact related to foreign currency and continued weakness in our Russia business. Excluding this negative impact, EPS would have increased 21% over the prior year.
Our quarter 3 EPS was $0.16 ahead of the top end of our guidance. The $0.16 beat was comprised of $0.10 related to the business outperformance, which was predominantly in Calvin Klein; an interest expense benefit of $0.02; and a tax benefit of $0.08. And that was partially offset by $0.04 of FX headwinds.
For the full year 2015, our earnings per share guidance remains unchanged at $6.90 to $7. This includes an additional $0.05 hit for foreign currency versus our previous guidance. If we exclude the negative impact related to foreign currency and weakness in the Russia business of $1.35, our earnings per share growth is projected to be 13% to 14% over the prior year.
Revenue is now projected to be up 3% for the year, excluding the foreign currency impact of 6%. Our new revenue guidance reflects a decrease of 1% for the prior year versus our previous guidance on a constant currency basis.
Overall operating margins are expected to be flat to the prior year, excluding a negative impact of about 80 basis points due to foreign currency. Our Calvin Klein business is projecting revenues to grow 8% on a constant currency basis and operating margins to increase 80 to 90 basis points, excluding a negative impact of approximately 40 basis points of FX.
Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 3% on a constant currency basis, with operating margins planned down 120 to 130 basis points, excluding the negative impact of approximately 100 basis points of FX. Tommy Hilfiger International margins are planned up with North America operating margins planned down after FX. This decline in North America is due to pressure on U.S. stores located in international tourist locations. 
Our Heritage business is planned to have a revenue decrease of 3%, due mostly to the exit of our IZOD retail business in 2015. Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to increase about 120 to 130 basis points. The impact of currency on our Heritage business is relatively immaterial.
Interest for the year is planned to be $115 million compared to the prior year amount of $139 million, due to our lower average debt balances. Also favorably impacting interest for 2015 is the debt refinancing we did in last year's first quarter as well as lower revolver borrowings. We currently expect to generate approximately $450 of free cash flow in 2015, which will be used to pay down debt of about $350 million and allow for continued stock repurchases. Our tax rate for the year is planned at about 20%.
Our revenue for the fourth quarter is planned up 5% on a constant currency basis. By business, we are estimating third quarter revenues on a constant currency basis to increase 15% for Calvin Klein, driven in part by the Chinese New Year, increase 1% for Tommy Hilfiger and decrease 4% for our Heritage brands. Heritage brand revenues are negatively impacting by the closing of the IZOD retail division.
Fourth quarter earnings per share is planned at $1.37 to $1.47 and includes approximately $0.33 of estimated negative impact from foreign currency and the decline in our Russia business. If we exclude this negative impact, EPS is projected to be in the range of a 3% decrease to a 2% increase over the prior year.
Interest expense is projected to be $30 million and taxes to be about 20.5% in the fourth quarter.
Finally, as we look forward to 2016, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar will negatively impact our 2016 earnings versus 2015 earnings by between $1.50 and $1.60 per share based on current exchange rates. Approximately 80% of the 2016 projected negative foreign currency impact is expected to be on transaction basis, while 20% of the negative impact is expected to be on the translation basis. Our exposure at a transactional level is mostly due to the purchasing of inventory in U.S. dollars by our international divisions.
And with that, I'll open it up to questions."

I think Heritage will start to be -- will not be a headwind any longer. I think we'll get back to our historical rate of growth that's in the low single-digit range, moving our profitability closer to 10%. And I think that from an earnings point of view, for at least the next 12 to 15 months, we'd anticipate that the Heritage business will be a contributor to our earnings growth. On -- from a Tommy point of view, I think for the next -- in the short term, I think that business will be under more pressure. It's -- I think the pressure will come, as you rightly said, much more from the U.S. business, which is feeling even more dramatically the strengthening dollar and the impact it has on tourism in the United States. Our Tommy business, it has benefited in the past from growing that tourist trade and really has benefited from both South American and Latin American travel as well as European travel. And both of those currencies are anywhere from 20% to 25% weaker and in the case of Brazil, closer to 40% to 45% weaker. And that has discouraged travel into the United States. So I think that clearly will continue into the first quarter -- fourth quarter of this year and probably into the first and second quarter of next year, as we go forward, as we cycle the strengthening dollars as we move forward. Long term, I don't think it's really changed what we see with the Tommy business. We think that business should continue to grow in the mid- to high single digits. I think that growth will be driven more substantially from outside the United States, particularly Asia, South America and Latin America, where we hope to be adding new businesses to our portfolio that today are either joint ventures or license businesses today. On the Calvin business, we see nothing but momentum in the business, both on the underwear side, which is clearly really outperforming all of our expectations. And on the jeans, outside of the United States, that business continues to outperform for us as well. And there, I think, our goal would be on a local currency basis to continue to grow that business in the high single-digit range. So that's where we are, David."

But I think it's with us and clearly, it's going to be with us for all of '16 since we're hedged out 12 to 18 months is where we go -- as we try to position ourselves as we go forward. So the difficulty we are facing is, given the European market, given the significant lack of any sign of inflation in that European market, so far, we've been challenged to really raise prices dramatically. I think, as I mentioned in my comments, we raised retail selling prices into the market about 2% in spring. We've continued to grow units. We think it's challenging in this environment. Most other players, I think, have agreed with us to really go into that market and start to raise price, especially when you're a market leader in every major department store throughout Europe with the Tommy Hilfiger brand. It's very challenging in key core categories, classification businesses where we have major positions to start to raise prices too dramatically. So we're looking at other levers. But I think, unfortunately, the offsets that we'll be able to create, purely from a pricing point of view and a sourcing point of view, are probably -- we'll probably able to offset 20% of it. But that's what we're looking at right now. And then I think the improvement of the business as we go forward, as we go into fall, I think, there is a greater opportunity to potentially raise prices, if the market starts to accept it and as it starts to really take hold hopefully in the market. As we start to see some of this improving sales trends that we're seeing in our business, hopefully cascade throughout the entire retail industry."

And our 2 biggest -- our 3 biggest are Canada, Brazil and then Europe, and we've known what's happened with those currencies. So I think we are -- we're being whipsawed right now and there are some things we can offset and some things we're going to have to wait for the market to recalibrate as we go forward. And I think, as we look at '16, that's the position we're going to be in. And as we get into the -- as we report fourth quarter, obviously, we'll give guidance and give more clarity. But to be honest with you, it's very much a moving target. And just this morning -- I walked in this morning at 6:30 and the euro hit its all-time low for the year at $1.05. And then, just before we got on the call Mike came in and said it's trending at $1.09. So it's a tremendous amount of moving parts right now as moving forward."

We had a big earnings beat in the third quarter. And normally, if things were much more reasonable, we'd be anticipating -- we would have anticipated that we would have taken the year up. But at the same time that we had a strong August and September, October was weaker, and as we got into November, we saw weakness. So this unseasonably warm weather is putting a lot of pressure on it. Inventories are built, particularly in cold weather categories. And it's going to be an expensive fourth quarter to get through a lot of that. I think, competitively, we are in as good position as anyone. Our 2 fashion brands aren't overexposed from a pure cold-weather category. We've got an outerwear business, but it tends to be much more fashionable and more lightweight. So we don't have some of the exposure that some other brands might have in those areas, but we do have a big sweater business, big flannel business, big [indiscernible] business, big heavyweight outerwear business and -- to be honest, even some of the lighter weight categories, we're just not getting the traffic in the store that you would hope for, that usually cold weather drives people in. So it is the holiday season, Christmas will come, people will shop, the consumer is in relatively good shape. But the consumer is really getting some great bargains out there and the mall is definitely on sale, especially at specialty apparel. You're really seeing prices that are 50% to 70% off storewide. And this weekend, I think it's going to be pretty aggressive. You even see it online. So long-winded answer to, I expect margins to be under pressure in the U.S. and inventory levels to come down, but will come down over the fourth quarter into the first quarter as people move through it. And it's all been factored into our guidance, I believe."

Some of our -- the categories of our business, particularly underwear, when you think about it -- dress shirts is another one, given size and usually it's not a category you try on goods. Given that nature of that product, I think, it over-skews in some of those areas to an online distribution. And we're seeing tremendous growth in that area. So we're very cautious about it. We are very concerned about how the brand is presented. By working with some of these third-party players and not allowing them just to go out to buy goods in the gray market, that's out there, and have 10 items but they are screaming on the Internet that they have Calvin Klein at $9.99. By cleaning it up and selling to them in a disciplined fashion, you clean up a lot of that noise, a lot of counterfeit product that winds up, and it really helps the integrity or brand globally.

So what we're trying to do is help work with them to deal with some takedowns and some sales estimates right now and reallocate the goods to the off-price market, but do it in the most efficient fashion. The challenge that, that's going to face as we go into spring is that the off-price channel has just got about anything they'd want right now. There's more inventory in that channel than ever before. They're being very aggressive in the pricing point of view. So we're being very aggressive about using our own retail stores to clear the goods in the most efficient way possible and trying to really capture that business in especially warm weather, store locations as we go -- as we start to turn into January.

I think what it does highlight is that the wholesale model is built in a way that you don't necessarily feel all the pain as sell-through is happening. Now in the U.S. markets since you support gross margins and allowances, you feel it. But as retailers, when they miss their sales plan and then they adjust their sales plans going forward, you have to adjust accordingly. So we won't get caught with inventory. But it will put pressure on sales growth in the U.S. as we go forward. And it's a reason that we've always tried to be as balanced as possible with our distribution strategy. Our own stores, both outlet and regular price, not only in North America, but globally; selling online directly to consumers ourselves; and also using third-party Internet players to sell-through that makes sense. It's all about how that our brand is appropriately positioned. What's the holistic outlook for that, and trying to position ourselves that we are agnostic about where we sell the goods, whether it's through our own brick and mortar or through wholesale department stores or direct to the consumer on the Internet. Now the only thing that's challenged is in the last few years as we've had to scale up the Internet business, the -- that business has not been as profitable as it's been cannibalized, but over time, as we go into '16 and '17, that business should get to a profit level that equates pretty much with our wholesale and retail business just as that business scales up. So we feel we're on track. We've made the investments systemically. We've made the investments from a marketing point of view. And Calvin Klein, I would tell you that over 50% of our advertising today direct-to-consumer is digital, and Tommy is probably close to 40%. And both of those -- that exposure will continue, because that's where I think you really could connect with your consumer and do business. And we are really moving more and more towards that and engaging with the consumer on a digital basis. So I think the world is changing and we need -- and our brands need to move with it and our distribution channel needs to move with it as well."

As we got into the first and second quarter, we saw some impact, but I think the full impact that came through starting in the third quarter of this year, July and August of this year in particular. And I think that's for a couple of the reasons: One is people tend to book vacations 6 months out and they book them and there was, I think, there was a tendency not to cancel as much. And so that will start to factor in as we go forward. So I think quarter-by-quarter I think we'll be impacted in the first quarter and then to a degree in the second quarter, and then it should hopefully start to level out, as we go into the second half of next year.

This year, second half is the first time we saw that trend start to turn. I wouldn't, just to put things in perspective, I wouldn't classify the Italian market as healthy and vibrant, but I would say it's in the midst of beginnings of the turnaround, it's stabilized, and we're growing off of it in the high single-digit kind of range. So that feels good. Particularly in Calvin, we're really seeing stronger growth, because I think we -- one, our exposure in that market and the consumer's acceptance of the Calvin Klein brand in Italy and how well we've done historically there, I think we are starting to get paid back for some of the product advancements we've made, for some of the close down of the inefficient stores to better stores, direct-to-consumer; and even in the wholesale channel there, we've really gotten the business back on track. So I think we can continue to see outsized growth on the Calvin Klein business there. But I guess I would say is, we are encouraged by what we see in Europe overall. Spain, in particular, we -- it's been ahead of the Italian market. But if you go back, it went through a tough period of time with our largest wholesale account, El Corte Inglés, really struggling during a period of time. We've seen that business really stabilize and start to strengthen as we've gone forward. So our business in Spain continues to grow. And then with the Calvin product, the U.K, France, the Scandinavian market, Germany in particular, which is by far the biggest market in Europe, where Calvin had 3 years ago, a very limited presence, it will probably become our biggest market for the Calvin Klein brand in 2016.

So what I always like to say, there are some years that are sales years and there are some years that are margin years. And I think for retailers and probably for most apparel companies, next year has got to be a margin year, because the margins are depressed. You can see it in front of you, so you can really plan better for that and then they'll tend to chase goods into the fall season as those opportunities present themselves. So we'll also maybe try to be smart inventory and decide where it's appropriate to take some risk next year in the second half with some inventory, if we start to see some positive trends and some selling.

No one is really ever accused you being lazy about pursuing opportunity. So as you go back to Erinn's question about -- maybe it was Joan's, sorry -- the license roll-ups next year. Is it really like we have to sit here and wait until we have a willing seller on these licenses that we're focused on? Or is it time to say, look, maybe we should look a little bit more strategically, is there a brand that we could add to our portfolio? And is 2016 the right year for us to start thinking about that a little bit more broadly, given a somewhat muted outlook for the industry?"

And in last 5 to 6 years, we've done some major acquisitions. So my -- those are impossible -- the kind of acquisitions you're talking about adding a brand or something that's going to fundamentally change the company to a degree. It's impossible to anticipate that. That happens when it happens. I think I have tried to be clear to say is we are in a position right now where the Warnaco acquisition is fully integrated systemically. We are there. We're moving it forward. We seem to be really capturing a lot of the opportunities from the acquisition in underwear in particular, in jeans as we continue to make advancements in that category. So I think there's -- that's behind us and we can see that ahead of us, some of the growth that will come with that. So with all that said, paying off a $1 billion of debt in the last 3 years, the balance sheet is in a strong position. As opportunities present themselves where 2, 3 years ago, we just said we're not looking; today, we are looking. We are interested to see what the opportunities might be. And from a strategic point of view, based on what we own today, the best acquisitions that we could do are the ones I've talked about, which is the reacquisitions of the licenses. But at the same time, opportunities present themselves. We are -- we've been very good at being able to take advantage of those opportunities. Nobody anticipated that we would acquire Tommy Hilfiger when we did. It turned out to be a fantastic acquisition for our shareholders. And we'll look for those same type of opportunities as they present themselves. Planning for it from projecting out earnings and what -- you can't -- it's impossible to do. But be assured that this management team is not sitting back and waiting for something to happen. We're out there trying to make things happen."

So as we're looking at the overall projections and thinking about the business, we are fortunate in that we have some real core replenishment businesses, particularly our underwear business, our dress category business, even our sportswear businesses, the denim categories, we continue to get behind those businesses to make sure we execute and maximize those businesses. As we're working out, there's no reason for us, except to secure production, whatever, there's no reason for us to get ahead of the order cycle in any significant way. So to commit inventories or do anything, there's no reason for us to do that. So we are staying as nimble as possible to try to take advantage of every opportunity from a top line point of view and also, at the same time, to manage the risk against that, that presents itself by overexposing ourselves to commitments and production. The cold weather product, how that all works out next year, I think that will take care of itself and the lead times on that are such that we'll have plenty of times to react, not to get caught in any way with inventory and to take appropriate risks in order to capture potential opportunities as we go forward.

I know there have been 1 or 2 others that have been out there talking much more aggressively about it. And we just don't think it's logical. We think that even if it's accepted by the retailer, it's got a dramatically affect your sell-throughs. And you have to really look at your competitive set and what you're doing. You can look at it in isolation.

So overall, we were quite pleased with our results for the third quarter, which exceeded the top end of our guidance by $0.16, despite the volatile overall market environment. Our results continue to highlight the strength of our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger international businesses as well as improving trends in our Heritage businesses.
Let me give you a quick update by region, what we see going on in the third quarter and as we move into the fourth quarter. In the U.S., the U.S. market during the third quarter and currently into the fourth quarter continues to experience increased softness in traffic trends in large part driven by a decline in international tourist traffic and spending trends, coupled with unseasonably warm weather. Not surprising, giving all the news reports that the U.S. is our most challenged macro environment. We had a good Thanksgiving, Black Friday weekend. But overall, November was a soft month driven by highly promotional macro environment as a result of elevated inventory levels throughout the industry. For the fourth quarter, we expect these trends to continue and are anticipating a highly promotional holiday selling season.
Moving to Europe. Europe continues to be our strongest market. Both Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger posted double-digit comp store increases in the third quarter. As we moved into the fourth quarter, we continued to see strong comp store sales performance at both of our European businesses.
The trend of plus mid-single digit comp continues despite a brief slowdown due to the Paris attacks. We have seen improving trends in all major European markets, including Spain and Italy, which had been under pressure, and those markets seem to have significantly turned around. We expect these positive trends to continue throughout the fourth quarter.
In Asia, Asia continued to post healthy sales gains with Calvin and Tommy in the third quarter driven by our China business. These trends continue into the fourth quarter as China continues to demonstrate strong results. However, we anticipate continued weakness in Korea driven by more -- driven more by the broader market environment and softness in Hong Kong in large part due to the lack of Mainland Chinese tourists coming to the Island.
Brazil, Latin America continues to be difficult and volatile, but very profitable for us. We expect this business to continue to be under pressure and volatile. We believe we are gaining share from our peers, and the business continues to be highly profitable. However, growth levels are significantly lower than we would have anticipated at the beginning of the year, given the volatility that's going on, particularly in Brazil.
On a brand basis, moving to Calvin Klein. Overall, we continue to see great momentum with the brand and our business more broadly. Calvin Klein revenues increased 7% on a constant currency basis for the quarter. We have seen great progress across our businesses as we continue to expand our directly operated businesses across jeans, underwear, sportswear and accessories. In addition, our Calvin Klein royalties increased 10% in the quarter, further demonstrating the overall strength of the brand. We are seeing strong growth in women's apparel and accessories, women's and men's footwear and men's tailored clothing.
Globally, our underwear performance continues to be a great -- continues with great momentum, with the women's performance outperforming our strong men's business with a lot of opportunity ahead of us. Key initiatives in this business include faster replenishment; maximizing our high-end Black Label fashion product in all international markets; and most significantly, keeping up with the growth of our women's Modern Cotton logo business, which continues to grow dramatically in North America and Europe. To give you a sense of how we're doing with the brand in the United States on the men's side, on the men's underwear bottoms business, our market share has grown to over 30% in department stores, and that's up high single digits for the year.
On the top side of the business, we have historically been the #3 player in department stores. And in the third quarter, we moved into the #2 position for the first time in the brand's history. 
On the women's side of the business, the bra category overall is up low single digits, and the Calvin Klein business is up 15% year-to-date. And we are one of the top categories in all major department stores. Our panty -- the panty category overall in the U.S. market is flat, and the Calvin Klein business is up double digits for the year.
We have seen -- we have also seen strong performance in our Calvin Klein jeans business with the continued improvement in product, which has been evidenced across all our markets. We are increasingly focused on key initiatives to drive the business forward, including supply chain initiatives around our denim efforts across the company, significant number of capsule collections and faster overall replenishment.
Asia and Latin America continue to be our 2 strongest markets for jeans with continued mid-single digit sales growth and improving profitability. As it relates to our to 2 turnaround markets, the U.S. and Europe for jeans, we have seen an acceleration in our European jeans business, as our improved product execution and customer satisfaction is paying off. 
On like-for-like product, we are seeing outperformance against our -- against both genders. Our best performing markets include Spain, the U.K. and the Italian market for jeans.
Overall, for Calvin Klein Europe across all product categories, our spring/summer 2016 order book is up mid-teens, excluding the Russia business. We continue to see increasing acceptance and performance for the brand across all wholesale accounts in all major European markets.
As we look at our U.S. jeans turnaround, we saw solid performance in the first half of the year in this business. But as we moved into fall holiday season, as a result of the softness in the overall U.S. retail landscape, primarily driven by unseasonably warm weather, we have begun to see a softness in this business.
Overall, department store sales growth decelerated in the quarter to 2% to 4% increase by major account, with strong performance at some of our other retail partners, including Urban Outfitters and Amazon.
Moving on to Tommy Hilfiger. Overall, our Tommy Hilfiger sales increased 4% on a constant currency basis, driven by our Tommy Hilfiger International businesses. In 3Q, we saw strong performance with growth of about 7%, driven by a tremendous 10% increase in comp store sales, which further highlights the strength of the Tommy business across Europe. These strong comp store sales increases have continued into the fourth quarter of this year with comp trends up mid-single digits. Given these strong trends, we believe we are growing our market share in all major European markets.
We saw a great feedback from our marketing campaigns with all our major retail accounts. The Rafael Nadal fall marketing campaign, which focused on underwear and tailored clothing had positive results. The Nadal marketing campaign will continue with the spring/summer 2016. As a reminder, our European spring/summer 2016 wholesale order book is up about 4%, excluding Russia, driven by a 2% increase in retail selling prices and a 2% unit volume increase. The categories experiencing the most growth included underwear and our denim category for Europe.
In North America, the U.S. market in particular, was plagued by further deterioration of traffic and consumer spending trends in the company's U.S. stores. These stores are highly penetrated in international tourist locations and were affected by the unseasonably warm weather. Margins in the U.S. Tommy business were under pressure throughout the quarter as we were forced to be much more promotional in order to manage inventory levels.
As we have moved into the fourth quarter, we have seen these challenging sales and margin trends continue. We expect the holiday season to be highly promotional, especially on cold weather product, and we are planning the fourth quarter accordingly. It is critical that we move through inventory and end the year clean from an inventory perspective, so that spring 2016 is not burdened with carryover merchandise. That's what's driving our plans for the fourth quarter.
As we move to our Heritage business. Heritage had a good third quarter and is in the midst of a strong turnaround. Earnings for the group was up 18%, and this improvement should continue into the fourth quarter. We have seen strong performance in just about all of our divisions. 
Just some quick highlights. In the dress shirt division, the Van Heusen flex collar has been an extraordinary success for us. We're seeing much higher average unit retails out the door, and we believe that the consumer is reacting very favorably to our marketing campaign. This new technology will be introduced into our other major dress shirt brands, including Calvin Klein, Kenneth Cole and Tommy Hilfiger. 
We are also seeing strength in our Warner's intimate business in the mid-tier channel, especially at Kohl's, and we expect that trend to continue into the fourth quarter with strong selling through Black Friday holiday weekend. We are also in our wholesale sportswear business seeing improvement from the prior year, led by the IZOD division with strong performances throughout its account chain.
Our direct-to-consumer retail business also saw operating profit improvement in the quarter, with Van Heusen posting 11% comp store increase for the third quarter. And those positive trends have continued into the fourth quarter with mid-single digit increases for the Heritage division.
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Mike to quantify some of these results."

The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release.

The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. 
On a constant currency basis, revenues for the third quarter were up 3% versus the prior year and in line with our guidance. Driving our revenue increase was our Calvin Klein business, which delivered a 7% constant currency increase over the prior year. Both our North America and our international business had revenue growth of 7% in constant currency, driven by strong wholesale shipments.
Our Calvin Klein strategies are taking hold, and we are seeing improved performance in underwear globally as well as strong performance in our international business, particularly in Europe and China. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 4% in constant currency, also in line with our guidance, with strong revenues in our international businesses, which had revenues up 6% from constant currency and Europe comps up 10% with all major markets showing increases.
Our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein United States retail stores located in international tourist destinations continued to be under significant pressure from a lack of traffic and spending, but these declines were more than offset by the performance in other areas. 
In addition, our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein U.S. retail stores located in centers that are not heavily penetrated by international tourists performed well and had positive comps for the third quarter.
Our Heritage business revenues were down 5%, due to the continued rationalization of our Heritage business, which included exiting the IZOD retail business as well as several licensed dress shirt product lines in our dress shirt business. 
Earnings per share for the second quarter was $2.66 and included a $0.44 negative impact related to foreign currency and continued weakness in our Russia business. Excluding this negative impact, EPS would have increased 21% over the prior year.
Our quarter 3 EPS was $0.16 ahead of the top end of our guidance. The $0.16 beat was comprised of $0.10 related to the business outperformance, which was predominantly in Calvin Klein; an interest expense benefit of $0.02; and a tax benefit of $0.08. And that was partially offset by $0.04 of FX headwinds.
For the full year 2015, our earnings per share guidance remains unchanged at $6.90 to $7. This includes an additional $0.05 hit for foreign currency versus our previous guidance. If we exclude the negative impact related to foreign currency and weakness in the Russia business of $1.35, our earnings per share growth is projected to be 13% to 14% over the prior year.
Revenue is now projected to be up 3% for the year, excluding the foreign currency impact of 6%. Our new revenue guidance reflects a decrease of 1% for the prior year versus our previous guidance on a constant currency basis.
Overall operating margins are expected to be flat to the prior year, excluding a negative impact of about 80 basis points due to foreign currency. Our Calvin Klein business is projecting revenues to grow 8% on a constant currency basis and operating margins to increase 80 to 90 basis points, excluding a negative impact of approximately 40 basis points of FX.
Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 3% on a constant currency basis, with operating margins planned down 120 to 130 basis points, excluding the negative impact of approximately 100 basis points of FX. Tommy Hilfiger International margins are planned up with North America operating margins planned down after FX. This decline in North America is due to pressure on U.S. stores located in international tourist locations. 
Our Heritage business is planned to have a revenue decrease of 3%, due mostly to the exit of our IZOD retail business in 2015. Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to increase about 120 to 130 basis points. The impact of currency on our Heritage business is relatively immaterial.
Interest for the year is planned to be $115 million compared to the prior year amount of $139 million, due to our lower average debt balances. Also favorably impacting interest for 2015 is the debt refinancing we did in last year's first quarter as well as lower revolver borrowings. We currently expect to generate approximately $450 of free cash flow in 2015, which will be used to pay down debt of about $350 million and allow for continued stock repurchases. Our tax rate for the year is planned at about 20%.
Our revenue for the fourth quarter is planned up 5% on a constant currency basis. By business, we are estimating third quarter revenues on a constant currency basis to increase 15% for Calvin Klein, driven in part by the Chinese New Year, increase 1% for Tommy Hilfiger and decrease 4% for our Heritage brands. Heritage brand revenues are negatively impacting by the closing of the IZOD retail division.
Fourth quarter earnings per share is planned at $1.37 to $1.47 and includes approximately $0.33 of estimated negative impact from foreign currency and the decline in our Russia business. If we exclude this negative impact, EPS is projected to be in the range of a 3% decrease to a 2% increase over the prior year.
Interest expense is projected to be $30 million and taxes to be about 20.5% in the fourth quarter.
Finally, as we look forward to 2016, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar will negatively impact our 2016 earnings versus 2015 earnings by between $1.50 and $1.60 per share based on current exchange rates. Approximately 80% of the 2016 projected negative foreign currency impact is expected to be on transaction basis, while 20% of the negative impact is expected to be on the translation basis. Our exposure at a transactional level is mostly due to the purchasing of inventory in U.S. dollars by our international divisions.
And with that, I'll open it up to questions."

I think Heritage will start to be -- will not be a headwind any longer. I think we'll get back to our historical rate of growth that's in the low single-digit range, moving our profitability closer to 10%. And I think that from an earnings point of view, for at least the next 12 to 15 months, we'd anticipate that the Heritage business will be a contributor to our earnings growth. On -- from a Tommy point of view, I think for the next -- in the short term, I think that business will be under more pressure. It's -- I think the pressure will come, as you rightly said, much more from the U.S. business, which is feeling even more dramatically the strengthening dollar and the impact it has on tourism in the United States. Our Tommy business, it has benefited in the past from growing that tourist trade and really has benefited from both South American and Latin American travel as well as European travel. And both of those currencies are anywhere from 20% to 25% weaker and in the case of Brazil, closer to 40% to 45% weaker. And that has discouraged travel into the United States. So I think that clearly will continue into the first quarter -- fourth quarter of this year and probably into the first and second quarter of next year, as we go forward, as we cycle the strengthening dollars as we move forward. Long term, I don't think it's really changed what we see with the Tommy business. We think that business should continue to grow in the mid- to high single digits. I think that growth will be driven more substantially from outside the United States, particularly Asia, South America and Latin America, where we hope to be adding new businesses to our portfolio that today are either joint ventures or license businesses today. On the Calvin business, we see nothing but momentum in the business, both on the underwear side, which is clearly really outperforming all of our expectations. And on the jeans, outside of the United States, that business continues to outperform for us as well. And there, I think, our goal would be on a local currency basis to continue to grow that business in the high single-digit range. So that's where we are, David."

But I think it's with us and clearly, it's going to be with us for all of '16 since we're hedged out 12 to 18 months is where we go -- as we try to position ourselves as we go forward. So the difficulty we are facing is, given the European market, given the significant lack of any sign of inflation in that European market, so far, we've been challenged to really raise prices dramatically. I think, as I mentioned in my comments, we raised retail selling prices into the market about 2% in spring. We've continued to grow units. We think it's challenging in this environment. Most other players, I think, have agreed with us to really go into that market and start to raise price, especially when you're a market leader in every major department store throughout Europe with the Tommy Hilfiger brand. It's very challenging in key core categories, classification businesses where we have major positions to start to raise prices too dramatically. So we're looking at other levers. But I think, unfortunately, the offsets that we'll be able to create, purely from a pricing point of view and a sourcing point of view, are probably -- we'll probably able to offset 20% of it. But that's what we're looking at right now. And then I think the improvement of the business as we go forward, as we go into fall, I think, there is a greater opportunity to potentially raise prices, if the market starts to accept it and as it starts to really take hold hopefully in the market. As we start to see some of this improving sales trends that we're seeing in our business, hopefully cascade throughout the entire retail industry."

And our 2 biggest -- our 3 biggest are Canada, Brazil and then Europe, and we've known what's happened with those currencies.

We had a big earnings beat in the third quarter. And normally, if things were much more reasonable, we'd be anticipating -- we would have anticipated that we would have taken the year up. But at the same time that we had a strong August and September, October was weaker, and as we got into November, we saw weakness. So this unseasonably warm weather is putting a lot of pressure on it. Inventories are built, particularly in cold weather categories. And it's going to be an expensive fourth quarter to get through a lot of that. I think, competitively, we are in as good position as anyone. Our 2 fashion brands aren't overexposed from a pure cold-weather category. We've got an outerwear business, but it tends to be much more fashionable and more lightweight. So we don't have some of the exposure that some other brands might have in those areas, but we do have a big sweater business, big flannel business, big [indiscernible] business, big heavyweight outerwear business and -- to be honest, even some of the lighter weight categories, we're just not getting the traffic in the store that you would hope for, that usually cold weather drives people in. So it is the holiday season, Christmas will come, people will shop, the consumer is in relatively good shape. But the consumer is really getting some great bargains out there and the mall is definitely on sale, especially at specialty apparel. You're really seeing prices that are 50% to 70% off storewide. And this weekend, I think it's going to be pretty aggressive. You even see it online. So long-winded answer to, I expect margins to be under pressure in the U.S. and inventory levels to come down, but will come down over the fourth quarter into the first quarter as people move through it. And it's all been factored into our guidance, I believe."

Some of our -- the categories of our business, particularly underwear, when you think about it -- dress shirts is another one, given size and usually it's not a category you try on goods. Given that nature of that product, I think, it over-skews in some of those areas to an online distribution. And we're seeing tremendous growth in that area. So we're very cautious about it. We are very concerned about how the brand is presented. By working with some of these third-party players and not allowing them just to go out to buy goods in the gray market, that's out there, and have 10 items but they are screaming on the Internet that they have Calvin Klein at $9.99. By cleaning it up and selling to them in a disciplined fashion, you clean up a lot of that noise, a lot of counterfeit product that winds up, and it really helps the integrity or brand globally.

The concern we have right now and I think Ken's really been focused on is, given the softer selling, retailers are now looking at turns as they get into the spring season, they're trying to be much more cautious -- look, they're coming out of the season with higher inventory positions and they're trying to reposition it. So what we're trying to do is help work with them to deal with some takedowns and some sales estimates right now and reallocate the goods to the off-price market, but do it in the most efficient fashion. The challenge that, that's going to face as we go into spring is that the off-price channel has just got about anything they'd want right now. There's more inventory in that channel than ever before. They're being very aggressive in the pricing point of view. So we're being very aggressive about using our own retail stores to clear the goods in the most efficient way possible and trying to really capture that business in especially warm weather, store locations as we go -- as we start to turn into January.

I think what it does highlight is that the wholesale model is built in a way that you don't necessarily feel all the pain as sell-through is happening. Now in the U.S. markets since you support gross margins and allowances, you feel it. But as retailers, when they miss their sales plan and then they adjust their sales plans going forward, you have to adjust accordingly. So we won't get caught with inventory. But it will put pressure on sales growth in the U.S. as we go forward. And it's a reason that we've always tried to be as balanced as possible with our distribution strategy. Our own stores, both outlet and regular price, not only in North America, but globally; selling online directly to consumers ourselves; and also using third-party Internet players to sell-through that makes sense. It's all about how that our brand is appropriately positioned. What's the holistic outlook for that, and trying to position ourselves that we are agnostic about where we sell the goods, whether it's through our own brick and mortar or through wholesale department stores or direct to the consumer on the Internet. Now the only thing that's challenged is in the last few years as we've had to scale up the Internet business, the -- that business has not been as profitable as it's been cannibalized, but over time, as we go into '16 and '17, that business should get to a profit level that equates pretty much with our wholesale and retail business just as that business scales up. So we feel we're on track. We've made the investments systemically. We've made the investments from a marketing point of view. And Calvin Klein, I would tell you that over 50% of our advertising today direct-to-consumer is digital, and Tommy is probably close to 40%. And both of those -- that exposure will continue, because that's where I think you really could connect with your consumer and do business. And we are really moving more and more towards that and engaging with the consumer on a digital basis. So I think the world is changing and we need -- and our brands need to move with it and our distribution channel needs to move with it as well."

As we got into the first and second quarter, we saw some impact, but I think the full impact that came through starting in the third quarter of this year, July and August of this year in particular. And I think that's for a couple of the reasons: One is people tend to book vacations 6 months out and they book them and there was, I think, there was a tendency not to cancel as much. And so that will start to factor in as we go forward.

This year, second half is the first time we saw that trend start to turn. I wouldn't, just to put things in perspective, I wouldn't classify the Italian market as healthy and vibrant, but I would say it's in the midst of beginnings of the turnaround, it's stabilized, and we're growing off of it in the high single-digit kind of range. So that feels good. Particularly in Calvin, we're really seeing stronger growth, because I think we -- one, our exposure in that market and the consumer's acceptance of the Calvin Klein brand in Italy and how well we've done historically there, I think we are starting to get paid back for some of the product advancements we've made, for some of the close down of the inefficient stores to better stores, direct-to-consumer; and even in the wholesale channel there, we've really gotten the business back on track. So I think we can continue to see outsized growth on the Calvin Klein business there. But I guess I would say is, we are encouraged by what we see in Europe overall. Spain, in particular, we -- it's been ahead of the Italian market. But if you go back, it went through a tough period of time with our largest wholesale account, El Corte Inglés, really struggling during a period of time. We've seen that business really stabilize and start to strengthen as we've gone forward. So our business in Spain continues to grow. And then with the Calvin product, the U.K, France, the Scandinavian market, Germany in particular, which is by far the biggest market in Europe, where Calvin had 3 years ago, a very limited presence, it will probably become our biggest market for the Calvin Klein brand in 2016.

Unfortunately, we're being hurt with currencies, but we're well ahead of schedule on the turnaround in Europe with the Calvin Klein business on a -- if you look at the fundamentals of the business and where we're positioned."

It sounds like you're getting that low single-digit price increase that you talked about, I haven't seen which currencies have moved much since we talked to you guys on the second quarter. So I'm just trying to reconcile the gap and what you seem to be leading us to for the FX outlook next year?"

And that's by far our biggest currency exposure from a market point of view. It's actually been the biggest -- that's probably been biggest change from the second quarter as we've gone forward. The other changes, I guess, we were -- again, in the early stages of it and where we are now, we were thinking more -- we were thinking there might have been more opportunity to potentially raise prices higher than the 2%. Right now, for the spring season, that's where we are. We hope that can improve as we go into the third quarter. So the $1.20 number, or the $1.25 number, that we talked about last time really increased to the $1.50 to $1.60 number totally based on what's really gone on with the euro and, to a limited degree, what's gone on with the Canadian dollar. So that's the fundamental change. And then, that -- as we've now, we are probably 85% locked in to 90% locked in with hedges for 2016. This is where it's kind of -- looks like it's actually falling out. So that's been the change from our second quarter call."

Manny, in your conversations with retailers in the U.S, and obviously, I think you say your -- the current trend seems to be a little bit isolated to weather. You're working with them to help clear inventories, but then as we look ahead to next year, I mean, is there a general sense in the industry that we're going to order more cautiously even though we do know it was at least in large part impacted by weather. I mean, do the retailors want to plan more cautiously with their orders for next year, even though we think it's weather? Or are they just saying, let's focus on margin next year, maybe order a little bit lower just in case, even though the weather -- we're not really forecasting it to be as a big of a drag for next year at this time."

Actually, Michael, I guess, it's a fair point and it's clearly a fair point from a financial guy. But that's just not the way retailers work.

Actually, Michael, I guess, it's a fair point and it's clearly a fair point from a financial guy. But that's just not the way retailers work. Retailers work off of, this is what was last year and they may say, ""Look, we think there's opportunity, so we are going to plan our comps instead of up 1.5%, we're going to plan it up 2.5%."" But it's not like that they won't go back and say, 2 years ago, we did x dollars and we're going to do that much and we're going to drive it. So they tend to do what's safe. And what's safe is they are getting -- besides getting hurt on top line, they're really getting hurt on the margin line. So what I always like to say, there are some years that are sales years and there are some years that are margin years. And I think for retailers and probably for most apparel companies, next year has got to be a margin year, because the margins are depressed. You can see it in front of you, so you can really plan better for that and then they'll tend to chase goods into the fall season as those opportunities present themselves. So we'll also maybe try to be smart inventory and decide where it's appropriate to take some risk next year in the second half with some inventory, if we start to see some positive trends and some selling. But I mean, that's the reality of it. I think you hit it on the head when you said they're really going to try to manage the turns and manage margins and manage their markdowns for '16."

Is it really like we have to sit here and wait until we have a willing seller on these licenses that we're focused on? Or is it time to say, look, maybe we should look a little bit more strategically, is there a brand that we could add to our portfolio? And is 2016 the right year for us to start thinking about that a little bit more broadly, given a somewhat muted outlook for the industry?"

And in last 5 to 6 years, we've done some major acquisitions. So my -- those are impossible -- the kind of acquisitions you're talking about adding a brand or something that's going to fundamentally change the company to a degree. It's impossible to anticipate that. That happens when it happens. I think I have tried to be clear to say is we are in a position right now where the Warnaco acquisition is fully integrated systemically. We are there. We're moving it forward. We seem to be really capturing a lot of the opportunities from the acquisition in underwear in particular, in jeans as we continue to make advancements in that category. So I think there's -- that's behind us and we can see that ahead of us, some of the growth that will come with that. So with all that said, paying off a $1 billion of debt in the last 3 years, the balance sheet is in a strong position. As opportunities present themselves where 2, 3 years ago, we just said we're not looking; today, we are looking. We are interested to see what the opportunities might be. And from a strategic point of view, based on what we own today, the best acquisitions that we could do are the ones I've talked about, which is the reacquisitions of the licenses. But at the same time, opportunities present themselves. We are -- we've been very good at being able to take advantage of those opportunities. Nobody anticipated that we would acquire Tommy Hilfiger when we did. It turned out to be a fantastic acquisition for our shareholders. And we'll look for those same type of opportunities as they present themselves. Planning for it from projecting out earnings and what -- you can't -- it's impossible to do. But be assured that this management team is not sitting back and waiting for something to happen. We're out there trying to make things happen."

So as we're looking at the overall projections and thinking about the business, we are fortunate in that we have some real core replenishment businesses, particularly our underwear business, our dress category business, even our sportswear businesses, the denim categories, we continue to get behind those businesses to make sure we execute and maximize those businesses. As we're working out, there's no reason for us, except to secure production, whatever, there's no reason for us to get ahead of the order cycle in any significant way. So to commit inventories or do anything, there's no reason for us to do that. So we are staying as nimble as possible to try to take advantage of every opportunity from a top line point of view and also, at the same time, to manage the risk against that, that presents itself by overexposing ourselves to commitments and production. The cold weather product, how that all works out next year, I think that will take care of itself and the lead times on that are such that we'll have plenty of times to react, not to get caught in any way with inventory and to take appropriate risks in order to capture potential opportunities as we go forward.

That's what we are in the process of really trying to figure out. I would say, the high point is mid-single digit increase to a low single digit increase, and we're talking somewhere between 2% and 5%, I think, for fall. I think that's reasonable. I know there have been 1 or 2 others that have been out there talking much more aggressively about it. And we just don't think it's logical. We think that even if it's accepted by the retailer, it's got a dramatically affect your sell-throughs. And you have to really look at your competitive set and what you're doing. You can look at it in isolation. So we're really trying to manage that and think it through very thoughtfully about managing gross margin percentage versus gross margin dollars to see what will give us the optimal answer. And as we're trying to protect with the Tommy business, a very large market position, we're not giving up market share. They're competitive sets, so they can come and underbid us for potential categories. So that's the balancing act that's going on right now.
