We made good progress on our transformation agenda, especially in our supply chain and in overheads. Of course, we also announced our coffee joint venture, which we expect to close later this year. As we enter 2015, we'll continue to focus on what we can control: reducing costs, pricing to protect profitability and driving power brands and innovation platforms in key markets.
In addition, we're taking some specific actions to exit lower-margin revenues to improve our mix. Overall, I'm quite confident in our ability to execute our plans, achieve our strategic objectives and continue to deliver solid returns to our shareholders.
Turning to the specifics for 2014. We generated strong earnings growth and margin expansion in a challenging environment by driving record net productivity and aggressively reducing overheads. On the top line, we delivered organic net revenue consistent with our latest outlook as we raised prices to recover higher input costs and protect profitability while continuing to invest in our growth platforms. 
Specifically, for the full year, organic net revenue was up 2.4%. Adjusted operating income margin increased 80 basis points to 12.9%. That was in line with our guidance of about 13% despite absorbing a 50 basis point headwind from the timing of mark-to-market accounting. Adjusted EPS was $1.76 for the year, up 23% on a constant currency basis. And the source of this growth was high quality, driven mostly by operating gains.
In light of a still challenging macroeconomic environment, consumer confidence and spending weakened in many of our key markets while competition among food retailers was intense, especially in Europe. We faced significantly higher prices for key commodities like cocoa and coffee. And this inflation was magnified by local currency devaluation, especially late in the year. 
In response, we quickly priced across our portfolio to offset the input cost inflation and to protect profitability. As a result, pricing was the key driver of our revenue, contributing 4.5 percentage points for the year.
Looking more closely at the sources of growth last year. Emerging markets were up 7%, with Brazil, Russia and India all increasing double digits. Developed markets were down modestly. This reflected the temporary effects of pricing-related customer disputes in Europe that we talked about last quarter as well as increased trade investments in North America. Let's take a more detailed look at full year top line results in each of our regions.
Latin America grew 15%, driven by pricing gains, especially in the inflationary economies of Venezuela and Argentina. Brazil was up double digits, including solid growth in all of our categories. EMEA grew 6.5%, driven by higher pricing and modest growth in vol/mix. Russia increased double digits. Vol/mix continue to improve, contributing more than 1/3 of our growth there. I'm very pleased with the performance of our team in Russia, who have consistently delivered strong results over the past couple of years. However, given the recent currency devaluation and deteriorating macroeconomic situation, we expect growth and profitability in Russia to be somewhat more challenging in 2015.
I'd also like to acknowledge our team in Ukraine, who delivered organic revenue that was essentially flat despite operating in a most difficult environment. Continuing with our region performance, Asia Pacific declined 2.8% as higher pricing was more than offset by lower vol/mix. China was down mid-single digits for the full year due to the continued softness in Biscuits, but we're now beginning to see some signs of recovery.
India delivered another year of double-digit growth, but industry-wide price increases in chocolate tempered category growth in the fourth quarter. In the near term, we expect this trend to continue until consumers adapt to the new pricing levels.
North America was up nearly 1% for the year, reflecting slower growth in Biscuits as the category softened as well as increased competition in the fourth quarter, especially in Crackers. We stepped up our brand and trade investments accordingly, and we're pleased to see signs of category recovery in the recent biscuit data. We expect growth to accelerate in early 2015.
In Europe, organic revenue was down 1% for the year. While pricing was up nearly 1.5 points, vol/mix fell as a result of a number of factors, including lower category growth as consumer demand softened in the weaker macro environment, pricing-related elasticity and pricing-related customer disruptions especially in France. 
Finally, in Europe, after more than 1 year of headwinds, coffee turned into a tailwind in the fourth quarter, contributing over 2 points of growth as we priced to offset higher green costs.
Turning now to our categories. For the full year, snacks grew [indiscernible] under 4% and our global categories grew about 3.5%. Importantly, growth rates softened somewhat in the back half, and we anticipate this trend will continue in 2015.
Biscuits remained the strongest of our snacks categories, up about 5% worldwide. And while the reset of our China business held our revenue growth below that of the total category, we made good progress on our Biscuits portfolio. 
OREO led the way. Globally, it grew high single digits and exceeded $2.5 billion [ph] in sales, driven by new product innovations such as OREO in China as well as new package formats such as family size in the U.S. After its first full year in Brazil, OREO has already achieved more than a 2.5% [ph] share, while in Europe, it continued to grow at a double-digit rate, up more than 25%. Like OREO, our belVita Breakfast Biscuits platform also grew strongly, up nearly 30%, topping $650 million in global revenues.
Innovation here also played a key role. Our new Soft Baked line drove over 50% growth for belVita in the U.S. while belVita Crunchy, which we launched last spring in several European markets, is off to a good start.
In Chocolate, the impact of higher prices to offset rising cocoa and dairy costs and the effect of weakening emerging market currencies, tempered global category growth to below 4%. As we've discussed in prior earnings calls, our decision to increase prices globally resulted in soft volume and share performance as some competitors either lagged predominantly in emerging markets or did not price at all as was the case in parts of Europe. We believe that all of our competitors will eventually raise prices, given that they're facing the same input cost pressures we are. Ultimately, as the price dislocation moderates, innovation is key to regaining momentum in the Chocolate category, and we've built solid platforms to accomplish that.
For example, we continue to expand Marvelous Creations. Our Chunky Chocolate filled with fun things like candy pieces and jellybeans, and we've expanded that into new markets like Canada and Russia, driving incremental growth. We also recently launched Cadbury Glow, a new premium gifting chocolate brand in India, Singapore and Hong Kong. Initial results have been strong, already reaching 13% of the Indian chocolate gifting segment last quarter.
Finally, the Gum & Candy category grew about 2% for the year. Our revenue was down about 3% due to the implementation of a sugar tax in Mexico where we have an 80 [ph] share, government restrictions on gum imports in Venezuela and the customer disputes in France. However, we grew or held share in 4 of our top 6 gum markets, including the U.S., Japan, Brazil and China, driven by improved price/pack architecture and a focus on freshness. China is now the second-largest gum market in the world, and our growth continue to be robust, up nearly 50% last year, benefiting from the launch of bottles and strive layers.
So as you can see, we're taking the necessary steps to ensure the long-term health of our business. We're pricing to protect profitability and aggressively reducing costs so that we can continue to invest in our franchises to drive sustainable top-tier returns for our shareholders. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brian."

Good morning, everyone. Over the next few slides starting with Slide 7, I'll walk you through our 2014 margin and EPS progress as well as our outlook for 2015. Adjusted gross margin decreased 60 basis points to 36.8%, with 50 points of th",1636,"Thanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Over the next few slides starting with Slide 7, I'll walk you through our 2014 margin and EPS progress as well as our outlook for 2015. 
Adjusted gross margin decreased 60 basis points to 36.8%, with 50 points of the decline attributable to the timing of the mark-to-market accounting for commodity and currency hedges. Over the course of the year, we successfully executed pricing of $1.6 billion. While this high level of pricing was enough to fully offset significant commodity and currency-related cost inflation on a dollar basis, it wasn't enough to offset the impact of inflation on our margin percentage. 
We were able to essentially maintain gross margins, excluding the mark-to-market impact, by delivering 2.8% net productivity, totaling more than $600 million. That's a record for the company and a testament to the strong work delivered by our Integrated Supply Chain team.
As Irene noted, our adjusted OI margin increased 80 basis points to 12.9%, in line with our guidance of approximately 13%. Excluding the 50 basis point mark-to-market impact, our underlying margin improvement was actually 130 basis points. Lower overheads drove more than half of this improvement as we aggressively reduced expenses by leveraging zero-based budgeting and other cost saving tools. 
In addition, we expanded margins by driving efficiencies in the nonworking elements of our media spend, including significantly consolidating suppliers. We also reduced production costs as we shifted more advertising to digital outlets.
To be clear, we maintained our working media support and increased our overall A&C spending on our power brands and innovation platforms. As we move to 2015, securing additional cost reductions will be a key focus and an important backstop to our plan.
Looking at performance by region, you'll see that developed markets drove much of the margin expansion. In North America, adjusted OI margin increased 140 basis points despite absorbing the startup costs of our newest greenfield biscuit plant in Salinas, Mexico. We'll begin to realize the margin benefits from that plant as we ramp up production later in the year.
In Europe, adjusted OI margin expanded 170 basis points as our overhead reduction and supply chain reinvention programs continues to pay dividends. Also worth mentioning is the impact of Latin America where margins grew 200 basis points. Our cost programs drove about half of this margin improvement while the other half related to onetime items.
Turning to earnings per share on Slide 10. Operating gains were the primary driver of our EPS growth. Adjusted EPS for the full year was $1.76, up 23% on a constant currency basis. Operating gains, excluding mark-to-market, accounted for $0.26 of this improvement. Our debt refinancing delivered $0.08 of EPS growth, and our lower share count contributed another $0.08. Even after accounting for the $0.14 negative impact of currency translation, adjusted EPS was up more than 14% for the year.
Cash flow has been another area of strong performance. Over the past 2 years, we delivered $4.8 billion of free cash flow excluding items. That's nearly 30% higher than our 2-year guidance of $3.7 billion. Strong improvement in working capital has been the primary driver. We've shortened our cash conversion cycle by 10 days, which comes on top of a 13-day improvement in the prior year. 
With our strong cash performance, we were able to return $2.9 billion in cash to shareholders last year. We repurchased $1.9 billion of shares, which is at the upper end of our $1 billion to $2 billion annual target. We also raised our dividend by 7% for a total payout of $1 billion.
Turning to Slide 12. I'm not going to cover this slide in detail, but it's safe to say that the external operating environment continues to be challenging and volatile, whether it's slow GDP growth, weak consumer demand or a difficult retailer environment. And given our strong global footprint, an uncontrollable variable like the strengthening of the U.S. dollar is especially challenging. Of course, there are a number of positive factors that will partially offset these headwinds both in 2015 and over the long term, including the continuing trend towards increased snacking and on-the-go consumer dynamics.
Within this challenging environment, we're focusing on what we can control and executing our transformation agenda. With respect to our portfolio, as Irene mentioned, we continue to expect the coffee deal to close this year. On a much smaller scale, we anticipate closing and integrating our recent acquisition of the Snacks business in Vietnam later this year. 
We're also working to improve our revenue mix by moving away from some low margin revenue. Specifically, we've made deliberate decisions to exit nonstrategic and margin-dilutive revenue, which will temper our organic revenue growth by about 100 basis points this year. 
Examples of these decisions include exiting certain customers in Europe who've chosen not to accept our price increases, discontinuing certain low-margin products that were sold under short-term trademark licenses from Kraft Foods Group and pruning some SKUs so we can simplify our supply chain and focus our investments on our growth platforms.
2015 is also a year of continued intense focus on cost in both our supply chain and overheads as we progress towards our margin expansion goals. We'll also continue to invest in our power brands and routes to market for future growth. We're excited by the longer-term prospects of accelerated growth, faster decision-making and cost savings as we shift to a category-led model in all of our regions.
So let's talk about how all this translates to our outlook for 2015. We expect organic revenue to grow at least 2%. As mentioned earlier, we see overall category growth rates remaining consistent with or even somewhat below 2014. That is, we anticipate our global categories will grow at least 3% in aggregate. In 2015, we expect to continue to prioritize margin improvements, which will impact our net revenue growth and market share.
Now although it's not part of organic growth, I'd like to provide some perspective on the potential impact of foreign currency translation on our revenue. Based on January 30 spot rates, we estimate currency would be about 11% -- 11 percentage point headwind to our revenue growth. Obviously, that's a big number, but remember that 80% of our revenue is based in markets where the currencies are not tied to the strengthening U.S. dollar. So while we anticipate our reported revenue will decline due to the significant currency translation impact, we expect to deliver solid organic growth in a challenging macro economic environment. 
Let me now turn to our margin outlook. In 2015, we expect to deliver adjusted OI margin of approximately 14%, another significant step towards our margin goal of 15% to 16% in 2016. The continued execution of both our supply chain reinvention and overhead reduction initiatives will be key drivers of the margin expansion. We expect the savings from these programs to build throughout the year.
Moving on to EPS. We expect adjusted EPS to grow double digits on a constant currency basis, which would be our third year in a row of double-digit EPS growth. Organic revenue growth and OI margin expansion will be the main drivers. In addition, we expect our adjusted interest expense to be about $825 million, given our current weighted average interest rate of about 4.5% plus other financing costs.
We expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the high teens for 2015, slightly higher than the 16% we saw in 2014. And finally, we expect to repurchase between $1 billion and $2 billion of shares.
Let me point out again that our EPS guidance is on a constant currency basis, but since currency will be such a big headwind in our GAAP reported results at the end of the year, I'd like to provide a bit of detail on that now. 
As I mentioned previously, 80% of our revenue is derived from currencies not tied to the U.S. dollar. This exposure to growth markets is typically a strength of our business model, and I believe it will be over the long term. However, most of these currencies have been devaluing versus the dollar over the last few months, resulting in a significant currency translation headwind. 
On Slide 17, you can see the potential impact. We estimate adjusted EPS would be approximately $0.30 lower than our constant currency results based on January 30 spot rates. While we do business in many currencies, the lion's share of the headwind comes from the euro, the British pound, the Russian ruble and the Brazilian real. 
So to summarize our 2015 outlook, we expect organic net revenue to be at least 2%, including a 1 point headwind from our strategic decisions to exit low-margin revenue. We anticipate adjusted OI margin of approximately 14% and double-digit growth in adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis. 
Please note that since we don't have a precise closing date for the coffee deal, our 2015 outlook includes the full year results for the coffee business. We'll update our 2015 outlook for the impact of the coffee divestiture as we get more clarity on the closing date.
So to wrap up, in 2014, we delivered strong earnings growth and margin expansion despite the challenging consumer and retail environment. While we expect the environment to remain difficult in 2015, we'll continue to prioritize margin improvements while delivering modest revenue growth, focus on executing the cost reduction initiatives under our control and make the necessary foundational investments in our brands, innovation platforms, routes to market and supply chain to stage the portfolio for the future. We remain confident in our ability to execute our transformation agenda so that we're well positioned to deliver sustainable profitable growth and generate top-tier shareholder returns now and over the long term.
With that, let's open it up for questions."

I should -- I expect that, that will improve as the year progresses in both Europe. And in North America, as I mentioned, we certainly are experiencing some category slowdown.

We're supporting our power brands in particular with the necessary spending to help to mitigate the impact.

There's no question that our long-term algorithm assumes a balance of volume/mix and pricing. And in the short term, there's no question that we are leaning disproportionately on pricing, given the enormous increases that we are seeing in both our commodity increases as well as in the impact of the currency devaluation. So it's been -- it was about 4.5 points of our 2 point, 4 points of revenue growth, so it was a significant impact, which says that vol/mix was a negative, and there's no question, as I talked about in a couple of times on the call, that in the short term, the $1.6 billion of pricing that we took has had an impact in the marketplace. We are monitoring that very carefully. We are thoughtful about which markets and which categories we are monitoring and protecting. And the end in mind is to get ourselves back onto a trajectory over the long term where we grow at or above the rates of our category growth. But in the near term, the single biggest opportunity for us to ensure that we have adequate money to invest in our franchises is to make sure that we're pricing to protect our margins in the face of escalating costs. So there's nothing about the numbers that's inconsistent with the approach that we're taking. Over the long term, we would expect to see our businesses growing at or above the rates of our categories. But in the near term, while costs are as volatile as they are, we want to make sure that we are protecting our profitability and that has a short-term dislocation impact."

We made good progress on our transformation agenda, especially in our supply chain and in overheads. Of course, we also announced our coffee joint venture, which we expect to close later this year. As we enter 2015, we'll continue to focus on what we can control: reducing costs, pricing to protect profitability and driving power brands and innovation platforms in key markets.
In addition, we're taking some specific actions to exit lower-margin revenues to improve our mix. Overall, I'm quite confident in our ability to execute our plans, achieve our strategic objectives and continue to deliver solid returns to our shareholders.
Turning to the specifics for 2014. We generated strong earnings growth and margin expansion in a challenging environment by driving record net productivity and aggressively reducing overheads. On the top line, we delivered organic net revenue consistent with our latest outlook as we raised prices to recover higher input costs and protect profitability while continuing to invest in our growth platforms. 
Specifically, for the full year, organic net revenue was up 2.4%. Adjusted operating income margin increased 80 basis points to 12.9%. That was in line with our guidance of about 13% despite absorbing a 50 basis point headwind from the timing of mark-to-market accounting. Adjusted EPS was $1.76 for the year, up 23% on a constant currency basis. And the source of this growth was high quality, driven mostly by operating gains.
In light of a still challenging macroeconomic environment, consumer confidence and spending weakened in many of our key markets while competition among food retailers was intense, especially in Europe. We faced significantly higher prices for key commodities like cocoa and coffee. And this inflation was magnified by local currency devaluation, especially late in the year. 
In response, we quickly priced across our portfolio to offset the input cost inflation and to protect profitability. As a result, pricing was the key driver of our revenue, contributing 4.5 percentage points for the year.
Looking more closely at the sources of growth last year. Emerging markets were up 7%, with Brazil, Russia and India all increasing double digits. Developed markets were down modestly. This reflected the temporary effects of pricing-related customer disputes in Europe, that we talked about last quarter, as well as increased trade investments in North America. Let's take a more detailed look at full year top line results in each of our regions.
Latin America grew 15%, driven by pricing gains, especially in the inflationary economies of Venezuela and Argentina. Brazil was up double digits, including solid growth in all of our categories. EMEA grew 6.5%, driven by higher pricing and modest growth in vol/mix. Russia increased double digits. Vol/mix continued to improve, contributing more than 1/3 of our growth there. I'm very pleased with the performance of our team in Russia, who have consistently delivered strong results over the past couple of years. However, given the recent currency devaluation and deteriorating macroeconomic situation, we expect growth and profitability in Russia to be somewhat more challenging in 2015.
I'd also like to acknowledge our team in Ukraine, who delivered organic revenue that was essentially flat despite operating in a most difficult environment. Continuing with our region performance, Asia Pacific declined 2.8% as higher pricing was more than offset by lower vol/mix. China was down mid-single digits for the full year due to the continued softness in Biscuits, but we're now beginning to see some signs of recovery.
India delivered another year of double-digit growth, but industry-wide price increases in chocolate tempered category growth in the fourth quarter. In the near term, we expect this trend to continue until consumers adapt to the new pricing levels.
North America was up nearly 1% for the year, reflecting slower growth in Biscuits as the category softened as well as increased competition in the fourth quarter, especially in crackers. We've stepped up our brand and trade investments accordingly, and we're pleased to see signs of category recovery in the recent biscuit data. We expect growth to accelerate in early 2015.
In Europe, organic revenue was down 1% for the year. While pricing was up nearly 1.5 points, vol/mix fell as a result of a number of factors, including lower category growth as consumer demand softened in the weaker macro environment, pricing-related elasticity and pricing-related customer disruptions especially in France. 
Finally, in Europe, after more than 1 year of headwinds, Coffee turned into a tailwind in the fourth quarter, contributing over 2 points of growth as we priced to offset higher green costs.
Turning now to our categories. For the full year, snacks grew just under 4% and our global categories grew about 3.5%. Importantly, growth rates softened somewhat in the back half, and we anticipate this trend will continue in 2015.
Biscuits remained the strongest of our snacks categories, up about 5% worldwide. And while the reset of our China business held our revenue growth below that of the total category, we made good progress on our Biscuits portfolio. Oreo led the way. Globally, it grew high single digits and exceeded $2.5 billion in sales, driven by new product innovations such as Oreo Singed [ph] in China as well as new package formats such as family size in the U.S. After its first full year in Brazil, Oreo has already achieved more than a 2.5% share, while in Europe, it continued to grow at a double-digit rate, up more than 25%. Like Oreo, our belVita Breakfast Biscuits platform also grew strongly, up nearly 30%, topping $650 million in global revenues. Innovation here also played a key role. Our new Soft Baked line drove over 50% growth for belVita in the U.S. while belVita Crunchy, which we launched last spring in several European markets, is off to a good start.
In Chocolate, the impact of higher prices to offset rising cocoa and dairy costs and the effect of weakening emerging market currencies, tempered global category growth to below 4%. As we've discussed in prior earnings calls, our decision to increase prices globally resulted in soft volume and share performance as some competitors either lagged predominantly in emerging markets or did not price at all as was the case in parts of Europe. We believe that all of our competitors will eventually raise prices, given that they're facing the same input cost pressures we are. Ultimately, as the price dislocation moderates, innovation is key to regaining momentum in the Chocolate category, and we've built solid platforms to accomplish that.
For example, we continue to expand Marvelous Creations, our chunky chocolate filled with fun things like candy pieces and jellybeans, and we've expanded that into new markets like Canada and Russia, driving incremental growth. We also recently launched Cadbury Glow, a new premium gifting chocolate brand in India, Singapore and Hong Kong. Initial results have been strong, already reaching 13% of the Indian chocolate gifting segment last quarter.
Finally, the Gum & Candy category grew about 2% for the year. Our revenue was down about 3% due to the implementation of a sugar tax in Mexico where we have an 80 share, government restrictions on gum imports in Venezuela and the customer disputes in France. However, we grew or held share in 4 of our top 6 gum markets, including the U.S., Japan, Brazil and China, driven by improved price pack architecture and a focus on freshness. China is now the second-largest gum market in the world, and our growth continue to be robust, up nearly 50% last year, benefiting from the launch of Stride bottles and Stride layers.
So as you can see, we're taking the necessary steps to ensure the long-term health of our business. We're pricing to protect profitability and aggressively reducing costs so that we can continue to invest in our franchises to drive sustainable top-tier returns for our shareholders. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brian."

Good morning, everyone. Over the next few slides starting with Slide 7, I'll walk you through our 2014 margin and EPS progress as well as our outlook for 2015. Adjusted gross margin decreased 60 basis points to 36.8%, with 50 points of th",1636,"Thanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Over the next few slides starting with Slide 7, I'll walk you through our 2014 margin and EPS progress as well as our outlook for 2015. 
Adjusted gross margin decreased 60 basis points to 36.8%, with 50 points of the decline attributable to the timing of the mark-to-market accounting for commodity and currency hedges. Over the course of the year, we successfully executed pricing of $1.6 billion. While this high level of pricing was enough to fully offset significant commodity and currency-related cost inflation on a dollar basis, it wasn't enough to offset the impact of inflation on our margin percentage. 
We were able to essentially maintain gross margins, excluding the mark-to-market impact, by delivering 2.8% net productivity, totaling more than $600 million. That's a record for the company and a testament to the strong work delivered by our Integrated Supply Chain team.
As Irene noted, our adjusted OI margin increased 80 basis points to 12.9%, in line with our guidance of approximately 13%. Excluding the 50 basis point mark-to-market impact, our underlying margin improvement was actually 130 basis points. Lower overheads drove more than half of this improvement as we aggressively reduced expenses by leveraging zero-based budgeting and other cost-saving tools. 
In addition, we expanded margins by driving efficiencies in the nonworking elements of our media spend, including significantly consolidating suppliers. We also reduced production costs as we shifted more advertising to digital outlets.
To be clear, we maintained our working media support and increased our overall A&C spending on our power brands and innovation platforms. As we move to 2015, securing additional cost reductions will be a key focus and an important backstop to our plan.
Looking at performance by region, you'll see that developed markets drove much of the margin expansion. In North America, adjusted OI margin increased 140 basis points despite absorbing the startup costs of our newest greenfield biscuit plant in Salinas, Mexico. We'll begin to realize the margin benefits from that plant as we ramp up production later in the year.
In Europe, adjusted OI margin expanded 170 basis points as our overhead reduction and supply chain reinvention programs continues to pay dividends. Also worth mentioning is the impact of Latin America where margins grew 200 basis points. Our cost programs drove about half of this margin improvement while the other half related to onetime items.
Turning to earnings per share on Slide 10. Operating gains were the primary driver of our EPS growth. Adjusted EPS for the full year was $1.76, up 23% on a constant currency basis. Operating gains, excluding mark-to-market, accounted for $0.26 of this improvement. Our debt refinancing delivered $0.08 of EPS growth, and our lower share count contributed another $0.08. Even after accounting for the $0.14 negative impact of currency translation, adjusted EPS was up more than 14% for the year.
Cash flow has been another area of strong performance. Over the past 2 years, we delivered $4.8 billion of free cash flow excluding items. That's nearly 30% higher than our 2-year guidance of $3.7 billion. Strong improvement in working capital has been the primary driver. We've shortened our cash conversion cycle by 10 days, which comes on top of a 13-day improvement in the prior year. 
With our strong cash performance, we were able to return $2.9 billion in cash to shareholders last year. We repurchased $1.9 billion of shares, which is at the upper end of our $1 billion to $2 billion annual target. We also raised our dividend by 7% for a total payout of $1 billion.
Turning to Slide 12. I'm not going to cover this slide in detail, but it's safe to say that the external operating environment continues to be challenging and volatile, whether it's slow GDP growth, weak consumer demands or a difficult retailer environment. And given our strong global footprint, an uncontrollable variable like the strengthening of the U.S. dollar is especially challenging. Of course, there are a number of positive factors that will partially offset these headwinds both in 2015 and over the long term, including the continuing trend towards increased snacking and on-the-go consumer dynamics.
Within this challenging environment, we're focusing on what we can control and executing our transformation agenda. With respect to our portfolio, as Irene mentioned, we continue to expect the coffee deal to close this year. On a much smaller scale, we anticipate closing and integrating our recent acquisition of the Kinh Do snacks business in Vietnam later this year. 
We're also working to improve our revenue mix by moving away from some low margin revenue. Specifically, we've made deliberate decisions to exit nonstrategic and margin-dilutive revenue, which will temper our organic revenue growth by about 100 basis points this year. Examples of these decisions include exiting certain customers in Europe who've chosen not to accept our price increases, discontinuing certain low-margin products that were sold under short-term trademark licenses from Kraft Foods Group and pruning some SKUs so we can simplify our supply chain and focus our investments on our growth platforms.
2015 is also a year of continued intense focus on cost in both our supply chain and overheads as we progress towards our margin expansion goals. We'll also continue to invest in our power brands and routes to market for future growth. We're excited by the longer-term prospects of accelerated growth, faster decision-making and cost savings as we shift to a category-led model in all of our regions.
So let's talk about how all this translates to our outlook for 2015. We expect organic revenue to grow at least 2%. As mentioned earlier, we see overall category growth rates remaining consistent with or even somewhat below 2014. That is, we anticipate our global categories will grow at least 3% in aggregate. In 2015, we expect to continue to prioritize margin improvements, which will impact our net revenue growth and market share.
Now although it's not part of organic growth, I'd like to provide some perspective on the potential impact of foreign currency translation on our revenue. Based on January 30 spot rates, we estimate currency would be about 11% -- 11 percentage point headwind to our revenue growth. Obviously, that's a big number, but remember that 80% of our revenue is based in markets where the currencies are not tied to the strengthening U.S. dollar. So while we anticipate our reported revenue will decline due to the significant currency translation impact, we expect to deliver solid organic growth in a challenging macroeconomic environment. 
Let me now turn to our margin outlook. In 2015, we expect to deliver adjusted OI margin of approximately 14%, another significant step towards our margin goal of 15% to 16% in 2016. The continued execution of both our supply chain reinvention and overhead reduction initiatives will be key drivers of the margin expansion. We expect the savings from these programs to build throughout the year.
Moving on to EPS. We expect adjusted EPS to grow double digits on a constant currency basis, which would be our third year in a row of double-digit EPS growth. Organic revenue growth and OI margin expansion will be the main drivers. In addition, we expect our adjusted interest expense to be about $825 million, given our current weighted average interest rate of about 4.5% plus other financing costs.
We expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the high teens for 2015, slightly higher than the 16% we saw in 2014. And finally, we expect to repurchase between $1 billion and $2 billion of shares.
Let me point out again that our EPS guidance is on a constant currency basis, but since currency will be such a big headwind in our GAAP reported results at the end of the year, I'd like to provide a bit of detail on that now. 
As I mentioned previously, 80% of our revenue is derived from currencies not tied to the U.S. dollar. This exposure to growth markets is typically a strength of our business model, and I believe it will be over the long term. However, most of these currencies have been devaluing versus the dollar over the last few months, resulting in a significant currency translation headwind. 
On Slide 17, you can see the potential impact. We estimate adjusted EPS would be approximately $0.30 lower than our constant currency results based on January 30 spot rates. While we do business in many currencies, the lion's share of the headwind comes from the euro, the British pound, the Russian ruble and the Brazilian real. 
So to summarize our 2015 outlook, we expect organic net revenue to be at least 2%, including a 1 point headwind from our strategic decisions to exit low-margin revenue. We anticipate adjusted OI margin of approximately 14% and double-digit growth in adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis. 
Please note that since we don't have a precise closing date for the coffee deal, our 2015 outlook includes the full year results for the coffee business. We'll update our 2015 outlook for the impact of the coffee divestiture as we get more clarity on the closing date.
So to wrap up, in 2014, we delivered strong earnings growth and margin expansion despite the challenging consumer and retail environment. While we expect the environment to remain difficult in 2015, we'll continue to prioritize margin improvements while delivering modest revenue growth, focus on executing the cost reduction initiatives under our control and make the necessary foundational investments in our brands, innovation platforms, routes to market and supply chain to stage the portfolio for the future. We remain confident in our ability to execute our transformation agenda so that we're well positioned to deliver sustainable profitable growth and generate top-tier shareholder returns now and over the long term.
With that, let's open it up for questions."

I should -- I expect that, that will improve as the year progresses in both Europe and in North America, as I mentioned, we certainly are experiencing some category slowdown.

But if you look over the course of the year, there's no question these costs are all still up year-over-year, and that's really what we've been responding to. So the facts are that the market basket of inputs for our Chocolate business are among the highest. And they were a key part of our -- a key reason for -- a contributor to the $1.6 billion of pricing that we took this past year. So it is still a headwind for us. We are taking the necessary steps to start by protecting profitability and making sure that we are pricing to recover those costs. We're supporting our power brands in particular with the necessary spending to help to mitigate the impact. And I'm quite confident that as the market adapts to these new price points, both from an absolute elasticity standpoint as well as from a price gap standpoint as competitors take pricing actions, I'm quite confident that we'll see the market recover."

There's no question that our long-term algorithm assumes a balance of volume/mix and pricing. And in the short term, there's no question that we are leaning disproportionately on pricing, given the enormous increases that we are seeing in both our commodity increases as well as in the impact of the currency devaluation. So it's been -- it was about 4.5 points of our 2 point, 4 points of revenue growth, so it was a significant impact, which says that vol/mix was a negative, and there's no question, as I talked about in a couple of times on the call, that in the short term, the $1.6 billion of pricing that we took has had an impact in the marketplace. We are monitoring that very carefully. We are thoughtful about which markets and which categories we are monitoring and protecting. And the end in mind is to get ourselves back onto a trajectory over the long term where we grow at or above the rates of our category growth. But in the near term, the single biggest opportunity for us to ensure that we have adequate money to invest in our franchises is to make sure that we're pricing to protect our margins in the face of escalating costs. So there's nothing about the numbers that's inconsistent with the approach that we're taking. Over the long term, we would expect to see our businesses growing at or above the rates of our categories. But in the near term, while costs are as volatile as they are, we want to make sure that we are protecting our profitability and that has a short-term dislocation impact."

Turning to the specifics for 2014. We generated strong earnings growth and margin expansion in a challenging environment by driving record net productivity and aggressively reducing overheads. On the top line, we delivered organic net revenue consistent with our latest outlook as we raised prices to recover higher input costs and protect profitability while continuing to invest in our growth platforms. 
Specifically, for the full year, organic net revenue was up 2.4%. Adjusted operating income margin increased 80 basis points to 12.9%. That was in line with our guidance of about 13% despite absorbing a 50 basis point headwind from the timing of mark-to-market accounting. Adjusted EPS was $1.76 for the year, up 23% on a constant currency basis. And the source of this growth was high quality, driven mostly by operating gains.
In light of a still challenging macroeconomic environment, consumer confidence and spending weakened in many of our key markets while competition among food retailers was intense, especially in Europe. We faced significantly higher prices for key commodities like cocoa and coffee. And this inflation was magnified by local currency devaluation, especially late in the year. 
In response, we quickly priced across our portfolio to offset the input cost inflation and to protect profitability. As a result, pricing was the key driver of our revenue, contributing 4.5 percentage points for the year.
Looking more closely at the sources of growth last year. Emerging markets were up 7%, with Brazil, Russia and India all increasing double digits. Developed markets were down modestly. This reflected the temporary effects of pricing-related customer disputes in Europe that we talked about last quarter, as well as increased trade investments in North America. Let's take a more detailed look at full year top line results in each of our regions.
Latin America grew 15%, driven by pricing gains, especially in the inflationary economies of Venezuela and Argentina. Brazil was up double digits, including solid growth in all of our categories. EMEA grew 6.5%, driven by higher pricing and modest growth in vol/mix. Russia increased double digits. Vol/mix continued to improve, contributing more than 1/3 of our growth there. I'm very pleased with the performance of our team in Russia, who have consistently delivered strong results over the past couple of years. However, given the recent currency devaluation and deteriorating macroeconomic situation, we expect growth and profitability in Russia to be somewhat more challenging in 2015.
I'd also like to acknowledge our team in Ukraine, who delivered organic revenue that was essentially flat despite operating in a most difficult environment. Continuing with our region performance, Asia Pacific declined 2.8% as higher pricing was more than offset by lower vol/mix. China was down mid-single digits for the full year due to the continued softness in Biscuits, but we're now beginning to see some signs of recovery.
India delivered another year of double-digit growth, but industry-wide price increases in chocolate tempered category growth in the fourth quarter. In the near term, we expect this trend to continue until consumers adapt to the new pricing levels.
North America was up nearly 1% for the year, reflecting slower growth in Biscuits as the category softened as well as increased competition in the fourth quarter, especially in crackers. We've stepped up our brand and trade investments accordingly, and we're pleased to see signs of category recovery in the recent biscuit data. We expect growth to accelerate in early 2015.
In Europe, organic revenue was down 1% for the year. While pricing was up nearly 1.5 points, vol/mix fell as a result of a number of factors, including lower category growth as consumer demand softened in the weaker macro environment, pricing-related elasticity and pricing-related customer disruptions especially in France. 
Finally, in Europe, after more than 1 year of headwinds, Coffee turned into a tailwind in the fourth quarter, contributing over 2 points of growth as we priced to offset higher green costs.
Turning now to our categories. For the full year, snacks grew just under 4% and our global categories grew about 3.5%. Importantly, growth rates softened somewhat in the back half, and we anticipate this trend will continue in 2015.
Biscuits remained the strongest of our snacks categories, up about 5% worldwide. And while the reset of our China business held our revenue growth below that of the total category, we made good progress on our Biscuits portfolio. Oreo led the way. Globally, it grew high single digits and exceeded $2.5 billion in sales, driven by new product innovations such as Oreo Singed [ph] in China as well as new package formats such as family size in the U.S. After its first full year in Brazil, Oreo has already achieved more than a 2.5% share, while in Europe, it continued to grow at a double-digit rate, up more than 25%. Like Oreo, our belVita Breakfast Biscuits platform also grew strongly, up nearly 30%, topping $650 million in global revenues. Innovation here also played a key role. Our new Soft Baked line drove over 50% growth for belVita in the U.S. while belVita Crunchy, which we launched last spring in several European markets, is off to a good start.
In Chocolate, the impact of higher prices to offset rising cocoa and dairy costs and the effect of weakening emerging market currencies tempered global category growth to below 4%. As we've discussed in prior earnings calls, our decision to increase prices globally resulted in soft volume and share performance as some competitors either lagged predominantly in emerging markets or did not price at all as was the case in parts of Europe. We believe that all of our competitors will eventually raise prices, given that they're facing the same input cost pressures we are. Ultimately, as the price dislocation moderates, innovation is key to regaining momentum in the Chocolate category, and we've built solid platforms to accomplish that.
For example, we continue to expand Marvelous Creations, our chunky chocolate filled with fun things like candy pieces and jellybeans, and we've expanded that into new markets like Canada and Russia, driving incremental growth. We also recently launched Cadbury Glow, a new premium gifting chocolate brand in India, Singapore and Hong Kong. Initial results have been strong, already reaching 13% of the Indian chocolate gifting segment last quarter.
Finally, the Gum & Candy category grew about 2% for the year. Our revenue was down about 3% due to the implementation of a sugar tax in Mexico where we have an 80 share, government restrictions on gum imports in Venezuela and the customer disputes in France. However, we grew or held share in 4 of our top 6 gum markets, including the U.S., Japan, Brazil and China, driven by improved price pack architecture and a focus on freshness. China is now the second-largest gum market in the world, and our growth continue to be robust, up nearly 50% last year, benefiting from the launch of Stride bottles and Stride layers.
So as you can see, we're taking the necessary steps to ensure the long-term health of our business. We're pricing to protect profitability and aggressively reducing costs so that we can continue to invest in our franchises to drive sustainable top-tier returns for our shareholders. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brian."

Good morning, everyone. Over the next few slides starting with Slide 7, I'll walk you through our 2014 margin and EPS progress as well as our outlook for 2015. Adjusted gross margin decreased 60 basis points to 36.8%, with 50 points of th",1636,"Thanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Over the next few slides starting with Slide 7, I'll walk you through our 2014 margin and EPS progress as well as our outlook for 2015. 
Adjusted gross margin decreased 60 basis points to 36.8%, with 50 points of the decline attributable to the timing of the mark-to-market accounting for commodity and currency hedges. Over the course of the year, we successfully executed pricing of $1.6 billion. While this high level of pricing was enough to fully offset significant commodity and currency-related cost inflation on a dollar basis, it wasn't enough to offset the impact of inflation on our margin percentage. 
We were able to essentially maintain gross margins, excluding the mark-to-market impact, by delivering 2.8% net productivity, totaling more than $600 million. That's a record for the company and a testament to the strong work delivered by our Integrated Supply Chain team.
As Irene noted, our adjusted OI margin increased 80 basis points to 12.9%, in line with our guidance of approximately 13%. Excluding the 50 basis point mark-to-market impact, our underlying margin improvement was actually 130 basis points. Lower overheads drove more than half of this improvement as we aggressively reduced expenses by leveraging zero-based budgeting and other cost-saving tools. 
In addition, we expanded margins by driving efficiencies in the nonworking elements of our media spend, including significantly consolidating suppliers. We also reduced production costs as we shifted more advertising to digital outlets.
To be clear, we maintained our working media support and increased our overall A&C spending on our power brands and innovation platforms. As we move through 2015, securing additional cost reductions will be a key focus and an important backstop to our plan.
Looking at performance by region, you'll see that developed markets drove much of the margin expansion. In North America, adjusted OI margin increased 140 basis points despite absorbing the startup costs of our newest greenfield biscuit plant in Salinas, Mexico. We'll begin to realize the margin benefits from that plant as we ramp up production later in the year.
In Europe, adjusted OI margin expanded 170 basis points as our overhead reduction and supply chain reinvention programs continues to pay dividends. Also worth mentioning is the impact of Latin America where margins grew 200 basis points. Our cost programs drove about half of this margin improvement while the other half related to onetime items.
Turning to earnings per share on Slide 10. Operating gains were the primary driver of our EPS growth. Adjusted EPS for the full year was $1.76, up 23% on a constant currency basis. Operating gains, excluding mark-to-market, accounted for $0.26 of this improvement. Our debt refinancing delivered $0.08 of EPS growth, and our lower share count contributed another $0.08. Even after accounting for the $0.14 negative impact of currency translation, adjusted EPS was up more than 14% for the year.
Cash flow has been another area of strong performance. Over the past 2 years, we delivered $4.8 billion of free cash flow excluding items. That's nearly 30% higher than our 2-year guidance of $3.7 billion. Strong improvement in working capital has been the primary driver. We've shortened our cash conversion cycle by 10 days, which comes on top of a 13-day improvement in the prior year. 
With our strong cash performance, we were able to return $2.9 billion in cash to shareholders last year. We repurchased $1.9 billion of shares, which is at the upper end of our $1 billion to $2 billion annual target. We also raised our dividend by 7% for a total payout of $1 billion.
Turning to Slide 12. I'm not going to cover this slide in detail, but it's safe to say that the external operating environment continues to be challenging and volatile, whether it's slow GDP growth, weak consumer demands or a difficult retailer environment. And given our strong global footprint, an uncontrollable variable like the strengthening of the U.S. dollar is especially challenging. Of course, there are a number of positive factors that will partially offset these headwinds both in 2015 and over the long term, including the continuing trend towards increased snacking and on-the-go consumer dynamics.
Within this challenging environment, we're focusing on what we can control and executing our transformation agenda. With respect to our portfolio, as Irene mentioned, we continue to expect the coffee deal to close this year. On a much smaller scale, we anticipate closing and integrating our recent acquisition of the Kinh Do snacks business in Vietnam later this year. 
We're also working to improve our revenue mix by moving away from some low margin revenue. Specifically, we've made deliberate decisions to exit nonstrategic and margin-dilutive revenue, which will temper our organic revenue growth by about 100 basis points this year. Examples of these decisions include exiting certain customers in Europe who've chosen not to accept our price increases, discontinuing certain low-margin products that were sold under short-term trademark licenses from Kraft Foods Group and pruning some SKUs so we can simplify our supply chain and focus our investments on our growth platforms.
2015 is also a year of continued intense focus on cost in both our supply chain and overheads as we progress towards our margin expansion goals. We'll also continue to invest in our power brands and routes to market for future growth. We're excited by the longer-term prospects of accelerated growth, faster decision-making and cost savings as we shift to a category-led model in all of our regions.
So let's talk about how all this translates to our outlook for 2015. We expect organic revenue to grow at least 2%. As mentioned earlier, we see overall category growth rates remaining consistent with or even somewhat below 2014. That is, we anticipate our global categories will grow at least 3% in aggregate. In 2015, we expect to continue to prioritize margin improvements, which will impact our net revenue growth and market share.
Now although it's not part of organic growth, I'd like to provide some perspective on the potential impact of foreign currency translation on our revenue. Based on January 30 spot rates, we estimate currency would be about 11% -- 11 percentage point headwind to our revenue growth. Obviously, that's a big number, but remember that 80% of our revenue is based in markets where the currencies are not tied to the strengthening U.S. dollar. So while we anticipate our reported revenue will decline due to the significant currency translation impact, we expect to deliver solid organic growth in a challenging macroeconomic environment. 
Let me now turn to our margin outlook. In 2015, we expect to deliver adjusted OI margin of approximately 14%, another significant step towards our margin goal of 15% to 16% in 2016. The continued execution of both our supply chain reinvention and overhead reduction initiatives will be key drivers of the margin expansion. We expect the savings from these programs to build throughout the year.
Moving on to EPS. We expect adjusted EPS to grow double digits on a constant currency basis, which would be our third year in a row of double-digit EPS growth. Organic revenue growth and OI margin expansion will be the main drivers. In addition, we expect our adjusted interest expense to be about $825 million, given our current weighted average interest rate of about 4.5% plus other financing costs.
We expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the high teens for 2015, slightly higher than the 16% we saw in 2014. And finally, we expect to repurchase between $1 billion and $2 billion of shares.
Let me point out again that our EPS guidance is on a constant currency basis, but since currency will be such a big headwind in our GAAP reported results at the end of the year, I'd like to provide a bit of detail on that now. 
As I mentioned previously, 80% of our revenue is derived from currencies not tied to the U.S. dollar. This exposure to growth markets is typically a strength of our business model, and I believe it will be over the long term. However, most of these currencies have been devaluing versus the dollar over the last few months, resulting in a significant currency translation headwind. 
On Slide 17, you can see the potential impact. We estimate adjusted EPS would be approximately $0.30 lower than our constant currency results based on January 30 spot rates. While we do business in many currencies, the lion's share of the headwind comes from the euro, the British pound, the Russian ruble and the Brazilian real. 
So to summarize our 2015 outlook, we expect organic net revenue to be at least 2%, including a 1 point headwind from our strategic decisions to exit low-margin revenue. We anticipate adjusted OI margin of approximately 14% and double-digit growth in adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis. 
Please note that since we don't have a precise closing date for the coffee deal, our 2015 outlook includes the full year results for the coffee business. We'll update our 2015 outlook for the impact of the coffee divestiture as we get more clarity on the closing date.
So to wrap up, in 2014, we delivered strong earnings growth and margin expansion despite the challenging consumer and retail environment. While we expect the environment to remain difficult in 2015, we'll continue to prioritize margin improvements while delivering modest revenue growth, focus on executing the cost reduction initiatives under our control and make the necessary foundational investments in our brands, innovation platforms, routes to market and supply chain to stage the portfolio for the future. We remain confident in our ability to execute our transformation agenda so that we're well positioned to deliver sustainable profitable growth and generate top-tier shareholder returns now and over the long term.
With that, let's open it up for questions."

I should -- I expect that, that will improve as the year progresses in both Europe and in North America, as I mentioned, we certainly are experiencing some category slowdown.

There's no question that our long-term algorithm assumes a balance of volume/mix and pricing. And in the short term, there's no question that we are leaning disproportionately on pricing, given the enormous increases that we are seeing in both our commodity increases as well as in the impact of the currency devaluation. So it's been -- it was about 4.5 points of our 2 point, 4 points of revenue growth, so it was a significant impact, which says that vol/mix was a negative, and there's no question, as I've talked about in a couple of times on the call, that in the short term, the $1.6 billion of pricing that we took has had an impact in the marketplace. We are monitoring that very carefully. We are thoughtful about which markets and which categories we are monitoring and protecting. And the end in mind is to get ourselves back onto a trajectory over the long term where we grow at or above the rates of our category growth. But in the near term, the single biggest opportunity for us to ensure that we have adequate money to invest in our franchises is to make sure that we're pricing to protect our margins in the face of escalating costs. So there's nothing about the numbers that's inconsistent with the approach that we're taking. Over the long term, we would expect to see our businesses growing at or above the rates of our categories. But in the near term, while costs are as volatile as they are, we want to make sure that we are protecting our profitability and that has a short-term dislocation impact."

We've continued to make good progress in a challenging environment by focusing on what we can control. This includes executing our transformation agenda, prioritizing margin expansion and strong constant currency earnings growth while delivering solid revenue growth. 
Specifically, organic net revenue grew 3.8%, driven by pricing actions to recover currency-driven [indiscernible] cost increases. We significantly expanded adjusted operating income margin, up 160 basis points to 13.8%. Importantly, adjusted gross margin contributed more than half of the increase while lower overheads contributed the rest. Adjusted EPS was $0.41, up nearly 26% on a constant currency basis, driven almost entirely by operating gains. 
As we discussed at CAGNY, we're executing 3 transformation priorities that will further leverage our advantaged portfolio and geographic footprint while setting us up to deliver top-tier financial performance as global demand improves. 
Let me give you a quick update on each of our transformation initiatives: to further focus our portfolio on snacks; to reduce our supply chain and overhead cost and to continue investing for growth. On the portfolio front, we expect our Jacobs Douwe Egberts coffee joint venture to close this year, likely in the third quarter. We're working to secure the necessary regulatory approvals from the European Commission and are awaiting the results of the phase 2 review. 
We anticipate closing our acquisition of Kinh Do's biscuit business in Vietnam around midyear and are looking forward to leveraging the growth opportunities of this attractive business. With about $175 million in sales, Kinh Do is one of the largest snack companies in Vietnam, with iconic brands and leading positions in biscuits and moon cakes. Going forward, we intend to accelerate its growth by introducing our power brands into its distribution network, which covers 130,000 outlets. 
We also welcomed Enjoy Life Foods into our family last quarter. While starting from a relatively small revenue base, the company provides us with an excellent platform for future growth. We're very excited about the opportunity to leverage its strong brands and market position in fast growing better-for-you allergen-free snacks.
Turning to our cost reduction programs. We're continuing to make good progress across our supply chain and in overheads. Net productivity in the quarter was very strong at more than 3% of cost of goods sold, building on the record rate of 2.8% we delivered last year. These productivity gains were instrumental in driving our 90 basis point improvement in adjusted gross margin. 
We're complementing these supply chain savings by aggressively managing overheads, leveraging the zero-based budgeting process we began about 18 months ago. This includes reducing indirect expenses as well as streamlining infrastructure and internal processes. In fact, we've already begun to migrate some transactional processes to our new global shared service centers. As a result, we continue to reduce overheads as a percent of revenue. 
Of course, these savings not only enable us to expand margins, but they also provide the fuel to invest in growth. As we highlighted at CAGNY, this includes investing in new advantaged assets as part of our supply chain reinvention. 
For example, our biscuit plant in Salinas, Mexico opened on schedule in the fourth quarter. By the end of the first half, we'll have 5 new lines up and running to support growth and repatriate volume that's currently co-manufactured. As you'll recall, each of these new lines gives us 1,000-point margin increase over existing assets. 
We're also bringing on stream advantaged Lines of the Future at other facilities around the world, in emerging markets like India and China as well as in Europe and the U.S. Each of these state-of-the-art lines has operating costs that are about half as much as our current lines and runs twice as fast while taking up only a fraction of the floor space. 
We've also continued to invest in working media to strengthen our brand equities, backstop our pricing and support innovation. Total advertising and consumer spending was essentially flat on a constant currency basis as we maintained marketing support, particularly on our power brands. 
That said, as a percent of revenue, A&C was down slightly as we continued to drive efficiencies in nonworking media, moved more advertising to lower-cost digital channels and shifted the timing of certain marketing programs. For the remainder of the year, we expect A&C to rise modestly as we invest behind new product launches and marketing programs to drive revenue and improve share.
Let's take a more detailed look at our top line results for the quarter. As you can see on Slide 5, organic net revenue grew 3.8%, with pricing contributing 6.5 percentage points. Consistent with our strategy, we've raised prices to recover higher input costs, including the impact of currency. As we've discussed previously, this protects profits and enables us to continue to invest in our people and in our key growth drivers: our brands, innovation platforms, sales and distribution capabilities and supply chain.
It's important to note that in the first quarter, a significant contributor to the increase in price was the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken last year. Of course, rising prices, especially when the increases are significant, typically have a short-term impact on consumer demand. In Q1, vol/mix was down 2.7 percentage points due in part to elasticity. 
As we discussed in our earnings call last quarter, we're also experiencing the impact of some strategic decisions to improve revenue mix. These include: discontinuing some low-margin customer-specific product lines, especially in Europe; exiting low-margin products associated with short-term brand licenses from Kraft Foods; and ongoing SKU simplification. In the quarter, these strategic decisions accounted for about 140 basis points of the decline in vol/mix. For the full year, we expect these decisions to be about 100 basis point headwind to our organic growth. And as we've said before, this has been incorporated into our revenue guidance. Partially offsetting this headwind in Q1 is about a 50 basis point benefit from the shift of Easter-related shipments into the first quarter.
Our power brands, which represent about 2/3 of our revenue, grew nearly 6%, led by Oreo, Tuc/Club Social and belVita biscuits, Chocolate, Trident Gum, Paul's Candy and Jacobs and Tassimo Coffee. Emerging markets were up [ph] only 11% with the BRIC countries up double digits. Developed markets were down 0.5%.
Turning now to our results by region. As you can see on Slide 6, Latin America and EMEA, fueled by higher pricing, drove much of our overall growth. Latin America was up nearly 19%, driven by the inflationary economies in Venezuela and Argentina. Brazil was up nearly 10%, including a meaningful contribution from vol/mix and solid growth across all categories.
EMEA grew 11%, primarily due to pricing in Russia and Ukraine in response to the sharp devaluation of those currencies. Despite this, vol/mix was up in both countries and share performance was solid. Russia grew mid-teens, with strong growth in our 2 largest categories. Chocolate was up high teens behind Alpen Gold and coffee was up over 20%.
Asia Pacific grew modestly with solid gains in China and India. China was up high single digits, driven by strong performance of both Oreo and Stride Gum. We continue to be encouraged by our progress. This is the third consecutive quarter of high single-digit growth there. Our team is executing well, and we're selectively investing to continue and hopefully accelerate our momentum.
India was up mid-single digits as Cadbury Dairy Milk's share topped 40%, its highest ever. However, chocolate price increases tempered consumer demand. We expect category and revenue growth in India to improve as the year progresses, not only as we increase A&C investments but also as consumers adjust to the industry-wide price increases implemented last year.
North America revenue declined modestly, largely due to a change in a large customer's in-store strategy that reduced merchandising and display opportunities. Although this led to a decline in the overall biscuits category and a modest decrease in our revenue, we grew our share, driven by strength in crackers. To accelerate revenue and category growth for the remainder of the year, we're stepping up marketing support behind our Power Brands and innovation platforms as well as increasing investments behind in-store execution.
Finally, Europe was down 0.6%, in line with our expectations. Frankly, we expect Europe's first half to be soft as the macro environment continues to be challenging. In addition, the strategic decisions to improve revenue mix that I mentioned earlier tempered Europe's volumes by about 200 basis points, which was only partially offset by a 60-point benefit due to the Easter shift. 
We've continued to experience some negative volume elasticity as a result of our decision to lead [ph] pricing to recover higher input costs, especially in chocolate. However, we expect this pressure to ease in the back half.
Turning now to our categories. For the quarter, snacks categories grew about 4.5% globally, up from the low 3s as we exited last year. Of course, the Easter shift helped boost growth rate somewhat. Including beverages, Cheese and Grocery, our categories edged closer to 5% growth.
Along with overall category growth modestly improving, our share performance began to stabilize, with 48% of our snacks revenues gaining or holding share in the quarter. That's up from 40% in 2014. In addition, compared to the softening trends we saw on the back half of last year, our share performance improved across almost all of our snacks categories.
The biscuits category grew about 4%, down from 5% last year. Much of this lower growth came in North America and Europe. Our biscuits revenue grew in line with the category as we gained or held share in key markets, fueled by our Power Brands, which grew high single digits. 
For example, Oreo was up mid-teens, driven by innovation in China and distribution gains in Brazil and Europe. Tuc/Club Social grew more than 30%, with launches of new flavors and pack sizes in Brazil. belVita was up high single digits, with strong growth in the U.S. behind the continued success of belVita Bites. And in the U.K., with belVita Tartine and Crunchy.
Turning to chocolate. The category grew 6.5%, aided by the Easter shift. Our sales only increased slightly more than 1%, with only about 35% of our revenue gaining or holding share. The softness was due primarily to our European business, which accounts for half of our Global Chocolate sales. We expected this, knowing that a significant portion of the decline would be due to our decision to discontinue some low-margin product lines, and that we've continued to experience some volume elasticity and share losses because we led pricing. 
Although we expect continued share pressure in Q2, we're encouraged to see that most of our European competitors have now begun to raise prices. As a result, we expect our shares to strengthen in the back half of the year. In the meantime, we're selectively stepping up our marketing and promotional activity to narrow price gaps and regain share.
In emerging markets, chocolate revenue increased mid-single digits, and we gained or held share in our key markets. For example, in Brazil, our largest chocolate business in emerging markets, sales grew high single digits, and we increased share by about 1 point. 
In India, our second-largest emerging markets chocolate business, although the category slowed, revenue was up mid-single digits and we held share. And in Russia and South Africa, revenue was up mid- to high teens, holding share as well. 
Looking ahead, as price gaps narrow and we increase marketing support in the back half of the year, we expect Global Chocolate revenue growth in both developed and emerging markets to accelerate and our shares to rebound.
Turning to Gum & Candy. The category grew about 1.5% while our revenue was up nearly 6%. For the first time in a while, I'm pleased to see strong Gum growth. Like chocolate, our Gum results are a tale of 2 cities. Developed markets continue to be down mid-single digits, with share losses in France, Japan and the U.S. But in the emerging markets, Gum was up mid-teens, led by strong revenue and share performance in Brazil and China. 
To summarize, we're very pleased with our performance in the first quarter. We delivered solid revenue growth in a challenging environment and made good progress in stabilizing our shares. We're executing on our transformation agenda well, including aggressively reducing cost to expand margins and to provide the fuel to invest in our franchises to drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brian."
739693,290208262,797081,"Mondelez International, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2015",2015-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Mondelez International, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Building on what Irene just said, we're feeling confident about our execution, especially the strong progress we're making to drive down costs, expand margins and grow earnings per share. Starting with Slide 8, you",1236,"Thanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Building on what Irene just said, we're feeling confident about our execution, especially the strong progress we're making to drive down costs, expand margins and grow earnings per share. 
Starting with Slide 8, you can see that adjusted gross margin increased 90 basis points to 38%. Pricing, including the carryover benefit of actions taken in 2014, more than offset the increase in commodity and currency-related cost inflation. This allowed strong net productivity of more than 3% of COGS or about $175 million to fall through.
Adjusted OI margin was up 160 basis points to 13.8%. Adjusted gross margin expansion accounted for more than half of the increase. The rest was driven by lower overheads as we continued to aggressively reduce expenses by leveraging our zero-based budgeting approach and other cost-saving tools.
Looking at margin performance by region. You can see that North America, Europe and Latin America drove our adjusted OI margin expansion. North America was up 400 basis points. More than half of this improvement was driven by strong net productivity, with the remainder largely due to lower overheads.
Europe was up 180 basis points as strong net productivity positively impacted adjusted gross margins. And Latin America increased 120 basis points, predominantly driven by overhead leverage. In contrast, EMEA declined 240 basis points. The sudden and severe devaluation of Ukrainian and Russian currencies made it difficult to fully recover input cost inflation in the near term without sacrificing significant volume declines or share losses. 
As we exit the quarter, we're in a much better position with margins in these markets. We expect margin will improve as the year progresses as we continue to implement additional price increases to cover higher costs. 
In Asia Pacific, margin was down 30 basis points. While we improved gross margin and lowered overheads, the phase-out of a local tax incentive program offset underlying year-over-year operating margin improvement.
Turning to EPS on Slide 10. Adjusted EPS for the first quarter was $0.41, up nearly 26% on a constant currency basis. The year-over-year improvement in our operating income accounted for $0.09 of this increase. Below the operating line, lower interest expense from our successful debt refinancing added $0.01, and lower outstanding shares added another $0.02. Also below the line, our effective tax rate was higher, driven mostly by the geographic mix of where our earnings were generated. The higher tax rate hurt our EPS by $0.02 versus last year. Even after accounting for the $0.08 negative impact of currency translation, adjusted EPS was up more than 5%.
On the next page, you'll see that we returned $1.75 billion of capital to our shareholders in the first quarter. We purchased $1.5 billion of stock. That represented 41.7 million shares at an average price of just under $36 as we front-loaded much of our buyback activity, given the relatively attractive share price and our liquidity. 
Consistent with our outlook, we expect to buy back up to $2 billion of stock for the year. However, this doesn't include additional share repurchase activity related to the expected cash proceeds from the coffee deal in the second half. 
We also paid about $250 million in dividends. As we've previously stated, we intend to pay a modest dividend, with shareholder returns largely driven by EPS growth. Nonetheless, we're committed to maintaining a payout ratio of at least 30%. Today, our payout ratio is about 35%.
Turning to Slide 12. In the first quarter, we took advantage of an opportunity to refinance some of our higher-cost dollar debt into lower coupon euro, sterling and Swiss franc-denominated notes. The weighted average rate for the $2.5 billion of U.S. dollar notes we tendered was about 6.2%. We financed the tender by issuing the equivalent of about $3.5 billion of notes at very attractive rates, securing a weighted average coupon of 1.9%. 
As a result, we lowered the weighted average cost of our long-term debt by about 100 basis points to 3.6%. We also extended the average tenor of our long-term debt by nearly 1 year from about 7.5 to 8.5 years. For 2015, this lowers our total interest expense by $75 million to $100 million, depending upon how currency rates evolve for the year.
Now turning to our outlook for the year. Given our solid start, we're increasingly confident in our ability to deliver our 2015 outlook. With that said, we still have much to do as we execute our transformation. So in the near term, we want to be prudent and we're simply reaffirming our outlook for the year. 
We continue to expect organic revenue to grow at least 2%, including a headwind of about 100 basis points from the strategic decisions to improve revenue mix that we discussed earlier. We anticipate adjusted OI margin of approximately 14% and double-digit growth in adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis. And we expect free cash flow, excluding items, to be approximately $1.2 billion. 
While our overall guidance for constant currency adjusted EPS has not changed, the makeup of the below-the-line items will be somewhat different. Due to our debt refinancing, our interest expense is likely to be around $750 million rather than the original guidance of around $825 million.
In addition, due to earnings mix and consistent with what we saw in the first quarter, our effective tax rate is likely to be higher than we originally anticipated. Instead of an estimated tax rate in the high teens, we currently expect a rate in the low 20s. Of course, currency continues to be a significant and increasing headwind this year, given that 80% of our revenue is not tied to the U.S. dollar.
Using April 27 spot rates, we anticipate that currency headwind would be about 12 percentage points for revenue versus our earlier estimate of 11 points. We also anticipate a $0.33 impact to adjusted EPS compared to our initial $0.30 estimate.
While the currency impact is significant, we believe our underlying performance and operations are solid. We remain confident in our ability to deliver strong constant currency earnings growth and solid organic revenue growth this year.
One last point. Since we don't have the necessary regulatory approvals to know the precise closing date for the coffee JV, our 2015 outlook includes the full year results for the coffee business. Assuming a closing sometime in the third quarter, we'll likely update our 2015 outlook for the impact of the coffee transaction when we report our second quarter results.
So to wrap up, we've had a solid start to the year by focusing on what we can control as we prioritize margin expansion and strong constant currency earnings growth while delivering solid revenue growth. We're making good progress on our transformation agenda. Our initiatives to focus our portfolio are on track, including the coffee JV. We're executing well against our cost reduction programs, and we're continuing to invest in our Power Brands, our supply chain and sales and distribution capabilities to drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth over the long term. 
As we anticipated, our market share performance has begun to stabilize. We expect it to improve in the second half as price gaps narrow, and we continue to selectively increase marketing support and promotional programs. All of these actions have us well positioned to achieve our 2015 outlook and our 15% to 16% margin target for 2016. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

So I think that's the big one. As I mentioned in my comments, I think we were a bit ahead in terms of executing in a couple areas. One is supply chain and some of the reinvention activities helped contribute to that productivity. I think some of that's timing and executing a bit earlier which helps. And then on overheads. We slightly beat our targets for overhead reductions. And that's really as ZBB is playing out and our visibility and transparency to spending and moving the culture from a -- to more cost-conscious culture, I think, is paying dividends for us. So those are the things, I think, that give us a little bit of a tailwind in the quarter. And again, as we talked about, I think the supply chain reinvention is clearly a second half impact that we still expect to see. We may be pulled a little bit of that into the first part of the year, which is great, but there'll be more to come in the second half."

But I think you also need to get underneath the covers a little bit on that number. A big driver of that 4.5% improvement was the 6.5% growth in chocolate, which is largely price-driven as we've said, also benefited somewhat from the Easter shift.

We've continued to make good progress in a challenging environment by focusing on what we can control. This includes executing our transformation agenda, prioritizing margin expansion and strong constant-currency earnings growth while delivering solid revenue growth. 
Specifically, organic net revenue grew 3.8%, driven by pricing actions to recover currency-driven input cost increases. We significantly expanded adjusted operating income margin, up 160 basis points to 13.8%. Importantly, adjusted gross margin contributed more than half of the increase while lower overheads contributed the rest. Adjusted EPS was $0.41, up nearly 26% on a constant-currency basis, driven almost entirely by operating gains. 
As we discussed at CAGNY, we're executing 3 transformation priorities that will further leverage our advantaged portfolio and geographic footprint while setting us up to deliver top-tier financial performance as global demand improves. 
Let me give you a quick update on each of our transformation initiatives: to further focus our portfolio on snacks, to reduce our supply chain and overhead costs and to continue investing for growth. 
On the portfolio front, we expect our Jacobs Douwe Egberts coffee joint venture to close this year, likely in the third quarter. We're working to secure the necessary regulatory approvals from the European Commission and are awaiting the results of the phase 2 review. 
We anticipate closing our acquisition of Kinh Do's biscuit business in Vietnam around midyear and are looking forward to leveraging the growth opportunities of this attractive business. With about $175 million in sales, Kinh Do is one of the largest snack companies in Vietnam, with iconic brands and leading positions in biscuits and moon cakes. Going forward, we intend to accelerate its growth by introducing our power brands into its distribution network, which covers 130,000 outlets. 
We also welcomed Enjoy Life Foods into our family last quarter. While starting from a relatively small revenue base, the company provides us with an excellent platform for future growth. We're very excited about the opportunity to leverage its strong brands and market position in fast-growing better-for-you allergen-free snacks.
Turning to our cost reduction programs. We're continuing to make good progress across our supply chain and in overheads. Net productivity in the quarter was very strong at more than 3% of cost of goods sold, building on the record rate of 2.8% we delivered last year. These productivity gains were instrumental in driving our 90-basis-point improvement in adjusted gross margin. 
We're complementing these supply chain savings by aggressively managing overheads, leveraging the 0-based budgeting process we began about 18 months ago. This includes reducing indirect expenses as well as streamlining infrastructure and internal processes. In fact, we've already begun to migrate some transactional processes to our new global shared service centers. As a result, we continue to reduce overheads as a percent of revenue. 
Of course, these savings not only enable us to expand margins, but they also provide the fuel to invest in growth. As we highlighted at CAGNY, this includes investing in new advantaged assets as part of our supply chain reinvention. 
For example, our biscuit plant in Salinas, Mexico, opened on schedule in the fourth quarter. By the end of the first half, we'll have 5 new lines up and running to support growth and repatriate volume that's currently co-manufactured. As you'll recall, each of these new lines gives us a 1,000-point margin increase over existing assets. 
We're also bringing on stream advantaged Lines of the Future at other facilities around the world, in emerging markets like India and China as well as in Europe and the U.S. Each of these state-of-the-art lines has operating costs that are about half as much as our current lines and runs twice as fast while taking up only a fraction of the floor space. 
We've also continued to invest in working media to strengthen our brand equities, backstop our pricing and support innovation. Total advertising and consumer spending was essentially flat on a constant-currency basis as we maintained marketing support, particularly on our Power Brands. 
That said, as a percent of revenue, A&C was down slightly as we continued to drive efficiencies in nonworking media, moved more advertising to lower-cost digital channels and shifted the timing of certain marketing programs. For the remainder of the year, we expect A&C to rise modestly as we invest behind new product launches and marketing programs to drive revenue and improve share.
Let's take a more detailed look at our top line results for the quarter. As you can see on Slide 5, organic net revenue grew 3.8%, with pricing contributing 6.5 percentage points. Consistent with our strategy, we've raised prices to recover higher input costs, including the impact of currency. As we've discussed previously, this protects profits and enables us to continue to invest in our people and in our key growth drivers: our brands, innovation platforms, sales and distribution capabilities and supply chain.
It's important to note that in the first quarter, a significant contributor to the increase in price was the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken last year. Of course, rising prices, especially when the increases are significant, typically have a short-term impact on consumer demand. In Q1, vol/mix was down 2.7 percentage points due in part to elasticity. 
As we discussed in our earnings call last quarter, we're also experiencing the impact of some strategic decisions to improve revenue mix. These include: discontinuing some low-margin, customer-specific product lines, especially in Europe; exiting low-margin products associated with short-term brand licenses from Kraft Foods; and ongoing SKU simplification. In the quarter, these strategic decisions accounted for about 140 basis points of the decline in vol/mix. For the full year, we expect these decisions to be about a 100-basis-point headwind to our organic growth, and as we've said before, this has been incorporated into our revenue guidance. Partially offsetting this headwind in Q1 is about a 50-basis-point benefit from the shift of Easter-related shipments into the first quarter.
Our Power Brands, which represent about 2/3 of our revenue, grew nearly 6%, led by Oreo, Tuc/Club Social and belVita biscuits, Lacta chocolate, Trident gum, Halls candy and Jacobs, Carte Noire and Tassimo coffee. Emerging markets were up nearly 11% with the BRIC countries up double digits. Developed markets were down 0.5%.
Turning now to our results by region. As you can see on Slide 6, Latin America and EEMEA, fueled by higher pricing, drove much of our overall growth. Latin America was up nearly 19%, driven by the inflationary economies in Venezuela and Argentina. Brazil was up nearly 10%, including a meaningful contribution from vol/mix and solid growth across all categories. 
EEMEA grew 11%, primarily due to pricing in Russia and Ukraine in response to the sharp devaluation of those currencies. Despite this, vol/mix was up in both countries and share performance was solid. Russia grew mid-teens, with strong growth in our 2 largest categories. Chocolate was up high teens behind Alpen Gold and coffee was up over 20%.
Asia Pacific grew modestly with solid gains in China and India. China was up high single digits, driven by strong performance of both Oreo and Stride gum. We continue to be encouraged by our progress. This is the third consecutive quarter of high single-digit growth there. Our team is executing well, and we're selectively investing to continue and hopefully accelerate our momentum.
India was up mid-single digits as Cadbury Dairy Milk's share topped 40%, its highest ever. However, chocolate price increases tempered consumer demand. We expect category and revenue growth in India to improve as the year progresses, not only as we increase A&C investments but also as consumers adjust to the industry-wide price increases implemented last year.
North America revenue declined modestly, largely due to a change in a large customer's in-store strategy that reduced merchandising and display opportunities. Although this led to a decline in the overall biscuits category and a modest decrease in our revenue, we grew our share, driven by strength in crackers. To accelerate revenue and category growth for the remainder of the year, we're stepping up marketing support behind our Power Brands and innovation platforms as well as increasing investments behind in-store execution.
Finally, Europe was down 0.6%, in line with our expectations. Frankly, we expect Europe's first half to be soft as the macro environment continues to be challenging. In addition, the strategic decisions to improve revenue mix that I mentioned earlier tempered Europe's volumes by about 200 basis points, which was only partially offset by a 60-point benefit due to the Easter shift. 
We've continued to experience some negative volume elasticity as a result of our decision to lead pricing to recover higher input costs, especially in chocolate. However, we expect this pressure to ease in the back half.
Turning now to our categories. For the quarter, snacks categories grew about 4.5% globally, up from the low 3s as we exited last year. Of course, the Easter shift helped boost growth rate somewhat. Including beverages, Cheese and Grocery, our categories edged closer to 5% growth.
Along with overall category growth modestly improving, our share performance began to stabilize, with 48% of our snacks revenues gaining or holding share in the quarter. That's up from 40% in 2014. In addition, compared to the softening trends we saw on the back half of last year, our share performance improved across almost all of our snacks categories.
The Biscuits category grew about 4%, down from 5% last year. Much of this slower growth came in North America and Europe. Our biscuits revenue grew in line with the category as we gained or held share in key markets, fueled by our Power Brands, which grew high single digits. 
For example, Oreo was up mid-teens, driven by innovation in China and distribution gains in Brazil and Europe; Tuc/Club Social grew more than 30%, with launches of new flavors and pack sizes in Brazil; belVita was up high single digits, with strong growth in the U.S. behind the continued success of belVita Bites; and in the U.K., with belVita tartine and crunchy.
Turning to Chocolate. The category grew 6.5%, aided by the Easter shift. Our sales only increased slightly more than 1%, with only about 35% of our revenue gaining or holding share. The softness was due primarily to our European business, which accounts for half of our Global Chocolate sales. We expected this, knowing that a significant portion of the decline would be due to our decision to discontinue some low-margin product lines, and that we'd continue to experience some volume elasticity and share losses because we led pricing. 
Although we expect continued share pressure in Q2, we're encouraged to see that most of our European competitors have now begun to raise prices. As a result, we expect our shares to strengthen in the back half of the year. In the meantime, we're selectively stepping up our marketing and promotional activity to narrow price gaps and regain share.
In emerging markets, chocolate revenue increased mid-single digits, and we gained or held share in our key markets. For example, in Brazil, our largest chocolate business in emerging markets, sales grew high single digits, and we increased share by about 1 point. 
In India, our second-largest emerging markets chocolate business, although the category slowed, revenue was up mid-single digits and we held share. And in Russia and South Africa, revenue was up mid- to high teens, holding share as well. 
Looking ahead, as price gaps narrow and we increase marketing support in the back half of the year, we expect Global Chocolate revenue growth in both developed and emerging markets to accelerate and our shares to rebound.
Turning to Gum & Candy. The category grew about 1.5% while our revenue was up nearly 6%. For the first time in a while, I'm pleased to see strong Gum growth. Like chocolate, our Gum results are a tale of 2 cities. Developed markets continued to be down mid-single digits, with share losses in France, Japan and the U.S. But in the emerging markets, Gum was up mid-teens, led by strong revenue and share performance in Brazil and China. 
To summarize, we're very pleased with our performance in the first quarter. We delivered solid revenue growth in a challenging environment and made good progress in stabilizing our shares. We're executing on our transformation agenda well, including aggressively reducing cost to expand margins and to provide the fuel to invest in our franchises to drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brian."
739693,290208262,797388,"Mondelez International, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2015",2015-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Mondelez International, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Building on what Irene just said, we're feeling confident about our execution, especially the strong progress we're making to drive down costs, expand margins and grow earnings per share. Starting with Slide 8, you",1230,"Thanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Building on what Irene just said, we're feeling confident about our execution, especially the strong progress we're making to drive down costs, expand margins and grow earnings per share. 
Starting with Slide 8, you can see that adjusted gross margin increased 90 basis points to 38%. Pricing, including the carryover benefit of actions taken in 2014, more than offset the increase in commodity- and currency-related cost inflation. This allowed strong net productivity of more than 3% of COGS or about $175 million to fall through.
Adjusted OI margin was up 160 basis points to 13.8%. Adjusted gross margin expansion accounted for more than half of the increase. The rest was driven by lower overheads as we continued to aggressively reduce expenses by leveraging our 0-based budgeting approach and other cost-saving tools.
Looking at margin performance by region. You can see that North America, Europe and Latin America drove our adjusted OI margin expansion. North America was up 400 basis points. More than half of this improvement was driven by strong net productivity, with the remainder largely due to lower overheads.
Europe was up 180 basis points as strong net productivity positively impacted adjusted gross margins. And Latin America increased 120 basis points, predominantly driven by overhead leverage. In contrast, EEMEA declined 240 basis points. The sudden and severe devaluation of Ukrainian and Russian currencies made it difficult to fully recover input cost inflation in the near term without sacrificing significant volume declines or share losses. 
As we exit the quarter, we're in a much better position with margins in these markets. We expect margin will improve as the year progresses as we continue to implement additional price increases to cover higher costs. 
In Asia Pacific, margin was down 30 basis points. While we improved gross margin and lowered overheads, the phaseout of a local tax incentive program offset underlying year-over-year operating margin improvement.
Turning to EPS on Slide 10. Adjusted EPS for the first quarter was $0.41, up nearly 26% on a constant-currency basis. The year-over-year improvement in our operating income accounted for $0.09 of this increase. Below the operating line, lower interest expense from our successful debt refinancing added $0.01 and lower outstanding shares added another $0.02. Also below the line, our effective tax rate was higher, driven mostly by the geographic mix of where our earnings were generated. The higher tax rate hurt our EPS by $0.02 versus last year. Even after accounting for the $0.08 negative impact of currency translation, adjusted EPS was up more than 5%.
On the next page, you'll see that we returned $1.75 billion of capital to our shareholders in the first quarter. We purchased $1.5 billion of stock. That represented 41.7 million shares at an average price of just under $36 as we front-loaded much of our buyback activity given the relatively attractive share price and our liquidity. 
Consistent with our outlook, we expect to buy back up to $2 billion of stock for the year. However, this doesn't include additional share repurchase activity related to the expected cash proceeds from the coffee deal in the second half. 
We also paid about $250 million in dividends. As we've previously stated, we intend to pay a modest dividend, with shareholder returns largely driven by EPS growth. Nonetheless, we're committed to maintaining a payout ratio of at least 30%. Today, our payout ratio is about 35%.
Turning to Slide 12. In the first quarter, we took advantage of an opportunity to refinance some of our higher-cost dollar debt into lower-coupon euro-, sterling- and Swiss franc-denominated notes. The weighted average rate for the $2.5 billion of U.S. dollar notes we tendered was about 6.2%. We financed the tender by issuing the equivalent of about $3.5 billion notes at very attractive rates, securing a weighted average coupon of 1.9%. 
As a result, we lowered the weighted average cost of our long-term debt by about 100 basis points to 3.6%. We also extended the average tenor of our long-term debt by nearly 1 year from about 7.5 to 8.5 years. For 2015, this lowers our total interest expense by $75 million to $100 million, depending upon how currency rates evolve for the year.
Now turning to our outlook for the year. Given our solid start, we're increasingly confident in our ability to deliver our 2015 outlook. With that said, we still have much to do as we execute our transformation. So in the near term, we want to be prudent and we're simply reaffirming our outlook for the year. 
We continue to expect organic revenue to grow at least 2%, including a headwind of about 100 basis points from the strategic decisions to improve revenue mix that we discussed earlier; we anticipate adjusted OI margin of approximately 14% and double-digit growth in adjusted EPS on a constant-currency basis; and we expect free cash flow, excluding items, to be approximately $1.2 billion. 
While our overall guidance for constant currency adjusted EPS has not changed, the makeup of the below-the-line items will be somewhat different. Due to our debt refinancing, our interest expense is likely to be around $750 million rather than the original guidance of around $825 million.
In addition, due to earnings mix, and consistent with what we saw in the first quarter, our effective tax rate is likely to be higher than we originally anticipated. Instead of an estimated tax rate in the high teens, we currently expect a rate in the low 20s. 
Of course, currency continues to be a significant and increasing headwind this year, given that 80% of our revenue is not tied to the U.S. dollar. Using April 27 spot rates, we anticipate that currency headwind would be about 12 percentage points for revenue versus our earlier estimate of 11 points. We also anticipate a $0.33 impact to adjusted EPS compared to our initial $0.30 estimate.
While the currency impact is significant, we believe our underlying performance and operations are solid. We remain confident in our ability to deliver strong constant-currency earnings growth and solid organic revenue growth this year.
One last point. Since we don't have the necessary regulatory approvals to know the precise closing date for the coffee JV, our 2015 outlook includes the full year results for the coffee business. Assuming a closing sometime in the third quarter, we'll likely update our 2015 outlook for the impact of the coffee transaction when we report our second quarter results.
So to wrap up, we've had a solid start to the year by focusing on what we can control as we prioritize margin expansion and strong constant-currency earnings growth while delivering solid revenue growth. We're making good progress on our transformation agenda. Our initiatives to focus our portfolio are on track, including the coffee JV. We're executing well against our cost reduction programs, and we're continuing to invest in our Power Brands, our supply chain and sales and distribution capabilities to drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth over the long term. 
As we anticipated, our market share performance has begun to stabilize. We expect it to improve in the second half as price gaps narrow and we continue to selectively increase marketing support and promotional programs. All of these actions have us well positioned to achieve our 2015 outlook and our 15% to 16% margin target for 2016. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

It'll take probably until the back half. And so in selected markets, we want to continue to make sure that we're protecting our market position.

So I think that's the big one. As I mentioned in my comments, I think we were a bit ahead in terms of executing in a couple areas. One is supply chain, and some of the reinvention activities helped contribute to that productivity. I think some of that's timing and executing a bit earlier, which helps. And then on overheads. We slightly beat our targets for overhead reductions. And that's really as ZBB is playing out and our visibility and transparency to spending and moving the culture from a -- to more cost-conscious culture, I think, is paying dividends for us. So those are the things, I think, that give us a little bit of tailwind in the quarter. And again, as we talked about, I think the supply chain reinvention is, clearly, a second half impact that we still expect to see. We maybe pulled a little bit of that into the first part of the year, which is great, but there'll be more to come in the second half."

We're very pleased to see that the snacks business in particular is up around 4.5%, which is a trend change from the end of last year. But I think you also need to get underneath the covers a little bit on that number. A big driver of that 4.5% improvement was the 6.5% growth in Chocolate, which is largely price-driven, as we've said, also benefited somewhat from the Easter shift. So the good news is we are starting to see pricing coming through, and that's critical to our overall algorithm, as we've said. Vol/mix is still soft and we're taking some actions in the coming months and quarters to make sure that we start to see our shares rebound.

We've continued to make good progress in a challenging environment by focusing on what we can control. This includes executing our transformation agenda, prioritizing margin expansion and strong constant-currency earnings growth while delivering solid revenue growth. 
Specifically, organic net revenue grew 3.8%, driven by pricing actions to recover currency-driven input cost increases. We significantly expanded adjusted operating income margin, up 160 basis points to 13.8%. Importantly, adjusted gross margin contributed more than half of the increase while lower overheads contributed the rest. Adjusted EPS was $0.41, up nearly 26% on a constant-currency basis, driven almost entirely by operating gains. 
As we discussed at CAGNY, we're executing 3 transformation priorities that will further leverage our advantaged portfolio and geographic footprint while setting us up to deliver top-tier financial performance as global demand improves. 
Let me give you a quick update on each of our transformation initiatives: to further focus our portfolio on snacks, to reduce our supply chain and overhead costs and to continue investing for growth. 
On the portfolio front, we expect our Jacobs Douwe Egberts coffee joint venture to close this year, likely in the third quarter. We're working to secure the necessary regulatory approvals from the European Commission and are awaiting the results of the phase 2 review. 
We anticipate closing our acquisition of Kinh Do's biscuit business in Vietnam around midyear and are looking forward to leveraging the growth opportunities of this attractive business. With about $175 million in sales, Kinh Do is one of the largest snack companies in Vietnam, with iconic brands and leading positions in biscuits and moon cakes. Going forward, we intend to accelerate its growth by introducing our power brands into its distribution network, which covers 130,000 outlets. 
We also welcomed Enjoy Life Foods into our family last quarter. While starting from a relatively small revenue base, the company provides us with an excellent platform for future growth. We're very excited about the opportunity to leverage its strong brands and market position in fast-growing better-for-you allergen-free snacks.
Turning to our cost reduction programs. We're continuing to make good progress across our supply chain and in overheads. Net productivity in the quarter was very strong at more than 3% of cost of goods sold, building on the record rate of 2.8% we delivered last year. These productivity gains were instrumental in driving our 90-basis-point improvement in adjusted gross margin. 
We're complementing these supply chain savings by aggressively managing overheads, leveraging the 0-based budgeting process we began about 18 months ago. This includes reducing indirect expenses as well as streamlining infrastructure and internal processes. In fact, we've already begun to migrate some transactional processes to our new global shared service centers. As a result, we continue to reduce overheads as a percent of revenue. 
Of course, these savings not only enable us to expand margins, but they also provide the fuel to invest in growth. As we highlighted at CAGNY, this includes investing in new advantaged assets as part of our supply chain reinvention. 
For example, our biscuit plant in Salinas, Mexico, opened on schedule in the fourth quarter. By the end of the first half, we'll have 5 new lines up and running to support growth and repatriate volume that's currently co-manufactured. As you'll recall, each of these new lines gives us a 1,000-point margin increase over existing assets. 
We're also bringing on stream advantaged Lines of the Future at other facilities around the world, in emerging markets like India and China as well as in Europe and the U.S. Each of these state-of-the-art lines has operating costs that are about half as much as our current lines and runs twice as fast while taking up only a fraction of the floor space. 
We've also continued to invest in working media to strengthen our brand equities, backstop our pricing and support innovation. Total advertising and consumer spending was essentially flat on a constant-currency basis as we maintained marketing support, particularly on our Power Brands. 
That said, as a percent of revenue, A&C was down slightly as we continued to drive efficiencies in nonworking media, moved more advertising to lower-cost digital channels and shifted the timing of certain marketing programs. For the remainder of the year, we expect A&C to rise modestly as we invest behind new product launches and marketing programs to drive revenue and improve share.
Let's take a more detailed look at our top line results for the quarter. As you can see on Slide 5, organic net revenue grew 3.8%, with pricing contributing 6.5 percentage points. Consistent with our strategy, we've raised prices to recover higher input costs, including the impact of currency. As we've discussed previously, this protects profits and enables us to continue to invest in our people and in our key growth drivers: our brands, innovation platforms, sales and distribution capabilities and supply chain.
It's important to note that in the first quarter, a significant contributor to the increase in price was the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken last year. Of course, rising prices, especially when the increases are significant, typically have a short-term impact on consumer demand. In Q1, vol/mix was down 2.7 percentage points due in part to elasticity. 
As we discussed in our earnings call last quarter, we're also experiencing the impact of some strategic decisions to improve revenue mix. These include: discontinuing some low-margin, customer-specific product lines, especially in Europe; exiting low-margin products associated with short-term brand licenses from Kraft Foods; and ongoing SKU simplification. In the quarter, these strategic decisions accounted for about 140 basis points of the decline in vol/mix. For the full year, we expect these decisions to be about a 100-basis-point headwind to our organic growth, and as we've said before, this has been incorporated into our revenue guidance. Partially offsetting this headwind in Q1 is about a 50-basis-point benefit from the shift of Easter-related shipments into the first quarter.
Our Power Brands, which represent about 2/3 of our revenue, grew nearly 6%, led by Oreo, Tuc/Club Social and belVita biscuits, Lacta chocolate, Trident gum, Halls candy and Jacobs, Carte Noire and Tassimo coffee. Emerging markets were up nearly 11% with the BRIC countries up double digits. Developed markets were down 0.5%.
Turning now to our results by region. As you can see on Slide 6, Latin America and EEMEA, fueled by higher pricing, drove much of our overall growth. Latin America was up nearly 19%, driven by the inflationary economies in Venezuela and Argentina. Brazil was up nearly 10%, including a meaningful contribution from vol/mix and solid growth across all categories. 
EEMEA grew 11%, primarily due to pricing in Russia and Ukraine in response to the sharp devaluation of those currencies. Despite this, vol/mix was up in both countries and share performance was solid. Russia grew mid-teens, with strong growth in our 2 largest categories. Chocolate was up high teens behind Alpen Gold and coffee was up over 20%.
Asia Pacific grew modestly with solid gains in China and India. China was up high single digits, driven by strong performance of both Oreo and Stride gum. We continue to be encouraged by our progress. This is the third consecutive quarter of high single-digit growth there. Our team is executing well, and we're selectively investing to continue and hopefully accelerate our momentum.
India was up mid-single digits as Cadbury Dairy Milk's share topped 40%, its highest ever. However, chocolate price increases tempered consumer demand. We expect category and revenue growth in India to improve as the year progresses, not only as we increase A&C investments but also as consumers adjust to the industry-wide price increases implemented last year.
North America revenue declined modestly, largely due to a change in a large customer's in-store strategy that reduced merchandising and display opportunities. Although this led to a decline in the overall biscuits category and a modest decrease in our revenue, we grew our share, driven by strength in crackers. To accelerate revenue and category growth for the remainder of the year, we're stepping up marketing support behind our Power Brands and innovation platforms as well as increasing investments behind in-store execution.
Finally, Europe was down 0.6%, in line with our expectations. Frankly, we expect Europe's first half to be soft as the macro environment continues to be challenging. In addition, the strategic decisions to improve revenue mix that I mentioned earlier tempered Europe's volumes by about 200 basis points, which was only partially offset by a 60-point benefit due to the Easter shift. 
We've continued to experience some negative volume elasticity as a result of our decision to lead pricing to recover higher input costs, especially in chocolate. However, we expect this pressure to ease in the back half.
Turning now to our categories. For the quarter, snacks categories grew about 4.5% globally, up from the low 3s as we exited last year. Of course, the Easter shift helped boost growth rate somewhat. Including beverages, Cheese and Grocery, our categories edged closer to 5% growth.
Along with overall category growth modestly improving, our share performance began to stabilize, with 48% of our snacks revenues gaining or holding share in the quarter. That's up from 40% in 2014. In addition, compared to the softening trends we saw on the back half of last year, our share performance improved across almost all of our snacks categories.
The Biscuits category grew about 4%, down from 5% last year. Much of this slower growth came in North America and Europe. Our biscuits revenue grew in line with the category as we gained or held share in key markets, fueled by our Power Brands, which grew high single digits. 
For example, Oreo was up mid-teens, driven by innovation in China and distribution gains in Brazil and Europe; Tuc/Club Social grew more than 30%, with launches of new flavors and pack sizes in Brazil; belVita was up high single digits, with strong growth in the U.S. behind the continued success of belVita Bites; and in the U.K., with belVita tartine and crunchy.
Turning to Chocolate. The category grew 6.5%, aided by the Easter shift. Our sales only increased slightly more than 1%, with only about 35% of our revenue gaining or holding share. The softness was due primarily to our European business, which accounts for half of our Global Chocolate sales. We expected this, knowing that a significant portion of the decline would be due to our decision to discontinue some low-margin product lines, and that we'd continue to experience some volume elasticity and share losses because we led pricing. 
Although we expect continued share pressure in Q2, we're encouraged to see that most of our European competitors have now begun to raise prices. As a result, we expect our shares to strengthen in the back half of the year. In the meantime, we're selectively stepping up our marketing and promotional activity to narrow price gaps and regain share.
In emerging markets, chocolate revenue increased mid-single digits, and we gained or held share in our key markets. For example, in Brazil, our largest chocolate business in emerging markets, sales grew high single digits, and we increased share by about 1 point. 
In India, our second-largest emerging markets chocolate business, although the category slowed, revenue was up mid-single digits and we held share. And in Russia and South Africa, revenue was up mid- to high teens, holding share as well. 
Looking ahead, as price gaps narrow and we increase marketing support in the back half of the year, we expect Global Chocolate revenue growth in both developed and emerging markets to accelerate and our shares to rebound.
Turning to Gum & Candy. The category grew about 1.5% while our revenue was up nearly 6%. For the first time in a while, I'm pleased to see strong Gum growth. Like chocolate, our Gum results are a tale of 2 cities. Developed markets continued to be down mid-single digits, with share losses in France, Japan and the U.S. But in the emerging markets, Gum was up mid-teens, led by strong revenue and share performance in Brazil and China. 
To summarize, we're very pleased with our performance in the first quarter. We delivered solid revenue growth in a challenging environment and made good progress in stabilizing our shares. We're executing on our transformation agenda well, including aggressively reducing cost to expand margins and to provide the fuel to invest in our franchises to drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brian."

Good morning, everyone. Building on what Irene just said, we're feeling confident about our execution, especially the strong progress we're making to drive down costs, expand margins and grow earnings per share. Starting with Slide 8, you",1230,"Thanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Building on what Irene just said, we're feeling confident about our execution, especially the strong progress we're making to drive down costs, expand margins and grow earnings per share. 
Starting with Slide 8, you can see that adjusted gross margin increased 90 basis points to 38%. Pricing, including the carryover benefit of actions taken in 2014, more than offset the increase in commodity- and currency-related cost inflation. This allowed strong net productivity of more than 3% of COGS or about $175 million to fall through.
Adjusted OI margin was up 160 basis points to 13.8%. Adjusted gross margin expansion accounted for more than half of the increase. The rest was driven by lower overheads as we continued to aggressively reduce expenses by leveraging our 0-based budgeting approach and other cost-saving tools.
Looking at margin performance by region. You can see that North America, Europe and Latin America drove our adjusted OI margin expansion. North America was up 400 basis points. More than half of this improvement was driven by strong net productivity, with the remainder largely due to lower overheads.
Europe was up 180 basis points as strong net productivity positively impacted adjusted gross margins. And Latin America increased 120 basis points, predominantly driven by overhead leverage. In contrast, EEMEA declined 240 basis points. The sudden and severe devaluation of Ukrainian and Russian currencies made it difficult to fully recover input cost inflation in the near term without sacrificing significant volume declines or share losses. 
As we exit the quarter, we're in a much better position with margins in these markets. We expect margin will improve as the year progresses as we continue to implement additional price increases to cover higher costs. 
In Asia Pacific, margin was down 30 basis points. While we improved gross margin and lowered overheads, the phaseout of a local tax incentive program offset underlying year-over-year operating margin improvement.
Turning to EPS on Slide 10. Adjusted EPS for the first quarter was $0.41, up nearly 26% on a constant-currency basis. The year-over-year improvement in our operating income accounted for $0.09 of this increase. Below the operating line, lower interest expense from our successful debt refinancing added $0.01 and lower outstanding shares added another $0.02. Also below the line, our effective tax rate was higher, driven mostly by the geographic mix of where our earnings were generated. The higher tax rate hurt our EPS by $0.02 versus last year. Even after accounting for the $0.08 negative impact of currency translation, adjusted EPS was up more than 5%.
On the next page, you'll see that we returned $1.75 billion of capital to our shareholders in the first quarter. We purchased $1.5 billion of stock. That represented 41.7 million shares at an average price of just under $36 as we front-loaded much of our buyback activity given the relatively attractive share price and our liquidity. 
Consistent with our outlook, we expect to buy back up to $2 billion of stock for the year. However, this doesn't include additional share repurchase activity related to the expected cash proceeds from the coffee deal in the second half. 
We also paid about $250 million in dividends. As we've previously stated, we intend to pay a modest dividend, with shareholder returns largely driven by EPS growth. Nonetheless, we're committed to maintaining a payout ratio of at least 30%. Today, our payout ratio is about 35%.
Turning to Slide 12. In the first quarter, we took advantage of an opportunity to refinance some of our higher-cost dollar debt into lower-coupon euro-, sterling- and Swiss franc-denominated notes. The weighted average rate for the $2.5 billion of U.S. dollar notes we tendered was about 6.2%. We financed the tender by issuing the equivalent of about $3.5 billion notes at very attractive rates, securing a weighted average coupon of 1.9%. 
As a result, we lowered the weighted average cost of our long-term debt by about 100 basis points to 3.6%. We also extended the average tenor of our long-term debt by nearly 1 year from about 7.5 to 8.5 years. For 2015, this lowers our total interest expense by $75 million to $100 million, depending upon how currency rates evolve for the year.
Now turning to our outlook for the year. Given our solid start, we're increasingly confident in our ability to deliver our 2015 outlook. With that said, we still have much to do as we execute our transformation. So in the near term, we want to be prudent and we're simply reaffirming our outlook for the year. 
We continue to expect organic revenue to grow at least 2%, including a headwind of about 100 basis points from the strategic decisions to improve revenue mix that we discussed earlier; we anticipate adjusted OI margin of approximately 14% and double-digit growth in adjusted EPS on a constant-currency basis; and we expect free cash flow, excluding items, to be approximately $1.2 billion. 
While our overall guidance for constant currency adjusted EPS has not changed, the makeup of the below-the-line items will be somewhat different. Due to our debt refinancing, our interest expense is likely to be around $750 million rather than the original guidance of around $825 million.
In addition, due to earnings mix, and consistent with what we saw in the first quarter, our effective tax rate is likely to be higher than we originally anticipated. Instead of an estimated tax rate in the high teens, we currently expect a rate in the low 20s. 
Of course, currency continues to be a significant and increasing headwind this year, given that 80% of our revenue is not tied to the U.S. dollar. Using April 27 spot rates, we anticipate that currency headwind would be about 12 percentage points for revenue versus our earlier estimate of 11 points. We also anticipate a $0.33 impact to adjusted EPS compared to our initial $0.30 estimate.
While the currency impact is significant, we believe our underlying performance and operations are solid. We remain confident in our ability to deliver strong constant-currency earnings growth and solid organic revenue growth this year.
One last point. Since we don't have the necessary regulatory approvals to know the precise closing date for the coffee JV, our 2015 outlook includes the full year results for the coffee business. Assuming a closing sometime in the third quarter, we'll likely update our 2015 outlook for the impact of the coffee transaction when we report our second quarter results.
So to wrap up, we've had a solid start to the year by focusing on what we can control as we prioritize margin expansion and strong constant-currency earnings growth while delivering solid revenue growth. We're making good progress on our transformation agenda. Our initiatives to focus our portfolio are on track, including the coffee JV. We're executing well against our cost reduction programs, and we're continuing to invest in our Power Brands, our supply chain and sales and distribution capabilities to drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth over the long term. 
As we anticipated, our market share performance has begun to stabilize. We expect it to improve in the second half as price gaps narrow and we continue to selectively increase marketing support and promotional programs. All of these actions have us well positioned to achieve our 2015 outlook and our 15% to 16% margin target for 2016. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

So I think that's the big one. As I mentioned in my comments, I think we were a bit ahead in terms of executing in a couple areas. One is supply chain, and some of the reinvention activities helped contribute to that productivity. I think some of that's timing and executing a bit earlier, which helps. And then on overheads. We slightly beat our targets for overhead reductions. And that's really as ZBB is playing out and our visibility and transparency to spending and moving the culture from a -- to a more cost-conscious culture, I think, is paying dividends for us. So those are the things, I think, that give us a little bit of tailwind in the quarter. And again, as we talked about, I think the supply chain reinvention is, clearly, a second half impact that we still expect to see. We maybe pulled a little bit of that into the first part of the year, which is great, but there'll be more to come in the second half."

I think, actually, we're not bucking the trend. We actually led that trend. If you recall, about 1.5 years ago, we ran into some real challenges as we saw demands slowing down quite rapidly, and our inventories were not keeping pace with that. So we -- as we've talked about it, we implemented a number of management tools and measurement tools to ensure that we had a good handle on sell-in and sellout, and that's serving us exceptionally well. So I think, in many respects, we were ahead of that curve, and we've now got that behind us. I'm particularly pleased, though, with the resurgence of the biscuit business, which is a critically important business for us. Oreo had a very strong quarter and is a strong contributor to the overall biscuit performance. And Gum just continues to be on fire. And so net-net, I think our Chinese business, we learned a lot in the early days as we observed what happens when consumption slows down. I think we've got a much better balance between sell-in and sellout. And the team is executing well, and I'm extremely pleased with their performance. So we're cautiously optimistic, but the continued performance of the biscuit category is important to us."

But I think you also need to get underneath the covers a little bit on that number. A big driver of that 4.5% improvement was the 6.5% growth in Chocolate, which is largely price-driven, as we've said, also benefited somewhat from the Easter shift.

But it looks like in the first quarter, right, you bought back the $1.5 billion in shares. Part of that, you could argue, was funded by the proceeds that you got from the currency hedges off the coffee divestiture. Without that, it might -- you maybe have to raise more debt to buy back the stock or what -- or not buy back as much. So I'm just curious, when the -- when you announced the coffee JV, the euro was like close to $1.40. Now current market, it's around $1.11. So it seemed like, and I think you put this within the footnotes of the release, it seems like the cash proceeds now you would receive on a dollar basis are less, which could potentially mean that you would be able to buy back less stock with those proceeds. But at the same time, you're buying back more stock in Q1 off of the benefit of this currency hedge. So it would seem like, I guess, the question is, is it fair to say that maybe some of that accretion, just off of the shift in the euro, has already occurred?"

Specifically, organi",1782,"Thanks, Dexter. Good morning. We had a strong second quarter. We built on our momentum from the start of the year, continuing to drive top-tier margin expansion and earnings growth while also delivering solid organic revenue growth. 
Specifically, organic revenue grew 4.3%, led by pricing actions to recover commodity and currency-driven input costs. Adjusted gross margin increased 330 basis points to 40.2%, driven by record net productivity as well as a 150 basis point benefit from mark-to-market of commodity and currency hedging contracts. 
We expanded adjusted operating income margin by 270 basis points to 15.2% while significantly increasing advertising and consumer support. And adjusted EPS was $0.47, up nearly 38% on a constant currency basis. Our strong year-to-date results reflect clear progress in the execution of our transformation agenda. Earlier this month, we closed 2 deals that will enable us to focus even more keenly on snacks. We combined our global coffee business with D.E Master Blenders, and we acquired the Kinh Do snacks business in Vietnam. 
On the cost front, we drove record net profitability in our supply chain and continued to reduce overhead as a percentage of revenue, driven by strong execution of our 0-based budgeting initiative. While continuing to improve profitability, we've also begun to stage the business for accelerated growth. In addition to significantly increasing advertising and consumer support, we brought more of our state-of-the-art production lines onstream to drive the growth of our Power Brands and innovation platforms.
Our updated outlook for 2015 reflects the strong year-to-date performance of our ongoing business as well as the continued progress on our transformation agenda. These solid results have enabled us to essentially offset the expected dilution related to the coffee transaction, including the near-term impact of stranded overhead costs. As a result, we're increasingly confident in our ability to deliver a 2016 adjusted operating income margin of 15% to 16%. 
Before jumping into the specifics of our Q2 performance, let me provide an update on our 2 recent portfolio actions. Earlier this month, we closed our deal to combine our coffee business with D.E Master Blenders, creating Jacobs Douwe Egberts, the world's leading pure-play coffee company. The company has revenues of more than EUR 5 billion and market-leading positions in over 18 countries across Europe, Latin America and Australia, as well as a strong emerging market presence. 
JDE owns some of the world's leading coffee brands, including Jacobs and Tassimo as well as Moccona, Douwe Egberts and Pilao. With greater focus and increased scale, JDE will be able to capitalize on the global growth opportunities in coffee and invest more heavily in innovation, manufacturing and market development. 
At closing, we received cash of EUR 3.8 billion and a 43.5% interest in the new joint venture. These amounts are down somewhat versus previous estimates because we retained our interest in our Korea-based joint venture, Dongsuh Foods Corporation. Since we continue to hold that position, this doesn't affect the overall economics of the JDE deal. 
As previously stated, we'll use a majority of the cash proceeds to buy back shares. We now anticipate the transaction will be EPS neutral to slightly accretive in 2016, reflecting fewer-than-expected shares repurchased due to the increase in our stock price as well as JDE's expected divestitures to satisfy European regulators.
2 weeks ago, we also completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in the Kinh Do snacks business in Vietnam. In addition to leveraging Kinh Do's iconic brands and leading positions in biscuits and moon cakes, we'll invest to introduce our Power Brands into their broad distribution network covering 130,000 outlets. 
With the completion of the coffee transaction, on a pro forma basis, snacks now represent nearly 85% of our revenue, up from 75%. This will enable us to further optimize our capital allocation and focus on accelerating the growth of our key franchises. 
As you can see on Slide 7, biscuits and chocolate now make up nearly 70% of our revenue, with Gum & Candy at about 15%. Post-coffee, our beverages segment is now composed entirely of Powdered Beverages and will represent about 6% of revenue. Finally, Cheese and Grocery is about 10% of sales, with a little less than half of the business in Europe.
So let's turn to our Q2 performance. We delivered organic revenue growth of 4.3%. Similar to the first quarter, higher pricing drove our top line growth as we raised prices to recover higher input costs, including the impact of currency. As we've discussed before, this protects profits and enables us to continue to invest in our brands and innovation platforms. 
As expected, vol/mix continued to be soft due to elasticity as well as the impact of a number of strategic decisions we took to improve revenue mix. In aggregate, these strategic decisions were a 60 basis point drag on vol/mix in Q2, and for the full year, we expect them to be a 100 basis point headwind. 
In addition, the shift of Easter-related shipments into Q1 had a negative impact of about 50 basis points. Finally, to complete our revenue profile, Power Brands grew more than 6.5%. Emerging markets were up nearly 10% with the BRIC countries also up about 10%. Finally, developed markets grew nearly 1 point.
Turning now to our results by region. Latin America was up nearly 20%, driven by the inflationary economies in Venezuela and Argentina. Brazil was up low single digits as we priced to recover the inflation impact of a weaker real on input costs. In addition, Brazil slowed sequentially as the weak macroenvironment led to a significant deceleration in our categories. 
As you know, the Brazilian economy has been soft for some time. As a result, we've been closely monitoring and managing inventory levels so that we have no significant destocking surprises. We're pleased that our shares have held up well and will continue to make the appropriate investments to drive further share gains. That said, Brazil's slowdown is an area we'll continue to watch closely in the second half as we don't see any short-term catalysts for category improvement.
Our EEMEA region grew 7%. As in the first quarter, this was primarily due to pricing. Our momentum in Russia continued, with revenue up more than 20%. This growth was driven by pricing in response to the sharp devaluation of the ruble. Despite significantly higher prices however, vol/mix was flat as we increased brand support and expanded distribution. Performance was strong across all categories. 
Asia Pacific was up 3%. We were pleased with the performance in China, where growth accelerated to more than 20% behind strong execution in both biscuits and gum. India revenue growth was soft due to continued price elasticity in chocolate. India is another market that we're watching closely as we move through the second half. We're keeping a sharp eye on inventory levels as we increase A&C investment to help accelerate category growth.
In North America, revenue grew modestly behind improved biscuits growth in the U.S. We expect improved revenue growth in the second half as increased A&C and our new low-cost capacity comes online. Europe was also up modestly. Coffee posted strong growth as we increased trade inventories to ensure a smooth transition to JDE. As expected, however, Europe's ongoing business remains soft. Similar to Q1, vol/mix was pressured as strategic decisions to improve revenue mix tempered Europe's volumes especially in chocolate, while the Easter shift also created a 60 basis point headwind.
In addition, chocolate continued to be affected by negative volume elasticity as competitive pricing actions announced earlier in the year are not yet fully reflected on shelf. We anticipate revenue trends in Europe will improve in the second half as price gaps narrow and as our brands benefit from increased A&C support.
Turning to our categories. Year-to-date, our snacks categories grew about 4.5% globally. Including beverages and cream cheese, our categories were up more than 5%. Our organic growth was about 1 point below that, again reflecting the impact of our strategic decisions to improve revenue mix.
While our financial results in the first half were strong, our year-to-date share performance is not where we want it to be. Only 45% of our revenue gained or held share, reflecting some sizable price gaps remaining in our categories, especially chocolate. 
Let's take a closer look at each category. The biscuits category grew more than 5.5% year-to-date. Our biscuits revenue growth was solid, up nearly 5%, with strong performances in China, Brazil and Russia. Share performance was also strong, with nearly 2/3 of revenue gaining or holding, including increases in both cookies and crackers in the U.S. Finally, Power Brands grew high single digits year-to-date, led by continued strength from Oreo, Tuc/Club Social and Barni.
Turning to chocolate. The category grew nearly 5% year-to-date while our revenue was up only modestly. This was largely due to our performance in Europe, which accounts for about half of our Global Chocolate revenue. This also affected our share, with only about 25% of revenue gaining or holding. 
Although we typically don't cite short-term data, we are seeing some green shoots in our most recent share performance, reflecting the benefit of selected A&C increases as well as narrowing price gaps. In the U.K. for example, we captured more than 2 share points in the most recent 4-week period. And in Germany, excluding the impact of some strategic decisions to exit low-margin revenue, we increased share through higher marketing support and selective trade investments. 
In emerging markets, our year-to-date chocolate revenue was up mid-single digits. In Russia, chocolate growth was strong, largely due to currency-driven price increases as vol/mix was up as well. Share performance was also strong. In Brazil, year-to-date revenue growth has been solid and we continue to gain share, although as I mentioned earlier, the category slowed in Q2 in response to the macroenvironment.
In India, chocolate revenue was soft as consumers have been slow to adapt to the higher prices we implemented last year. In each of our key chocolate markets, we expect revenue growth and share performance to continue to improve in the second half as price gaps narrow further and as we step up A&C investments.
Finally, in Gum & Candy, the category was up less than 2% year-to-date but our revenue increased over 6.5%, with both Gum & Candy up mid-single digits, fueled by the launch of Trident in China and by strong growth in the U.S. In sum, we're pleased with our solid top line growth in the quarter and with the early indicators of share improvement in response to increased A&C support. 
Let me now turn it over to Brian to provide an update on our margin expansion and earnings growth."

Starting",2079,"Thanks, Irene, and good morning. As Irene highlighted, our Q2 results again demonstrate our ability to execute across multiple fronts of our transformation agenda, with great results in reducing costs, expanding margins and investing in growth. 
Starting with Slide 11. You can see that adjusted gross margin increased 330 basis points in the second quarter to more than 40%. Productivity drove more than half of the improvement, continuing our momentum from the first quarter and the second half of last year. In the quarter, we delivered strong net productivity of more than 3% of COGS or about $175 million, which continues to be a record level of productivity for us and benchmarks well versus peers.
In addition, mark-to-market contributed 150 basis points to the margin expansion as we adjusted the value of our currency and commodity positions that don't qualify for hedge accounting. Adjusted OI margin was up 270 basis points to 15.2%. We took the opportunity to reinvest a portion of the cost savings into additional A&C spending to support top line growth and market shares.
As a result, A&C spending in the quarter grew double digits on a constant currency basis, up 60 basis points as a percentage of revenue to more than 9%. Consistent with our plans to deliver both top-tier revenue growth and margin expansion, we'll continue to invest some of the additional cost savings into high ROI initiatives. As a result, we expect A&C spending to continue to increase as a percentage of revenue in the second half. We'll talk more about this when we present at the Back to School Conference in early September.
As you can see on Slide 12, we expanded adjusted OI margins in all but 1 region. North America's margin was up modestly as we reinvested some of the productivity and overhead savings into higher marketing and merchandising support. Margins in Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific were up sharply, driven by strong productivity and overhead leverage, which also fueled increased A&C spending in these regions. 
In EEMEA, adjusted OI margin was down 120 basis points as we continued to price to recover currency-driven input cost inflation in Russia and Ukraine. Considering the massive dislocation we saw in these markets in the first months of the year, we've made solid progress here in rebuilding our margins.
Adjusted EPS was $0.47 per share, up nearly 38% on a constant currency basis. Operating gains accounted for $0.06 of the increase despite the impact of approximately $0.04 of higher A&C spending. The year-over-year change in mark-to-market accounting accounted for the other $0.06.
Below the operating line, lower interest expense and outstanding shares each added $0.02 while a higher tax rate was $0.01 drag. After accounting for the $0.08 currency headwind, adjusted EPS was still up more than 17%.
On Slide 14, you can see that we returned $2.7 billion of capital to our shareholders in the first half. We purchased $2.2 billion of stock, more than 58 million shares at an average price of a little more than $37 a share. This increased level of buyback reflects our ability to pool in a substantial portion of our planned buyback related to the coffee proceeds as we leverage the hedge gains of about $1 billion related to the transaction.
In addition, we increased our share repurchase authorization program by $6 billion to a total of $13.7 billion and extended the expiration by 2 years through 2018. As a result, we can purchase up to $6.9 billion of stock over the next 3.5 years.
We also paid nearly $500 million in dividends in the first half. In addition, last week, we announced a 13% increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $0.17 a share, reflecting our continued confidence in delivering on our long-term commitments.
Let's turn to our outlook for the year. Now that the coffee transaction's complete, we'll give you a sense for what to expect for the remainder of the year. As you've seen through the first half, our ongoing business has been performing above our previous outlook. In our updated outlook, we continue that momentum. 
There are several moving parts and we provided on Slide 15 the key elements of our outlook. To help you determine the appropriate comparative historical financial results to use, earlier today, we issued an 8-K with pro forma adjusted financials by quarter for 2014 and the first half of 2015. The adjustments primarily involve moving our higher-margin coffee business out of our reported operating income and reclassifying the after-tax income to below OI using the equity method. This is also how we'll record our portion of the after-tax earnings from JDE going forward.
Let's start with our revenue outlook. For the second half, we expect organic growth of at least 3% versus a second half 2014 revenue base of $15.2 billion, which excludes coffee. This target reflects the underlying momentum of our ongoing business, which was up 3.2% in the first half. So for the full year, this implies organic growth of at least 3%. That's up from our previous target of at least 2%, which included coffee for the full year. On an apples-to-apples basis, this is an increase in our revenue guidance.
In addition, we expect a better balance between price and vol/mix in the second half as price gaps narrow, as our share performance improves, as we increase our A&C spending and as we lap the impact of our strategic decisions to exit lower-margin businesses.
Currency, however, will continue to be a sizable headwind. Based on current spot rates, especially with the continued weakening of the euro, we estimate currency will have a negative impact of approximately 11 percentage points in the second half.
Turning to margin. In the second half, we expect to deliver adjusted OI margin of at least 14% despite stepping up A&C spending and absorbing a number of headwinds related to the coffee divestiture. That's up from 12.6% in the second half of last year. On an apples-to-apples basis, this reflects a margin upside for our ongoing business, which offsets both the coffee impacts and higher A&C investment. 
As I said earlier, we're making good progress in building sustainable momentum in the execution of our supply chain reinvention program and in reducing overheads. Through the first 6 months, we've delivered strong net productivity even before realizing any meaningful benefits from the new state-of-the-art assets that are now coming on stream. 
As Daniel Myers discussed at CAGNY, in addition to the 4 lines that are up and running now in our Salinas, Mexico biscuit facility, in the coming months, we have new high-speed and lower-cost production lines being installed in the U.S, in Europe, in India, China and in other markets. As expected, we should begin to see the benefits from these new lines in the second half. And yesterday, we announced a $130 million investment to install an additional 4 biscuit lines in Salinas, replacing 9 older inefficient lines in our Chicago biscuit plant. We expect these new lines to be onstream in mid-2016.
In terms of overhead cost as a percentage of revenue are also down in the first half. In fact, in each of the indirect cost packages we highlighted at CAGNY, we're delivering savings that are on or better than target, and so we're increasing our cost reduction expectations. We're also on track with respect to our migration to global shared services, which will simplify and streamline our back-office processes and better leverage our scale. Our shared services initiatives will begin to provide savings next year.
Cost reductions in our ongoing business will more than offset the dilutive impacts of 3 items surrounding the coffee deal. First, the coffee business we divested has a higher margin than our ongoing business. In 2014, the coffee business had an adjusted OI margin of approximately 17% versus about 13% for the total company. 
Second, the divestiture results in some stranded overheads. While the dilutive effect of stranded costs will be more pronounced in the third quarter, this impact is temporary. We expect to fully offset the impacts with additional cost reductions by the end of the year. 
Third and in conjunction with the creation of the coffee JV, we've reclassified after-tax income related to joint ventures in which we have a minority interest from above operating income to below the line to be consistent with how we account for equity earnings from JDE. The largest of these is our Korean coffee-related JV. Together, these 3 items are expected to pressure margins in the second half by 75 to 100 basis points.
Despite these margin impacts from the transaction, we continue to expect adjusted OI margin to expand significantly for the full year. From a pro forma adjusted margin of 12% in 2014, we expect to deliver pro forma adjusted OI margin of approximately 14% in 2015, excluding a temporary negative impact of 20 to 30 basis points from stranded costs. Importantly, with momentum from our supply chain and overhead cost savings programs, we're increasingly confident in our ability to deliver adjusted OI margin of 15% to 16% in 2016.
Now turning to EPS. We continue to expect to deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth on a constant currency basis for the full year versus the 2014 adjusted EPS baseline of $1.75. The margin expansion in our ongoing business is anticipated to drive the bulk of the increase, while lower interest expense and a lower share count are also expected to provide some benefit. 
These benefits will be partially offset by the dilution related to the coffee divestiture. We do expect our year-over-year margin and EPS growth to be more fourth quarter weighted, given that in Q3, we'll have a more pronounced impact from stranded costs, from frontloading A&C spending and from an expected year-over-year mark-to-market headwind. 
Our currency headwind estimate for the year is unchanged at $0.33. With respect to JDE, to estimate our total adjusted EPS, you'll need to be able to estimate the JV's net income. However, since it's a private company that we don't control, disclosure regarding its financial results will be somewhat limited. On Slide 20, we've provided a framework for JDE's income statement. 
Now looking at how we'll use the cash proceeds from the coffee deal. At closing, we received EUR 3.8 billion of cash, which we hedged at the time of the agreement in May 2014. So effectively, we received approximately $5.2 billion. We're returning about $2.9 billion via increased share buybacks, about $900 million which we pulled into the first half of the year. We'll deploy the remaining $2 billion over the next 12 months. 
We'll use approximately $1.6 billion to pay down commercial paper, and we'll use the remaining $700 million for other corporate purposes, including funding the Kinh Do deal. For your convenience, we've summarized the elements of our updated earnings outlook on Slide 22. 
In addition, let me provide you with a few other items to help you update your financial models. With respect to interest expense, given the commercial paper is a low-cost form of financing, the paydown of $1.6 billion of CP is not expected to have a meaningful impact on our interest expense in the second half. As a result, we still anticipate interest expense to be around $375 million in the back half and $750 million for the year. We expect our tax rate to be in the high teens in the second half, down from a pro forma adjusted rate nearly 25% in the first half due to reductions in statutory rates in certain countries. For the year, we expect our pro forma tax rate to be in the low 20s.
We're also increasing our free cash flow outlook for our ongoing business by about $400 million. This is driven by our strong year-to-date margin performance and continued solid working capital management. This increase, however, is more than offset by the divestiture of the coffee business.
So to wrap up, we delivered strong first half results with top-tier margin expansion and earnings growth while also stepping up investments to support future growth and improve market share. Our updated 2015 outlook reflects this momentum as well as the opportunity to fund additional A&C support while absorbing the dilutive impact of the coffee transaction.
As a result, we're confident we can continue to build upon this momentum and deliver our 2016 adjusted OI margin target of 15% to 16%. With that, let's open it up for questions."

It is -- there are quite a few moving pieces. I guess I'd start. I mean, clearly a strong first half by almost any financial metrics, and we're ahead of our outlook for the first half on both growth and margins. As -- I guess the simple answer is we're increasing net organic revenue outlook from 2%-plus to 3%-plus, and we think that's a prudent increase, given what we're seeing in the markets today. On OI margins, we're still at about 14% for the year and basically offsetting the dilution of the coffee transaction with underlying margins really improving. So our year-over-year OI margin improvement is now about 170 basis points. And when you go back to our original outlook, the prior 14% was an improvement year-over-year of 110 basis points. So I think that's one of the ways to look at this and feel good about the outlook that we've just given. And then hanging on obviously, despite the dilution to double-digit adjusted EPS growth at constant currency. Those, I think, are the big elements at a very high level. Happy to get more into the mechanics if you want, but I think those are the headlines."

So the combination of those 2 things need to be added back to the overall performance. And net-net, we're not entirely pleased yet with our performance in Europe, but it is playing out essentially the way we had expected.

That market has been quite slow and we started to see growth coming back there. So it will be a balance. The operative thought here is to make sure that we're getting good ROI. But in markets I talked about Brazil and India, I would say given the dynamics in Brazil, it's probably going to be much more about share protection. In a market like India, we're about 65% of the category. And we believe that therefore, our spending can help to stimulate the consumer acceptance of the higher price points.

And when you look at price net of commodities within the quarter, we saw positive dollar impact there, but it would have been negative on the margin rate, not enough price to offset the full impact of commodity inflation in the rate. So that's the dynamic. We would be, in the quarter, actually absorbing startup costs related to the startup of some of these lines.

So we invested behind Oreo, behind the launch of Oreo Thins, which has been off to a terrific start. We've seen very nice improvement in our share as a result of that. And we're seeing the biscuit category is starting to improve after quite some time of being essentially flat. We're also launching our belVita product, as we speak, and that will have a nice impact. So a lot of the good work that's going on in China is our opportunity to control our own destiny by making sure that we have adequate spending behind our franchises as well as adequate strong innovation platforms.

As I've said and I think I said at CAGNY, I mean, this should be the peak year as a percentage of revenue and on a dollar basis and will start moving down as we move through the execution of the supply chain reinvention activity. So no real change to that. I think we're being thoughtful. We're adjusting that based on some of the volume trends that you've seen in terms of capacity that drives volume versus investment in productivity programs and maybe accelerating some of the productivity opportunities.

It's just we'd like to see it get back up to the high single-digit, double-digit rates that it had been growing at since we acquired the Cadbury business. There's no question that the actions that we took in response to the devaluation of the rupee as well as the impact of higher cocoa cost has impacted the market. We not only have seen our gaps widen but we also have crossed some critical price thresholds. And so the intent of our investments back in the chocolate category in India are designed to help to mitigate some of that and help the Indian consumer over the hump. We've also taken a number of steps to help our price/pack architecture in the market so that the -- we are covering various points on the price spectrum.

Specifically, organi",1781,"Thanks, Dexter. Good morning. We had a strong second quarter. We built on our momentum from the start of the year, continuing to drive top-tier margin expansion and earnings growth while also delivering solid organic revenue growth. 
Specifically, organic revenue grew 4.3%, led by pricing actions to recover commodity and currency-driven input costs. Adjusted gross margin increased 330 basis points to 40.2%, driven by record net productivity as well as a 150 basis point benefit from mark-to-market of commodity and currency hedging contracts. 
We expanded adjusted operating income margin by 270 basis points to 15.2%, while significantly increasing advertising and consumer support. And adjusted EPS was $0.47, up nearly 38% on a constant-currency basis. 
Our strong year-to-date results reflect clear progress in the execution of our transformation agenda. Earlier this month, we closed 2 deals that will enable us to focus even more keenly on snacks. We combined our global coffee business with D.E Master Blenders, and we acquired the Kinh Do snacks business in Vietnam. 
On the cost front, we drove record net profitability in our supply chain and continued to reduce overhead as a percentage of revenue, driven by strong execution of our zero-based budgeting initiative. While continuing to improve profitability, we've also begun to stage the business for accelerated growth. In addition to significantly increasing advertising and consumer support, we brought more of our state-of-the-art production lines onstream to drive the growth of our Power Brands and innovation platforms.
Our updated outlook for 2015 reflects the strong year-to-date performance of our ongoing business as well as the continued progress on our transformation agenda. These solid results have enabled us to essentially offset the expected dilution related to the coffee transaction, including the near-term impact of stranded overhead costs. As a result, we're increasingly confident in our ability to deliver a 2016 adjusted operating income margin of 15% to 16%. 
Before jumping into the specifics of our Q2 performance, let me provide an update on our 2 recent portfolio actions. Earlier this month, we closed our deal to combine our coffee business with D.E Master Blenders, creating Jacobs Douwe Egberts, the world's leading pure-play coffee company. The company has revenues of more than EUR 5 billion and market-leading positions in over 18 countries across Europe, Latin America and Australia as well as a strong emerging market presence. 
JDE owns some of the world's leading coffee brands, including Jacobs and Tassimo as well as Moccona, Douwe Egberts and Pilao. With greater focus and increased scale, JDE will be able to capitalize on the global growth opportunities in coffee and invest more heavily in innovation, manufacturing and market development. 
At closing, we received cash of EUR 3.8 billion and a 43.5% interest in the new joint venture. These amounts are down somewhat versus previous estimates because we retained our interest in our Korea-based joint venture, Dongsuh Foods Corporation. Since we continue to hold that position, this doesn't affect the overall economics of the JDE deal. 
As previously stated, we'll use a majority of the cash proceeds to buy back shares. We now anticipate the transaction will be EPS-neutral to slightly accretive in 2016, reflecting fewer-than-expected shares repurchased due to the increase in our stock price as well as JDE's expected divestitures to satisfy European regulators.
2 weeks ago, we also completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in the Kinh Do snacks business in Vietnam. In addition to leveraging Kinh Do's iconic brands and leading positions in biscuits and moon cakes, we'll invest to introduce our Power Brands into their broad distribution network covering 130,000 outlets. 
With the completion of the coffee transaction, on a pro forma basis, snacks now represent nearly 85% of our revenue, up from 75%. This will enable us to further optimize our capital allocation and focus on accelerating the growth of our key franchises. 
As you can see on Slide 7, biscuits and chocolate now make up nearly 70% of our revenue, with Gum & Candy at about 15%. Post-coffee, our Beverages segment is now composed entirely of powdered beverages and will represent about 6% of revenue. Finally, Cheese and Grocery is about 10% of sales, with a little less than half of the business in Europe.
So let's turn to our Q2 performance. We delivered organic revenue growth of 4.3%. Similar to the first quarter, higher pricing drove our top line growth as we raised prices to recover higher input costs, including the impact of currency. As we've discussed before, this protects profits and enables us to continue to invest in our brands and innovation platforms. 
As expected, vol/mix continued to be soft due to elasticity as well as the impact of a number of strategic decisions we took to improve revenue mix. In aggregate, these strategic decisions were a 60 basis point drag on vol/mix in Q2, and for the full year, we expect them to be a 100 basis point headwind. 
In addition, the shift of Easter-related shipments into Q1 had a negative impact of about 50 basis points. Finally, to complete our revenue profile, Power Brands grew more than 6.5%. Emerging markets were up nearly 10%, with the BRIC countries also up about 10%. Finally, developed markets grew nearly 1 point.
Turning now to our results by region. Latin America was up nearly 20%, driven by the inflationary economies in Venezuela and Argentina. Brazil was up low single digits as we priced to recover the inflation impact of a weaker real on input costs. In addition, Brazil slowed sequentially as the weak macro environment led to a significant deceleration in our categories. 
As you know, the Brazilian economy has been soft for some time. As a result, we've been closely monitoring and managing inventory levels so that we have no significant de-stocking surprises. We're pleased that our shares have held up well, and we'll continue to make the appropriate investments to drive further share gains. That said, Brazil's slowdown is an area we'll continue to watch closely in the second half, as we don't see any short-term catalysts for category improvement.
Our EEMEA region grew 7%. As in the first quarter, this was primarily due to pricing. Our momentum in Russia continued, with revenue up more than 20%. This growth was driven by pricing in response to the sharp devaluation of the ruble. Despite significantly higher prices, however, vol/mix was flat as we increased brand support and expanded distribution. Performance was strong across all categories. 
Asia Pacific was up 3%. We were pleased with the performance in China, where growth accelerated to more than 20% behind strong execution in both biscuits and gum. India revenue growth was soft due to continued price elasticity in chocolate. India's another market that we're watching closely as we move through the second half. We're keeping a sharp eye on inventory levels as we increase A&C investment to help accelerate category growth.
In North America, revenue grew modestly behind improved biscuits growth in the U.S. We expect improved revenue growth in the second half as increased A&C and our new low-cost capacity comes online. 
Europe was also up modestly. Coffee posted strong growth as we increased trade inventories to ensure a smooth transition to JDE. As expected, however, Europe's ongoing business remains soft. Similar to Q1, vol/mix was pressured, as strategic decisions to improve revenue mix tempered Europe's volumes, especially in chocolate, while the Easter shift also created a 60 basis point headwind.
In addition, chocolate continued to be affected by negative volume elasticity, as competitive pricing actions announced earlier in the year are not yet fully reflected on-shelf. We anticipate revenue trends in Europe will improve in the second half as price gaps narrow and as our brands benefit from increased A&C support.
Turning to our categories. Year-to-date, our snacks categories grew about 4.5% globally. Including beverages and cream cheese, our categories were up more than 5%. Our organic growth was about 1 point below that, again, reflecting the impact of our strategic decisions to improve revenue mix.
While our financial results in the first half were strong, our year-to-date share performance is not where we want it to be. Only 45% of our revenue gained or held share, reflecting some sizable price gaps remaining in our categories, especially chocolate. 
Let's take a closer look at each category. The Biscuits category grew more than 5.5% year-to-date. Our Biscuits revenue growth was solid, up nearly 5%, with strong performances in China, Brazil and Russia. Share performance was also strong, with nearly 2/3 of revenue gaining or holding, including increases in both cookies and crackers in the U.S. 
Finally, Power Brands grew high single digits year-to-date, led by continued strength from Oreo, Tuc/Club Social and Barni.
Turning to Chocolate. The category grew nearly 5% year-to-date, while our revenue was up only modestly. This was largely due to our performance in Europe, which accounts for about half of our Global Chocolate revenue. This also affected our share, with only about 25% of revenue gaining or holding. 
Although we typically don't cite short-term data, we are seeing some green shoots in our most recent share performance, reflecting the benefit of selected A&C increases as well as narrowing price gaps. In the U.K., for example, we captured more than 2 share points in the most recent 4-week period. And in Germany, excluding the impact of some strategic decisions to exit low-margin revenue, we increased share through higher marketing support and selective trade investments. 
In emerging markets, our year-to-date chocolate revenue was up mid-single digits. In Russia, chocolate growth was strong, largely due to currency-driven price increases, but vol/mix was up as well. Share performance was also strong. In Brazil, year-to-date revenue growth has been solid and we continue to gain share, although, as I mentioned earlier, the category slowed in Q2 in response to the macro environment.
In India, chocolate revenue was soft, as consumers have been slow to adapt to the higher prices we implemented last year. In each of our key chocolate markets, we expect revenue growth and share performance to continue to improve in the second half as price gaps narrow further and as we step up A&C investments.
Finally, in Gum & Candy, the category was up less than 2% year-to-date, but our revenue increased over 6.5%, with both Gum & Candy up mid-single digits, fueled by the launch of Trident in China and by strong Halls growth in the U.S. 
In sum, we're pleased with our solid top line growth in the quarter and with the early indicators of share improvement in response to increased A&C support. 
Let me now turn it over to Brian to provide an update on our margin expansion and earnings growth."

Starting",2078,"Thanks, Irene, and good morning. As Irene highlighted, our Q2 results again demonstrate our ability to execute across multiple fronts of our transformation agenda, with great results in reducing costs, expanding margins and investing in growth. 
Starting with Slide 11. You can see that adjusted gross margin increased 330 basis points in the second quarter to more than 40%. Productivity drove more than half of the improvement, continuing our momentum from the first quarter and the second half of last year. In the quarter, we delivered strong net productivity of more than 3% of COGS or about $175 million, which continues to be a record level of productivity for us and benchmarks well versus peers.
In addition, mark-to-market contributed 150 basis points to the margin expansion, as we adjusted the value of our currency and commodity positions that don't qualify for hedge accounting. Adjusted OI margin was up 270 basis points to 15.2%. We took the opportunity to reinvest a portion of the cost savings into additional A&C spending to support top line growth and market shares.
As a result, A&C spending in the quarter grew double digits on a constant-currency basis, up 60 basis points as a percentage of revenue to more than 9%. Consistent with our plans to deliver both top-tier revenue growth and margin expansion, we'll continue to invest some of the additional cost savings into high-ROI initiatives. As a result, we expect A&C spending to continue to increase as a percentage of revenue in the second half. We'll talk more about this when we present at the Back to School Conference in early September.
As you could see on Slide 12, we expanded adjusted OI margins in all but 1 region. North America's margin was up modestly as we reinvested some of the productivity and overhead savings into higher marketing and merchandising support. Margins in Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific were up sharply, driven by strong productivity and overhead leverage, which also fueled increased A&C spending in these regions. 
In EEMEA, adjusted OI margin was down 120 basis points, as we continued to price to recover currency-driven input cost inflation in Russia and Ukraine. Considering the massive dislocation we saw in these markets in the first months of the year, we've made solid progress here in rebuilding our margins.
Adjusted EPS was $0.47 per share, up nearly 38% on a constant currency basis. Operating gains accounted for $0.06 of the increase despite the impact of approximately $0.04 of higher A&C spending. The year-over-year change in mark-to-market accounting accounted for the other $0.06.
Below the operating line, lower interest expense and outstanding shares each added $0.02, while a higher tax rate was $0.01 drag. After accounting for the $0.08 currency headwind, adjusted EPS was still up more than 17%.
On Slide 14, you can see that we returned $2.7 billion of capital to our shareholders in the first half. We purchased $2.2 billion of stock, more than 58 million shares, at an average price of a little more than $37 a share. This increased level of buyback reflects our ability to pool in a substantial portion of our planned buyback related to the coffee proceeds as we leveraged the hedge gains of about $1 billion related to the transaction.
In addition, we increased our share repurchase authorization program by $6 billion to a total of $13.7 billion and extended the expiration by 2 years through 2018. As a result, we can purchase up to $6.9 billion of stock over the next 3.5 years.
We also paid nearly $500 million in dividends in the first half. In addition, last week, we announced a 13% increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $0.17 a share, reflecting our continued confidence in delivering on our long-term commitments.
Let's turn to our outlook for the year. Now that the coffee transaction's complete, we'll give you a sense for what to expect for the remainder of the year. As you've seen through the first half, our ongoing business has been performing above our previous outlook. In our updated outlook, we continue that momentum. 
There are several moving parts, and we've provided on Slide 15 the key elements of our outlook. To help you determine the appropriate comparative historical financial results to use, earlier today, we issued an 8-K with pro forma adjusted financials by quarter for 2014 and the first half of 2015. The adjustments primarily involve moving our higher-margin coffee business out of our reported operating income and reclassifying the after-tax income to below OI using the equity method. This is also how we'll record our portion of the after-tax earnings from JDE going forward.
Let's start with our revenue outlook. For the second half, we expect organic growth of at least 3% versus the second half 2014 revenue base of $15.2 billion, which excludes coffee. This target reflects the underlying momentum of our ongoing business, which was up 3.2% in the first half. So for the full year, this implies organic growth of at least 3%. That's up from our previous target of at least 2%, which included coffee for the full year. On an apples-to-apples basis, this is an increase in our revenue guidance.
In addition, we expect a better balance between price and vol/mix in the second half as price gaps narrow, as our share performance improves, as we increase our A&C spending and as we lap the impact of our strategic decisions to exit lower-margin businesses.
Currency, however, will continue to be a sizable headwind. Based on current spot rates, especially with the continued weakening of the euro, we estimate currency will have a negative impact of approximately 11 percentage points in the second half.
Turning to margin. In the second half, we expect to deliver adjusted OI margin of at least 14% despite stepping up A&C spending and absorbing a number of headwinds related to the coffee divestiture. That's up from 12.6% in the second half of last year. On an apples-to-apples basis, this reflects a margin upside for our ongoing business, which offsets both the coffee impacts and higher A&C investment. 
As I said earlier, we're making good progress in building sustainable momentum in the execution of our supply chain reinvention program and in reducing overheads. Through the first 6 months, we've delivered strong net productivity, even before realizing any meaningful benefits from the new state-of-the-art assets that are now coming on stream. 
As Daniel Myers discussed at CAGNY, in addition to the 4 lines that are up and running now in our Salinas, Mexico, biscuit facility, in the coming months, we have new high-speed and lower-cost production lines being stalled -- installed in the U.S, in Europe, in India, China and in other markets. As expected, we should begin to see the benefits from these new lines in the second half. And yesterday, we announced a $130 million investment to install an additional 4 biscuit lines in Salinas, replacing 9 older, inefficient lines in our Chicago biscuit plant. We expect these new lines to be onstream in mid-2016.
In terms of overheads, cost as a percentage of revenue are also down in the first half. In fact, in each of the indirect cost packages we highlighted at CAGNY, we're delivering savings that are on or better than target, and so we're increasing our cost reduction expectations. We're also on track with respect to our migration to global shared services, which will simplify and streamline our back-office processes and better leverage our scale. Our shared services initiatives will begin to provide savings next year.
Cost reductions in our ongoing business will more than offset the dilutive impacts of 3 items surrounding the coffee deal. First, the coffee business we divested has a higher margin than our ongoing business. In 2014, the coffee business had an adjusted OI margin of approximately 17% versus about 13% for the total company. 
Second, the divestiture results in some stranded overheads. While the dilutive effect of stranded costs will be more pronounced in the third quarter, this impact is temporary. We expect to fully offset the impacts with additional cost reductions by the end of the year. 
Third, and in conjunction with the creation of the coffee JV, we've reclassified after-tax income related to joint ventures in which we have a minority interest from above operating income to below the line to be consistent with how we account for equity earnings from JDE. The largest of these is our Korean coffee-related JV. Together, these 3 items are expected to pressure margins in the second half by 75 to 100 basis points.
Despite these margin impacts from the transaction, we continue to expect adjusted OI margin to expand significantly for the full year. From a pro forma adjusted margin of 12% in 2014, we expect to deliver pro forma adjusted OI margin of approximately 14% in 2015, excluding a temporary negative impact of 20 to 30 basis points from stranded costs. Importantly, with momentum from our supply chain and overhead cost savings programs, we're increasingly confident in our ability to deliver adjusted OI margin of 15% to 16% in 2016.
Now turning to EPS. We continue to expect to deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth on a constant-currency basis for the full year versus the 2014 adjusted EPS baseline of $1.75. The margin expansion in our ongoing business is anticipated to drive the bulk of the increase, while lower interest expense and a lower share count are also expected to provide some benefit. These benefits will be partially offset by the dilution related to the coffee divestiture. We do expect our year-over-year margin and EPS growth to be more fourth quarter-weighted, given that, in Q3, we'll have a more pronounced impact from stranded costs, from front-loading A&C spending and from an expected year-over-year mark-to-market headwind. Our currency headwind estimate for the year is unchanged at $0.33. 
With respect to JDE, to estimate our total adjusted EPS, you'll need to be able to estimate the JV's net income. However, since it's a private company that we don't control, disclosure regarding its financial results will be somewhat limited. On Slide 20, we've provided a framework for JDE's income statement. 
Now looking at how we'll use the cash proceeds from the coffee deal. At closing, we received EUR 3.8 billion of cash, which we hedged at the time of the agreement in May 2014. So effectively, we received approximately $5.2 billion. We're returning about $2.9 billion via increased share buybacks, about $900 million of which we pulled into the first half of the year. We'll deploy the remaining $2 billion over the next 12 months. We'll use approximately $1.6 billion to pay down commercial paper, and we'll use the remaining $700 million for other corporate purposes, including funding the Kinh Do deal. 
For your convenience, we've summarized the elements of our updated earnings outlook on Slide 22. 
In addition, let me provide you with a few other items to help you update your financial models. With respect to interest expense, given that commercial paper is a low-cost form of financing, the paydown of $1.6 billion of CP is not expected to have a meaningful impact on our interest expense in the second half. As a result, we still anticipate interest expense to be around $375 million in the back half and $750 million for the year. We expect our tax rate to be in the high teens in the second half, down from a pro forma adjusted rate, nearly 25%, in the first half due to reductions in statutory rates in certain countries. For the year, we expect our pro forma tax rate to be in the low 20s.
We're also increasing our free cash flow outlook for our ongoing business by about $400 million. This is driven by our strong year-to-date margin performance and continued solid working capital management. This increase, however, is more than offset by the divestiture of the coffee business.
So to wrap up, we delivered strong first half results with top-tier margin expansion and earnings growth while also stepping up investments to support future growth and improve market share. Our updated 2015 outlook reflects this momentum as well as the opportunity to fund additional A&C support while absorbing the dilutive impact of the coffee transaction. As a result, we're confident we can continue to build upon this momentum and deliver our 2016 adjusted OI margin target of 15% to 16%. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

I mean, clearly, a strong first half by almost any financial metric, and we're ahead of our outlook for the first half on both growth and margins. As -- I guess, the simple answer is we're increasing net organic revenue outlook from 2%-plus to 3%-plus, and we think that's a prudent increase, given what we're seeing in the markets today. On OI margins, we're still at about 14% for the year, and basically offsetting the dilution of the coffee transaction with underlying margins really improving. So our year-over-year OI margin improvement is now about 170 basis points. And when you go back to our original outlook, the prior 14% was an improvement year-over-year of 110 basis points. So I think that's one of the ways to look at this and feel good about the outlook that we've just given. And then, hanging on, obviously, despite the dilution to double-digit adjusted EPS growth at constant currency. Those, I think, are the big elements at a very high level.

And if so, I guess, what caused the gap to still be as wide as it was?"

And as I mentioned in my script, in the second quarter, we did increase some promotional and A&C support in markets like the U.K. and Germany, and we are starting to see some responses there. But don't forget that we also -- Europe is really the main place where the strategic decisions have an impact, and that's about a 60 basis point impact to top line, as well as Europe has a disproportionately large Easter business, and that's about 50 basis points on the top line. So the combination of those 2 things need to be added back to the overall performance. So net-net, we're not entirely pleased yet with our performance in Europe, but it is playing out essentially the way we had expected. And we do expect back half to see stronger performance as price gaps narrow, as we start to see our competitor pricing playing through in the marketplace and as we reinvest some of our savings into more A&C support."

The operative thought here is to make sure that we're getting good ROI. But in markets I talked about, Brazil and in India, I would say, given the dynamics in Brazil, it's probably going to be much more about share protection. In a market like India, we're about 65% of the category. And we believe that, therefore, our spending can help to stimulate the consumer acceptance of the higher price points. So it's a balance, but net-net, it gives us great confidence that we should see -- as we make these investments, we should see improvements in our revenue -- rate of revenues growth as well as our share performance."

And when you look at price net of commodities within the year --  within quarter, we saw positive dollar impact there, but it would have been negative on the margin rate. Not enough price to offset the full impact of commodity inflation in the rate. So that's the dynamic. And we would be, in the quarter, actually absorbing startup costs related to the startup of some of these lines. So it -- in -- for the most part, the new lines would be a headwind to gross margins; a modest one, not a big one at this point. Okay?"

We had challenges of our own, as you'll recall, back in 2013, and we very quickly have addressed them. We've taken a number of steps aside from very closely monitoring inventory versus consumption, as you said. We've invested quite significantly in category growth in biscuits as well as in our innovation platforms. So we invested behind Oreo, behind the launch of Oreo Thins, which has been off to a terrific start. We've seen very nice improvement in our share as a result of that, and we're seeing the biscuit category is starting to improve after quite some time of being essentially flat. We're also launching our belVita product as we speak, and that will have a nice impact. So a lot of the good work that's going on in China is our opportunity to control our own destiny by making sure that we have adequate spending behind our franchises as well as adequate strong innovation platforms. On the Gum side, I'm quite pleased with the performance. Stride continues to do well. We continue to innovate behind that franchise in terms of the launch of bottles and Stride layers, but we also just recently introduced Trident into the market, and it's off to a very strong start.

So we expect that -- we had told you that we expected vol/mix in the second quarter to be weak because of the Easter shift as well as the elasticities. We should start to see that strengthen in the back half of the year."

I think, as we -- one of the things you saw, probably, in the deck is that as we take coffee out, it takes about $100 million out. So the number for the year is still about $1.7 billion. I -- as I've said, and I think I said at CAGNY, I mean, this should be the peak year, as a percentage of revenue and on a dollar basis, and we'll start moving down as we move through the execution of the supply chain reinvention activity. So no real change to that. I think we're being thoughtful. We're adjusting that based on some of the volume trends that you've seen, in terms of capacity that drives volume versus investment in productivity programs and maybe accelerating some of the productivity opportunities. And that's part of what, I think, you see play out. On the restructuring, no real change. We're progressing through that, and that's part of the -- obviously, driving some of the overhead savings that you're seeing in the results.

It's not a problem, it's just we'd like to see it get back up to the high single-digit, double-digit rates that it had been growing at since we acquired the Cadbury business. There's no question that the actions that we took in response to the devaluation of the rupee as well as the impact of higher cocoa cost has impacted the market. We not only have seen our gaps widen, but we also have crossed some critical price thresholds. And so the intent of our investments back in the chocolate category in India are designed to help to mitigate some of that and help the Indian consumer over the hump. We've also taken a number of steps to help our price pack architecture in the market so that the -- we are covering various points on the price spectrum.

Specifically, organi",1781,"Thanks, Dexter. Good morning. We had a strong second quarter. We built on our momentum from the start of the year, continuing to drive top-tier margin expansion and earnings growth while also delivering solid organic revenue growth. 
Specifically, organic revenue grew 4.3%, led by pricing actions to recover commodity and currency-driven input costs. Adjusted gross margin increased 330 basis points to 40.2%, driven by record net productivity as well as a 150 basis point benefit from mark-to-market of commodity and currency hedging contracts. 
We expanded adjusted operating income margin by 270 basis points to 15.2%, while significantly increasing advertising and consumer support. And adjusted EPS was $0.47, up nearly 38% on a constant-currency basis. 
Our strong year-to-date results reflect clear progress in the execution of our transformation agenda. Earlier this month, we closed 2 deals that will enable us to focus even more keenly on snacks. We combined our global coffee business with D.E Master Blenders, and we acquired the Kinh Do snacks business in Vietnam. 
On the cost front, we drove record net productivity in our supply chain and continued to reduce overhead as a percentage of revenue, driven by strong execution of our zero-based budgeting initiative. While continuing to improve profitability, we've also begun to stage the business for accelerated growth. In addition to significantly increasing advertising and consumer support, we brought more of our state-of-the-art production lines onstream to drive the growth of our Power Brands and innovation platforms.
Our updated outlook for 2015 reflects the strong year-to-date performance of our ongoing business as well as the continued progress on our transformation agenda. These solid results have enabled us to essentially offset the expected dilution related to the coffee transaction, including the near-term impact of stranded overhead costs. As a result, we're increasingly confident in our ability to deliver a 2016 adjusted operating income margin of 15% to 16%. 
Before jumping into the specifics of our Q2 performance, let me provide an update on our 2 recent portfolio actions. Earlier this month, we closed our deal to combine our coffee business with D.E Master Blenders, creating Jacobs Douwe Egberts, the world's leading pure-play coffee company. The company has revenues of more than EUR 5 billion and market-leading positions in over 18 countries across Europe, Latin America and Australia as well as a strong emerging market presence. 
JDE owns some of the world's leading coffee brands, including Jacobs and Tassimo as well as Moccona, Douwe Egberts and Pilao. With greater focus and increased scale, JDE will be able to capitalize on the global growth opportunities in coffee and invest more heavily in innovation, manufacturing and market development. 
At closing, we received cash of EUR 3.8 billion and a 43.5% interest in the new joint venture. These amounts are down somewhat versus previous estimates because we retained our interest in our Korea-based joint venture, Dongsuh Foods Corporation. Since we continue to hold that position, this doesn't affect the overall economics of the JDE deal. 
As previously stated, we'll use a majority of the cash proceeds to buy back shares. We now anticipate the transaction will be EPS-neutral to slightly accretive in 2016, reflecting fewer-than-expected shares repurchased due to the increase in our stock price as well as JDE's expected divestitures to satisfy European regulators.
Two weeks ago, we also completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in the Kinh Do snacks business in Vietnam. In addition to leveraging Kinh Do's iconic brands and leading positions in biscuits and moon cakes, we'll invest to introduce our Power Brands into their broad distribution network covering 130,000 outlets. 
With the completion of the coffee transaction, on a pro forma basis, snacks now represent nearly 85% of our revenue, up from 75%. This will enable us to further optimize our capital allocation and focus on accelerating the growth of our key franchises. 
As you can see on Slide 7, biscuits and chocolate now make up nearly 70% of our revenue, with Gum & Candy at about 15%. Post-coffee, our Beverages segment is now composed entirely of powdered beverages and will represent about 6% of revenue. Finally, Cheese and Grocery is about 10% of sales, with a little less than half of the business in Europe.
So let's turn to our Q2 performance. We delivered organic revenue growth of 4.3%. Similar to the first quarter, higher pricing drove our top line growth as we raised prices to recover higher input costs, including the impact of currency. As we've discussed before, this protects profits and enables us to continue to invest in our brands and innovation platforms. 
As expected, vol/mix continued to be soft due to elasticity as well as the impact of a number of strategic decisions we took to improve revenue mix. In aggregate, these strategic decisions were a 60 basis point drag on vol/mix in Q2, and for the full year, we expect them to be a 100 basis point headwind. 
In addition, the shift of Easter-related shipments into Q1 had a negative impact of about 50 basis points. Finally, to complete our revenue profile, Power Brands grew more than 6.5%. Emerging markets were up nearly 10%, with the BRIC countries also up about 10%. Finally, developed markets grew nearly 1 point.
Turning now to our results by region. Latin America was up nearly 20%, driven by the inflationary economies in Venezuela and Argentina. Brazil was up low single digits as we priced to recover the inflation impact of a weaker real on input costs. In addition, Brazil slowed sequentially as the weak macro environment led to a significant deceleration in our categories. 
As you know, the Brazilian economy has been soft for some time. As a result, we've been closely monitoring and managing inventory levels so that we have no significant de-stocking surprises. We're pleased that our shares have held up well, and we'll continue to make the appropriate investments to drive further share gains. That said, Brazil's slowdown is an area we'll continue to watch closely in the second half, as we don't see any short-term catalysts for category improvement.
Our EEMEA region grew 7%. As in the first quarter, this was primarily due to pricing. Our momentum in Russia continued, with revenue up more than 20%. This growth was driven by pricing in response to the sharp devaluation of the ruble. Despite significantly higher prices, however, vol/mix was flat as we increased brand support and expanded distribution. Performance was strong across all categories. 
Asia Pacific was up 3%. We were pleased with the performance in China, where growth accelerated to more than 20% behind strong execution in both biscuits and gum. India revenue growth was soft due to continued price elasticity in chocolate. India's another market that we're watching closely as we move through the second half. We're keeping a sharp eye on inventory levels as we increase A&C investment to help accelerate category growth.
In North America, revenue grew modestly behind improved biscuits growth in the U.S. We expect improved revenue growth in the second half as increased A&C and our new low-cost capacity comes online. 
Europe was also up modestly. Coffee posted strong growth as we increased trade inventories to ensure a smooth transition to JDE. As expected, however, Europe's ongoing business remains soft. Similar to Q1, vol/mix was pressured, as strategic decisions to improve revenue mix tempered Europe's volumes, especially in chocolate, while the Easter shift also created a 60 basis point headwind.
In addition, chocolate continued to be affected by negative volume elasticity, as competitor pricing actions announced earlier in the year are not yet fully reflected on-shelf. We anticipate revenue trends in Europe will improve in the second half as price gaps narrow and as our brands benefit from increased A&C support.
Turning to our categories. Year-to-date, our snacks categories grew about 4.5% globally. Including beverages and cream cheese, our categories were up more than 5%. Our organic growth was about 1 point below that, again, reflecting the impact of our strategic decisions to improve revenue mix.
While our financial results in the first half were strong, our year-to-date share performance is not where we want it to be. Only 45% of our revenue gained or held share, reflecting some sizable price gaps remaining in our categories, especially chocolate. 
Let's take a closer look at each category. The Biscuits category grew more than 5.5% year-to-date. Our Biscuits revenue growth was solid, up nearly 5%, with strong performances in China, Brazil and Russia. Share performance was also strong, with nearly 2/3 of revenue gaining or holding, including increases in both cookies and crackers in the U.S. 
Finally, Power Brands grew high single digits year-to-date, led by continued strength from Oreo, Tuc/Club Social and Barni.
Turning to Chocolate. The category grew nearly 5% year-to-date, while our revenue was up only modestly. This was largely due to our performance in Europe, which accounts for about half of our Global Chocolate revenue. This also affected our share, with only about 25% of revenue gaining or holding. 
Although we typically don't cite short-term data, we are seeing some green shoots in our most recent share performance, reflecting the benefit of selected A&C increases as well as narrowing price gaps. In the U.K., for example, we captured more than 2 share points in the most recent 4-week period. And in Germany, excluding the impact of some strategic decisions to exit low-margin revenue, we increased share through higher marketing support and selective trade investments. 
In emerging markets, our year-to-date chocolate revenue was up mid-single digits. In Russia, chocolate growth was strong, largely due to currency-driven price increases, but vol/mix was up as well. Share performance was also strong. In Brazil, year-to-date revenue growth has been solid and we continue to gain share, although, as I mentioned earlier, the category slowed in Q2 in response to the macro environment.
In India, chocolate revenue was soft, as consumers have been slow to adapt to the higher prices we implemented last year. In each of our key chocolate markets, we expect revenue growth and share performance to continue to improve in the second half as price gaps narrow further and as we step up A&C investments.
Finally, in Gum & Candy, the category was up less than 2% year-to-date, but our revenue increased over 6.5%, with both Gum & Candy up mid-single digits, fueled by the launch of Trident in China and by strong Halls growth in the U.S. 
In sum, we're pleased with our solid top line growth in the quarter and with the early indicators of share improvement in response to increased A&C support. 
Let me now turn it over to Brian to provide an update on our margin expansion and earnings growth."

Starting",2078,"Thanks, Irene, and good morning. As Irene highlighted, our Q2 results again demonstrate our ability to execute across multiple fronts of our transformation agenda, with great results in reducing costs, expanding margins and investing in growth. 
Starting with Slide 11. You can see that adjusted gross margin increased 330 basis points in the second quarter to more than 40%. Productivity drove more than half of the improvement, continuing our momentum from the first quarter and the second half of last year. In the quarter, we delivered strong net productivity of more than 3% of COGS or about $175 million, which continues to be a record level of productivity for us and benchmarks well versus peers.
In addition, mark-to-market contributed 150 basis points to the margin expansion, as we adjusted the value of our currency and commodity positions that don't qualify for hedge accounting. Adjusted OI margin was up 270 basis points to 15.2%. We took the opportunity to reinvest a portion of the cost savings into additional A&C spending to support top line growth and market shares.
As a result, A&C spending in the quarter grew double digits on a constant-currency basis, up 60 basis points as a percentage of revenue to more than 9%. Consistent with our plans to deliver both top-tier revenue growth and margin expansion, we'll continue to invest some of the additional cost savings into high-ROI initiatives. As a result, we expect A&C spending to continue to increase as a percentage of revenue in the second half. We'll talk more about this when we present at the Back to School Conference in early September.
As you can see on Slide 12, we expanded adjusted OI margins in all but 1 region. North America's margin was up modestly as we reinvested some of the productivity and overhead savings into higher marketing and merchandising support. Margins in Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific were up sharply, driven by strong productivity and overhead leverage, which also fueled increased A&C spending in these regions. 
In EEMEA, adjusted OI margin was down 120 basis points, as we continued to price to recover currency-driven input cost inflation in Russia and Ukraine. Considering the massive dislocation we saw in these markets in the first months of the year, we've made solid progress here in rebuilding our margins.
Adjusted EPS was $0.47 per share, up nearly 38% on a constant currency basis. Operating gains accounted for $0.06 of the increase despite the impact of approximately $0.04 of higher A&C spending. The year-over-year change in mark-to-market accounting accounted for the other $0.06.
Below the operating line, lower interest expense and outstanding shares each added $0.02, while a higher tax rate was $0.01 drag. After accounting for the $0.08 currency headwind, adjusted EPS was still up more than 17%.
On Slide 14, you can see that we returned $2.7 billion of capital to our shareholders in the first half. We purchased $2.2 billion of stock, more than 58 million shares, at an average price of a little more than $37 a share. This increased level of buyback reflects our ability to pool in a substantial portion of our planned buyback related to the coffee proceeds as we leveraged the hedge gains of about $1 billion related to the transaction.
In addition, we increased our share repurchase authorization program by $6 billion to a total of $13.7 billion and extended the expiration by 2 years through 2018. As a result, we can purchase up to $6.9 billion of stock over the next 3.5 years.
We also paid nearly $500 million in dividends in the first half. In addition, last week, we announced a 13% increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $0.17 a share, reflecting our continued confidence in delivering on our long-term commitments.
Let's turn to our outlook for the year. Now that the coffee transaction's complete, we'll give you a sense for what to expect for the remainder of the year. As you've seen through the first half, our ongoing business has been performing above our previous outlook. In our updated outlook, we continue that momentum. 
There are several moving parts, and we've provided on Slide 15 the key elements of our outlook. To help you determine the appropriate comparative historical financial results to use, earlier today we issued an 8-K with pro forma adjusted financials by quarter for 2014 and the first half of 2015. The adjustments primarily involve moving our higher-margin coffee business out of our reported operating income and reclassifying the after-tax income to below OI using the equity method. This is also how we'll record our portion of the after-tax earnings from JDE going forward.
Let's start with our revenue outlook. For the second half, we expect organic growth of at least 3% versus the second half 2014 revenue base of $15.2 billion, which excludes coffee. This target reflects the underlying momentum of our ongoing business, which was up 3.2% in the first half. So for the full year, this implies organic growth of at least 3%. That's up from our previous target of at least 2%, which included coffee for the full year. On an apples-to-apples basis, this is an increase in our revenue guidance.
In addition, we expect a better balance between price and vol/mix in the second half as price gaps narrow, as our share performance improves, as we increase our A&C spending and as we lap the impact of our strategic decisions to exit lower-margin businesses.
Currency, however, will continue to be a sizable headwind. Based on current spot rates, especially with the continued weakening of the euro, we estimate currency will have a negative impact of approximately 11 percentage points in the second half.
Turning to margin. In the second half, we expect to deliver adjusted OI margin of at least 14% despite stepping up A&C spending and absorbing a number of headwinds related to the coffee divestiture. That's up from 12.6% in the second half of last year. On an apples-to-apples basis, this reflects a margin upside for our ongoing business, which offsets both the coffee impacts and higher A&C investment. 
As I said earlier, we're making good progress in building sustainable momentum in the execution of our supply chain reinvention program and in reducing overheads. Through the first 6 months, we've delivered strong net productivity, even before realizing any meaningful benefits from the new state-of-the-art assets that are now coming on stream. 
As Daniel Myers discussed at CAGNY, in addition to the 4 lines that are up and running now in our Salinas, Mexico, biscuit facility, in the coming months, we have new high-speed and lower-cost production lines being stalled -- installed in the U.S, in Europe, in India, China and in other markets. As expected, we should begin to see the benefits from these new lines in the second half. And yesterday, we announced a $130 million investment to install an additional 4 biscuit lines in Salinas, replacing 9 older, inefficient lines in our Chicago biscuit plant. We expect these new lines to be onstream in mid-2016.
In terms of overheads, costs as a percentage of revenue are also down in the first half. In fact, in each of the indirect cost packages we highlighted at CAGNY, we're delivering savings that are on or better than target, and so we're increasing our cost reduction expectations. We're also on track with respect to our migration to global shared services, which will simplify and streamline our back-office processes and better leverage our scale. Our shared services initiatives will begin to provide savings next year.
Cost reductions in our ongoing business will more than offset the dilutive impacts of 3 items surrounding the coffee deal. First, the coffee business we divested has a higher margin than our ongoing business. In 2014, the coffee business had an adjusted OI margin of approximately 17% versus about 13% for the total company. 
Second, the divestiture results in some stranded overheads. While the dilutive effect of stranded costs will be more pronounced in the third quarter, this impact is temporary. We expect to fully offset the impacts with additional cost reductions by the end of the year. 
Third, and in conjunction with the creation of the coffee JV, we've reclassified after-tax income related to joint ventures in which we have a minority interest from above operating income to below the line to be consistent with how we account for equity earnings from JDE. The largest of these is our Korean coffee-related JV. Together, these 3 items are expected to pressure margins in the second half by 75 to 100 basis points.
Despite these margin impacts from the transaction, we continue to expect adjusted OI margin to expand significantly for the full year. From a pro forma adjusted margin of 12% in 2014, we expect to deliver pro forma adjusted OI margin of approximately 14% in 2015, excluding a temporary negative impact of 20 to 30 basis points from stranded costs. Importantly, with momentum from our supply chain and overhead cost savings programs, we're increasingly confident in our ability to deliver adjusted OI margin of 15% to 16% in 2016.
Now turning to EPS. We continue to expect to deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth on a constant-currency basis for the full year versus the 2014 adjusted EPS baseline of $1.75. The margin expansion in our ongoing business is anticipated to drive the bulk of the increase, while lower interest expense and a lower share count are also expected to provide some benefit. These benefits will be partially offset by the dilution related to the coffee divestiture. We do expect our year-over-year margin and EPS growth to be more fourth quarter-weighted, given that, in Q3, we'll have a more pronounced impact from stranded costs, from front-loading A&C spending and from an expected year-over-year mark-to-market headwind. Our currency headwind estimate for the year is unchanged at $0.33. 
With respect to JDE, to estimate our total adjusted EPS, you'll need to be able to estimate the JV's net income. However, since it's a private company that we don't control, disclosure regarding its financial results will be somewhat limited. On Slide 20, we've provided a framework for JDE's income statement. 
Now looking at how we'll use the cash proceeds from the coffee deal. At closing, we received EUR 3.8 billion of cash, which we hedged at the time of the agreement in May 2014. So effectively, we received approximately $5.2 billion. We're returning about $2.9 billion via increased share buybacks, about $900 million of which we pulled into the first half of the year. We'll deploy the remaining $2 billion over the next 12 months. We'll use approximately $1.6 billion to pay down commercial paper, and we'll use the remaining $700 million for other corporate purposes, including funding the Kinh Do deal. 
For your convenience, we've summarized the elements of our updated earnings outlook on Slide 22. 
In addition, let me provide you with a few other items to help you update your financial models. With respect to interest expense, given that commercial paper is a low-cost form of financing, the paydown of $1.6 billion of CP is not expected to have a meaningful impact on our interest expense in the second half. As a result, we still anticipate interest expense to be around $375 million in the back half and $750 million for the year. We expect our tax rate to be in the high teens in the second half, down from a pro forma adjusted rate, nearly 25%, in the first half due to reductions in statutory rates in certain countries. For the year, we expect our pro forma tax rate to be in the low 20s.
We're also increasing our free cash flow outlook for our ongoing business by about $400 million. This is driven by our strong year-to-date margin performance and continued solid working capital management. This increase, however, is more than offset by the divestiture of the coffee business.
So to wrap up, we delivered strong first half results with top-tier margin expansion and earnings growth while also stepping up investments to support future growth and improve market share. Our updated 2015 outlook reflects this momentum as well as the opportunity to fund additional A&C support while absorbing the dilutive impact of the coffee transaction. As a result, we're confident we can continue to build upon this momentum and deliver our 2016 adjusted OI margin target of 15% to 16%. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

I mean, clearly, a strong first half by almost any financial metric, and we're ahead of our outlook for the first half on both growth and margins. As -- I guess, the simple answer is we're increasing net organic revenue outlook from 2%-plus to 3%-plus, and we think that's a prudent increase, given what we're seeing in the markets today. On OI margins, we're still at about 14% for the year, and basically offsetting the dilution of the coffee transaction with underlying margins really improving. So our year-over-year OI margin improvement is now about 170 basis points. And when you go back to our original outlook, the prior 14% was an improvement year-over-year of 110 basis points. So I think that's one of the ways to look at this and feel good about the outlook that we've just given. And then, hanging on, obviously, despite the dilution to double-digit adjusted EPS growth at constant currency. Those, I think, are the big elements at a very high level. Happy to get more into the mechanics if you want, but I think those are the headlines."

And then, related to that productivity savings, are those -- when you cite productivity savings, are those inclusive of the Salinas plant, for example, or some of the lines in the future? Are you incorporating that in when you talk productivity?"

We talked about mark-to-market 150, so the 2 of those are about the number. The reality is there are some other smaller things moving around. And when you look at price net of commodities within the year -- within quarter, we saw a positive dollar impact there, but it would have been negative on the margin rate. Not enough price to offset the full impact of commodity inflation in the rate. So that's the dynamic. And we would be, in the quarter, actually absorbing startup costs related to the startup of some of these lines. So it -- in -- for the most part, the new lines would be a headwind to gross margins; a modest one, not a big one at this point. Okay?"

We had challenges of our own, as you'll recall, back in 2013, and we very quickly have addressed them. We've taken a number of steps aside from very closely monitoring inventory versus consumption, as you said. We've invested quite significantly in category growth in biscuits as well as in our innovation platforms. So we invested behind Oreo, behind the launch of Oreo Thins, which has been off to a terrific start. We've seen very nice improvement in our share as a result of that, and we're seeing the biscuit category is starting to improve after quite some time of being essentially flat. We're also launching our belVita product as we speak, and that will have a nice impact. So a lot of the good work that's going on in China is our opportunity to control our own destiny by making sure that we have adequate spending behind our franchises as well as adequate strong innovation platforms. On the Gum side, I'm quite pleased with the performance. Stride continues to do well. We continue to innovate behind that franchise in terms of the launch of bottles and Stride layers, but we also just recently introduced Trident into the market, and it's off to a very strong start. So we're cautiously optimistic. We're continuing to keep our eye very closely on the dynamic in the market, but I think we've got our hands firmly on the key levers that will help to fuel our business."

It's not a problem, it's just we'd like to see it get back up to the high single-digit, double-digit rates that it had been growing at since we acquired the Cadbury business. There's no question that the actions that we took in response to the devaluation of the rupee as well as the impact of higher cocoa cost has impacted the market. We not only have seen our gaps widen, but we also have crossed some critical price thresholds. And so the intent of our investments back in the chocolate category in India are designed to help to mitigate some of that and help the Indian consumer over the hump. We've also taken a number of steps to help our price pack architecture in the market so that the -- we are covering various points on the price spectrum. So net-net, India continues to be a market of great importance and interest to us.

The third quarter macro environment remained challenging, but we continued to drive top-tier margin expansion while delivering solid organic revenue growth. Specifically, organic revenue grew 3.7%, led by our pricing actions",1671,"Thanks, Dexter. Good morning. The third quarter macro environment remained challenging, but we continued to drive top-tier margin expansion while delivering solid organic revenue growth. Specifically, organic revenue grew 3.7%, led by our pricing actions to recover commodity- and currency-driven input costs, primarily in high inflation markets. 
Adjusted gross margin increased 180 basis points to 39.1%, driven by strong net productivity and the early benefits of improvements in our supply chain. We expanded adjusted operating income margin by 170 basis points to 14.1% while significantly increasing advertising and consumer support. 
Adjusted EPS was $0.42, flat versus prior year on a constant currency basis. We delivered strong operating gains. However, as expected, these gains were offset by below-the-line items, including dilution related to the creation of our coffee joint venture as well as higher taxes.
Our performance in the third quarter reflects continued progress in executing our transformation agenda. We further focused our portfolio. In July, we closed on the joint venture to combine our coffee business with D.E Master Blenders to create Jacobs Douwe Egberts, the largest pure-play coffee business in the world. As a result, we received more than $5 billion of cash, including the benefit of currency hedges and retained a 43.5% interest in the JV. 
We strengthened our snacks business through 2 bolt-on acquisitions, including Kinh Do's biscuit business in Vietnam and Enjoy Life Foods, a leader in fast-growing allergen-free snacks in the U.S. We'll look for more opportunities in the future to strengthen our snacks business through additional bolt-on acquisitions like these.
We also continue to aggressively reduce costs to expand margins and provide the fuel to accelerate our growth. In the third quarter, we significantly expanded gross margin by generating net productivity of more than 3% of cost of goods sold, including the benefits from the installation of almost 30 Lines of the Future around the world. 
In addition, we remain on track to reduce overheads as a percent of revenue by at least 250 basis points between 2013 and 2016, with additional opportunities thereafter. As Brian mentioned at the Barclays conference in September, we're identifying even more indirect cost savings than our original target. This sets up well for continued savings beyond 2016.
We're also well on our way to migrating more than 40% of back-office processes in finance, HR and several other functions to global shared services. For each of these processes, we'll reduce costs on average by half, enabling additional savings through and beyond 2018. As these supply chain and overhead cost savings come through the P&L, we'll continue to expand gross and operating margins while stepping up investments to drive growth. We're already beginning to see the benefits of this virtuous cycle.
In the third quarter, we increased advertising and consumer support as a percent of revenue by 50 basis points to more than 8.5%. Almost all of our incremental investment was behind our Power Brands in key markets and categories to backstop our pricing actions, improve our share of voice and accelerate the global rollout of proven innovation platforms such as Oreo Thins in North America, Ace Oreo in Russia, Trident and belVita in China and Bubbly Aerated Chocolate in India. 
In addition, we continue to invest in route-to-market expansion, especially in emerging markets as we look to strengthen our capabilities and position ourselves to capture more than our fair share of growth as the economies in these markets recover. We're encouraged by this progress and remain committed to our strategy and transformation agenda. 
As we look ahead, there are 3 areas where we want to continue to sharpen our focus going forward: on cost savings, growth and commercial execution. So we're also announcing some important organizational changes this morning. We've seen great benefit in consolidating our cost agenda under Brian Gladden, our CFO and our growth agenda under our Chief Growth Officer. 
We now see a similar opportunity to sharpen our global commercial execution by creating a new role of Chief Commercial Officer or CCO. Today, we're naming Mark Clouse to that position and appointing Tim Cofer, who currently runs our Asia Pacific business, as Chief Growth Officer. Mark, in his role as CCO, will oversee the execution of the company's growth plan, with oversight over all 5 geographic regions as well as the global sales function. 
This new structure should simplify and accelerate day-to-day P&L decision-making and trade-offs while focusing investments in those areas that will best drive profitable growth. Tim, in his role as CGO with responsibility for corporate strategy, the global categories, global marketing and research, development and quality, will lead the development of next-generation innovation platforms and new business opportunities to accelerate future growth. 
Brian, Tim and Mark, together with our region presidents, Daniel Myers and our Integrated Supply Chain teams, will work hand in hand to continue to advance our transformation agenda and accelerate growth on both the top and bottom lines.
Now let's take a closer look at our top line results. As I said, organic revenue growth was 3.7%. Higher prices contributed 7.4 points, with most of the pricing occurring in emerging markets as we recovered commodity- and currency-driven input costs to protect profitability. Vol/mix was down 3.7 points, largely due to elasticity in response to new pricing actions in markets like Brazil and Russia as well as a negative 70 basis point impact, resulting from our strategic decisions to improve revenue mix. Year-to-date, the vol/mix headwind from those decisions was 90 basis points. For the full year, we expect a headwind of up to 100 basis points as we shared with you before.
Our Power Brands, which now represent nearly 70% of revenue, delivered solid growth of more than 5%. Emerging markets were up over 10% due to pricing, with the BRIC markets growing mid- to high single digits. Developed markets declined 0.5%, largely driven by our actions to improve revenue mix.
Turning now to our results by region. As I mentioned earlier, pricing in emerging markets drove our growth this quarter. Latin America was up over 17%, driven by inflationary pricing in Venezuela and Argentina. Brazil was up low to mid-single digits as we took additional pricing to recover higher input costs, resulting from the recent weakening of the real. 
This pricing, along with softer categories as macro economic conditions deteriorated, pressured vol/mix in Brazil. We anticipated these difficult conditions and managed the business accordingly. As a result, we don't expect to have a material inventory destocking risk.
Our EEMEA region was up 6%, led primarily by pricing in Russia in response to the sharp devaluation of the ruble. We responded with a series of pricing actions that led to over 20% growth in Russia this quarter, which was broad-based across most categories. Vol/mix declined however as categories slowed in response to higher prices and weakening economic conditions. As in Brazil, we're actively managing our inventory levels and do not expect any material dislocation issues.
Asia Pacific was up 3%, with solid growth in China and Australia, partially offset by weakness in some other markets. China was up mid- to high single digits, driven by strong performance in both biscuits and gum. India grew modestly, led by solid chocolate growth in response to our stepped-up A&C investments.
Turning to developed markets. Europe was down 1.6%, largely due to our strategic decisions to improve revenue mix. North America was up modestly, with solid growth in biscuits and candy, partially offset by continued softness in gum.
Turning to our categories. Year-to-date snacks are up approximately 5% and about the same amount if you include powdered beverages and cream cheese. Currency-driven pricing remains the key driver of category growth. While our organic snacks growth is about 1 point below our categories, that's largely related to the 90 basis point impact of our actions to improve revenue mix. 
Looking at our overall market share, about 45% of our snacks revenues are gaining or holding share. Although we're not satisfied with this result, we're making sequential progress as expected as our competitors price, consumers adjust to higher price points and we invest some of our cost savings into incremental marketing support.
Let's take a closer look at each of our snacks categories. Biscuits grew nearly 6.5% year-to-date, and we grew about 5.5% with strong performance in China, Brazil and Russia. Shares were also strong with about 60% gaining or holding, including increases in both cookies and crackers in the U.S. as well as share gains in Brazil. Power Brand revenues were up high single digits, led by Oreo, Tuc Club Social and belVita. 
The chocolate category increased about 5.5% year-to-date while our revenue grew only about 1%. This reflects the fact that we led significant pricing in most markets in response to rising input costs. Recently, competitors have begun to price, and in select markets like the U.K and India, we've stepped-up A&C support. As a result, we're beginning to see improvements in both revenue growth and share. In fact, in the third quarter, our revenue grew low single digits, up from essentially flat in the first half. 
Chocolate market share also increased from about 25% growing or holding in the first half to approximately 30% through September. While share performance remains below what we would like, much of this is due to our revenue mix improvements in Europe, including discontinuing low-margin chocolate product lines. Going forward, we expect share performance to continue to improve as price gaps narrow and as our A&C investments pay off.
The Gum & Candy category grew nearly 2% year-to-date. Our revenue was up 5%, with both Gum & Candy growing mid-single digits, led by growth of gum in China and candy in the U.S. So as you can see, we delivered solid top line growth in the quarter, and share has begun to improve in response to increased marketing support in a number of key markets and categories. 
Let me now turn it over to Brian, who will provide an update on our third quarter margin expansion and earnings growth."

We delivered strong margin expansion in the third quarter by executing our transformation agenda in a challenging macro economic and consumer environment. Starting with Slide 9, you can see that adjusted gross margin increased 180 basis points to 39.1%. This expansion was driven by another quarter of net productivity of more than 3% of COGS. As expected, mark-to-market of commodity and currency hedging contracts was a 40 basis point headwind in the quarter, largely due to cycling of a gain in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date, mark-to-market is a 20 basis point benefit. 
Adjusted OI margin grew 170 basis points to 14.1%. We continue to drive down overheads and offset stranded costs from the coffee transaction by leveraging zero-based budgeting and other cost-saving tools. These overhead savings, as well as lower supply chain costs, allowed us to continue to accelerate some A&C investments in a number of key markets and categories in the quarter to support our pricing actions and innovation platform launches as well as to stimulate category growth and improve share performance. 
As Irene mentioned, we stepped-up A&C by 50 basis points to more than 8.5% of revenue. Based on recent results, our investments are beginning to pay off. We're seeing improvements in our growth in share performance in chocolate in both Europe and India. And in addition, our biscuits revenue in North America has begun to accelerate behind our increased marketing support and innovation.
Now let's look at margin improvement by region. As you can see on Slide 10, our cost reduction efforts have driven improvement in adjusted OI margins across all of our regions. In North America, OI margin was up 130 basis points, largely driven by strong gross margin expansion, which more than offset increased A&C investment. In Europe, margin increased 270 basis points as strong net productivity and lower overheads more than offset increased A&C in that market.
In Latin America, margin grew 60 basis points, driven by lower overheads. And in Asia Pacific and EEMEA, margins increased 380 and 210 basis points, respectively, as strong gross margin expansion more than offset higher A&C support.
Adjusted EPS was $0.42, flat versus the prior year on a constant currency basis. We delivered strong operating gains of $0.08, which includes a $0.01 benefit from acquisitions and a $0.02 headwind from mark-to-market as we lapped the gain in the prior year quarter.
Below the operating line, lower interest expense and the benefit from a lower share count offset a $0.04 headwind from taxes as we cycled an unusually low effective tax rate in the prior year quarter. Additionally and as you know, we're now reporting our portion of the JDE's net income using the equity method below the line. While we don't expect to provide much regular color on the results of JDE as it's a private company, we've said it would initially be dilutive and it was this quarter. Some of this is driven by the timing of the close, and some is simply driven by the timing of the integration and synergy execution. 
Prior to the closing of the JV, both partners increased shipments to the trade as a precautionary measure to ensure a smooth transition for customers, which affected JDE's third quarter revenue. While we expect -- we continue to expect the EPS dilution for the next few quarters, we remain confident in the potential of the business and believe it will create significant value for both shareholders.
Turning to return of capital. On Slide 12, you can see so far this year, we returned $3.8 billion of capital to our shareholders. In addition to paying more than $700 million in dividends, we purchased $3.1 billion of stock or nearly 80 million shares at an average price of just under $39 a share. 
In Q3, we bought back a little over $900 million of stock as we opportunistically stepped up our buyback activity, given how our stock traded during the quarter. This means that we have about $6 billion remaining under the current share repurchase authorization that goes through 2018.
Let's turn to our outlook. Given our solid third quarter results, we're reaffirming our 2015 outlook and our 2016 adjusted OI margin target of 15% to 16%. For 2015, we still expect organic net revenue growth of at least 3%. On a reported basis, currency remains a sizable headwind. Based on current spot rates, we estimate currency to have a negative 13 percentage point impact for the year, a little more than our previous estimate of a 12-point impact. 
We continue to expect to deliver adjusted OI margin of approximately 14%, excluding 20 to 30 basis points of stranded overhead costs from the coffee transaction. We made good progress in offsetting most of the stranded costs in the quarter and expect to fully offset them by the end of the year. 
We continue to anticipate double-digit adjusted EPS growth on a constant currency basis for the full year. Based on current spot rates, we estimate a negative currency impact of $0.33, the same as our previous estimate.
With respect to free cash flow, excluding items, we still expect it to be approximately $1 billion for the year. For modeling purposes, we've reduced our interest expense assumption to approximately $700 million, down from $750 million. We maintain our tax rate guidance in the low 20s for 2015. And while we continue to be opportunistic with our share buyback program, we anticipate repurchasing around $500 million of our shares in the fourth quarter. In this scenario, we would still have approximately $700 million remaining in coffee transaction proceeds to spend in the first half of next year.
So to wrap up. We delivered another solid quarter in a volatile and challenging macro economic environment. We're continuing to make excellent progress against our transformation agenda by focusing our portfolio on snacks and aggressively reducing our supply chain and overhead costs. This has enabled us to expand operating margins in each region while also fueling incremental investments behind our Power Brands and innovation platforms to drive revenue growth and improve market share in our key markets and categories.
As a result, we remain on track to deliver our 2015 outlook as well as our 2016 margin target of 15% to 16%. As the world's leading snacking company, we're one of few industry players with the assets, leadership and capabilities to deliver strong top and bottom line growth over the long term. With that, let's open it up for questions."

First off, with margins continuing to come through as you expect, seems like the key question will be around really the mix between volume and price. And I guess, I thought we'd at least start to see volume get sequentially better for the company, particularly with price gaps turning to narrow. But volume got a bit weaker sequentially and we got more price than we've modeled. And I guess European volume was still pretty weak despite a very easy year-ago comp. So maybe first, could you just update us on again, a little bit more color on the price gap situation in Europe chocolate. And if you need to reassess the strategy there, like perhaps what you did in the U.K.? Or do you -- have you seen enough movement in pricing in earnest that you kind of feel like you're going to see these price gaps narrow for real?"

We're seeing some very encouraging signs as we look at chocolate. In the EU [indiscernible] biscuits in North America we look at chocolate in India, for example. The factor that really impacted Q3, there's really 2. The first is that we did have to take some additional pricing in markets like Brazil and Russia in response to the significant devaluations of their currencies. And that just created another elasticity impact, which just put a little bit more pressure again in the near term on vol/mix. And then the second is just for the [indiscernible] we had a big heat wave this summer in Continental Europe, and that did have an impact on our chocolate business. So that as we started to see those gaps close and make the necessary investments, the impact of those investments just took a little bit longer than we anticipated. Net-net, we would expect that we should see continued revenue growth in share improvement as we make the investment focus in the key areas I've described and as we exit the year."

But we constantly are evaluating the opportunity to make sure that the margins of these various franchises are attractive enough to warrant the investment while recognizing that we do create some dislocation. We are leading pricing in most of these markets. And in markets like Russia, for example, we priced 3 times in the course of this year in response to the significant and rapid devaluation of the ruble. So I feel very good that we are managing to get our margins and protect our margins where they need to be. We are spending back as appropriate. And as I said at the -- in response to the earlier question, the aggregate Q3 response -- results mapped some of the impact that our spending is having. Take chocolate in Europe for example. We chose to delay some of that spending until September rather than into the summer because of the fact that we had an unusually hot summer. And therefore, it's not a surprise that it is just starting to have an impact now. So I think if you start to look at our shares over the last 4-week period, we're seeing very strong response as the categories in a number of these markets are now growing and think about markets like India, for example, think about the U.K. Our latest 12-week [ph] share is up 1.3 [ph] after share losses up until that point. The latest 4 weeks, we're up 3 points, 6 points. So we're seeing very strong indications that we're getting a good return on the A&C investments. We are carefully monitoring the volume pricing relationship because as you rightly point out, fixed cost absorption is important to us. But in the face of what we're doing, we're generating net productivity of over 3% of cost of goods sold. So I feel pretty comfortable the algorithm is working, and we should see improved performance, particularly on shares as we move into -- as we exit the year."

The third quarter macro environment remained challenging, but we continued to drive top-tier margin expansion while delivering solid organic revenue growth. Specifically, organic revenue grew 3.7%, led by our pricing actions",1669,"Thanks, Dexter. Good morning. The third quarter macro environment remained challenging, but we continued to drive top-tier margin expansion while delivering solid organic revenue growth. Specifically, organic revenue grew 3.7%, led by our pricing actions to recover commodity and currency-driven input costs, primarily in high inflation markets. 
Adjusted gross margin increased 180 basis points to 39.1%, driven by strong net productivity and the early benefits of improvements in our supply chain. We expanded adjusted operating income margin by 170 basis points to 14.1%, while significantly increasing advertising and consumer support. 
Adjusted EPS was $0.42, flat versus prior year on a constant currency basis. We delivered strong operating gains. However, as expected, these gains were offset by below-the-line items, including dilution related to the creation of our coffee joint venture as well as higher taxes.
Our performance in the third quarter reflects continued progress in executing our transformation agenda. We further focused our portfolio. In July, we closed on the joint venture to combine our coffee business with D.E Master Blenders to create Jacobs Douwe Egberts, the largest pure-play coffee business in the world. As a result, we received more than $5 billion of cash, including the benefit of currency hedges and retained a 43.5% interest in the JV. 
We strengthened our Snacks business through 2 bolt-on acquisitions, including Kinh Do's biscuit business in Vietnam and Enjoy Life Foods, a leader in fast-growing allergen-free snacks in the U.S. We'll look for more opportunities in the future to strengthen our Snacks business through additional bolt-on acquisitions like these.
We also continue to aggressively reduce costs to expand margins and provide the fuel to accelerate our growth. In the third quarter, we significantly expanded gross margin by generating net productivity of more than 3% of cost of goods sold, including the benefits from the installation of almost 30 Lines of the Future around the world. 
In addition, we remain on track to reduce overheads as a percent of revenue by at least 250 basis points between 2013 and 2016, with additional opportunities thereafter. As Brian mentioned at the Barclays conference in September, we're identifying even more indirect cost savings than our original target. This sets us up well for continued savings beyond 2016.
We're also well on our way to migrating more than 40% of back-office processes in finance, HR and several other functions to global shared services. For each of these processes, we'll reduce costs on average by half, enabling additional savings through and beyond 2018. As these supply chain and overhead cost savings come through the P&L, we'll continue to expand gross and operating margins while stepping up investments to drive growth. We're already beginning to see the benefits of this virtuous cycle.
In the third quarter, we increased advertising and consumer support as a percent of revenue by 50 basis points to more than 8.5%. Almost all of our incremental investment was behind our Power Brands in key markets and categories to backstop our pricing actions, improve our share of voice and accelerate the global rollout of proven innovation platforms, such as Oreo Thins in North America, base Oreo in Russia, Trident and belVita in China and Bubbly aerated chocolate in India. 
In addition, we continue to invest in route-to-market expansion, especially in emerging markets as we look to strengthen our capabilities and position ourselves to capture more than our fair share of growth as the economies in these markets recover. We're encouraged by this progress and remain committed to our strategy and transformation agenda. 
As we look ahead, there are 3 areas where we want to continue to sharpen our focus going forward: on cost savings, growth and commercial execution. So we're also announcing some important organizational changes this morning. We've seen great benefit in consolidating our cost agenda under Brian Gladden, our CFO; and our growth agenda under our Chief Growth Officer. 
We now see a similar opportunity to sharpen our global commercial execution by creating a new role of Chief Commercial Officer or CCO. Today, we're naming Mark Clouse to that position and appointing Tim Cofer, who currently runs our Asia Pacific business, as Chief Growth Officer. Mark, in his role as CCO, will oversee the execution of the company's growth plan, with oversight over all 5 geographic regions as well as the global sales function. 
This new structure should simplify and accelerate day-to-day P&L decision-making and trade-offs, while focusing investments in those areas that will best drive profitable growth. Tim, in his role as CGO, with responsibility for corporate strategy, the global categories, global marketing and research, development and quality, will lead the development of next-generation innovation platforms and new business opportunities to accelerate future growth. 
Brian, Tim and Mark, together with our region presidents, Daniel Myers and our Integrated Supply Chain teams, will work hand in hand to continue to advance our transformation agenda and accelerate growth on both the top and bottom lines.
Now let's take a closer look at our top line results. As I said, organic revenue growth was 3.7%. Higher prices contributed 7.4 points, with most of the pricing occurring in emerging markets as we recovered commodity and currency-driven input costs to protect profitability. Vol/mix was down 3.7 points, largely due to elasticity in response to new pricing actions in markets like Brazil and Russia as well as a negative 70-basis-point impact resulting from our strategic decisions to improve revenue mix. Year-to-date, the vol/mix headwind from those decisions was 90 basis points. For the full year, we expect a headwind of up to 100 basis points, as we shared with you before.
Our Power Brands, which now represent nearly 70% of revenue, delivered solid growth of more than 5%. Emerging markets were up over 10% due to pricing, with the BRIC markets growing mid to high single digits. Developed markets declined 0.5%, largely driven by our actions to improve revenue mix.
Turning now to our results by region. As I mentioned earlier, pricing in emerging markets drove our growth this quarter. Latin America was up over 17%, driven by inflationary pricing in Venezuela and Argentina. Brazil was up low to mid-single digits as we took additional pricing to recover higher input costs, resulting from the recent weakening of the real. 
This pricing, along with softer categories, as macro economic conditions deteriorated, pressured vol/mix in Brazil. We anticipated these difficult conditions and managed the business accordingly. As a result, we don't expect to have a material inventory destocking risk.
Our EEMEA region was up 6%, led primarily by pricing in Russia in response to the sharp devaluation of the ruble. We responded with a series of pricing actions that led to over 20% growth in Russia this quarter, which was broad based across most categories. Vol/mix declined, however, as categories slowed in response to higher prices and weakening economic conditions. As in Brazil, we're actively managing our inventory levels and do not expect any material dislocation issues.
Asia Pacific was up 3%, with solid growth in China and Australia, partially offset by weakness in some other markets. China was up mid to high single digits, driven by strong performance in both biscuits and gum. India grew modestly, led by solid chocolate growth in response to our stepped-up A&C investments.
Turning to developed markets. Europe was down 1.6%, largely due to our strategic decisions to improve revenue mix. North America was up modestly, with solid growth in biscuits and candy, partially offset by continued softness in gum.
Turning to our categories. Year-to-date snacks are up approximately 5% and about the same amount if you include powdered beverages and cream cheese. Currency-driven pricing remains the key driver of category growth. While our organic snacks growth is about 1 point below our categories, that's largely related to the 90-basis-point impact of our actions to improve revenue mix. 
Looking at our overall market share, about 45% of our snacks revenues are gaining or holding share. Although we're not satisfied with this result, we're making sequential progress as expected, as our competitors price, consumers adjust to higher price points and we invest some of our cost savings into incremental marketing support.
Let's take a closer look at each of our snacks categories. Biscuits grew nearly 6.5% year-to-date, and we grew about 5.5%, with strong performance in China, Brazil and Russia. Shares were also strong with about 60% gaining or holding, including increases in both cookies and crackers in the U.S. as well as share gains in Brazil. Power Brand revenues were up high single digits, led by Oreo, Tuc/Club Social and belVita. 
The chocolate category increased about 5.5% year-to-date while our revenue grew only about 1%. This reflects the fact that we led significant pricing in most markets in response to rising input costs. Recently, competitors have begun to price, and in select markets like the U.K and India, we've stepped up A&C support. As a result, we're beginning to see improvements in both revenue growth and share. In fact, in the third quarter, our revenue grew low single digits, up from essentially flat in the first half. 
Chocolate market share also increased from about 25% growing or holding in the first half to approximately 30% through September. While share performance remains below what we would like, much of this is due to our revenue mix improvements in Europe, including discontinuing low-margin chocolate product lines. Going forward, we expect share performance to continue to improve as price gaps narrow and as our A&C investments pay off.
The Gum & Candy category grew nearly 2% year-to-date. Our revenue was up 5%, with both Gum & Candy growing mid-single digits, led by growth of gum in China and candy in the U.S. So as you can see, we delivered solid top line growth in the quarter, and share has begun to improve in response to increased marketing support in a number of key markets and categories. 
Let me now turn it over to Brian, who will provide an update on our third quarter margin expansion and earnings growth."
739693,313029911,883813,"Mondelez International, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Mondelez International, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Irene. Good morning. We delivered strong margin expansion in the third quarter by executing our transformation agenda in a challenging macroeconomic and consumer environment. Starting with Slide 9, you can see that adjusted gross margin increased",1077,"Thanks, Irene. Good morning. We delivered strong margin expansion in the third quarter by executing our transformation agenda in a challenging macroeconomic and consumer environment. Starting with Slide 9, you can see that adjusted gross margin increased 180 basis points to 39.1%. This expansion was driven by another quarter of net productivity of more than 3% of COGS. As expected, mark-to-market of commodity and currency hedging contracts was a 40-basis-point headwind in the quarter, largely due to cycling of a gain in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date, mark-to-market is a 20-basis-point benefit. 
Adjusted OI margin grew 170 basis points to 14.1%. We continue to drive down overheads and offset stranded costs from the coffee transaction by leveraging zero-based budgeting and other cost-saving tools. These overhead savings as well as lower supply chain costs allowed us to continue to accelerate some A&C investments in a number of key markets and categories in the quarter to support our pricing actions and innovation platform launches as well as to stimulate category growth and improve share performance. 
As Irene mentioned, we stepped up A&C by 50 basis points to more than 8.5% of revenue. Based on recent results, our investments are beginning to pay off. We're seeing improvements in our growth and share performance in chocolate in both Europe and India. And in addition, our biscuits revenue in North America has begun to accelerate behind our increased marketing support and innovation.
Now let's look at margin improvement by region. As you can see on Slide 10, our cost-reduction efforts have driven improvement in adjusted OI margins across all of our regions. In North America, OI margin was up 130 basis points, largely driven by strong gross margin expansion, which more than offset increased A&C investment. In Europe, margin increased 270 basis points as strong net productivity and lower overheads more than offset increased A&C in that market.
In Latin America, margin grew 60 basis points, driven by lower overheads. And in Asia Pacific and EEMEA, margins increased 380 and 210 basis points, respectively, as strong gross margin expansion more than offset higher A&C support.
Adjusted EPS was $0.42, flat versus the prior year on a constant currency basis. We delivered strong operating gains of $0.08, which includes a $0.01 benefit from acquisitions and a $0.02 headwind from mark-to-market as we lapped a gain in the prior year quarter.
Below the operating line, lower interest expense and the benefit from a lower share count offset a $0.04 headwind from taxes as we cycled an unusually low effective tax rate in the prior year quarter. Additionally, and as you know, we're now reporting our portion of the JDE's net income using the equity method below the line. While we don't expect to provide much regular color on the results of JDE, as it's a private company, we've said it would initially be dilutive; and it was this quarter. Some of this is driven by the timing of the close, and some is simply driven by the timing of the integration and synergy execution. 
Prior to the closing of the JV, both partners increased shipments to the trade as a precautionary measure to ensure a smooth transition for customers, which affected JDE's third quarter revenue. While we expect -- we continue to expect the EPS dilution for the next few quarters, we remain confident in the potential of the business and believe it will create significant value for both shareholders.
Turning to return of capital. On Slide 12, you can see so far this year, we've returned $3.8 billion of capital to our shareholders. In addition to paying more than $700 million in dividends, we purchased $3.1 billion of stock or nearly 80 million shares at an average price of just under $39 a share. 
In Q3, we bought back a little over $900 million of stock as we opportunistically stepped up our buyback activity, given how our stock traded during the quarter. This means that we have about $6 billion remaining under the current share repurchase authorization that goes through 2018.
Let's turn to our outlook. Given our solid third quarter results, we're reaffirming our 2015 outlook and our 2016 adjusted OI margin target of 15% to 16%. For 2015, we still expect organic net revenue growth of at least 3%. On a reported basis, currency remains a sizable headwind. Based on current spot rates, we estimate currency to have a negative 13-percentage-point impact for the year, a little more than our previous estimate of a 12-point impact. 
We continue to expect to deliver adjusted OI margin of approximately 14%, excluding 20 to 30 basis points of stranded overhead costs from the coffee transaction. We made good progress in offsetting most of the stranded costs in the quarter and expect to fully offset them by the end of the year. 
We continue to anticipate double-digit adjusted EPS growth on a constant currency basis for the full year. Based on current spot rates, we estimate a negative currency impact of $0.33, the same as our previous estimate.
With respect to free cash flow, excluding items, we still expect it to be approximately $1 billion for the year. For modeling purposes, we've reduced our interest expense assumption to approximately $700 million, down from $750 million. We maintain our tax rate guidance in the low 20s for 2015. And while we continue to be opportunistic with our share buyback program, we anticipate repurchasing around $500 million of our shares in the fourth quarter. In this scenario, we would still have approximately $700 million remaining in coffee transaction proceeds to spend in the first half of next year.
So to wrap up. We delivered another solid quarter in a volatile and challenging macroeconomic environment. We're continuing to make excellent progress against our transformation agenda by focusing our portfolio on snacks and aggressively reducing our supply chain and overhead costs. This has enabled us to expand operating margins in each region while also fueling incremental investments behind our Power Brands and innovation platforms to drive revenue growth and improve market share in our key markets and categories.
As a result, we remain on track to deliver our 2015 outlook as well as our 2016 margin target of 15% to 16%. As the world's leading snacking company, we're one of few industry players with the assets, leadership and capabilities to deliver strong top and bottom line growth over the long term. With that, let's open it up for questions."

First off, with margins continuing to come through as you expect, seems like the key question will be around really the mix between volume and price. And I guess, I thought we'd at least start to see volume get sequentially better for the company, particularly with price gaps starting to narrow. But volume got a bit weaker sequentially and we got more price than we've modeled. And I guess European volume was still pretty weak despite a very easy year-ago comp. So maybe first, could you just update us on, again, a little bit more color on the price gap situation in Europe chocolate. And if you need to reassess the strategy there like, perhaps, what you did in the U.K. Or do you -- have you seen enough movement in pricing, in earnest, that you kind of feel like you're going to see these price gaps narrow for real?"

We're seeing some very encouraging signs as we look at chocolate in the EU; we look at biscuits in North America; we look at chocolate in India, for example. The factor that really impacted Q3, there's really 2. The first is that we did have to take some additional pricing in markets like Brazil and Russia in response to the significant devaluations of their currencies. And that just created another elasticity impact, which just put a little bit more pressure again in the near term on vol/mix. And then the second is just for the luck of the draw; we had a big heat wave this summer in Continental Europe, and that did have an impact on our chocolate business, so that as were starting to see those gaps close and make the necessary investments, the impact of those investments just took a little bit longer than we anticipated. Net-net, we would expect that we should see continued revenue growth and share improvement as we make the investments focused in the key areas I've described and as we exit the year."

We believe very strongly that the right aggregation needs to be at the regional level. But think of it more as a center of excellence, the opportunity to take best practices from one market to another. So in addition to making sure that the terrific growth agenda that Mark and his team laid out is now executed through our regions, we do see additional opportunities to capture best practices in terms of execution at point-of-sale as well as building our capabilities in areas like trade optimization as you suggest. So all of those things, I believe, will just help to further strengthen what has been very strong commercial execution."

So yes, I mean, there clearly were specific actions that we took, both sides of the -- both partners heading into the close of the joint venture that moved more inventory into the trade.

It's hard from the outside to figure all this out. But you're spending a ton of capital to put in these highly efficient lines. And these efficient lines I assume, the volume that's going -- that efficiency is a function of the volume that's going through them. And so to the extent that you have other, I guess, cost savings, your decision to price against currency results in weaker volume. It doesn't look like the A&C had a big impact or a positive impact in the quarter. So I guess I'm not really sure what the question is, but I guess I'm a little bit concerned that the decision on price versus -- FX-related price versus volume weakness makes this whole transformation less powerful because of the fixed cost absorption not being there; or maybe just kind of walk me through why that's not a concern."

But we constantly are evaluating the opportunity to make sure that the margins of these various franchises are attractive enough to warrant the investment while recognizing that we do create some dislocation. We are leading pricing in most of these markets. And in markets like Russia, for example, we priced 3 times in the course of this year in response to the significant and rapid devaluation of the ruble. So I feel very good that we are managing to get our margins and protect our margins where they need to be. We are spending back as appropriate. And as I said at the -- in response to the earlier question, the aggregate Q3 results mapped some of the impact that our spending is having. Take chocolate in Europe for example. We chose to delay some of that spending until September rather than into the summer because of the fact that we had an unusually hot summer. And therefore, it's not a surprise that it is just starting to have an impact now. So I think if you start to look at our shares over the last 4-week period, we're seeing very strong response as the categories in a number of these markets are now growing. Think about markets like India, for example; think about the U.K. Our latest 12-week share is up 1.3 [ph] after share losses up until that point. The latest 4 weeks, we're up 3.6 points. So we're seeing very strong indications that we're getting a good return on the A&C investments. We are carefully monitoring the volume pricing relationship because as you rightly point out, fixed cost absorption is important to us. But in the face of what we're doing, we're generating net productivity of over 3% of cost of goods sold. So I feel pretty comfortable the algorithm is working, and we should see improved performance, particularly on shares as we move into -- as we exit the year."

The third quarter macroenvironment remained challenging, but we continued to drive top-tier margin expansion while delivering solid organic revenue growth. Specifically, organic revenue grew 3.7%, led by our pricing actions to recover commodity and currency-driven input costs, primarily in high inflation markets. 
Adjusted gross margin increased 180 basis points to 39.1%, driven by strong net productivity and the early benefits of improvements in our supply chain. We expanded adjusted operating income margin by 170 basis points to 14.1%, while significantly increasing advertising and consumer support. 
Adjusted EPS was $0.42, flat versus prior year on a constant currency basis. We delivered strong operating gains. However, as expected, these gains were offset by below-the-line items, including dilution related to the creation of our coffee joint venture as well as higher taxes.
Our performance in the third quarter reflects continued progress in executing our transformation agenda. We further focused our portfolio. In July, we closed on the joint venture to combine our coffee business with D.E Master Blenders to create Jacobs Douwe Egberts, the largest pure-play coffee business in the world. As a result, we received more than $5 billion of cash, including the benefit of currency hedges and retained a 43.5% interest in the JV. 
We strengthened our Snacks business through 2 bolt-on acquisitions, including Kinh Do's biscuit business in Vietnam and Enjoy Life Foods, a leader in fast-growing allergen-free snacks in the U.S. We'll look for more opportunities in the future to strengthen our Snacks business through additional bolt-on acquisitions like these.
We also continue to aggressively reduce costs to expand margins and provide the fuel to accelerate our growth. In the third quarter, we significantly expanded gross margins by generating net productivity of more than 3% of cost of goods sold, including the benefits from the installation of almost 30 Lines of the Future around the world. 
In addition, we remain on track to reduce overheads as a percent of revenue by at least 250 basis points between 2013 and 2016, with additional opportunities thereafter. As Brian mentioned at the Barclays conference in September, we're identifying even more indirect cost savings than our original target. This sets us up well for continued savings beyond 2016.
We're also well on our way to migrating more than 40% of back-office processes in finance, HR and several other functions to global shared services. For each of these processes, we'll reduce costs on average by half, enabling additional savings through and beyond 2018. As these supply chain and overhead cost savings come through the P&L, we'll continue to expand gross and operating margins while stepping up investments to drive growth. We're already beginning to see the benefits of this virtuous cycle.
In the third quarter, we increased advertising and consumer support as a percent of revenue by 50 basis points to more than 8.5%. Almost all of our incremental investment was behind our Power Brands in key markets and categories to backstop our pricing actions, improve our share of voice and accelerate the global rollout of proven innovation platforms, such as Oreo Thins in North America, base Oreo in Russia, Trident and belVita in China and Bubbly aerated chocolate in India. 
In addition, we continue to invest in route-to-market expansion, especially in emerging markets as we look to strengthen our capabilities and position ourselves to capture more than our fair share of growth as the economies in these markets recover. We're encouraged by this progress and remain committed to our strategy and transformation agenda. 
As we look ahead, there are 3 areas where we want to continue to sharpen our focus going forward: on cost savings, growth and commercial execution. So we're also announcing some important organizational changes this morning. We've seen great benefit in consolidating our cost agenda under Brian Gladden, our CFO; and our growth agenda under our Chief Growth Officer. 
We now see a similar opportunity to sharpen our global commercial execution by creating a new role of Chief Commercial Officer or CCO. Today, we're naming Mark Clouse to that position and appointing Tim Cofer, who currently runs our Asia Pacific business, as Chief Growth Officer. Mark, in his role as CCO, will oversee the execution of the company's growth plan, with oversight over all 5 geographic regions as well as the global sales function. 
This new structure should simplify and accelerate day-to-day P&L decision-making and trade-offs, while focusing investments in those areas that will best drive profitable growth. Tim, in his role as CGO, with responsibility for corporate strategy, the global categories, global marketing and research, development and quality, will lead the development of next-generation innovation platforms and new business opportunities to accelerate future growth. 
Brian, Tim and Mark, together with our region presidents, Daniel Myers and our Integrated Supply Chain teams, will work hand-in-hand to continue to advance our transformation agenda and accelerate growth on both the top and bottom lines.
Now let's take a closer look at our top line results. As I said, organic revenue growth was 3.7%. Higher prices contributed 7.4 points, with most of the pricing occurring in emerging markets as we recovered commodity and currency-driven input costs to protect profitability. Vol/mix was down 3.7 points, largely due to elasticity in response to new pricing actions in markets like Brazil and Russia as well as a negative 70-basis-point impact resulting from our strategic decisions to improve revenue mix. Year-to-date, the vol/mix headwind from those decisions was 90 basis points. For the full year, we expect a headwind of up to 100 basis points, as we shared with you before.
Our Power Brands, which now represent nearly 70% of revenue, delivered solid growth of more than 5%. Emerging markets were up over 10% due to pricing, with the BRIC markets growing mid to high single digits. Developed markets declined 0.5%, largely driven by our actions to improve revenue mix.
Turning now to our results by region. As I mentioned earlier, pricing in emerging markets drove our growth this quarter. Latin America was up over 17%, driven by inflationary pricing in Venezuela and Argentina. Brazil was up low to mid-single digits as we took additional pricing to recover higher input costs, resulting from the recent weakening of the real. 
This pricing, along with softer categories, as macroeconomic conditions deteriorated, pressured vol/mix in Brazil. We anticipated these difficult conditions and managed the business accordingly. As a result, we don't expect to have a material inventory destocking risk.
Our EEMEA region was up 6%, led primarily by pricing in Russia in response to the sharp devaluation of the ruble. We responded with a series of pricing actions that led to over 20% growth in Russia this quarter, which was broad based across most categories. Vol/mix declined, however, as categories slowed in response to higher prices and weakening economic conditions. As in Brazil, we're actively managing our inventory levels and do not expect any material dislocation issues.
Asia Pacific was up 3%, with solid growth in China and Australia, partially offset by weakness in some other markets. China was up mid to high single digits, driven by strong performance in both biscuits and gum. India grew modestly, led by solid chocolate growth in response to our stepped-up A&C investments.
Turning to developed markets. Europe was down 1.6%, largely due to our strategic decisions to improve revenue mix. North America was up modestly, with solid growth in biscuits and candy, partially offset by continued softness in gum.
Turning to our categories. Year-to-date snacks are up approximately 5% and about the same amount if you include powdered beverages and cream cheese. Currency-driven pricing remains the key driver of category growth. While our organic snacks growth is about 1 point below our categories, that's largely related to the 90-basis-point impact of our actions to improve revenue mix. 
Looking at our overall market share, about 45% of our snacks revenues are gaining or holding share. Although we're not satisfied with this result, we're making sequential progress as expected, as our competitors price, consumers adjust to higher price points and we invest some of our cost savings into incremental marketing support.
Let's take a closer look at each of our snacks categories. Biscuits grew nearly 6.5% year-to-date, and we grew about 5.5%, with strong performance in China, Brazil and Russia. Shares were also strong with about 60% gaining or holding, including increases in both cookies and crackers in the U.S. as well as share gains in Brazil. Power Brand revenues were up high single digits, led by Oreo, Tuc/Club Social and belVita. 
The Chocolate category increased about 5.5% year-to-date while our revenue grew only about 1%. This reflects the fact that we led significant pricing in most markets in response to rising input costs. Recently, competitors have begun to price, and in select markets like the U.K. and India, we've stepped up A&C support. As a result, we're beginning to see improvements in both revenue growth and share. In fact, in the third quarter, our revenue grew low single digits, up from essentially flat in the first half. 
Chocolate market share also increased from about 25% growing or holding in the first half to approximately 30% through September. While share performance remains below what we would like, much of this is due to our revenue mix improvements in Europe, including discontinuing low-margin chocolate product lines. Going forward, we expect share performance to continue to improve as price gaps narrow and as our A&C investments pay off.
The Gum & Candy category grew nearly 2% year-to-date. Our revenue was up 5%, with both Gum & Candy growing mid-single digits, led by growth of gum in China and candy in the U.S. So as you can see, we delivered solid top line growth in the quarter, and share has begun to improve in response to increased marketing support in a number of key markets and categories. 
Let me now turn it over to Brian, who will provide an update on our third quarter margin expansion and earnings growth."

We delivered strong margin expansion in the third quarter by executing our transformation agenda in a challenging macroeconomic and consumer environment. Starting with Slide 9, you can see that adjusted gross margin increased",1078,"Thanks, Irene. Good morning. We delivered strong margin expansion in the third quarter by executing our transformation agenda in a challenging macroeconomic and consumer environment. Starting with Slide 9, you can see that adjusted gross margin increased 180 basis points to 39.1%. This expansion was driven by another quarter of net productivity of more than 3% of COGS. As expected, mark-to-market of commodity and currency hedging contracts was a 40-basis-point headwind in the quarter, largely due to cycling of a gain in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date, mark-to-market is a 20-basis-point benefit. 
Adjusted OI margin grew 170 basis points to 14.1%. We continue to drive down overheads and offset stranded costs from the coffee transaction by leveraging zero-based budgeting and other cost-saving tools. These overhead savings as well as lower supply chain costs allowed us to continue to accelerate some A&C investments in a number of key markets and categories in the quarter to support our pricing actions and innovation platform launches as well as to stimulate category growth and improve share performance. 
As Irene mentioned, we stepped up A&C by 50 basis points to more than 8.5% of revenue. Based on recent results, our investments are beginning to pay off. We're seeing improvements in our growth and share performance in chocolate in both Europe and India. And in addition, our biscuits revenue in North America has begun to accelerate behind our increased marketing support and innovation.
Now let's look at margin improvement by region. As you can see on Slide 10, our cost-reduction efforts have driven improvement in adjusted OI margins across all of our regions. In North America, the OI margin was up 130 basis points, largely driven by strong gross margin expansion, which more than offset increased A&C investment. In Europe, margin increased 270 basis points as strong net productivity and lower overheads more than offset increased A&C in that market.
In Latin America, margin grew 60 basis points, driven by lower overheads. And in Asia Pacific and EEMEA, margins increased 380 and 210 basis points, respectively, as strong gross margin expansion more than offset higher A&C support.
Adjusted EPS was $0.42, flat versus the prior year on a constant currency basis. We delivered strong operating gains of $0.08, which includes a $0.01 benefit from acquisitions and a $0.02 headwind from mark-to-market as we lapped a gain in the prior year quarter.
Below the operating line, lower interest expense and the benefit from a lower share count offset a $0.04 headwind from taxes as we cycled an unusually low effective tax rate in the prior year quarter. Additionally, and as you know, we're now reporting our portion of the JDE's net income using the equity method below the line. While we don't expect to provide much regular color on the results of JDE, as it's a private company, we've said it would initially be dilutive; and it was this quarter. Some of this is driven by the timing of the close, and some is simply driven by the timing of the integration and synergy execution. 
Prior to the closing of the JV, both partners increased shipments to the trade as a precautionary measure to ensure a smooth transition for customers, which affected JDE's third quarter revenue. While we expect -- we continue to expect the EPS dilution for the next few quarters, we remain confident in the potential of the business and believe it will create significant value for both shareholders.
Turning to return of capital. On Slide 12, you can see so far this year, we've returned $3.8 billion of capital to our shareholders. In addition to paying more than $700 million in dividends, we purchased $3.1 billion of stock or nearly 80 million shares at an average price of just under $39 a share. 
In Q3, we bought back a little over $900 million of stock as we opportunistically stepped up our buyback activity, given how our stock traded during the quarter. This means that we have about $6 billion remaining under the current share repurchase authorization that goes through 2018.
Let's turn to our outlook. Given our solid third quarter results, we're reaffirming our 2015 outlook and our 2016 adjusted OI margin target of 15% to 16%. For 2015, we still expect organic net revenue growth of at least 3%. On a reported basis, currency remains a sizable headwind. Based on current spot rates, we estimate currency to have a negative 13-percentage-point impact for the year, a little more than our previous estimate of a 12-point impact. 
We continue to expect to deliver adjusted OI margin of approximately 14%, excluding 20 to 30 basis points of stranded overhead costs from the coffee transaction. We made good progress in offsetting most of the stranded costs in the quarter and expect to fully offset them by the end of the year. 
We continue to anticipate double-digit adjusted EPS growth on a constant currency basis for the full year. Based on current spot rates, we estimate a negative currency impact of $0.33, the same as our previous estimate.
With respect to free cash flow, excluding items, we still expect it to be approximately $1 billion for the year. For modeling purposes, we've reduced our interest expense assumption to approximately $700 million, down from $750 million. We maintain our tax rate guidance in the low 20s for 2015. And while we continue to be opportunistic with our share buyback program, we anticipate repurchasing around $500 million of our shares in the fourth quarter. In this scenario, we would still have approximately $700 million remaining in coffee transaction proceeds to spend in the first half of next year.
So to wrap up. We delivered another solid quarter in a volatile and challenging macroeconomic environment. We're continuing to make excellent progress against our transformation agenda by focusing our portfolio on snacks and aggressively reducing our supply chain and overhead costs. This has enabled us to expand operating margins in each region while also fueling incremental investments behind our Power Brands and innovation platforms to drive revenue growth and improve market share in our key markets and categories.
As a result, we remain on track to deliver our 2015 outlook as well as our 2016 margin target of 15% to 16%. As the world's leading snacking company, we're one of few industry players with the assets, leadership and capabilities to deliver strong top and bottom line growth over the long term. With that, let's open it up for questions."

First off, with margins continuing to come through as you expect, seems like the key question will be around really the mix between volume and price. And I guess, I thought we'd at least start to see volume get sequentially better for the company, particularly with price gaps starting to narrow. But volume got a bit weaker sequentially and we got more price than we'd modeled. And I guess European volume was still pretty weak despite a very easy year-ago comp. So maybe first, could you just update us on, again, a little bit more color on the price gap situation in Europe, chocolate. And if you need to reassess the strategy there like, perhaps, what you did in the U.K. Or do you -- have you seen enough movement in pricing, in earnest, that you kind of feel like you're going to see these price gaps narrow for real?"

We're seeing some very encouraging signs as we look at chocolate in the EU; we look at biscuits in North America; we look at chocolate in India, for example. The factor that really impacted Q3, there's really 2. The first is that we did have to take some additional pricing in markets like Brazil and Russia in response to the significant devaluations of their currencies. And that just created another elasticity impact, which just put a little bit more pressure again in the near term on vol/mix. And then the second is just for the luck of the draw; we had a big heat wave this summer in Continental Europe, and that did have an impact on our chocolate business, so that as were starting to see those gaps close and make the necessary investments, the impact of those investments just took a little bit longer than we anticipated. Net-net, we would expect that we should see continued revenue growth and share improvement as we make the investments focused in the key areas I've described and as we exit the year."

Brazil, we continue to see the north-northeast as a ripe area for investments. So these are near-end [ph], high payback kinds of route-to-market investments. That said, we still see white space opportunities for us to take our categories to new markets. And obviously, gum in China is a great example, biscuits in India, for example. But as we look at our emerging markets, virtually all of them are 1 or 2-category markets, and it would be our expectation over time that we will be able to see all of our categories in each of our key markets.

And these efficient lines I assume, the volume that's going -- that efficiency is a function of the volume that's going through them. And so to the extent that you have other, I guess, cost savings, your decision to price against currency results in weaker volume. It doesn't look like the A&C had a big impact or a positive impact in the quarter. So I guess I'm not really sure what the question is, but I guess I'm a little bit concerned that the decision on price versus -- FX-related price versus volume weakness makes this whole transformation less powerful because of the fixed cost absorption not being there; or maybe you just kind of walk me through why that's not a concern."

But we constantly are evaluating the opportunity to make sure that the margins of these various franchises are attractive enough to warrant the investment while recognizing that we do create some dislocation. We are leading pricing in most of these markets. And in markets like Russia, for example, we priced 3 times in the course of this year in response to the significant and rapid devaluation of the ruble. So I feel very good that we are managing to get our margins and protect our margins where they need to be. We are spending back as appropriate. And as I said at the -- in response to the earlier question, the aggregate Q3 results mapped some of the impact that our spending is having. Take chocolate in Europe for example. We chose to delay some of that spending until September rather than into the summer because of the fact that we had an unusually hot summer. And therefore, it's not a surprise that it is just starting to have an impact now. So I think if you start to look at our shares over the last 4-week period, we're seeing very strong response as the categories in a number of these markets are now growing. Think about markets like India, for example; think about the U.K. Our latest 12-week share is up 1.3 after share losses up until that point. The latest 4 weeks, we're up 3.6 points. So we're seeing very strong indications that we're getting a good return on the A&C investments. We are carefully monitoring the volume pricing relationship because, as you rightly point out, fixed cost absorption is important to us. But in the face of what we're doing, we're generating net productivity of over 3% of cost of goods sold. So I feel pretty comfortable the algorithm is working, and we should see improved performance, particularly on shares as we move into -- as we exit the year."

So it's really not rocket science, but I have great confidence that as we continue to experience volatility in this challenging macroenvironment, that we're well positioned to manage our businesses and continue to deliver our commitments."
