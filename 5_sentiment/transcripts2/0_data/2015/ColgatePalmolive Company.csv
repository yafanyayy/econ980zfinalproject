With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.
We're pleased to exit 2014 with organic sales up 6% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, which was the strongest quarter of last year. Our market shares are strong around the world as you will hear in a moment. As always, innovation has been critical to our success and we're excited about our pipeline looking forward to 2015 and beyond. 
In many markets, macroeconomic challenges persist. And, of course, foreign exchange has been and will continue to be a considerable headwind as translational low is projected to impact EPS in 2015 over 10% at current foreign exchange rates. That makes us even more pleased to be able to deliver content organic sales growth and positive results on the bottom line. 
While our gross margin was down in the quarter due to very significant transaction costs, we believe that we'll see an improving trend as we move through 2015 with the more benign or material cost environment and pricing taken to offset the impact of rising transaction costs related to foreign exchange. Our funding-the-growth program is robust as ever and our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track. Savings generated in 2014 related to the Global Growth and Efficiency Program were over $100 million after tax and above the top end of our projected range. Overhead expenses are down in the quarter due to tight controls in all divisions and savings from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program. Our total commercial spending also increased in support of both existing and new products. 
We think we're well poised to meet the challenges we face as we enter 2015. We believe our strong balance sheet and a solid cash generation should keep us in good stead. 
So turning to North America. We're very pleased with our progress here. Innovation is contributing to organic sales growth and we had more plans for this year. In the fourth quarter, in the U.S., our market share increased year-to-date in toothpaste and manual toothbrushes and was even with the prior year in mouthwash. Results were strong across our portfolio in toothpaste. Our Colgate Total toothpaste share remains over 10%, supported by fresh, the relaunch of Colgate Total Advanced Whitening and the boost provided by our companion, Colgate Total Lasting White mouthwash. The Colgate Optic White franchises also doing well as the superpremium line is driving incrementality with its year-to-date toothpaste share up from 5.3% to 5.6%. And, as you know, we also launched Colgate enamel health toothpaste and toothbrushes in the second half of 2014. It's off to a strong start and our overall toothpaste share is up 1.4% in the 3 months after its launch as compared to the 3 months prior. 
In the mouthwash category, our year-to-date share is up more than a full point while our 2 major competitors' full year shares declined, with excellent results from Colgate Total Lasting White mouthwash. Our fabric conditioner business continues to perform well. Both for the full year and the quarter, our market share is up over a full point to a new record, close to 20% of the overall market and as you know, these products are primarily sold and Hispanic markets. And as you would expect, we have more innovation slated for 2015 with a full plan for the first quarter. In toothpaste, we're launching Colgate Optic White Express White toothpaste. This innovation provides whiter teeth in just 3 days simply by brushing with best results after 4 weeks of brushing as directed. It's Colgate's fastest whitening toothpaste and is enamel safe for daily use. In the mouthwash category, we're launching Colgate Total Gum Health mouthwash. It provides advanced gum protection for 45% stronger, healthier gums versus a none antibacterial mouthwash. Fast between teeth and along the gum line and it kills 99% of terms on contact with 12-hour protection against bacteria that cause gingivitis. In the toothbrush category, we're launching Colgate sensitive toothbrush plus sensitivity. Using the same innovative pen application technology that's been so successful in the whitening segment. This pen utilizes our patented Pro-Argin Technology to deliver sensitivity relief 24/7 with continued use and goes right to the source of the pain. To begin the momentum in the dish liquid category, we're launching a premium price Palmolive multiservice, which is specially formulated to kill bacteria on dishes and hard, non-core kitchen surfaces. And on the value side, we're launching Ajax all-in-one dish liquid, which has a new formula with 10% more cleaning ingredients than before. And to further our success in the fabric conditioner category, we're launching Suavitel fragrance pro with a proprietary sense system, which provides 5x longer lasting fragrance compared with using detergent alone, as well as Suavitel Fast Dry dryer sheet, which helped loads dry 30% faster than using detergent alone. 
Turning then to Europe/South Pacific. We enjoyed another quarter of organic sales growth in this region with a slight acceleration in volume from the third quarter. Our commercial hub and activities, part of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, are now complete and were implemented with very little disruption. In fact in the quarter, virtually all new hubs delivered positive organic sales growth. Innovation is critical in this part of the world and it continues to contribute to market share growth in a number of our categories. Our market shares across Europe are up year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrush, battery toothbrush, mouthwash, liquid hand soaps and dish liquids. Of note, all categories of our aesthetic business has grown market share year-to-date; shower gel, liquid hand soap and underarm protection. Our launch of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Sugar Acid Neutralizers is now complete across the region with excellent share results in a number of markets. 1 of our first launch markets, Denmark, posted a 4.1% share in the most recent period and 2 larger more recent market launch markets, the U.K. and France, have already achieved 1.5% and 2% shares, respectively in the most recent periods. 
Building on this success in 2015, we will continue full marketing support for the toothpaste along with the further rollout of a companion toothbrush and mouthwash. As I just mentioned, our Sanex business is performing well and we have exciting new product activity to support further growth. Launching in the first quarter is Sanex Advance, Sanex's first bodycare regimen developed with leading dermatologists. Available in 3 different formulations, the regimen will include a body lotion and hand cream to complement the body wash and deodorant. This is Sanex's first entry into the hand and body lotion category. The Sanex Advanced Dermal Repair Bundle for dry skin with minor damage that we contains active restore complex and alantoin to restore pH balance in moisturization. The Sanex advanced derm bundle for extra try atopic skin contains skin-identical lipids and to help restore the skin's protective barrier, itchiness and control hypersensitivity, helping the skin to keep functioning normally. 
The Sanex Advanced Hydrate 24H bundle for very dry, dehydrated skin uses active technology in the shower gel and lotion, which has a ceramide and glycerine to maintain the skin's protective barrier by locking in the moisture. And in addition, we'll be launching Sanex in Poland, a new geography, which will provide incremental new business for us. 
Turning then to Latin America. Business business across this region is solid. Organic sales growth accelerated from the prior 2 quarters in 2014 and while volume increased a modest 1% versus the year ago period, this was on top of the very strong increase of 10% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Toothpaste shares are strong across the region. In Mexico, our most recent share is 80.8%, up 80 basis points from the year-ago period. Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection has achieved 2% share in the most recent period. In Brazil in December, our toothpaste share reached 72.1% for the month, the highest share in the past 18 years. This is in spite of a lot of competitive activity. Our manual toothbrush business is performing well. In Mexico, we achieved a record share of 45% in the latest reading while for the first time our major competitor dropped below the 40% share. Growth was across all retail environments, self-service stores, pharmacies and the indirect trade. We reached a record year-to-date share in Brazil as well with good growth in the superpremium segment with a 32.4% share of the market, the #1 position. In bar soaps, we strengthen our leadership position across the region, up 0.5 point on a year-to-date basis to 29.7% with the most recent read at 29.9%. 
Innovation in both the Palmolive and Protex equities has contributed to this success. And in the home care category, our year-to-date regional market shares have increased in fabric conditioners of 50 basis points to 51.6% and in liquid cleaners, up 70 basis points to 36.3%. And we have more exciting new products planned for 2015 across all our categories. In the first quarter, specifically, we're excited about a new subcategory in their Protex body cleansing category. Feminine intimate wash. Protex is a branded that's recognized as an experts in skin protection and this positioning should transfer readily into the intimate care sub category. It will be launched for the full integrated marketing campaign, including a product website and endorsement through a well-known journalist. Primary replacement in-store will be on the intimate shelves with secondary replacement on the soap shelf to attract attention from from loyal Protex users. 
Turning then to Asia. We're pleased with the acceleration of organic sales growth in this region as we indicated would happened last quarter. And as referenced in the press release, we saw good toothpaste market share gains in a number of countries. In India, our market share increased to 54.4%, up 30 basis points on a year-to-date basis. Colgate Active Salt toothpaste, especially for this market were antibacterial efficacy increased 70 basis points to over a 5% share. In Malaysia, our year-to-date share's up 30 basis points to just over 73%. Anti-cavity segment now comprises almost 27% of the market and Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection toothpaste launched last February has a 3.2% share year-to-date with the most recent lead of 4%. In manual toothbrushes, our regional share increased 20 basis points year-to-date to 30.2%, with 8 out of 10 countries reporting stable to positive growth. In India, our share reached a record 43.2%, up 120 basis points on a year-to-date basis. 
Innovation under the Colgate Slim Soft equity has been particularly successful. And our regional mouthwash share increased 120 basis points year-to-date to 23.1%, with the most recent period at 24.6%. 
Looking forward, in toothpaste, we will be relaunching both our base sensitivity line, as well as the Colgate Sensitive Pro release line. In addition we will be adding Colgate Sensitive Pro release Repair and Prevent. This new product has the unique Coliseum and amino acid complex, which it refers their root cause of sensitivity, preventing the pain from returning. 
In India, we will be launching Colgate Active Salt with. The tree in India is known for its antibacterial properties. In certain markets, we will also introduce a line of kid's toothpaste for children aged 2 to 5, a segment currently somewhat underdeveloped that would present a great incremental opportunity. New in the mouthwash category will be Colgate Plax Bamboo Charcoal and, as you know, charcoal is also widely viewed as an ingredient to fight bacteria. 
Turning then to Africa/Eurasia. This region continues to deliver strong organic sales growth despite some macroeconomic challenges in countries such as Russia. Original toothpaste share is up 10 basis points to 32.4% year-to-date and despite difficulties in Russia and the Ukraine, our year-to-date share is up 10 basis points to 32.9% in Russia and up 170 basis points in the Ukraine to 28.2%. We've also seen good share increases across sub-Saharan Africa and the North Africa. In manual toothbrushes, Colgate 360° and Colgate Slim Soft have helped increase our share in Turkey, up 30 basis points year-to-date to 28.7%. In South Africa, we are up 380 basis points year-to-date to over 38% of the market. And across the region, our mouthwash shares are up 30 basis points year-to-date, approaching 20%. Colgate is the #2 mouthwash brand in Africa/Eurasia. You may recall we told you about the new product in Russia, Colgate Altai Herbs mouthwash. That has contributed to a 210 basis point increase in our Russian mouthwash share to 27.5% year-to-date. We also have a good market-leading shower gel business in this region. Our year-to-date share is up 120 basis points to almost 22%. Russia, Turkey and South Africa have all reached record shares. We've told you on previous calls about our Palmolive Gourmet Spa line with enticing coffee, chocolate, vanilla and peach fragrances. That innovation has been 1 of the drivers of the excellent share performance. And innovation this quarter continues. This for the relaunch of our Colgate Total toothpaste portfolio, we have initiated a new integrated marketing campaign around the idea of the incredible mouth. The idea is that Colgate knows that your mouth is incredible, unique, which is why Colgate developed Colgate Total to protect 100% of your mouth, not only your teeth. 
To continue the momentum in our shower gel business, we're launching Palmolive Taiga Freshness for Men. You may recall we've had great success for the Colgate herbs products toothpaste, mouthwash and body cleansing. Altai is a region in Russia known for its herbs, which are believed to have curative properties. Similarly, Taiga is the Northern Forest characterized by pines, trees and marshes covering much of Northern Eurasia. This new product offers the freshness and cleanness of the legendary Taiga in your shower. Finally, Hill's. We're pleased with Hill's continued good organic sales growth of 4% in the quarter particularly when compared to a strong 7% growth in the year-ago quarter. Innovation has driven good results across our science diet, Prescription Diet and Ideal Balance portfolio. For the science diet portfolio, nutritional consultant Shaffer engagement and superstores and when you sell favorites with your the U.S. has helped drive sales. In Europe, Hill's Science Plan Perfect Weight has been supported with secondary displays in store and in-store weighing area and on-shelf dynamic screens to explain the product benefits. Here in the U.S., Hill's Ideal Balance has gained share in both the wellness and natural segments and consumption of the product in superstores was up strongly versus the year-ago period. In Europe, the product sustained excellent trade acceptance in the U.K. and Germany, 2 large set food markets we've received support with promotional activities and secondary placements. And our Prescription Diet metabolic line continues to made with success. To build on that, this quarter, we're launching Prescription Diet metabolic plus. 32 million pets obesity-related concurrent conditions. This is the first and only dual efficacy therapeutic pet nutrition food. It will be available for weight loss plus mobility for dogs and weight loss plus urinary stress for CATs. The product will be available in both a try and stew format. And also they're excited about the new global packaging redesign across the Prescription Diet range. With consumer friendly packaging and new better tasting for glass, the bundle is they bond the least they bond the least is centigrade a stronger emotional connection, strengthen our leadership and innovation credentials and the improved taste perception. That's rolling out across the U.S., Canada and some of the high-growth markets in the first quarter of 2015 and Europe in the second quarter. 
So in summary, we believe our solid results for the quarter are a good indication that we have an effective strategy and we believe that this consistent strategy has stood as well for many years. You know it well. Staying close to the customer and consumer, innovating everywhere, becoming more effective and efficient and ongoing leadership development. We believe our Executive son the ground have the tools to make the right decision to volume, supporting innovation, in story and outcome increasing market share, all this is winning on the ground. We and our competition alike our faced with choppy times, volatile currency and macroeconomic challenges in many parts of the world so we believe it's a simple consistent focus well understood by every Colgate person that makes the difference. 
And now I'd like to turn it over to Q&A.

And then maybe could you also provide a little update on volume and sales trends in China and Brazil specifically. It looks like things improved as expected in China but you were still battling through some inventory issues in Brazil. Just curious if that's a fair read and just expectations on and how you expect momentum to trend from here."
262247,282217018,751044,"Colgate-Palmolive Co., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Colgate-Palmolive Company","Executives","Well I think as Bina said at the end of her prepared remarks, I guess we live in a world these days where focus is really important but so is agility. And I don't think you saw in the fourth quarter the agility and the balance, I guess, between volume and",672,"Well I think as Bina said at the end of her prepared remarks, I guess we live in a world these days where focus is really important but so is agility. And I don't think you saw in the fourth quarter the agility and the balance, I guess, between volume and price as our 6% was composed of volume growth in all divisions and pricing increases largely in the developing world. So if we take that to the gross profit roll forward, and you go back to the prior year gross profit, 59.1, we benefited from 1.4 points of pricing as you can see a step-up from the prior 3 quarters between our Funding the Growth and restructuring, we had something like 280 basis points of benefit. And then faced the headwind in terms of material prices of some 4.3 points, of which 2 points for the quarter was transaction. And then there were 20 basis points negative of some other minor changes, which gets you to the 58.8% gross margin. Interestingly, although we are where we are, if you were to go back to the October conversation we had and our expectations for the fourth quarter for gross margin to be even with prior year, if you just strip out the exchange deterioration since our October call, in fact, for this quarter, our gross margin would have been at prior year level. What we managed to do by moving quickly on pricing was to offset the dollar impact of foreign exchange but not yet the ratio impact. So that's 2014. When you go forward into 2015, I guess you've got a few things in terms of our view on gross margin. Our view on gross margin for 2015 is that we will expand it between 50 and 100 basis points on the year your now that is going to progress through the year from the first to the fourth quarter. We get a benefit in 2015, of course, from the current oil prices, which we expect to work through towards the end of the first half next year. And, of course, commodity materials, which our forecast would say are more or less flat year-on-year. 
And these are benefits we haven't seen in prior years. We will continue, and indeed already have, take pricing particularly in those emerging markets where we have to meet the transaction impact of foreign exchange because that's what translates into the operating earnings. We will, of course, be focused on our Funding the Growth programs, which again should benefit in 2015 from a more benign cost environment and, of course, we have our restructuring program. So as we begin 2015, we feel good with the expansion target of plus 50 to 100 basis points on gross margin, stepping its way up through the year. Now when you come back to the top line of the company, I think the fourth quarter played out organically pretty much the way we expected it. We see the destocking in China behind us, and that's way we see the 6% organic there and indeed organic growth in the country itself. In terms of Brazil, we said that we would still be working through the destocking in the fourth quarter that, that would be completed in the fourth quarter and then we would move into 2015 and indeed that has been the case. But if you step back and kind of take a look at where is the consumer, we continue to see for our categories that in North America, category growth, and again I'm talking our categories, is between 1% and 2% as we've said on the last call, it is edging wildly up to the upper end of that 1% and 2% range. Europe continues to be more [ph] between 0 and 1%. And across the emerging markets, we continue to feel comfortable with the mid single-digit local currency value growth rates for our categories. So that's the environment we see in 2015, with China and Brazil now behind us."

I think we have demonstrated fairly consistently an ability to deliver pricing to offset the transaction impact of foreign exchange. I think we've demonstrated that in the fourth quarter. And we expect to continue to price as we have already done in some parts of the world. So pricing will be a factor in growth and in our gross margin expansion plans for 2015. And we believe, as we indeed already have, that we will be able to realized that. And I go back to the fourth quarter and say that was a fairly meaningful step-up in pricing in those emerging markets and yet we still had a balance between volume growth and pricing growth. Now when you turn to Latin America, the need for pricing again is driven by foreign exchange. And if you look at Latin America, overall, we took pricing in the fourth quarter and you see pricing up literally across the geography. From Mexico through Central America, Byron the group, Brazil and the Southern. So we took pricing across the Board. In Venezuela as we told you on the last call, we, along with our 2 principal multinational competitors and a large local player down there, on price control categories, got approval to increase pricing. And so we, along with everyone else, increased pricing in Venezuela. And that will roll forward into 2015. But again, you look at Asia, you look at Africa, Eurasia, we're taking pricing in all parts of the world that are affected by foreign exchange."

And again, I come back to the fourth quarter, having taken pricing, we did see volume growth in all of that divisions. Now, of course, that step-up in Venezuelan pricing will ease off as we work our way through 2015 because of Venezuela is much more episodic than many of the other markets. So the answer is yes. And again, back to the consumer behavior, we've continued to see our categories hold in, in the emerging markets at mid-single digits. And remember, as you will see when we file our K, for us, 2014, Venezuela continues to represent about 3% of the company's worldwide sales and only about 1% of the operating margin."

And on top of that, how do you think about your levels of inventory levels at retail? And I also want to touch a little bit on the elasticity of demand in your categories because in the past you said that consumers understand pricing due to 2 FX. But at what point does that equation start to potentially break down because this quarter, you obviously a big acceleration in price and volume really didn't accelerate all that much but can you help us understand the analytics to measure that you don't potentially go overboard on pricing and what do you consider too much? I guess volume actually decelerates to the point where you're seeing negatives, would you consider that to go too foregin? Clearly, I'm painting specifically about Latin America."

I come back and say that we saw volume growth in all of our emerging markets, even with the stepped up pricing we took in the fourth quarter. So we think we have a handle on it, and we think again, remember that types of products we are selling, that we can take the pricing necessary to offset the foreign exchange impacts and continue to balance between volume and price. And indeed, volume slows a little bit when you take the pricing but then that balance comes back. No, on retail inventory, you may remember, we were the first to talk about the destocking in China. And I think that we try to be very transparent about what we saw unfolding in the marketplace. This China destocking is behind us, and I said on the last call that we expect Brazil to work through in the fourth quarter. And it has done. We track not only retail inventory, we track inventory with all of our distributors country-by-country. And we have parameters that actually relate to the return on invested capital that his repair gets in terms of the inventory levels that they would hold. So we have a very clear view on that inventory. And we have a very sharp focus on making sure that it is not at least by our actions, out of balance. What we saw in Brazil and China was a marketplace destocking because of the slowdown in the categories. So I think you can feel confident that we have very much control on that inventory. And remember, as we talked about when we went through those subprime years, in difficult times, products in our categories, if you will, become the simple luxuries that consumers can afford. So the behavior of using these products does not go away when times get slightly tougher."

So can you talk about sort of how much of the transaction piece maybe you're not going to cover. And can you get pricing in developed markets to cover some of the transnational peace.

I mean so when I think about foreign exchange as a headwind, yes, the translation impact is 10% on the bottom line on the top line, we see it's going to be about 7% to 7.5% of the year. So that just gives you the breadth of that. In terms of the transaction impact, that is embedded into our guidance on gross margin being out 50 to 100 basis points per that transaction impact, whether it's the balance sheet aspect of payables in the short-term or the more substantive foreign exchange impact on raw materials or imported finished goods in the medium term, that hits the gross margin squarely. And if you don't recover that, you can't deliver an operating return. So all of of our guidance is assuming our ability to offset that transaction impact. Now remember, offsetting that transaction impact is not just a function of this price increases in any given market place. It can be benefited from mix. It can be benefited from different types of promotional activity that elevate the ASP. We have the benefit of our funding-the-growth program. We have the benefit of the global growth and restructuring program that we have underway. And as I said at the beginning, the benefit of a more benign commodity environment, especially in the area of. If you look in Europe and North America, these price increases are difficult to accomplish. But you saw in the Europe, terrific margin expansion this year. So there, it's going to be some of the other techniques that I think are going to continue to drive gross margin most especially our efforts, the global growth and efficiency program and what we can do with our promotional efficiencies as we go forward rather than list price increases but that's the way we plan the year, John."

So if you look at the balance, in fact in the quarter, our total commercial investment was up as it was for the year. Interestingly, many of our competitors in many large markets around the world eased back on their traditional advertising spend. So in many of those markets actually, our competitive pressure was actually strengthened. Now as we think about 2015, in terms of that traditional market of advertising and promotion, we are planning for that to increase absolutely and as a percentage to sales. And as we have always done, we will continue to balance that as the year unfolds. So we feel very much that the advertising is where we needed to be and I think, candidly, Joe, when you look at the results in the fourth quarter, we've got a 6% organic growth rate and delivered a pretty robust bottom line. And, of course, it's that kind of sustainable top and bottom line growth that we are focused on. You know relative to the overhead, ForEx isn't much of an impact. We continue to expect to make progress in terms of overheads because the Global Growth and Efficiency Program is largely focused in that area rather than gross margin this time around.

In terms of the advertising, yes, you're right. 1 has to be conscious about the brand health as we call it. I will say that the kind of model that perhaps many of us grew up with where what was accounted for in trade spending was inherently bad and only the so-called below-the-line spending was good, I think those days are gone. I think one's ability to take Hispanic consumers in the U.S. that you can reach with in-store activity that may have a component of price but might be much more driven by a coupon that is regionally dropped trucked to high population areas. This kind of techniques are now available and it weren't available before. And you can measure them, retailers can handle different configurations to put them at work with the consumer. But coming back to the brands, we do to tracking work and our tracking work around the world shows that if you take out Oral Care business around the world, the health is very, very good of those brands. So by all means, we track it. Sometimes from a short-term point of view, if couponing or other activity steps up, you have no option at least in part to participate. But I think we've been 1 of the loudest voices, I at least I hope so, in saying that we much prefer to compete in an environment of innovation with marketing support then price motion. But we don't see weakness in brand health. That is something, of course, we have and we'll continue to track."

It is what we are doing with our facilities and it is the expanded use of the Colgate business service centers. And we're very excited by it because we think is we have now seen in Europe, not only does it bring you the immediate term savings but it makes you operate smarter and faster and in a more efficient manner.

Hard to see how to get that without pulling some of the money they put in the market back out. So are you seeing the promotional in densities in those markets? And then secondly, gross margins. I just want to talk a little bit more deeply on the answer to the question earlier. You're signaling sort of neutral commodities maybe even a little bit of fear of it favorability with oil so to steady old-line on price, continued productivity you do the math on that even if you assume transactional headwinds become more substantial in other words this quarter it's still hard not to see a path at least to 150 basis points gross margin expansion.

So if we look at India to not talk about the market share, we're approaching 55 and the competitor in question has about 1.7 share. And our business there continues to be quite strong. In terms of Brazil, I would say yes. The promotional intensity has dropped off a little bit in Brazil, which is a good thing. On gross margin, Jason, and I'm sorry with a glib response. But the gross margin is really 1 of phasing because as I tried to explain earlier, we think that gross margin expansion is very much going to build across the year because although we see the headline lowering the commodity costs and certainly oil, the work of that from our inventory point of view to its effect on resins, bottles, et cetera will take some time to be seen. And on the flip side, the transaction impact when ForEx goes, that hits you straight away, whether it's the stuff you have to pay and your payables, whether it's the dollar-denominated raw materials that replace that which you are now having to pay for. So that's immediate. And go we in that on the gross margin takes a little bit more time. So I do think we'll end next year in a strength and position gross margin wise but it really has also to do with facing.

With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.
We're pleased to exit 2014 with organic sales up 6% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, which was the strongest quarter of last year. Our market shares are strong around the world as you will hear in a moment. As always, innovation has been critical to our success and we're excited about our pipeline looking forward to 2015 and beyond. 
In many markets, macroeconomic challenges persist. And of course, foreign exchange has been and will continue to be a considerable headwind as translation alone is projected to impact EPS in 2015 over 10% at current foreign exchange rates. That makes us even more pleased to be able to deliver continued organic sales growth and positive results on the bottom line. 
While our gross margin was down in the quarter due to very significant transaction costs, we believe that we'll see an improving trend as we move through 2015 with a more benign raw material cost environment and pricing taken to offset the impact of rising transaction costs related to foreign exchange. Our funding-the-growth program is as robust as ever and our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track. Savings generated in 2014 related to the Global Growth and Efficiency Program were over $100 million after tax and above the top end of our projected range. Overhead expenses are down in the quarter due to tight controls in all divisions and savings from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program. Our total commercial spending also increased in support of both existing and new products. 
We think we're well poised to meet the challenges we face as we enter 2015. We believe our strong balance sheet and a solid cash generation should keep us in good stead. 
So turning to North America. We're very pleased with our progress here. Innovation is contributing to organic sales growth and we have more plans for this year. In the fourth quarter, in the U.S., our market share increased year-to-date in toothpaste and manual toothbrushes and was even with the prior year in mouthwash. Results were strong across our portfolio in toothpaste. Our Colgate Total toothpaste share remains over 10%, supported by a graphic refresh, a relaunch of Colgate Total Advanced Whitening and the boost provided by our companion, Colgate Total Lasting White mouthwash. The Colgate Optic White franchise is also doing well as the superpremium line is driving incrementality with its year-to-date toothpaste share up from 5.3% to 5.6%. And as you know, we also launched Colgate Enamel Health Toothpaste and toothbrushes in the second half of 2014. It's off to a strong start and our overall toothpaste share is up 1.4% in the 3 months after its launch as compared to the 3 months prior. 
In the mouthwash category, our year-to-date share is up more than a full point while our 2 major competitors' full year shares declined, with excellent results from Colgate Total Lasting White mouthwash. Our fabric conditioner business continues to perform well. Both for the full year and the quarter, our market share is up over a full point to a new record, close to 20% of the overall market and as you know, these products are primarily sold in Hispanic markets. And as you would expect, we have more innovation slated for 2015 with a full grid plan for the first quarter. In toothpaste, we're launching Colgate Optic White, Express White toothpaste. This innovation provides whiter teeth in just 3 days simply by brushing with best results after 4 weeks of brushing as directed. It's Colgate's fastest whitening toothpaste and is enamel safe for daily use. In the mouthwash category, we're launching Colgate Total Gum Health mouthwash. It provides advanced gum protection for 45% stronger, healthier gums versus a none antibacterial mouthwash. It fights plaque between teeth and along the gum line and kills 99% of germs on contact with 12-hour protection against bacteria that cause gingivitis. In the toothbrush category, we're launching Colgate Sensitive Toothbrush Plus Sensitivity Relief Pen. Using the same innovative pen application technology that has been so successful in the whitening segment. The pen utilizes our patented Pro-Argin Technology to deliver sensitivity relief 24/7 with continued use and goes right to the source of the pain. To rekindle momentum in the dish liquid category, we're launching a premium priced Palmolive multiservice, which is specially formulated to kill bacteria on dishes and hard, nonporous kitchen surfaces. And on the value side, we're launching Ajax all-in-one dish liquid, which has a new formula with 10% more cleaning ingredients than before. And to further our success in the fabric conditioner category, we're launching Suavitel fragrance pro with a proprietary scent system, which provides 5x longer lasting fragrance compared with using detergent alone as well as Suavitel Fast Dry dryer sheet, which helps clothes dry 30% faster than using detergent alone. 
Turning then to Europe/South Pacific. We enjoyed another quarter of organic sales growth in this region with a slight acceleration in volume from the third quarter. Our commercial hubbing activities, part of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, are now complete and were implemented with very little disruption. In fact in the quarter, virtually all new hubs delivered positive organic sales growth. Innovation is critical in this part of the world and it continues to contribute to market share growth in a number of our categories. Our market shares across Europe are up year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrush, battery toothbrush, mouthwash, liquid hand soap and dish liquid. Of note, all categories of our Sanex business has grown market share year-to-date; shower gel, liquid hand soap and underarm protection. Our launch of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Sugar Acid Neutralizer is now complete across the region with excellent share results in a number of markets. One of our first launch markets, Denmark, posted a 4.1% share in the most recent period and 2 larger more recent market launch markets, the U.K. and France, have already achieved 1.5% and 2% shares, respectively, in the most recent periods. 
Building on this success in 2015, we will continue full marketing support for the toothpaste along with a further rollout of a companion toothbrush and mouthwash. As I just mentioned, our Sanex business is performing well and we have some exciting new product activity to support further growth. Launching in the first quarter is Sanex ADVANCED, Sanex's first bodycare regimen developed with leading dermatologists. Available in 3 different formulations, the regimen will include a body lotion and hand cream to complement the body wash and deodorant. This is Sanex's first entry into the hand and body lotion category. The Sanex ADVANCED Dermo Repair bundle for dry skin with minor damage contains active restore complex and allantoin to restore pH balance and moisturization. The Sanex ADVANCED atopi [ph] derm bundle for extra try atopic skin contains skin-identical lipids and emollients to help restore the skin's protective barrier, sooth itchiness and control hypersensitivity, helping the skin to keep functioning normally. 
The Sanex Advanced Hydrate 24H bundle for very dry, dehydrated skin uses Ceragly Activ Technology in the shower gel and lotion, which has pseudo-ceramide and glycerine to maintain the skin's protective barrier by locking in the moisture. And in addition, we'll be launching Sanex in Poland, a new geography, which will provide incremental new business for us. 
Turning then to Latin America. Business across this region is solid. Organic sales growth accelerated from the prior 2 quarters in 2014 and while volume increased a modest 1% versus the year-ago period, this was on top of a very strong increase of 10% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Toothpaste shares are strong across the region. In Mexico, our most recent share is 80.8%, up 80 basis points from the year-ago period. Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection has achieved a 2% share in the most recent period. In Brazil in December, our toothpaste share reached 72.1% for the month, the highest share in the past 18 years. This is in spite of a lot of competitive activity. Our manual toothbrush business is performing well. In Mexico, we achieved a record share of 45% in the latest reading, while for the first time our major competitor dropped below the 40% share. Growth was across all retail environments, self-service stores, pharmacies and the indirect trade. We reached a record year-to-date share in Brazil as well with good growth in the superpremium segment with a 32.4% share of the market, the #1 position. In bar soaps, we've strengthened our leadership position across the region, up 0.5 point on a year-to-date basis to 29.7% with the most recent read at 29.9%. 
Innovation in both the Palmolive and Protex equities has contributed to this success. And in the Home Care category, our year-to-date regional market shares have increased in fabric conditioners up 50 basis points to 51.6% and in liquid cleaners, up 70 basis points to 36.3%. And we have more exciting new products planned for 2015 across all our categories. In the first quarter, specifically, we're excited about a new subcategory in the Protex body cleansing category, feminine intimate wash. Protex is a brand that's recognized as an expert in skin protection and this positioning should transfer readily into the intimate care sub category. It will be launched with a fully integrated marketing campaign, including a product website and endorsements from a well-known journalist. Primary replacement in-store will be on the intimate shelf with secondary placement on the soap shelf to attract attention from loyal Protex users. 
Turning then to Asia. We're pleased with the acceleration of organic sales growth in this region as we indicate would happen last quarter. And as referenced in the press release, we saw good toothpaste market share gains in a number of countries. In India, our market shares increased to 54.4%, up 30 basis points on a year-to-date basis. Colgate Active Salt toothpaste developed especially for this market, where salt connotes the antibacterial efficacy, increased 70 basis points to over a 5% share. In Malaysia, our year-to-date share is up 30 basis points to just over 73%. The anti-cavity segment now comprises almost 27% of the market and Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection toothpaste, launched last February, has a 3.2% share year-to-date with the most recent read of 4%. In manual toothbrushes, our regional share increased 20 basis points year-to-date to 30.2%, with 8 out of 10 countries reporting stable to positive growth. In India, our share reached a record 43.2%, up 120 basis points on a year-to-date basis. 
Innovation under the Colgate Slim Soft equity has been particularly successful. And our regional mouthwash share increased 120 basis points year-to-date to 23.1%, with the most recent period at 24.6%. 
Looking forward, in toothpaste, we will be relaunching both our base sensitivity line as well as the Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief line. In addition, we will be adding Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair & Prevent. This new product has a unique calcium and amino acid complex, which repairs the root cause of sensitivity, preventing the pain from returning. 
In India, we will be launching Colgate Active Salt with Neem. Neem tree in India is known for its antibacterial properties. In certain markets, we will also introduce a line of kid's toothpaste for children age 2 to 5, a segment currently somewhat underdeveloped would present a great incremental opportunity. New in the mouthwash category will be Colgate Plax Bamboo Charcoal and, as you know, charcoal is also widely viewed as an ingredient to fight bacteria. 
Turning then to Africa/Eurasia. This region continues to deliver strong organic sales growth despite some macroeconomic challenges in countries such as Russia. Our regional toothpaste share is up 10 basis points to 32.4% year-to-date and despite difficulties in Russia and the Ukraine, our year-to-date share is up 10 basis points to 32.9% in Russia and up 170 basis points in the Ukraine to 28.2%. We've also seen good share increases across sub-Saharan Africa and the North Africa. In manual toothbrushes, Colgate 360° and Colgate Slim Soft have helped increase our share in Turkey, up 30 basis points year-to-date to 28.7%. In South Africa, we are up 380 basis points year-to-date to over 38% of the market. And across the region, our mouthwash shares are up 30 basis points year-to-date, approaching 20%. Colgate is the #2 mouthwash brand in Africa/Eurasia. You may recall, we told you about the new product in Russia, Colgate Altai Herbs mouthwash. That has contributed to a 210 basis point increase in our Russian mouthwash share to 27.5% year-to-date. We also have a good market-leading shower gel business in this region. Our year-to-date share is up 120 basis points to almost 22%. Russia, Turkey and South Africa have all reached record shares. We've told you on previous calls about our Palmolive Gourmet Spa line with enticing coffee, chocolate, vanilla and peach fragrances. That innovation has been one of the drivers of the excellent share performance. And innovation this quarter continues. To support our relaunch of our Colgate Total toothpaste portfolio, we have initiated a new integrated marketing campaign around the idea of the incredible mouth. The idea is that Colgate knows that your mouth is incredible, unique, which is why Colgate developed Colgate Total to protect 100% of your mouth, not only your teeth. 
To continue the momentum in our shower gel business, we're launching Palmolive Taiga Freshness for Men. You may recall we've had great success for the Colgate Altai herbs products, toothpaste, mouthwash and body cleansing. Altai is a region in Russia known for its herbs, which are believed to have curative properties. Similarly, Taiga is a Northern Forest characterized by pines, [indiscernible] and marshes covering much of Northern Eurasia. This new product offers the freshness and cleanness of the legendary Taiga in your shower. Finally, Hill's. We're pleased with Hill's continued good organic sales growth of 4% in the quarter particularly when compared to a strong 7% growth in the year-ago quarter. Innovation has driven good results across our Science Diet, Prescription Diet and Ideal Balance portfolio. For the Science Diet portfolio, nutritional consultant, shopper engagement at superstores and sampling of our new salty savory treats here in the U.S. has helped drive sales. In Europe, Hill's Science Plan Perfect Weight has been supported with secondary displays in store and in-store weighing area and on-shelf dynamic screens to explain the product benefits. Here in the U.S., Hill's Ideal Balance has gained share in both the wellness and natural segments and consumption of the product in superstores was up strongly versus the year-ago period. In Europe, the product has gained excellent trade acceptance in the U.K. and Germany, 2 large pet food markets, and received support with promotional activities and secondary placements. And our Prescription Diet metabolic line continues to meet with success. To build on that, this quarter, we're launching Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus. 32 million pets have obesity-related concurrent conditions. This is the first and only dual efficacy therapeutic pet nutrition food. It will be available for weight loss plus mobility for dogs and weight loss plus urinary stress for cats. The product will be available in both a dry and stew format. And we're also very excited about the new global packaging redesign across the Prescription Diet range. With more consumer-friendly packaging and new better-tasting formulas, the bundle is designed to create a stronger emotional connection, strengthen our leadership and innovation credentials and improve taste perception. That's rolling out across the U.S., Canada and some of the high-growth markets in the first quarter of 2015 and Europe in the second quarter. 
So in summary, we believe our solid results for the quarter are a good indication that we have an effective strategy and we believe that this consistent strategy has stood as well for many years. You know it well. Staying close to the customer and consumer, innovating everywhere, becoming more effective and efficient and ongoing leadership development. We believe our executives on the ground have the tools to make the right decision. Balancing price and volume; supporting innovation, in-store and out; increasing market share. All this is winning on the ground. We and our competition alike our faced with choppy times, volatile swings in currency and macroeconomic challenges in many parts of the world. So we believe it's a simple consistent focus well understood by every Colgate person that makes the difference. 
And now I'd like to turn it over to Q&A.

And I think you saw in the fourth quarter the agility and the balance, I guess, between volume and price as our 6% was composed of volume growth in all divisions and pricing increases largely in the developing world. So if we take that to the gross profit roll forward, and you go back to the prior year gross profit, 59.1, we benefited from 1.4 points of pricing as you can see a step-up from the prior 3 quarters between our Funding the Growth and restructuring, we had something like 280 basis points of benefit. And then faced a headwind in terms of material prices of some 4.3 points, of which 2 points for the quarter was transaction. And then we're 20 basis points negative of some other minor changes, which gets you to the 58.8% gross margin. Interestingly, although we are where we are, if you were to go back to the October conversation we had and our expectations for the fourth quarter for gross margin to be even with prior year, if you just stripped out the exchange deterioration since our October call, in fact, for this quarter, our gross margin would have been at prior year level. What we manage to do by moving quickly on pricing was to offset the dollar impact of the foreign exchange but not yet the ratio impact. So that's 2014. When you go forward into 2015, I guess you've got a few things in terms of our view on gross margin. Our view on gross margin for 2015 is that we will expand it between 50 and 100 basis points on the year. Now that is going to progress through the year from the first to the fourth quarter. We get a benefit in 2015, of course, from the current oil prices, which we expect to work through towards the end of the first half next year. And of course, commodity materials, which our forecast would say are more or less flat year-on-year. 
And these are benefits we haven't seen in prior years. We will continue, and indeed already have, take pricing particularly in those emerging markets where we have to meet the transaction impact of foreign exchange because that's what translates into the operating earnings. We will, of course, be focused on our Funding the Growth programs, which again should benefit in 2015 from a more benign cost environment and, of course, we have our restructuring program. So as we begin 2015, we feel good with the expansion target of plus 50 to 100 basis points on gross margin, stepping its way up through the year. Now when you come back to the top line of the company, I think the fourth quarter played out organically pretty much the way we expected it. We see the destocking in China behind us, and that's why we see the 6% organic there and indeed organic growth in the country itself. In terms of Brazil, we said that we would still be working through the destocking in the fourth quarter that, that would be completed in the fourth quarter and then we would move into 2015 and indeed that has been the case. But if you step back and kind of take a look at where is the consumer, we continue to see for our categories that in North America, category growth, and again I'm talking our categories, is between 1% and 2%. As we said on the last call, it is edging wildly up to the upper end of that 1% and 2% range. Europe continues to be more even between 0% and 1%. And across the emerging markets, we continue to feel comfortable with the mid single-digit local currency value growth rates for our categories. So that's the environment we see in 2015, with China and Brazil now behind us."

The -- I think we have demonstrated fairly consistently an ability to deliver pricing to offset the transaction impact of foreign exchange. I think we demonstrated that in the fourth quarter. And we expect to continue to price as we have already done in some parts of the world. So pricing will be a factor in growth and in our gross margin expansion plans for 2015. And we believe, as we indeed already have, that we will be able to realize that. And I go back to the fourth quarter and say that was a fairly meaningful step-up in pricing in those emerging markets and yet we still had a balance between volume growth and pricing growth. Now when you turn to Latin America, the need for pricing again is driven by foreign exchange. And if you look at Latin America, overall, we took pricing in the fourth quarter and you see pricing up literally across the geography. From Mexico through Central America, our Andian [ph] group, Venezuela, Brazil and the Southern comb. So we took pricing across the board. In Venezuela, as we told you on the last call, we, along with our 2 principal multinational competitors and a large local player down there, on price-controlled categories, got approval to increase pricing. And so we, along with everyone else, increased pricing in Venezuela. And that will roll forward into 2015. But again, you look at Asia, you look at Africa, Eurasia, we're taking pricing in all parts of the world that are affected by foreign exchange."

But I think what we're all trying to figure out is as it relates to the sustainability of it, was Venezuela and Argentina a disproportionate driver of that, right? In other words, can we feel comfortable with the assumption that you guys were able to hold volume very well across the segment broadly and the numbers aren't necessarily skewed by Venezuela and Argentina?"

And again, I come back to the fourth quarter, having taken pricing, we did see volume growth in all of our divisions. Now of course, that step-up in Venezuelan pricing will ease off as we work our way through 2015 because Venezuela is much more episodic than many of the other markets. So the answer is yes. And again, back to the consumer behavior, we continue to see our categories hold in, in the emerging markets at mid-single digits. And remember, as you will see when we file our K, for us, 2014, Venezuela continues to represent about 3% of the company's worldwide sales and only about 1% of the operating margin."

And I also want to touch a little bit on the elasticity of demand in your categories because in the past you said that consumers understand pricing due to FX. But at what point does that equation start to potentially break down because this quarter, you obviously saw a big acceleration in price and volume really didn't decelerate all that much. But can you help us understand the analytics to measure you don't potentially go overboard on pricing and what do you consider too much? I guess volume actually decelerates to the point where you're seeing negatives. Would you consider that to go too foreign? Clearly, I'm thinking specifically about Latin America."

I come back and say we saw volume growth in all of our emerging markets, even with the stepped up pricing we took in the fourth quarter. So we think we have a handle on it, and we think again, remember the types of products we are selling, that we can take the pricing necessary to offset the foreign exchange impacts and continue to remain that balance between volume and price. And indeed, volume slows a little bit when you take the pricing but then that balance comes back. Look, on retail inventory, you may remember, we were the first to talk about the destocking in China. And I think we tried to be very transparent about what we saw unfolding in the marketplace. The China destocking is behind us, and I said on the last call that we expected Brazil to work through in the fourth quarter. And it has done. We track not only retail inventory, we track inventory with all of our distributors country-by-country. And we have parameters that actually relate back to the return on invested capital the distributor gets in terms of the inventory levels that they would hold. So we have a very clear view on that inventory. And we have a very sharp focus on making sure that it is not, at least by our actions, out of balance. What we saw in Brazil and China was a marketplace destocking because of the slowdown in the categories. So I think you can feel confident that we have very much control on that inventory. And remember, as we talked about when we went through those subprime years, in difficult times, products in our categories, if you will, become the simple luxuries that consumers can afford. So the behavior of using these products does not go away when times get slightly tougher."

So can you talk a little bit about the -- the transaction piece is a little bit different now given what we've seen in terms of the move in the euro and some of the other more developed markets currencies, which obviously are negative. So can you talk about sort of how much of the transaction piece maybe you're not going to cover? And can you get pricing in developed markets to cover some of the transnational piece? Is that a possibility even or is that something where you basically say, you know what, we're going to have to eat that impact given where the market is right now?"

Let me just complete what Bina said. I mean so when you think about foreign exchange as a headwind, yes, the translation impact is 10% on the bottom line.

I mean so when you think about foreign exchange as a headwind, yes, the translation impact is 10% on the bottom line. On the top line, we see it's going to be about 7% to 7.5% on the year. So that just gives you the breadth of that. In terms of the transaction impact, that is bedded into our guidance on gross margin being up 50 to 100 basis points. The transaction impact, whether it's the balance sheet aspect of payables in the short term or the more substantive foreign exchange impact on raw materials or imported finished goods in the medium term, that hits the gross margin squarely. And if you don't recover that, you can't deliver an operating return. So all of our guidance is assuming our ability to offset that transaction impact. Now remember, offsetting that transaction impact is not just a function of list price increases in any given market place. It can be benefited from mix. It could be benefited from different types of promotional activity that elevate the ASP. We have the benefit of our funding-the-growth program. We have the benefit of the global growth and restructuring program that we have underway. And as I said at the beginning, the benefit of a more benign commodity environment, especially in the area of oil. Now if you look at Europe and North America, list price increases are difficult to accomplish. But you saw in Europe, terrific margin expansion this year. So there, it's going to be some of the other techniques that I think are going to continue to drive gross margin most especially our funding-the-growth efforts, the global growth and efficiency program and what we can do with our promotional efficiencies as we go forward rather than list price increases but that's the way we plan the year, John."

So if you look at the balance, in fact, in the quarter, our total commercial investment was up as it was for the year. Interestingly, many of our competitors in many large markets around the world eased back on their traditional advertising spend. So in many of those markets actually, our competitive pressure was actually strengthened. Now as we think about 2015, in terms of that traditional bucket of advertising and promotion, we are planning for that to increase absolutely and as a percentage to sales. And as we have always done, we will continue to balance that as the year unfolds. So we feel very much that the advertising is where we needed to be and I think, candidly, Joe, when you look at the results in the fourth quarter, we've got a 6% organic growth rate and delivered a pretty robust bottom line. And of course, it's that kind of sustainable top and bottom line growth that we are focused on. Relative to the overhead, ForEx isn't much of an impact. We continue to expect to make progress in terms of overheads because the Global Growth and Efficiency Program is largely focused in that area rather than gross margin this time around.

Well, as you heard from many, there is a lag, things in life have a way of going up quicker than they come down. If you take oil, the most immediate benefit you get tends to be in freight because that price is quite quickly. And so we've got a little bit of the benefit in the fourth quarter, very modest, and we expect that to benefit us starting in this quarter in 2015. When you talk about the flow-through benefits of the resin impact and the other material impacts, that will start to benefit us towards the end of the first half partly related to it working through the system, partly related to our own inventory levels. You have to work those through before you get the benefit, which is why we make the point that as we build to that 50 to 100 basis points gross margin improvement, it is going to build across the year because the commodity benefits will really start flowing in, in the second quarter."

We have, we think, been quite responsible with the benefit of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program in Europe in making sure that our commercial investments, including traditional advertising and promotion, are appropriate for both the European category growth rates and the competitors we meet in Europe.

Well, no, even if you did drop off, Ali, we didn't provide that information on Venezuela and we won't now. But the point I did make relative to Venezuela, indeed, Latin America is that we feel pricing across Latin America in the fourth quarter. In the case of Venezuela, yes, it was episodic as we said in the third quarter, it would be because we haven't had pricing for several years. That same episodic benefit also benefited our principal multinational competitors who got the same government approvals on key categories for them at exactly the same time we got ours. And indeed the local competitor was granted pricing as well. So everybody benefited from pricing in Venezuela. But the point to make is we took pricing across the board and in an environment where everybody was getting pricing. Our global growth rate was indeed 6%. In terms of the advertising, yes, you're right. One has to be conscious about the brand health, as we call it. I will say that the kind of model that perhaps many of us grew up with where what was accounted for in trade spending was inherently bad and only the so-called below-the-line spending was good. I think those days are gone. I think one's ability to take Hispanic consumers in the U.S. that you can reach with in-store activity that may have a component of price but might be much more driven by a coupon that is regionally dropped to high-population areas. These kind of techniques are now available and they weren't available before. And you can measure them, you can execute them. Retailers can handle different configurations to put them at work with the consumer. But coming back to the brands. We do, do tracking work and our tracking work around the world shows that if you take out Oral Care business around the world, the health is very, very good of those brands. So by all means, we track it. Sometimes from a short-term point of view, if couponing or other activity steps up, you have no option at least in part to participate. But I think we've been one of the loudest voices, at least I hope so, in saying that we much prefer to compete in an environment of innovation with marketing support than price promotion. But we don't see weakness in brand health. That is something, of course, we have and we'll continue to track."

Hard to see how they get that without pulling some of the money they put in the market back out. So are you seeing the promotional intensity ease in those markets? And then secondly, gross margins. I just wanted to talk a little bit more deeply and answer to the question earlier. You're signaling sort of neutral commodities, maybe even a little bit of favorability with oil. So to steady hold the line on price, continued productivity, you do the math on that even if you assume that transactional headwinds become more substantial than they were this quarter, it's still hard not to see a path at least to 150 basis points of gross margin expansion.

In terms of Brazil, I would say yes. The promotional intensity has dropped off a little bit in Brazil, which is a good thing. On gross margin, Jason, and I'm sorry with the glib response. But the gross margin is really one of phasing because as I tried to explain earlier, we think that gross margin expansion is very much going to build across the year because although we see the headline lowering of commodity costs and certainly oil, the work through of that from our inventory point of view to its effect on resins, bottles, et cetera will take some time to be seen. And on the flip side, the transaction impact when ForEx goes against you, that hits you straight away, whether it's the stuff you have to pay and your payables, whether it's the dollar-denominated raw materials that replace that which you are now having to pay for. So that's immediate. And the win back on the gross margin takes a little bit more time. So I do think we'll end next year in a strengthened position, gross margin-wise, but it really has all to do with facing. So I believe these are all the questions we have?"

With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.
We're pleased to exit 2014 with organic sales up 6% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, which was the strongest quarter of last year. Our market shares are strong around the world as you will hear in a moment. As always, innovation has been critical to our success and we're excited about our pipeline looking forward to 2015 and beyond. 
In many markets, macroeconomic challenges persist. And of course, foreign exchange has been and will continue to be a considerable headwind as translation alone is projected to impact EPS in 2015 over 10% at current foreign exchange rates. That makes us even more pleased to be able to deliver continued organic sales growth and positive results on the bottom line. 
While our gross margin was down in the quarter due to very significant transaction costs, we believe that we'll see an improving trend as we move through 2015 with a more benign raw material cost environment and pricing taken to offset the impact of rising transaction costs related to foreign exchange. Our funding-the-growth program is as robust as ever and our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track. Savings generated in 2014 related to the Global Growth and Efficiency Program were over $100 million after tax and above the top end of our projected range. Overhead expenses are down in the quarter due to tight controls in all divisions and savings from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program. Our total commercial spending also increased in support of both existing and new products. 
We think we're well poised to meet the challenges we face as we enter 2015. We believe our strong balance sheet and solid cash generation should keep us in good stead. 
So turning to North America. We're very pleased with our progress here. Innovation is contributing to organic sales growth and we have more planned for this year. In the fourth quarter, in the U.S., our market share increased year-to-date in toothpaste and manual toothbrushes and was even with the prior year in mouthwash. Results were strong across our portfolio in toothpaste. Our Colgate Total toothpaste share remains over 10%, supported by a graphic refresh, a relaunch of Colgate Total Advanced Whitening and the boost provided by our companion, Colgate Total Lasting White mouthwash. The Colgate Optic White franchise is also doing well as the superpremium line is driving incrementality with its year-to-date toothpaste share up from 5.3% to 5.6%. And as you know, we also launched Colgate Enamel Health Toothpaste and toothbrushes in the second half of 2014. It's off to a strong start and our overall toothpaste share is up 1.4% in the 3 months after its launch as compared to the 3 months prior. 
In the mouthwash category, our year-to-date share is up more than a full point while our 2 major competitors' full year shares declined, with excellent results from Colgate Total Lasting White mouthwash. Our fabric conditioner business continues to perform well. Both for the full year and the quarter, our market share is up over a full point to a new record, close to 20% of the overall market and as you know, these products are primarily sold in Hispanic markets. Now as you'd expect, we have more innovation slated for 2015 with a full grid [ph]  Planned for the first quarter. In toothpaste, we're launching Colgate Optic White, Express White toothpaste. This innovation provides whiter teeth in just 3 days simply by brushing with best results after 4 weeks of brushing as directed. It's Colgate's fastest whitening toothpaste and is enamel-safe for daily use. In the mouthwash category, we're launching Colgate Total Gum Health mouthwash. It provides advanced gum protection for 45% stronger, healthier gums versus a none antibacterial mouthwash. It fights plaque between teeth and along the gum line and kills 99% of germs on contact with 12-hour protection against bacteria that cause gingivitis. In the toothbrush category, we're launching Colgate Sensitive Toothbrush Plus Sensitivity Relief Pen, using the same innovative pen application technology that has been so successful in the whitening segment. The pen utilizes our patented Pro-Argin Technology to deliver sensitivity relief 24/7 with continued use and goes right to the source of the pain. To rekindle momentum in the dish liquid category, we're launching a premium priced Palmolive multiservice, which is specially formulated to kill bacteria on dishes and hard, nonporous kitchen surfaces. And on the value side, we're launching Ajax all-in-one dish liquid, which has a new formula with 10% more cleaning ingredients than before. And to further our success in the fabric conditioner category, we're launching Suavitel fragrance pro with a proprietary scent system, which provides 5x longer lasting fragrance compared with using detergent alone as well as Suavitel Fast Dry dryer sheets, which help clothes dry 30% faster than using detergent alone. 
Turning then to Europe/South Pacific. We enjoyed another quarter of organic sales growth in this region with a slight acceleration in volume from the third quarter. Our commercial hubbing activities, part of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, are now complete and were implemented with very little disruption. In fact in the quarter, virtually all new hubs delivered positive organic sales growth. Innovation is critical in this part of the world and it continues to contribute to market share growth in a number of our categories. Our market shares across Europe are up year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrush, battery toothbrush, mouthwash, liquid hand soap and dish liquid. Of note, all categories of our Sanex business have grown market share year-to-date: shower gel, liquid hand soap and underarm protection. Our launch of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Sugar Acid Neutralizer is now complete across the region with excellent share results in a number of markets. One of our first launch markets, Denmark, posted a 4.1% share in the most recent period and 2 larger more recent market launch markets, the U.K. and France, have already achieved 1.5% and 2% shares, respectively, in the most recent period. 
Building on this success in 2015, we will continue full marketing support for the toothpaste along with a further rollout of a companion toothbrush and mouthwash. As I just mentioned, our Sanex business is performing well and we have some exciting new product activity to support further growth. Launching in the first quarter is Sanex ADVANCED, Sanex's first bodycare regimen developed with leading dermatologists. Available in 3 different formulations, the regimen will include a body lotion and hand cream to complement the body wash and deodorant. This is Sanex's first entry into the hand and body lotion category. The Sanex ADVANCED Dermo Repair bundle for dry skin with minor damage contains active restore complex and allantoin to restore pH balance and moisturization. The Sanex ADVANCED atopi [ph] derm bundle for extra try atopic skin contains skin-identical lipids and emollients to help restore the skin's protective barrier, sooth itchiness and control hypersensitivity, helping the skin to keep functioning normally. 
The Sanex Advanced Hydrate 24H bundle for very dry, dehydrated skin uses Ceragly Activ Technology in the shower gel and lotion, which has pseudo-ceramide and glycerine to maintain the skin's protective barrier by locking in the moisture. And in addition, we'll be launching Sanex in Poland, a new geography, which will provide incremental new business for us. 
Turning then to Latin America. Business across this region is solid. Organic sales growth accelerated from the prior 2 quarters in 2014 and while volume increased a modest 1% versus the year-ago period, this was on top of a very strong increase of 10% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Toothpaste shares are strong across the region. In Mexico, our most recent share is 80.8%, up 80 basis points from the year-ago period. Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection has achieved a 2% share in the most recent period. In Brazil in December, our toothpaste share reached 72.1% for the month, the highest share in the past 18 years. This is in spite of a lot of competitive activity. Our manual toothbrush business is performing well. In Mexico, we achieved a record share of 45% in the latest readings, while for the first time our major competitor dropped below a 40% share. Growth was across all retail environments: self-service stores, pharmacies and the indirect trade. We reached a record year-to-date share in Brazil as well with good growth in the superpremium segment with a 32.4% share of the market, the #1 position. In bar soaps, we've strengthened our leadership position across the region, up 0.5 point on a year-to-date basis to 29.7% with the most recent read at 29.9%. 
Innovation in both the Palmolive and Protex equities has contributed to this success. And in the Home Care category, our year-to-date regional market shares have increased in fabric conditioners up 50 basis points to 51.6% and in liquid cleaners, up 70 basis points to 36.3%. And we have more exciting new products planned for 2015 across all our categories. In the first quarter, specifically, we're excited about a new subcategory in the Protex body cleansing category, feminine intimate wash. Protex is a brand that's recognized as an expert in skin protection and this positioning should transfer readily into the intimate care sub category. It will be launched with a fully integrated marketing campaign, including a product website and endorsements from a well-known journalist. Primary replacement in-store will be on the intimate shelf with secondary placement on the soap shelf to attract attention from loyal Protex users. 
Turning then to Asia. We're pleased with the acceleration of organic sales growth in this region as we indicated would happen last quarter. And as referenced in the press release, we saw good toothpaste market share gains in a number of countries. In India, our market shares increased to 54.4%, up 30 basis points on a year-to-date basis. Colgate Active Salt toothpaste developed especially for this market, where salt connotes a antibacterial efficacy, increased 70 basis points to over a 5% share. In Malaysia, our year-to-date share is up 30 basis points to just over 73%. The anti-cavity segment now comprises almost 27% of the market and Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection toothpaste, launched last February, has a 3.2% share year-to-date with the most recent read of 4%. In manual toothbrushes, our regional share increased 20 basis points year-to-date to 30.2%, with 8 out of 10 countries reporting stable to positive growth. In India, our share reached a record 43.2%, up 120 basis points on a year-to-date basis. 
Innovation under the Colgate Slim Soft equity has been particularly successful. And our regional mouthwash share increased 120 basis points year-to-date to 23.1%, with the most recent period at 24.6%. 
Looking forward, in toothpaste, we will be relaunching both our base sensitivity line as well as the Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief line. In addition, we will be adding Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair & Prevent. This new product has a unique calcium and amino acid complex, which repairs the root cause of sensitivity, preventing the pain from returning. 
In India, we will be launching Colgate Active Salt with Neem. The Neem tree in India is known for its antibacterial properties. In certain markets, we will also introduce a line of kid's toothpaste for children aged 2 to 5, a segment currently somewhat underdeveloped which presents a great incremental opportunity. New in the mouthwash category will be Colgate Plax Bamboo Charcoal and, as you know, charcoal is also widely viewed as an ingredient to fight bacteria. 
Turning then to Africa/Eurasia. This region continues to deliver strong organic sales growth despite some macroeconomic challenges in countries such as Russia. Our regional toothpaste share is up 10 basis points to 32.4% year-to-date and despite difficulties in Russia and the Ukraine, our year-to-date share is up 10 basis points to 32.9% in Russia and up 170 basis points in the Ukraine to 28.2%. We've also seen good share increases across sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa. In manual toothbrushes, Colgate 360° and Colgate Slim Soft have helped increase our share in Turkey, up 30 basis points year-to-date to 28.7%. In South Africa, we are up 380 basis points year-to-date to over 38% of the market. And across the region, our mouthwash share is up 30 basis points year-to-date, approaching 20%. Colgate is the #2 mouthwash brand in Africa/Eurasia. You may recall, we told you about a new product in Russia, Colgate Altai Herbs mouthwash. That has contributed to a 210 basis point increase in our Russian mouthwash share to 27.5% year-to-date. We also have a good market-leading shower gel business in this region. Our year-to-date share is up 120 basis points to almost 22%. Russia, Turkey and South Africa have all reached record shares. We've told you on previous calls about our Palmolive Gourmet Spa line with enticing coffee, chocolate, vanilla and peach fragrances. That innovation has been one of the drivers of the excellent share performance. And innovation this quarter continues. To support our relaunch of our Colgate Total toothpaste portfolio, we have initiated a new integrated marketing campaign around the idea of the incredible mouth. The idea is that Colgate knows that your mouth is incredible, unique, which is why Colgate developed Colgate Total to protect 100% of your mouth, not only your teeth. 
To continue the momentum in our shower gel business, we're launching Palmolive Taiga Freshness for Men. You may recall we've had great success with Colgate Altai herbs products: toothpaste, mouthwash and body cleansing. Altai is a region in Russia known for its herbs, which are believed to have curative properties. Similarly, Taiga is a Northern Forest characterized by pines, spruces and larches, covering much of Northern Eurasia. This new product offers the freshness and cleanliness of the legendary Taiga in your shower. Finally, Hill's. We're pleased with Hill's continued good organic sales growth of 4% in the quarter, particularly when compared to a strong 7% growth in the year-ago quarter. Innovation has driven good results across our Science Diet, Prescription Diet and Ideal Balance portfolio. For the Science Diet portfolio, nutritional consultants, shopper engagement at superstores and sampling of our new soft savory treats here in the U.S. have helped drive sales. In Europe, Hill's Science Plan Perfect Weight has been supported with secondary displays in store and in-store weighing area and on-shelf dynamic screens to explain the product benefits. Here in the U.S., Hill's Ideal Balance has gained share in both the wellness and natural segments and consumption of the product in superstores was up strongly versus the year-ago period. In Europe, the product has gained excellent trade acceptance in the U.K. and Germany -- 2 large pet food markets -- and received support with promotional activities and secondary placements. And our Prescription Diet metabolic line continues to meet with success. To build on that, this quarter, we're launching Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus. 32 million pets have obesity-related concurrent conditions. This is the first and only dual efficacy therapeutic pet nutrition food. It will be available for weight loss plus mobility for dogs and weight loss plus urinary stress for cats. The product will be available in both dry and stew format. And we're also very excited about the new global packaging redesign across the Prescription Diet range. With more consumer-friendly packaging and new better-tasting formulas, the bundle is designed to create a stronger emotional connection, strengthen our leadership and innovation credentials and improve taste perception. That's rolling out across the U.S., Canada and some of the high-growth markets in the first quarter of 2015 and Europe in the second quarter. 
So in summary, we believe our solid results for the quarter are a good indication that we have an effective strategy and we believe that this consistent strategy has stood as well for many years. You know it well. Staying close to the customer and consumer, innovating everywhere, becoming more effective and efficient and ongoing leadership development. We believe our executives on the ground have the tools to make the right decision. Balancing price and volume; supporting innovation, in-store and out; increasing market share. All this is winning on the ground. We and our competition alike our faced with choppy times, volatile swings in currency and macroeconomic challenges in many parts of the world. So we believe it's a simple consistent focus well understood by every Colgate person that makes the difference. 
And now I'd like to turn it over to Q&A.

And I think you saw in the fourth quarter the agility and the balance, I guess, between vol",673,"Well, see, the -- I think as Bina said at the end of her prepared remarks, I guess we live in a world these days where focus is really important but so is agility. And I think you saw in the fourth quarter the agility and the balance, I guess, between volume and price as our 6% was composed of volume growth in all divisions and pricing increases largely in the developing world. So if we take that to the gross profit roll-forward, and you go back to the prior year of gross profit, 59.1, we benefited from 1.4 points of pricing, as you can see a step-up from the prior 3 quarters. Between our Funding the Growth and restructuring, we had something like 280 basis points of benefit. And then faced a headwind in terms of material prices of some 4.3 points, of which 2 points for the quarter was transaction. And then were 20 basis points negative of some other minor changes, which gets you to the 58.8% gross margin. Interestingly, although we are where we are, if you were to go back to the October conversation we had and our expectations for the fourth quarter for gross margin to be even with prior year, if you just stripped out the exchange deterioration since our October call, in fact, for this quarter, our gross margin would have been at prior year level. What we managed to do by moving quickly on pricing was to offset the dollar impact of the foreign exchange but not yet the ratio impact. So that's 2014. When you go forward into 2015, I guess you've got a few things in terms of our view on gross margin. Our view on gross margin for 2015 is that we will expand it between 50 and 100 basis points on the year. Now that is going to progress through the year from the first to the fourth quarter. We get a benefit in 2015, of course, from the current oil prices, which we expect to work through towards the end of the first half next year. And of course, commodity materials, which our forecasts would say are more or less flat year-on-year. And these are benefits we haven't seen in prior years. We will continue, and indeed already have, take pricing particularly in those emerging markets where we have to meet the transaction impact of foreign exchange because that's what translates into the operating earnings. We will, of course, be focused on our Funding the Growth programs, which again should benefit in 2015 from a more benign cost environment and, of course, we have our restructuring program. So as we begin 2015, we feel good with the expansion target of plus 50 to 100 basis points on gross margin, stepping its way up through the year. Now when you come back to the top line of the company, I think the fourth quarter played out organically pretty much the way we expected it. We see the destocking in China behind us, and that's why we see the 6% organic there and indeed organic growth in the country itself. In terms of Brazil, we said that we would still be working through the destocking in the fourth quarter that, that would be completed in the fourth quarter and then we would move into 2015 and indeed that has been the case. But if you step back and kind of take a look at where is the consumer, we continue to see for our categories that in North America, category growth, and again I'm talking our categories, is between 1% and 2%. As we said on the last call, it is edging wildly up to the upper end of that 1% and 2% range. Europe continues to be more even between 0% and 1%. And across the emerging markets, we continue to feel comfortable with the mid single-digit local currency value growth rate for our categories. So that's the environment we see in 2015, with China and Brazil now behind us."

The -- I think we have demonstrated fairly consistently an ability to deliver pricing to offset the transaction impact of foreign exchange. I think we demonstrated that in the fourth quarter. And we expect to continue to price as we have already done in some parts of the world. So pricing will be a factor in growth and in our gross margin expansion plans for 2015. And we believe, as we indeed already have, that we will be able to realize that. And I go back to the fourth quarter and say there was a fairly meaningful step-up in pricing in those emerging markets and yet we still had a balance between volume growth and pricing growth. Now when you turn to Latin America, the need for pricing again is driven by foreign exchange. And if you look at Latin America, overall, we took pricing in the fourth quarter and you see pricing up literally across the geography. From Mexico through Central America, our Andean group, Venezuela, Brazil and the Southern Cone. So we took pricing across the board. In Venezuela, as we told you on the last call, we, along with our 2 principal multinational competitors and a large local player down there, on price-controlled categories, got approval to increase pricing. And so we, along with everyone else, increased pricing in Venezuela. And that will roll forward into 2015. But again, you look at Asia, you look at Africa, Eurasia, we're taking pricing in all parts of the world that are affected by foreign exchange."

But I think what we're all trying to figure out is as it relates to the sustainability of it, was Venezuela and Argentina a disproportionate driver of that, right? In other words, can we feel comfortable with the assumption that you guys were able to hold volume very well across the segment broadly and the numbers aren't necessarily skewed by Venezuela and Argentina?"

I think the more pertinent question is our ability to maintain that pricing and continue to increase that pricing going forward and our view is that yes, we can. And again, I come back to the fourth quarter, having taken pricing, we did see volume growth in all of our divisions. Now of course, that step-up in Venezuelan pricing will ease off as we work our way through 2015 because Venezuela is much more episodic than many of the other markets. So the answer is yes. And again, back to the consumer behavior, we continue to see our categories hold in, in the emerging markets at mid-single digits. And remember, as you will see when we file our K, for us, 2014, Venezuela continues to represent about 3% of the company's worldwide sales and only about 1% of the operating margin."

And I also want to touch a little bit on the elasticity of demand in your categories because in the past you said that consumers understand pricing due to FX. But at what point does that equation start to potentially break down because this quarter, you obviously saw a big acceleration in price and volume really didn't decelerate all that much. But can you help us understand the analytics to make sure you don't potentially go overboard on pricing and what do you consider too much? Like if volume actually decelerates to the point where you're seeing negatives, would you consider that to go too far? And clearly, I'm thinking specifically about Latin America."

Well, clearly, Olivia, as I'm sure all other companies do, we do considerable work to balance even the short-term volume impact of the pricing we take. I come back and say we saw volume growth in all of our emerging markets, even with the stepped up pricing we took in the fourth quarter. So we think we have a handle on it, and we think again, remember the types of products we are selling, that we can take the pricing necessary to offset the foreign exchange impacts and continue to main [ph]  that balance between volume and price. And indeed, volume slows a little bit when you take the pricing but then that balance comes back. Look, on retail inventory, you may remember, we were the first to talk about the destocking in China. And I think we tried to be very transparent about what we saw unfolding in the marketplace. The China destocking is behind us, and I said on the last call that we expected Brazil to work through in the fourth quarter, and it has done. We track not only retail inventory, we track inventory with all of our distributors country-by-country. And we have parameters that actually relate back to the return on invested capital that the distributor gets in terms of the inventory levels that they would hold. So we have a very clear view on that inventory. And we have a very sharp focus on making sure that it is not, at least by our actions, out of balance. What we saw in Brazil and China was a marketplace destocking because of the slowdown in the category. So I think you can feel confident that we have very much control on that inventory. And remember, as we talked about when we went through those subprime years, in difficult times, products in our categories, if you will, become the simple luxuries that consumers can afford. So the behavior of using these products does not go away when times get slightly tougher."

So can you talk about sort of how much of the transaction piece maybe you're not going to cover? And can you get pricing in developed markets to cover some of this transactional piece? Is that a possibility even or is that something where you basically say, you know what, we're going to have to eat that impact given where the market is right now?"

Let me just complete what Bina said. I mean so when you think about foreign exchange as a headwind, yes, the translation impact is 10% on the bottom line. On the top line, we see it going to be about 7% to 7.5% on the year. So that just",314,"Yes. Thanks, John. Let me just complete what Bina said. I mean so when you think about foreign exchange as a headwind, yes, the translation impact is 10% on the bottom line. On the top line, we see it going to be about 7% to 7.5% on the year. So that just gives you the breadth of that. In terms of the transaction impact, that is bedded into our guidance on gross margin being up 50 to 100 basis points. The transaction impact, whether it's the balance sheet aspect of payables in the short term or the more substantive foreign exchange impact on raw materials or imported finished goods in the medium term, that hits the gross margin squarely. And if you don't recover that, you can't deliver an operating return. So all of our guidance is assuming our ability to offset that transaction impact. Now remember, offsetting that transaction impact is not just a function of list price increases in any given marketplace. It can be benefited from mix. It could be benefited from different types of promotional activity that elevate the ASP. We have the benefit of our funding-the-growth program. We have the benefit of the global growth and restructuring program that we have underway. And as I said at the beginning, the benefit of a more benign commodity environment, especially in the area of oil. Now if you look at Europe and North America, list price increases are difficult to accomplish. But you saw in Europe, terrific margin expansion this year. So there, it's going to be some of the other techniques that I think are going to continue to drive gross margin, most especially our funding-the-growth efforts, the global growth and efficiency program and what we can do with our promotional efficiencies as we go forward, rather than list price increases. But that's the way we planned the year, John."

So as we have said for quite a considerable time, the advertising is a combination of what we all grew up with, which is the traditional media and promotion. And we have always balanced that in terms of the traditional with the in-store activity that we undertake during the year. So if you look at the balance, in fact, in the quarter, our total commercial investment was up as it was for the year. Interestingly, many of our competitors in many large markets around the world eased back on their traditional advertising spend. So in many of those markets actually, our competitive pressure was actually strengthened. Now as we think about 2015, in terms of that traditional bucket of advertising and promotion, we are planning for that to increase absolutely and as a percentage to sales. And as we have always done, we will continue to balance that as the year unfolds. So we feel very much that the advertising is where we need it to be and I think, candidly, Joe, when you look at the results in the fourth quarter, we got a 6% organic growth rate and delivered a pretty robust bottom line. And of course, it's that kind of sustainable top and bottom line growth that we are focused on. Relative to the overhead, ForEx isn't much of an impact. We continue to expect to make progress in terms of overheads because the Global Growth and Efficiency Program is largely focused in that area rather than gross margin this time around. And again, as Bina said, we were ahead of delivery of that program in 2014 and we will continue to make progress in 2015."

But couponing volume and couponing values both stepped-up substantially in 2014. And we expect that will continue in 2015. Now in part, coupons create trial for new products. So that's quite healthy. So you'll see some bumps, I guess, quarter-by-quarter because of that.

But the point I did make relative to Venezuela, indeed Latin America, is that we took pricing across Latin America in the fourth quarter.

That same episodic benefit also benefited our principal multinational competitors who got the same government approvals on key categories for them at exactly the same time we got ours. And indeed the local competitor was granted pricing as well. So everybody benefited from pricing in Venezuela. But the point to make is we took pricing across the board and in an environment where everybody was getting pricing, our global growth rate was indeed 6%. In terms of the advertising, yes, you're right. One has to be conscious about the brand health, as we call it. I will say that the kind of model that perhaps many of us grew up with where what was accounted for in trade spending was inherently bad and only the so-called below-the-line spending was good. I think those days are gone. I think one's ability to take Hispanic consumers in the U.S. that you can reach with in-store activity that may have a component of price but might be much more driven by a coupon that is regionally dropped to high-population areas. These kind of techniques are now available and they weren't available before. And you can measure them, you can execute them. Retailers can handle different configurations to put them at work with the consumer. But coming back to the brands. We do, do tracking work and our tracking work around the world shows that if you take out Oral Care business around the world, the health is very, very good of those brands. So by all means, we track it. Sometimes from a short-term point of view, if couponing or other activity steps up, you have no option at least in part to participate. But I think we've been one of the loudest voices, at least I hope so, in saying that we much prefer to compete in an environment of innovation with marketing support than price promotion. But we don't see weakness in brand health. That is something, of course, we have and will continue to track."

The -- if you take India and the promotional intensity, actually India from Procter's point of view was never particularly intense in our categories. Now if you look at India, Bina talked about the market share, we're approaching 55 and the competitor in question has about 0.7 share. So -- and our business there continues to be quite strong. In terms of Brazil, I would say yes. The promotional intensity has dropped off a little bit in Brazil, which is a good thing. On gross margin, Jason, and I'm sorry with the glib response. But the gross margin is really one of phasing because as I tried to explain earlier, we think that gross margin expansion is very much going to build across the year because although we see the headline lowering of commodity costs and certainly oil, the work-through of that from our inventory point of view to its effect on resins, bottles, et cetera will take some time to be seen. And on the flip side, the transaction impact when ForEx goes against you, that hits you straight away, whether it's the stuff you have to pay and your payables, whether it's the dollar-denominated raw materials that replace that which you are now having to pay for. So that's immediate. And the win-back on the gross margin takes a little bit more time. So I do think we'll end next year in a strengthened position, gross margin-wise, but it really has all to do with phasing. So I believe those are all the questions we have?"

With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.
We're pleased to exit 2014 with organic sales up 6% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, which was the strongest quarter of last year. Our market shares are strong around the world as you will hear in a moment. As always, innovation has been critical to our success and we're excited about our pipeline looking forward to 2015 and beyond. 
In many markets, macroeconomic challenges persist. And of course, foreign exchange has been and will continue to be a considerable headwind as translation alone is projected to impact EPS in 2015 over 10% at current foreign exchange rates. That makes us even more pleased to be able to deliver continued organic sales growth and positive results on the bottom line. 
While our gross margin was down in the quarter due to very significant transaction costs, we believe that we'll see an improving trend as we move through 2015 with a more benign raw material cost environment and pricing taken to offset the impact of rising transaction costs related to foreign exchange. Our funding-the-growth program is as robust as ever and our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track. Savings generated in 2014 related to the Global Growth and Efficiency Program were over $100 million after tax and above the top end of our projected range. Overhead expenses are down in the quarter due to tight controls in all divisions and savings from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program. Our total commercial spending also increased in support of both existing and new products. 
We think we're well poised to meet the challenges we face as we enter 2015. We believe our strong balance sheet and solid cash generation should keep us in good stead. 
So turning to North America. We're very pleased with our progress here. Innovation is contributing to organic sales growth and we have more planned for this year. In the fourth quarter, in the U.S., our market share increased year-to-date in toothpaste and manual toothbrushes and was even with the prior year in mouthwash. Results were strong across our portfolio in toothpaste. Our Colgate Total toothpaste share remains over 10%, supported by a graphic refresh, a relaunch of Colgate Total Advanced Whitening and the boost provided by our companion, Colgate Total Lasting White mouthwash. The Colgate Optic White franchise is also doing well as the superpremium line is driving incrementality with its year-to-date toothpaste share up from 5.3% to 5.6%. And as you know, we also launched Colgate Enamel Health Toothpaste and toothbrushes in the second half of 2014. It's off to a strong start and our overall toothpaste share is up 1.4% in the 3 months after its launch as compared to the 3 months prior. 
In the mouthwash category, our year-to-date share is up more than a full point while our 2 major competitors' full year shares declined, with excellent results from Colgate Total Lasting White mouthwash. Our fabric conditioner business continues to perform well. Both for the full year and the quarter, our market share is up over a full point to a new record, close to 20% of the overall market and as you know, these products are primarily sold in Hispanic markets. Now as you'd expect, we have more innovation slated for 2015 with a full grid [ph] planned for the first quarter. In toothpaste, we're launching Colgate Optic White, Express White toothpaste. This innovation provides whiter teeth in just 3 days simply by brushing with best results after 4 weeks of brushing as directed. It's Colgate's fastest whitening toothpaste and is enamel-safe for daily use. In the mouthwash category, we're launching Colgate Total Gum Health mouthwash. It provides advanced gum protection for 45% stronger, healthier gums versus a none antibacterial mouthwash. It fights plaque between teeth and along the gum line and kills 99% of germs on contact with 12-hour protection against bacteria that cause gingivitis. In the toothbrush category, we're launching Colgate Sensitive Toothbrush Plus Sensitivity Relief Pen, using the same innovative pen application technology that has been so successful in the whitening segment. The pen utilizes our patented Pro-Argin Technology to deliver sensitivity relief 24/7 with continued use and goes right to the source of the pain. To rekindle momentum in the dish liquid category, we're launching a premium priced Palmolive multiservice, which is specially formulated to kill bacteria on dishes and hard, nonporous kitchen surfaces. And on the value side, we're launching Ajax all-in-one dish liquid, which has a new formula with 10% more cleaning ingredients than before. And to further our success in the fabric conditioner category, we're launching Suavitel fragrance pro with a proprietary scent system, which provides 5x longer lasting fragrance compared with using detergent alone as well as Suavitel Fast Dry dryer sheets, which help clothes dry 30% faster than using detergent alone. 
Turning then to Europe/South Pacific. We enjoyed another quarter of organic sales growth in this region with a slight acceleration in volume from the third quarter. Our commercial hubbing activities, part of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, are now complete and were implemented with very little disruption. In fact in the quarter, virtually all new hubs delivered positive organic sales growth. Innovation is critical in this part of the world and it continues to contribute to market share growth in a number of our categories. Our market shares across Europe are up year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrush, battery toothbrush, mouthwash, liquid hand soap and dish liquid. Of note, all categories of our Sanex business have grown market share year-to-date: shower gel, liquid hand soap and underarm protection. Our launch of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Sugar Acid Neutralizer is now complete across the region with excellent share results in a number of markets. One of our first launch markets, Denmark, posted a 4.1% share in the most recent period and 2 larger more recent market launch markets, the U.K. and France, have already achieved 1.5% and 2% shares, respectively, in the most recent period. 
Building on this success in 2015, we will continue full marketing support for the toothpaste along with a further rollout of a companion toothbrush and mouthwash. As I just mentioned, our Sanex business is performing well and we have some exciting new product activity to support further growth. Launching in the first quarter is Sanex ADVANCED, Sanex's first bodycare regimen developed with leading dermatologists. Available in 3 different formulations, the regimen will include a body lotion and hand cream to complement the body wash and deodorant. This is Sanex's first entry into the hand and body lotion category. The Sanex ADVANCED Dermo Repair bundle for dry skin with minor damage contains active restore complex and allantoin to restore pH balance and moisturization. The Sanex ADVANCED atopi [ph] derm bundle for extra try atopic skin contains skin-identical lipids and emollients to help restore the skin's protective barrier, sooth itchiness and control hypersensitivity, helping the skin to keep functioning normally. 
The Sanex Advanced Hydrate 24H bundle for very dry, dehydrated skin uses Ceragly Activ Technology in the shower gel and lotion, which has pseudo-ceramide and glycerine to maintain the skin's protective barrier by locking in the moisture. And in addition, we'll be launching Sanex in Poland, a new geography, which will provide incremental new business for us. 
Turning then to Latin America. Business across this region is solid. Organic sales growth accelerated from the prior 2 quarters in 2014 and while volume increased a modest 1% versus the year-ago period, this was on top of a very strong increase of 10% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Toothpaste shares are strong across the region. In Mexico, our most recent share is 80.8%, up 80 basis points from the year-ago period. Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection has achieved a 2% share in the most recent period. In Brazil in December, our toothpaste share reached 72.1% for the month, the highest share in the past 18 years. This is in spite of a lot of competitive activity. Our manual toothbrush business is performing well. In Mexico, we achieved a record share of 45% in the latest readings, while for the first time our major competitor dropped below a 40% share. Growth was across all retail environments: self-service stores, pharmacies and the indirect trade. We reached a record year-to-date share in Brazil as well with good growth in the superpremium segment with a 32.4% share of the market, the #1 position. In bar soaps, we've strengthened our leadership position across the region, up 0.5 point on a year-to-date basis to 29.7% with the most recent read at 29.9%. 
Innovation in both the Palmolive and Protex equities has contributed to this success. And in the Home Care category, our year-to-date regional market shares have increased in fabric conditioners up 50 basis points to 51.6% and in liquid cleaners, up 70 basis points to 36.3%. And we have more exciting new products planned for 2015 across all our categories. In the first quarter, specifically, we're excited about a new subcategory in the Protex body cleansing category, feminine intimate wash. Protex is a brand that's recognized as an expert in skin protection and this positioning should transfer readily into the intimate care sub category. It will be launched with a fully integrated marketing campaign, including a product website and endorsements from a well-known journalist. Primary replacement in-store will be on the intimate shelf with secondary placement on the soap shelf to attract attention from loyal Protex users. 
Turning then to Asia. We're pleased with the acceleration of organic sales growth in this region as we indicated would happen last quarter. And as referenced in the press release, we saw good toothpaste market share gains in a number of countries. In India, our market shares increased to 54.4%, up 30 basis points on a year-to-date basis. Colgate Active Salt toothpaste developed especially for this market, where salt connotes a antibacterial efficacy, increased 70 basis points to over a 5% share. In Malaysia, our year-to-date share is up 30 basis points to just over 73%. The anti-cavity segment now comprises almost 27% of the market and Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection toothpaste, launched last February, has a 3.2% share year-to-date with the most recent read of 4%. In manual toothbrushes, our regional share increased 20 basis points year-to-date to 30.2%, with 8 out of 10 countries reporting stable to positive growth. In India, our share reached a record 43.2%, up 120 basis points on a year-to-date basis. 
Innovation under the Colgate Slim Soft equity has been particularly successful. And our regional mouthwash share increased 120 basis points year-to-date to 23.1%, with the most recent period at 24.6%. 
Looking forward, in toothpaste, we will be relaunching both our base sensitivity line as well as the Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief line. In addition, we will be adding Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair & Prevent. This new product has a unique calcium and amino acid complex, which repairs the root cause of sensitivity, preventing the pain from returning. 
In India, we will be launching Colgate Active Salt with Neem. The Neem tree in India is known for its antibacterial properties. In certain markets, we will also introduce a line of kid's toothpaste for children aged 2 to 5, a segment currently somewhat underdeveloped which presents a great incremental opportunity. New in the mouthwash category will be Colgate Plax Bamboo Charcoal and, as you know, charcoal is also widely viewed as an ingredient to fight bacteria. 
Turning then to Africa/Eurasia. This region continues to deliver strong organic sales growth despite some macroeconomic challenges in countries such as Russia. Our regional toothpaste share is up 10 basis points to 32.4% year-to-date and despite difficulties in Russia and the Ukraine, our year-to-date share is up 10 basis points to 32.9% in Russia and up 170 basis points in the Ukraine to 28.2%. We've also seen good share increases across sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa. In manual toothbrushes, Colgate 360° and Colgate Slim Soft have helped increase our share in Turkey, up 30 basis points year-to-date to 28.7%. In South Africa, we are up 380 basis points year-to-date to over 38% of the market. And across the region, our mouthwash share is up 30 basis points year-to-date, approaching 20%. Colgate is the #2 mouthwash brand in Africa/Eurasia. You may recall, we told you about a new product in Russia, Colgate Altai Herbs mouthwash. That has contributed to a 210 basis point increase in our Russian mouthwash share to 27.5% year-to-date. We also have a good market-leading shower gel business in this region. Our year-to-date share is up 120 basis points to almost 22%. Russia, Turkey and South Africa have all reached record shares. We've told you on previous calls about our Palmolive Gourmet Spa line with enticing coffee, chocolate, vanilla and peach fragrances. That innovation has been one of the drivers of the excellent share performance. And innovation this quarter continues. To support our relaunch of our Colgate Total toothpaste portfolio, we have initiated a new integrated marketing campaign around the idea of the incredible mouth. The idea is that Colgate knows that your mouth is incredible, unique, which is why Colgate developed Colgate Total to protect 100% of your mouth, not only your teeth. 
To continue the momentum in our shower gel business, we're launching Palmolive Taiga Freshness for Men. You may recall we've had great success with Colgate Altai herbs products: toothpaste, mouthwash and body cleansing. Altai is a region in Russia known for its herbs, which are believed to have curative properties. Similarly, Taiga is a Northern Forest characterized by pines, spruces and larches, covering much of Northern Eurasia. This new product offers the freshness and cleanliness of the legendary Taiga in your shower. Finally, Hill's. We're pleased with Hill's continued good organic sales growth of 4% in the quarter, particularly when compared to a strong 7% growth in the year-ago quarter. Innovation has driven good results across our Science Diet, Prescription Diet and Ideal Balance portfolio. For the Science Diet portfolio, nutritional consultants, shopper engagement at superstores and sampling of our new soft savory treats here in the U.S. have helped drive sales. In Europe, Hill's Science Plan Perfect Weight has been supported with secondary displays in store and in-store weighing area and on-shelf dynamic screens to explain the product benefits. Here in the U.S., Hill's Ideal Balance has gained share in both the wellness and natural segments and consumption of the product in superstores was up strongly versus the year-ago period. In Europe, the product has gained excellent trade acceptance in the U.K. and Germany -- 2 large pet food markets -- and received support with promotional activities and secondary placements. And our Prescription Diet metabolic line continues to meet with success. To build on that, this quarter, we're launching Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus. 32 million pets have obesity-related concurrent conditions. This is the first and only dual efficacy therapeutic pet nutrition food. It will be available for weight loss plus mobility for dogs and weight loss plus urinary stress for cats. The product will be available in both dry and stew format. And we're also very excited about the new global packaging redesign across the Prescription Diet range. With more consumer-friendly packaging and new better-tasting formulas, the bundle is designed to create a stronger emotional connection, strengthen our leadership and innovation credentials and improve taste perception. That's rolling out across the U.S., Canada and some of the high-growth markets in the first quarter of 2015 and Europe in the second quarter. 
So in summary, we believe our solid results for the quarter are a good indication that we have an effective strategy and we believe that this consistent strategy has stood as well for many years. You know it well. Staying close to the customer and consumer, innovating everywhere, becoming more effective and efficient and ongoing leadership development. We believe our executives on the ground have the tools to make the right decision. Balancing price and volume; supporting innovation, in-store and out; increasing market share. All this is winning on the ground. We and our competition alike our faced with choppy times, volatile swings in currency and macroeconomic challenges in many parts of the world. So we believe it's a simple consistent focus well understood by every Colgate person that makes the difference. 
And now I'd like to turn it over to Q&A.

And I think you saw in the fourth quarter the agility and the balance, I guess, between volume and price as our 6% was composed of volume growth in all divisions and pricing increases largely in the developing world. So if we take that to the gross profit roll-forward, and you go back to the prior year of gross profit, 59.1, we benefited from 1.4 points of pricing, as you can see a step-up from the prior 3 quarters. Between our Funding the Growth and restructuring, we had something like 280 basis points of benefit. And then faced a headwind in terms of material prices of some 4.3 points, of which 2 points for the quarter was transaction. And then were 20 basis points negative of some other minor changes, which gets you to the 58.8% gross margin. Interestingly, although we are where we are, if you were to go back to the October conversation we had and our expectations for the fourth quarter for gross margin to be even with prior year, if you just stripped out the exchange deterioration since our October call, in fact, for this quarter, our gross margin would have been at prior year level. What we managed to do by moving quickly on pricing was to offset the dollar impact of the foreign exchange but not yet the ratio impact. So that's 2014. When you go forward into 2015, I guess you've got a few things in terms of our view on gross margin. Our view on gross margin for 2015 is that we will expand it between 50 and 100 basis points on the year. Now that is going to progress through the year from the first to the fourth quarter. We get a benefit in 2015, of course, from the current oil prices, which we expect to work through towards the end of the first half next year. And of course, commodity materials, which our forecasts would say are more or less flat year-on-year. And these are benefits we haven't seen in prior years. We will continue, and indeed already have, take pricing particularly in those emerging markets where we have to meet the transaction impact of foreign exchange because that's what translates into the operating earnings. We will, of course, be focused on our Funding the Growth programs, which again should benefit in 2015 from a more benign cost environment and, of course, we have our restructuring program. So as we begin 2015, we feel good with the expansion target of plus 50 to 100 basis points on gross margin, stepping its way up through the year. Now when you come back to the top line of the company, I think the fourth quarter played out organically pretty much the way we expected it. We see the destocking in China behind us, and that's why we see the 6% organic there and indeed organic growth in the country itself. In terms of Brazil, we said that we would still be working through the destocking in the fourth quarter that, that would be completed in the fourth quarter and then we would move into 2015 and indeed that has been the case. But if you step back and kind of take a look at where is the consumer, we continue to see for our categories that in North America, category growth, and again I'm talking our categories, is between 1% and 2%. As we said on the last call, it is edging wildly up to the upper end of that 1% and 2% range. Europe continues to be more even between 0% and 1%. And across the emerging markets, we continue to feel comfortable with the mid-single-digit local currency value growth rate for our categories. So that's the environment we see in 2015, with China and Brazil now behind us."

The -- I think we have demonstrated fairly consistently an ability to deliver pricing to offset the transaction impact of foreign exchange. I think we demonstrated that in the fourth quarter. And we expect to continue to price as we have already done in some parts of the world. So pricing will be a factor in growth and in our gross margin expansion plans for 2015. And we believe, as we indeed already have, that we will be able to realize that. And I go back to the fourth quarter and say there was a fairly meaningful step-up in pricing in those emerging markets and yet we still had a balance between volume growth and pricing growth. Now when you turn to Latin America, the need for pricing again is driven by foreign exchange. And if you look at Latin America, overall, we took pricing in the fourth quarter and you see pricing up literally across the geography. From Mexico through Central America, our Andean group, Venezuela, Brazil and the Southern Cone. So we took pricing across the board. In Venezuela, as we told you on the last call, we, along with our 2 principal multinational competitors and a large local player down there, on price-controlled categories, got approval to increase pricing. And so we, along with everyone else, increased pricing in Venezuela. And that will roll forward into 2015. But again, you look at Asia, you look at Africa, Eurasia, we're taking pricing in all parts of the world that are affected by foreign exchange."

In other words, can we feel comfortable with the assumption that you guys were able to hold volume very well across the segment broadly and the numbers aren't necessarily skewed by Venezuela and Argentina?"

Clearly, we got more pricing in Venezuela because we had, had no pricing for an extended period of years. So the answer there is clearly yes, as it was for everybody else that we compete with in that country. I think the more pertinent question is our ability to maintain that pricing and continue to increase that pricing going forward and our view is that yes, we can. And again, I come back to the fourth quarter, having taken pricing, we did see volume growth in all of our divisions. Now of course, that step-up in Venezuelan pricing will ease off as we work our way through 2015 because Venezuela is much more episodic than many of the other markets. So the answer is yes. And again, back to the consumer behavior, we continue to see our categories hold in, in the emerging markets at mid-single digits. And remember, as you will see when we file our K, for us, 2014, Venezuela continues to represent about 3% of the company's worldwide sales and only about 1% of the operating margin."

And I also want to touch a little bit on the elasticity of demand in your categories because in the past you said that consumers understand pricing due to FX. But at what point does that equation start to potentially break down because this quarter, you obviously saw a big acceleration in price and volume really didn't decelerate all that much. But can you help us understand the analytics to make sure you don't potentially go overboard on pricing and what do you consider too much? Like if volume actually decelerates to the point where you're seeing negatives, would you consider that to go too far? And clearly, I'm thinking specifically about Latin America."

Well, clearly, Olivia, as I'm sure all other companies do, we do considerable work to balance even the short-term volume impact of the pricing we take. I come back and say we saw volume growth in all of our emerging markets, even with the stepped up pricing we took in the fourth quarter. So we think we have a handle on it, and we think again, remember the types of products we are selling, that we can take the pricing necessary to offset the foreign exchange impacts and continue to main [ph]  that balance between volume and price. And indeed, volume slows a little bit when you take the pricing but then that balance comes back. Look, on retail inventory, you may remember, we were the first to talk about the destocking in China. And I think we tried to be very transparent about what we saw unfolding in the marketplace. The China destocking is behind us, and I said on the last call that we expected Brazil to work through in the fourth quarter, and it has done. We track not only retail inventory, we track inventory with all of our distributors country-by-country. And we have parameters that actually relate back to the return on invested capital that the distributor gets in terms of the inventory levels that they would hold. So we have a very clear view on that inventory. And we have a very sharp focus on making sure that it is not, at least by our actions, out of balance. What we saw in Brazil and China was a marketplace destocking because of the slowdown in the category. So I think you can feel confident that we have very much control on that inventory. And remember, as we talked about when we went through those subprime years, in difficult times, products in our categories, if you will, become the simple luxuries that consumers can afford. So the behavior of using these products does not go away when times get slightly tougher."

So can you talk a little bit about the -- the transaction piece is a little bit different now given what we've seen in terms of the move in the euro and some of the other more developed market currencies, which obviously are negative. So can you talk about sort of how much of the transaction piece maybe you're not going to cover? And can you get pricing in developed markets to cover some of this transactional piece? Is that a possibility even or is that something where you basically say, you know what, we're going to have to eat that impact given where the market is right now?"

Let me just complete what Bina said. I mean so when you think about foreign exchange as a headwind, yes, the translation impact is 10% on the bottom line.

I mean so when you think about foreign exchange as a headwind, yes, the translation impact is 10% on the bottom line. On the top line, we see it going to be about 7% to 7.5% on the year. So that just gives you the breadth of that. In terms of the transaction impact, that is bedded into our guidance on gross margin being up 50 to 100 basis points. The transaction impact, whether it's the balance sheet aspect of payables in the short term or the more substantive foreign exchange impact on raw materials or imported finished goods in the medium term, that hits the gross margin squarely. And if you don't recover that, you can't deliver an operating return. So all of our guidance is assuming our ability to offset that transaction impact. Now remember, offsetting that transaction impact is not just a function of list price increases in any given marketplace. It can be benefited from mix. It could be benefited from different types of promotional activity that elevate the ASP. We have the benefit of our funding-the-growth program. We have the benefit of the global growth and restructuring program that we have underway. And as I said at the beginning, the benefit of a more benign commodity environment, especially in the area of oil. Now if you look at Europe and North America, list price increases are difficult to accomplish. But you saw in Europe, terrific margin expansion this year. So there, it's going to be some of the other techniques that I think are going to continue to drive gross margin, most especially our funding-the-growth efforts, the global growth and efficiency program and what we can do with our promotional efficiencies as we go forward, rather than list price increases. But that's the way we planned the year, John."

So if you look at the balance, in fact, in the quarter, our total commercial investment was up as it was for the year. Interestingly, many of our competitors in many large markets around the world eased back on their traditional advertising spend. So in many of those markets actually, our competitive pressure was actually strengthened. Now as we think about 2015, in terms of that traditional bucket of advertising and promotion, we are planning for that to increase absolutely and as a percentage to sales. And as we have always done, we will continue to balance that as the year unfolds. So we feel very much that the advertising is where we need it to be and I think, candidly, Joe, when you look at the results in the fourth quarter, we got a 6% organic growth rate and delivered a pretty robust bottom line. And of course, it's that kind of sustainable top and bottom line growth that we are focused on. Relative to the overhead, ForEx isn't much of an impact. We continue to expect to make progress in terms of overheads because the Global Growth and Efficiency Program is largely focused in that area rather than gross margin this time around.

That same episodic benefit also benefited our principal multinational competitors who got the same government approvals on key categories for them at exactly the same time we got ours. And indeed the local competitor was granted pricing as well. So everybody benefited from pricing in Venezuela. But the point to make is we took pricing across the board and in an environment where everybody was getting pricing, our global growth rate was indeed 6%. In terms of the advertising, yes, you're right. One has to be conscious about the brand health, as we call it. I will say that the kind of model that perhaps many of us grew up with where what was accounted for in trade spending was inherently bad and only the so-called below-the-line spending was good. I think those days are gone. I think one's ability to take Hispanic consumers in the U.S. that you can reach with in-store activity that may have a component of price but might be much more driven by a coupon that is regionally dropped to high-population areas. These kind of techniques are now available and they weren't available before. And you can measure them, you can execute them. Retailers can handle different configurations to put them at work with the consumer. But coming back to the brands. We do, do tracking work and our tracking work around the world shows that if you take out Oral Care business around the world, the health is very, very good of those brands. So by all means, we track it. Sometimes from a short-term point of view, if couponing or other activity steps up, you have no option at least in part to participate. But I think we've been one of the loudest voices, at least I hope so, in saying that we much prefer to compete in an environment of innovation with marketing support than price promotion. But we don't see weakness in brand health. That is something, of course, we have and will continue to track."

On P&G's conference call, they referenced expectation of getting 400 basis points of margin gains, constant currency or even currency loaded, out of Brazil and India. Hard to see how they get that without pulling some of the money they've put in the market, back out. So are you seeing the promotional intensity ease in those markets? And then secondly, gross margins. I just wanted to walk through a bit more deeply in answer to the question earlier. You're signaling sort of neutral commodities, maybe even a little bit of favorability with oil. Sort of steady, hold the line on price, continue productivity. You do the math on that, even if you assume that transactional headwinds become more substantial than they were this quarter, it's still hard not to see a path to at least to 150 basis points of gross margin expansion. So what am I missing there?"

In terms of Brazil, I would say yes. The promotional intensity has dropped off a little bit in Brazil, which is a good thing. On gross margin, Jason, and I'm sorry with the glib response. But the gross margin is really one of phasing because as I tried to explain earlier, we think that gross margin expansion is very much going to build across the year because although we see the headline lowering of commodity costs and certainly oil, the work-through of that from our inventory point of view to its effect on resins, bottles, et cetera will take some time to be seen. And on the flip side, the transaction impact when ForEx goes against you, that hits you straight away, whether it's the stuff you have to pay and your payables, whether it's the dollar-denominated raw materials that replace that which you are now having to pay for. So that's immediate. And the win-back on the gross margin takes a little bit more time. So I do think we'll end next year in a strengthened position, gross margin-wise, but it really has all to do with phasing. So I believe those are all the questions we have?"

With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer. 
We're pleased with how this year has started out, with solid organic sales growth and encouraging growth margin improvement despite the major currency headwinds we have been facing. Our business is on track. And as Ian said in this morning's press release, our anticipated full year earnings per share decline reflects a double-digit increase on a currency-neutral basis, of course, excluding restructuring charges. And as you'll hear in more detail shortly, we made very good market share progress across categories and divisions. This is a result of ongoing innovation around the world, supported by a healthy level of advertising. And while our reported advertising was down absolutely versus the year-ago quarter, the 10.6% level as a percent of sales is up meaningfully from the fourth quarter of 2014 level of 9.7% and compares to a level in last year's first quarter of 11.1%, the highest for last year. And as we've said on many occasions, it's the combination of this reported advertising and our very impactful in-store activities, which drives volume and market share growth. And our efforts in the area of efficiency continued to pay off, with our funding-the-growth initiatives off to a very good start. In fact, it's the strongest first quarter we've had in that area in sometime. 
In addition, our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track and delivering the savings we had projected. And as referenced in the press release, our balance sheet is strong. Working capital levels are below last year. 
So let's turn to the divisions, starting with North America. Our North American business continues to grow. As mentioned in the press release, our year-to-date market share is up in toothpaste and manual toothbrushes. In addition, it's up in mouthwash, body wash, liquid hand soap, and fabric conditioner. 
In the toothpaste whitening category, the February launch of Colgate Optic White Platinum Express White has added incremental share. Our year-to-date share is the whitening is 5.8%, which grew to 6.8% in March. 
Part of our successful integrated marketing campaign, included the use of YouTube beauty experts to engage our millennial consumer. Another 2015 toothpaste innovation is Colgate Enamel Health Multi-Protection toothpaste, which includes premium packaging. 
In the body wash category, our year-to-date share is up over a full point to almost 10%. Our February launches of both Irish Spring Signature for Men and Soft Soap Version Glow have contributed to these results. 
And our liquid hand soap share is at 31.4% year-to-date, with the most recent share of 33.1%, largely driven by the soft soap fragrant foam and collection. 
We're also very pleased with our business, which is growing very strongly. Innovation as well as increased distribution have played a role. We're getting good traction with our recent launch of baby products. Our in-store execution has been excellent, including a very impactful Earth Day event. And you'll hear about more new products later in the year. 
So let's turn then to Europe South Pacific. Momentum is strong across this division and market shares are growing. Our strong organic volume growth of 5.5% is the highest in almost 5 years. Our year-to-date market share is up in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, liquid hand soap, shower gel and fabric conditioner. Our year-to-date toothpaste share is at 36.4%, up 40 basis points, with the most recent reading at 37%. Toothpaste innovation this quarter includes Colgate Total Daily Repair. This new product helps reverse early damage for better oral health. It's an everyday multi-benefit toothpaste with proactive repair benefits and is priced at a premium to the base business. 
In the whitening category, we're launching Colgate Max White for men with powerful stain removal for whiter teeth. And more toothpaste innovation is planned for the second half of this year. 
Our manual toothbrush share is up 2 full points to 26.9% on a year-to-date basis, with the most recent share at 27.2% and innovative products such as Colgate 360 degree and Colgate Slim Soft toothbrushes reported by excellent in-store execution have helped drive these results. 
The U.K. and Australia had particularly good performance, with year-to-date toothbrush shares up 660 basis points and 240 basis points, respectively. Clearly, strengthening already robust leadership positions. 
In the Personal Care category, we're also launching a new men's variance, Palmolive Men Fresh Care. This is a 3-in-1 product, which combines a face, body and hair wash in one convenient package. 
We told you last quarter about a new line under the Sanex brand: Sanex Advanced. This is has had excellent trade acceptance and in-store implementation. We expect that share results should follow soon. 
Our year-to-date fabric conditioner share is up 80 basis points to 27.4%, with the most recent period at 27.7%. This was helped by the launch of Supline Paradise Sensations. It brings new trends to the fabric conditioner category with its powerful bundle impact and sophisticated fragrances. The pipeline of products moving forward is strong, with the relaunch of Supline Perfect Tide and Magic Moments, offering easy ironing and superior long-lasting fragrance. The new premium look with outstanding on-shelf impact and a higher performance formula commands a premium price. 
Turning then to Latin America. Organic sales growth was strong in this region, despite a strong year-ago comparison. And as elsewhere, premium innovation has helped drive results. 
Our regional toothpaste share is up 150 basis points to 77.7% on a year-to-date basis, with good gains in many countries. In Brazil, we're up 40 basis points year-over-year to 71.7%, while our nearest competitor has seen sequential declines in the last 3 bi-monthly share periods. 
In Mexico, we're up 110 basis points to 80.6% and this despite continued promotional pressure from some of our competitors. 
In manual toothbrushes, premium offerings such as Colgate 360 degree and Colgate Slim Soft, have contributed share growth in many countries. In Mexico, our leadership share increased 80 basis points to 43.1% on a year-to-date basis, widening the gap between our nearest competitor to 150 basis points. 
In Columbia, our year-to-date share increased 30 basis points to 46.7%. 
In bar soap, the year has started strong, with the division holding market leadership at 30.7%, both equities, Palmolive and Protex, continue to be the #1 and 2 brands across Latin America. And we achieved record high shares in Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala. 
Our market-leading fabric conditioner business in Mexico expanded its market share by 50 basis points to 47.2% on a year-to-date basis. Newly launched Suavitel Aroma Intense achieved a 1.4% share in the direct trade in the first quarter, and a new smaller base business size helped compete with low-priced local competitors in the bodega retail environment. 
Innovation in Latin America continues this quarter across categories. To build on a success in the whitening category, we are launching Luminous White Advanced toothpaste in Brazil. This is Colgate's most advanced whitening toothpaste, which intensifies to white of your teeth 3 shades whiter. Its unique formula contains the same ingredient dentist use and you can feel it working while you brush. As a companion product, we will offer Colgate 360 Degree Luminous White Toothbrush, with stain-erasing cups and a 2 times whitening action. 
In the mid-tier segment and as a companion to our Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus toothpaste we are relaunching Colgate's Maximum Cavity Protection toothbrush. The product has multi-angled bristles and a flexible neck, which help with plaque removal. 
And in the Personal Care category, we have just launched a new line under the Protex brand. Protex complete 12 body wash, hand soap and bar soap, providing long-lasting antibacterial protection. 
Turning then to Asia. As you've seen, organic sales performance in this region was somewhat new to this quarter. But going forward we have a full pipeline a new products to reignite growth. 
In India, our toothpaste share is up 30 basis points to 54.6% on a year-to-date basis, fueled by the launch of Colgate Active Salt and Colgate Matte Fresh. 
In the Philippines, our toothpaste share increased 120 basis points to 60.9%, with the most recent read at 61.2%. Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection toothpaste has achieved almost a 3% share of that market. 
Our manual toothbrush shares increased in 5 of 10 countries around the region, with our divisional year-to-date share at 29.9%, down modestly from the year-ago period, but still the market leading position. 
And we continue to grow our mouthwash business. Our regional share is up 30 basis points to 24% on a year-to-date basis. 
In India, Colgate Plax Active Salt and Colgate Plaques Visible White help drive our market share up 100 basis points to 18.2%, while in the Philippines, Colgate Plaques Jasmine Tea was a major driver of a 220 basis point increase to 26.8%, with the most recent lead at 27.9%. 
And in the second quarter, the innovation continues. In toothpaste, we will launch Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair and Prevent, which repairs the sensitive areas of teeth and with regular use, provides lasting protection to prevent sensitivity from returning. In the base sensitivity line, comes Colgate Sensitive with Sensi-Foam to reach all areas of the teeth. 
So the Thai market, we're launching Colgate Salt Charcoal. And as you know, charcoal is an attractive ingredient to consumers in this region based on local insights. 
In manual toothbrushes, we've just introduced Colgate Slim Soft Gold Charcoal toothbrush, with less than 0.01 millimeters slim tip antibacterial bristles for deep but gentle cleaning. And we're extending charcoal to the value portion of our toothbrush business with Colgate Zigzag Charcoal toothbrush. 
In personal care in Thailand, we will launch a line of soap, body wash and hand soap Protex Omega 3 body wash with Omega 3 essential oil and which washes away 99.9% of bacteria, while keeping your skin feeling moisturized. 
Also, in that market, we will introduce Protex Intimate Care Feminine Wash, the bundle now selling in Brazil. 
Turning to Africa/Eurasia, organic sales in this region were strong, building on the momentum we saw as we exited 2014. And innovation has driven these good results across categories. Our regional toothpaste share is up 90 basis points year-to-date to 33.7%, with market share increases in virtually every country. 
Our share in Russia was up 160 basis points, in South Africa, 120 basis points and in Turkey, 130 basis points. Similarly, our toothbrush share increased everywhere with the exception of East West Africa. Shares in Russia, South Africa and Turkey increased 170 basis points, 90 basis points and 50 basis points, respectively. 
Our bar soap share was also up across the region, up 290 basis points year-to-date. In South Africa, our share increased 180 basis points to 32.4%, thanks to the new products we told you about in previous quarters: Protex Men and Protex African Therapy. and more innovation is planned for this quarter. In toothpaste, we will be launching Colgate Optic White Whiten and Restore. The formula was an active mineral complex and fresh mint flavor provides 1 shade whiter teeth in 1 week while helping to restore enamel strength. And the consumer can have the confidence of always being able to look their best without compromising the health of her mouth. 
In Russia, following on the success of our Altai herbs bundle, we will be introducing Colgate Plaques Oak Bark and fear mouthwash. Oak Park and for are attractive ingredients to consumers in this part of the world based on local insights. 
And in the shower gel category, we are adding a new variant to our successful Palmolive Spa Gourmet Line, Mint Shake, with an uplifting mint fragrance and rich creamy formula infused with natural mint extract that leave your skin feeling pampered. 
To build on our success in bar soaps, we're launching Protex Complete 12, similar to the bundle launching across Latin America. 
In Hill's, Hill's saw organic sales growth was a good balance between volume and price, both here and overseas. In addition, it's encouraging that gross profit margin is up year-over-year. As you may recall, we indicated this would, indeed, happen despite initial cost associated with reformulation of new and existing products. And we're pleased that in the U.S. market, retail consumption in the large-format retailers is up nicely. Among the drivers are our new premium Hill's science diet offerings, which have been supported in-store with impactful displays and are growing faster than the rest of the Hill's science diet line. 
This quarter, we've begun a 10-week turnaround campaign to support Hill's Science Diet Perfect Weight. The objective here is to educate consumers about pet weight loss, creating awareness and buzz around the product to drive trial. Consumer engagement activities will be both in-store and online. 
Hill's Ideal Balance also continued to perform well. Hill's Ideal Balance Grafted was launched in the first quarter. This new sub-line with its premium positioning, offers a of ingredients prepared with care. A full support campaign has included new product kits and feeding trials along with online ratings and reviews. 
The packaging and messaging relaunch of our Hill's Prescription Diet line is also a good start. Here, in the U.S., it's received excellent feedback from the profession. The packaging is seen as being more consumer-friendly with increased in clearer descriptive. And this is now rolling out across Europe. 
So in summary, we are very pleased with the way 2015 has started out. The momentum we saw as we exited 2014 has continued in many regions of the world. Our new product pipeline is full across all categories, and our ongoing savings programs as well as our Global Growth and Efficiency program are providing funds to support that robust innovation. And as we implement our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, our people are becoming even more focused on winning on the ground each and every day. We look forward to sharing our progress with you as we go forward through the year.

We pick up a positive benefit of pricing at 1 percentage point. Between funding the growth and a very modest contribution from restructuring, we picked up another 170 basis points. And as Bina said in her remarks, you can see that, that places us with a far quicker start on our funding-the-growth in 2015 than we had prior year because of the intense focus we have put there. Material prices were a headwind of 230 basis points. And that was almost wholly transaction impact. There's another 10 basis points of other and that gets you to the current year of gross profit of 58.9%. We were very pleased with the 30 basis points improvement we had in the first quarter. Indeed, many external views saw our gross profit coming down because of that foreign exchange transaction impact. And we like to think that the balance we're finding between pricing, between funding-the-growth, between Global Growth and Efficiency driving our innovation and meeting competitive marketplace needs is allowing us to grow the top line, while at the same time, increasing our gross margin. And as we said on the last call, and it remains true for this year, we expect our gross margin to continue to build across the year. And we still plan to expand that gross margin on the year between 50 and 100 basis points. So I think that captures the gross margin approach and thinking from our side. In terms of the marketplaces, I wouldn't say we have seen anything holistically different. We see in pockets increased promotional activity. We see in other pockets, increased couponing activity and we see in other locations, frankly, an easing in the promotional environment. We do see quite a lot of pullback from our principal competitors in media advertising across the first quarter of the year. And I would say our reaction to it is as our reaction has always been, we balance between driving trial for our innovation and meeting promotional needs when they are there. But at the same time, growing and growing our gross margin. And that continues to be our view of the external environment promotionally for the balance of the year."

And we feel we started the year in a good place with that 30 margin point expansion, knowing that pricing takes a little bit of time to catch up with the foreign exchange impact. So more pricing across the balance of the year and reiterating the plan to expand our gross margin, again, across the balance of the year to increase by 50 to 100 basis points for the full year."

In some situations where the marketplace change is significant and dire, we, along with others, tend to take significant pricing steps very quickly. Russia would be a very clear example. In others, we are more balanced in doing it. If I broaden the discussion a little bit and you think about selling price increases, in fact, our selling price increases in the quarter were between 4% and 5%. Then, with some of the activities we have at the store level, we spent some of that back, so you end up with the net pricing number, which is what you see at 2.4% and on balance between the 2, still grew gross profit by 30 basis points and kept advertising at a healthy level of 10.6%. So that's what we tend to be juggling with as we balance gross pricing with how we execute in the marketplace. And our responsiveness will be as the market dictates and our balance between the gross and the effective pricing will reflect also marketplace needs. But again, that balance will see our gross margin expand as the year unfolds by 50 to 100 basis points, which sees us with our traditional advertising up absolutely and as a percent of sales on the year."

But over the last few years, it seems like when margin has crept up, then you soon thereafter, lose share and there's kind of been a trade off, and I'm wondering, number one, if you can comment on that and whether there's been more structural change so that we really should think that 27-plus percent operating margin is sustainable for Hill's, combined with an outlook for top line growth. And also, as the Hill's business sort of expands, I know you've entered some new markets like Eastern Europe and Latin America. I assume you're not opening up manufacturing yet in those places. So is there a risk that there is more transactional cost to the business as pretty smooth and you don't have a global manufacturer for that business specifically?"

And I think all of these are a balance between the value of the consumer believes that they are paying for and the gross margin that, that delivers. So Bina went through much of the innovation that we can so far talk about on the Hill's business thus far this year. And a large part of that is accretive from a gross margin point of view. So we're creating innovation that is margin accretive that the consumer is attracted to. So you will remember, when we went through the process of turning Hill's around, we said one of the key strategic things we wanted to do was to make the innovation flow in Hill's sustainable, not episodic. And we have that now. So yes, we do believe and it was part of our plan when we made the investment in gross margin that we would return to historical levels. Now from a local country expansion point of view, we're not in any new markets compared to the emerging markets that we had already been like Russia, like Brazil, like Mexico, those types of marketplace. And indeed, we do have a transaction burden because we don't make Hill's products in Russia, for example. But all of that is based into our business plan. We make the same pricing adjustments to address the transaction impact on Hill's as we do for the Colgate business. And maybe strategically down the road one day, if you were to invest in capacity, of course, that would give us further margin improvement on those businesses. The other comment I would make is we are finding with Hill's and our engagement with the Hill's consumer that the emotional connection is so rich that you can engage with that consumer through digital vehicles almost entirely because they will spend extraordinarily time finding out information, and they will spend extraordinary time with Hill's representatives to take care of their pets. So with that business, in particular, we're building a very efficient model of targeting and reaching the consumer, given the emotional investment they have in the category of the brand and, of course, their pets. So long story short, we think it's sustainable."

And so let me make a few remarks around China because that really is the country, the geography to discuss. I think the first thing to say is that you will remember, we were one of the first recognize the trade destocking was occurring in the second quarter last year. And we said that destocking process would be completed by the end of 2014 and the trade inventories would be back to balance. And that has happened. The inventory destocking is completed in China. If you look at our consumption in China, which is to say, the consumers purchases of our products, our quarter 1 consumption was up a healthy mid-single digits, in line with the marketplace. Our January, February market share was up meaningfully from the fourth quarter of 2014 when the destocking ended. And indeed, our local sales in China for the first quarter were up behind that strong consumption meaningfully, fourth quarter to first quarter. Now the comparison with the first quarter of 2014 is down due to the comparison with what was our highest quarter in 2014, which again, you will remember was the quarter before the down stocking occurred. So what I'm saying is our consumption is leading our sales back up. Our market share and that consumption predict continued growth in sales. And I think most importantly, the second quarter in China is off to a brisk start. So consumption is good and that future growth for that business will continue to build."

And of course, the couponing behind the trial for those new products would have been in the first quarter of 2014. So there's a timing aspect to that as well. We have, indeed, taken pricing in Brazil. But I would comment on Brazil that it is a different story to China. And that the marketplace economic activity, and indeed, our categories worsened since the last time we spoke in January. I don't think that's new news to everyone. It has been widely reported. Pleasingly, as Bina said, our market share, approaching 72% is up year-on-year. In fact, when I was down there 2 weeks ago, the General Manager said with great pride it was the highest market share in 19 years. But who's looking. And so our shares continue to be strong i.e. we're growing faster than the market growth. And as you would imagine, given our experience in Latin America, we're doing a very, shall we say, attentive job of managing our cost structure. But I think it's fair to say that we should expect and indeed we are planning for a slower Brazil marketplace for the balance of this year. Now the organic growth outcome, I think you can do your own math. We provided a range of 4% to 7% because of the choppiness and volatility in our world. And if -- to put that in comparison, that 4% is up against the highest quarter of last year at 6.5%. So the compares ease a little bit as we go forward. And if the China growth returns the way we expect it to, it will clearly move us up that range. So we're still comfortable with the 4% to 7% range and we'll see how it unfolds quarter by quarter."

And regardless of what the inflation is in a country, in Venezuela's case, pricing is controlled by the government. So we don't have the flexibility to follow the inflation with self-directed pricing in Venezuela. So Venezuela is all roll over in 2015. I would also say that we have very broad-based pricing increases across all of Latin America. You forgot Hill's, where I think we've got a very good balance between the effective pricing and volume growth on that business and beginning to see the gross margin build back nicely, which was clearly one of our objectives. The U.S., North America pricing possibility that will always be a bit choppy, given the timing of couponing behind new products. And the fact that couponing goes into price. And I think they will continue to be pricing pressure in Europe, but our expectation is that is a ease over the balance of the year compared to the first quarter level. Now in Asia, specific to China, we made some corrective pricing actions on a couple of our businesses, which are now baked in for the full year. I think that was responding to all the questions you asked, at least I hope so."

At the same time, because of the economic decline, several of the categories did go negative in volume terms. So not all the categories were positive from a volume point of view. The other thing has to say, and I spent 3 days down there not so long ago is there is quite a bit of short-term disruption in the marketplace. The economy slows down. You have the various scandals unfolding day after day. Interest rates go up and what happens is the indirect retailers take a step back and wait to see how everything is going to settle out. So there is an added element, I would say, of short-term hesitation in terms of the way the market would normally line up.

With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer. 
We're pleased with how this year has started out, with solid organic sales growth and encouraging growth margin improvement despite the major currency headwinds we have been facing. Our business is on track. And as Ian said in this morning's press release, our anticipated full year earnings per share decline reflects a double-digit increase on a currency-neutral basis, of course, excluding restructuring charges. And as you'll hear in more detail shortly, we made very good market share progress across categories and divisions. This is a result of ongoing innovation around the world, supported by a healthy level of advertising. And while our reported advertising was down absolutely versus the year-ago quarter, the 10.6% level as a percent of sales is up meaningfully from the fourth quarter 2014 level of 9.7% and compares to a level in last year's first quarter of 11.1%, the highest for last year. And as we've said on many occasions, it's the combination of this reported advertising and our very impactful in-store activities which drive volume and market share growth. And our efforts in the area of efficiency continued to pay off, with our Funding the Growth initiatives off to a very good start. In fact, it's the strongest first quarter we've had in that area in sometime. In addition, our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track and delivering the savings we had projected. And as referenced in the press release, our balance sheet is strong. Working capital levels are below last year. 
So let's turn to the divisions, starting with North America. Our North American business continues to grow. As mentioned in the press release, our year-to-date market share is up in toothpaste and manual toothbrushes. In addition, it's up in mouthwash, body wash, liquid hand soap and fabric conditioner. 
In the toothpaste whitening category, the February launch of Colgate Optic White Platinum Express White has added incremental share. Our year-to-date share for whitening is 5.8%, which grew to 6.8% in March. Part of our successful integrated marketing campaign included the use of YouTube beauty experts to engage our millennial consumer. Another 2015 toothpaste innovation is Colgate Enamel Health Multi-Protection toothpaste, which includes premium packaging. 
In the body wash category, our year-to-date share is up over a full point to almost 10%. Our February launches of both Irish Spring Signature For Men and Softsoap Fresh & Glow have contributed to these results. 
And our liquid hand soap share is at 31.4% year-to-date, with the most recent share at 33.1%, largely driven by the Softsoap Fragrant Foaming Collection. 
We're also very pleased with our Tom's of Maine business, which is growing very strongly. Innovation as well as increased distribution have played a role. We're getting good traction with our recent launch of a line of baby products. Our in-store execution has been excellent, including a very impactful Earth Day event. And you'll hear about more new products later in the year. 
So let's turn then to Europe/South Pacific. Momentum is strong across this division, and market shares are growing. Our strong organic volume growth of 5.5% is the highest in almost 5 years. Our year-to-date market share is up in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, liquid hand soap, shower gel and fabric conditioner. 
Our year-to-date toothpaste share is at 36.4%, up 40 basis points, with the most recent reading at 37%. Toothpaste innovation this quarter includes Colgate Total Daily Repair. This new product helps reverse early damage for better oral health. It's an everyday multi-benefit toothpaste with proactive repair benefits and is priced at a premium to the base business. In the whitening category, we're launching Colgate Max White for men with powerful stain removal for whiter teeth. And more toothpaste innovation is planned for the second half of this year. 
Our manual toothbrush share is up 2 full points to 26.9% on a year-to-date basis, with the most recent share at 27.2%. And innovative products such as Colgate 360° and Colgate Slim Soft toothbrushes reported by excellent in-store execution have helped drive these results. The U.K. and Australia had particularly good performance, with year-to-date toothbrush shares up 660 basis points and 240 basis points, respectively, clearly strengthening already robust leadership positions. 
In the Personal Care category, we're also launching a new men's variance, Palmolive Men Fresh Care. This is a 3-in-1 product, which combines a face, body and hair wash in one convenient package. We told you last quarter about a new line under the Sanex brand, Sanex ADVANCED. This has had excellent trade acceptance and in-store implementation. We expect that share results should follow soon. 
Our year-to-date fabric conditioner share is up 80 basis points to 27.4%, with the most recent period at 27.7%. This was helped by the launch of Soupline Paradise Sensations, which brings new trends to the fabric conditioner category with its powerful bundle impact and sophisticated fragrances. The pipeline of products moving forward is strong, with the relaunch of Soupline Perfect Glide and Magic Moments, offering easy ironing and superior long-lasting fragrance. The new premium look with outstanding on-shelf impact and a high-performing formula commands a premium price. 
Turning then to Latin America. Organic sales growth was strong in this region, despite a strong year-ago comparison. And as elsewhere, premium innovation has helped drive results. 
Our regional toothpaste share is up 150 basis points to 77.7% on a year-to-date basis, with good gains in many countries. In Brazil, we're up 40 basis points year-over-year to 71.7%, while our nearest competitor has seen sequential declines in the last 3 bimonthly share periods. In Mexico, we're up 110 basis points to 80.6% and this despite continued promotional pressure from some of our competitors. 
In manual toothbrushes, premium offerings such as Colgate 360° and Colgate Slim Soft have contributed share growth in many countries. In Mexico, our leadership share increased 80 basis points to 43.1% on a year-to-date basis, widening the gap between our nearest competitor to 150 basis points. In Colombia, our year-to-date share increased 30 basis points to 46.7%. 
In bar soap, the year has started strong, with the division holding market leadership at 30.7%. Both equities, Palmolive and Protex, continued to be the #1 and 2 brands across Latin America. And we achieved record high shares in Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala. 
Our market-leading fabric conditioner business in Mexico expanded its market share by 50 basis points to 47.2% on a year-to-date basis. Newly launched Suavitel Aroma Intense achieved a 1.4% share in the direct trade in the first quarter. And a new smaller base business size helped compete with low-priced local competitors in the bodega retail environment. 
Innovation in Latin America continues this quarter across categories. To build on our success in the whitening category, we are launching Luminous White Advanced toothpaste in Brazil. This is Colgate's most advanced whitening toothpaste, which intensifies the white of your teeth 3 shades whiter. Its unique formula contains the same ingredient dentists use, and you can feel it working while you brush. As a companion product, we will offer Colgate 360° Luminous White toothbrush, with stain-erasing cups and a 2x whitening action. 
In the mid-tier segment and as a companion to our Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Neutrazucar toothpaste, we are relaunching Colgate Zig Zag Maximum Cavity Protection toothbrush. The product has multi-angled bristles and a flexible neck which help with plaque removal. 
And in the Personal Care category, we have just launched a new line under the Protex brand. Protex Complete 12 body wash, hand soap and bar soap, providing long-lasting antibacterial protection. 
Turning then to Asia. As you've seen, organic sales performance in this region was somewhat muted this quarter. But going forward, we have a full pipeline of new products to reignite growth. 
In India, our toothpaste share is up 30 basis points to 54.6% on a year-to-date basis, fueled by the launch of Colgate Active Salt and Colgate Max Fresh. In the Philippines, our toothpaste share increased 120 basis points to 60.9%, with the most recent read at 61.2%. Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection toothpaste has achieved almost a 3% share of that market. 
Our manual toothbrush shares increased in 5 of 10 countries around the region, with our divisional year-to-date share at 29.9%, down modestly from the year-ago period but still the market leading position. 
And we continue to grow our mouthwash business. Our regional share is up 30 basis points to 24% on a year-to-date basis. 
In India, Colgate Plax Active Salt and Colgate Plax Visible White helped drive our market share up 100 basis points to 18.2%, while in the Philippines, Colgate Plax Jasmine Tea was a major driver of a 220 basis point increase to 26.8%, with the most recent read at 27.9%. 
And in the second quarter, the innovation continues. In toothpaste, we will launch Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair & Prevent, which repairs the sensitive areas of teeth and with regular use, provides lasting protection to prevent sensitivity from returning. In the base sensitivity line comes Colgate Sensitive with Sensifoam to reach all areas of the teeth. 
For the Thai market, we're launching Colgate Salt Charcoal. And as you know, charcoal is an attractive ingredient to consumers in this region based on local insights. 
In manual toothbrushes, we've just introduced Colgate Slim Soft Gold Charcoal toothbrush, with less than 0.01 millimeters slim tip antibacterial bristles for deep but gentle cleaning. And we're extending charcoal to the value portion of our toothbrush business with Colgate Zig Zag Charcoal toothbrush. 
In personal care in Thailand, we will launch a line of soap, body wash and hand soap, Protex Omega 3, body wash with Omega 3 essential oil and which washes away 99.9% of bacteria while keeping your skin feeling moisturized. Also in that market, we will introduce Protex Intimate Care feminine wash, the bundle now selling in Brazil. 
Turning to Africa/Eurasia. Organic sales in this region were strong, building on the momentum we saw as we exited 2014. And innovation has driven these good results across categories. 
Our regional toothpaste share is up 90 basis points year-to-date to 33.7%, with market share increases in virtually every country. Our share in Russia was up 160 basis points; in South Africa, 120 basis points; and in Turkey, 130 basis points. Similarly, our toothbrush share increased everywhere with the exception of East-West Africa. Shares in Russia, South Africa and Turkey increased 170 basis points, 90 basis points and 50 basis points, respectively. 
Our bar soap share was also up across the region, up 290 basis points year-to-date. In South Africa, our share increased 180 basis points to 32.4%, thanks to the new products we told you about in previous quarters: Protex Men and Protex African Therapy. 
And more innovation is planned for this quarter. In toothpaste, we will be launching Colgate Optic White Whiten and Restore. The formula with an active mineral complex and fresh mint flavor provides 1 shade whiter teeth in 1 week while helping to restore enamel strength. And the consumer can have the confidence of always being able to look their best without compromising the health of her mouth. 
In Russia, following on the success of our Altai Herbs bundle, we will be introducing Colgate Plax Forte Oak Bark & Fir mouthwash. Oak Bark & Fir are attractive ingredients to consumers in this part of the world based on local insights. 
And in the shower gel category, we are adding a new variant to our successful Palmolive Spa Gourmet line, Mint Shake, with an uplifting mint fragrance and rich creamy formula infused with natural mint extracts that leave your skin feeling pampered. 
To build on our success in bar soaps, we're launching Protex Complete 12, similar to the bundle launching across Latin America. 
And Hill's. Hill's solid organic sales growth was a good balance between volume and price, both here and overseas. In addition, it's encouraging that gross profit margin is up year-over-year. As you may recall, we indicated this would, indeed, happen despite initial costs associated with reformulation of new and existing products. 
And we're pleased that in the U.S. market, retail consumption in the large format retailers is up nicely. Among the drivers are our new premium Hill's Science Diet offerings, which have been supported in-store with impactful displays and are growing faster than the rest of the Hill's Science Diet line. 
This quarter, we've begun a 10-week turnaround campaign to support Hill's Science Diet Perfect Weight. The objective here is to educate consumers about pet weight loss, creating awareness and buzz around the product to drive trial. Consumer engagement activities will be both in-store and online. 
Hill's Ideal Balance also continued to perform well. Hill's Ideal Balance Crafted was launched in the first quarter. This new sub-line with its premium positioning offers authentic ingredients prepared with care. A full support campaign has included new product kits and feeding trials along with online ratings and reviews. 
The packaging and messaging relaunch of our Hill's Prescription Diet line is off to a good start. Here in the U.S., it's received excellent feedback from the profession [ph]. The packaging is seen as being more consumer-friendly with increased and clearer descriptive. And this is now rolling out across Europe. 
So in summary, we're very pleased with the way 2015 has started out. The momentum we saw as we exited 2014 has continued in many regions of the world. Our new product pipeline is full across all categories, and our ongoing savings programs as well as our Global Growth and Efficiency Program are providing funds to support that robust innovation. And as we implement our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, our people are becoming even more focused on winning on the ground each and every day. We look forward to sharing our progress with you as we go forward through the year. 
And now, Danny, I'd like to open it up for questions."

We pick up a positive benefit of pricing at 1 percentage point. Between Funding the Growth and a very modest contribution from restructuring, we pick up another 170 basis points. And as Bina said in her remarks, you can see that, that places us with a far quicker start on our Funding the Growth in 2015 than we had prior year because of the intense focus we have put there. Material prices were a headwind of 230 basis points, and that was almost wholly a transaction impact. There's another 10 basis points of other, and that gets you to the current year of gross profit of 58.9%. We were very pleased with the 30 basis points improvement we had in the first quarter. Indeed, many external views saw our gross profit coming down because of that foreign exchange transaction impact. And we like to think that the balance we're finding between pricing, between Funding the Growth, between Global Growth and Efficiency, driving our innovation and meeting competitive marketplace needs is allowing us to grow the top line while, at the same time, increasing our gross margin. And as we said on the last call, and it remains true for this year, we expect our gross margin to continue to build across the year. And we still plan to expand that gross margin on the year between 50 and 100 basis points. So I think that captures the gross margin approach and thinking from our side. In terms of the marketplaces, I wouldn't say we have seen anything holistically different. We see in pockets increased promotional activity. We see in other pockets increased couponing activity. And we see in other locations, frankly, an easing in the promotional environment. We do see quite a lot of pullback from our principal competitors in media advertising across the first quarter of the year. And I would say our reaction to it is as our reaction has always been, we balance between driving trial for our innovation and meeting promotional needs when they are there but, at the same time, growing and growing our gross margin. And that continues to be our view of the external environment promotionally for the balance of the year."

But I return to the point that I think we're working very hard to maintain that right balance, so we can invest to grow market share and drive the top line while increasing our gross margin. And we feel we started the year in a good place with that 30 margin point expansion, knowing that pricing takes a little bit of time to catch up with the foreign exchange impact. So more pricing across the balance of the year and reiterating the plan to expand our gross margin, again, across the balance of the year to increase by 50 to 100 basis points for the full year."

And so, I guess, how do we look at sort of the time frame that it takes to react to some of this emerging market currency volatility in the transactional FX? Is it something where the pricing goes in relatively quickly? Or do you sort of have to wait for things to stabilize as we look at sort of how to balance, again, some of the wild movements in the currency and whether or not if you price for transactional and then the currency moves in your favor, there's an additional spread that works in your favor?"

It's -- in some situations where the marketplace change is significant and dire, we, along with others, tend to take significant pricing steps very quickly. Russia would be a very clear example. In others, we are more balanced in doing it. If I broaden the discussion a little bit and you think about selling price increases, in fact, our selling price increases in the quarter were between 4% and 5%. Then with some of the activities we have at the store level, we spent some of that back. So you end up with the net pricing number, which is what you see at 2.4% and on balance between the two, still grew gross profit by 30 basis points and kept advertising at a healthy level of 10.6%. So that's what we tend to be juggling with as we balance gross pricing with how we execute in the marketplace. And our responsiveness will be as the market dictates, and our balance between the gross and the effective pricing will reflect also marketplace needs. But again, that balance will see our gross margin expand as the year unfolds by 50 to 100 basis points, which sees us with our traditional advertising up absolutely and as a percent of sales on the year."

And it looks to me that the operating margin is kind of back to close to an all-time high level, which is awesome. But over the last few years, it seems like when margin has crept up, then you soon thereafter lose share, and there's kind of been a trade-off. And I'm wondering, number one, if you can comment on that and whether there's been more structural change so that we really should think that a 27-plus percent operating margin is sustainable for Hill's, combined with an outlook for top line growth. And also, as the Hill's business sort of expands, I know you've entered some new markets like Eastern Europe and Latin America, I assume you're not opening up manufacturing yet in those places. So is there a risk that there is more transactional cost to the business as currencies move and you don't have local manufacturing for that business specifically?"

And I think all of these are a balance between the value of the consumer believes that they are paying for and the gross margin that, that delivers. So Bina went through much of the innovation that we can so far talk about on the Hill's business thus far this year, and a large part of that is accretive from a gross margin point of view. So we're creating innovation that is margin-accretive that the consumer is attracted to. So you will remember, when we went through the process of turning Hill's around, we said one of the key strategic things we wanted to do was to make the innovation flow in Hill's sustainable, not episodic. And we have that now. So yes, we do believe, and it was part of our plan when we made the investment in gross margin, that we would return to historical levels. Now from a local country expansion point of view, we're not in any new markets compared to the emerging markets that we had already been in, like Russia, like Brazil, like Mexico, those types of marketplace. And indeed, we do have a transaction burden because we don't make Hill's products in Russia, for example. But all of that is based into our business plan. We make the same pricing adjustments to address the transaction impact on Hill's as we do for the Colgate business. And maybe strategically down the road one day, if we were to invest in capacity, of course, that would give us further margin improvement on those businesses. The other comment I would make is we are finding with Hill's and our engagement with the Hill's consumer that the emotional connection is so rich that you can engage with that consumer through digital vehicles almost entirely because they will spend extraordinarily (sic) [extraordinary] time finding out information, and they will spend extraordinary time with Hill's representatives to take care of their pets. So with that business, in particular, we're building a very efficient model of targeting and reaching the consumer given the emotional investment they have in the category of the brand and, of course, their pets. So long story short, we think it's sustainable."

And so let me make a few remarks around China because that really is the country, the geography to discuss. I think the first thing to say is that you will remember, we were one of the first to recognize that trade destocking was occurring in the second quarter last year. And we said that destocking process would be completed by the end of 2014, and the trade inventories would be back to balance. And that has happened. The inventory destocking is completed in China. If you look at our consumption in China, which is to say, the consumer's purchases of our products, our quarter 1 consumption was up a healthy mid-single digits, in line with the marketplace. Our January, February market share was up meaningfully from the fourth quarter of 2014 when the destocking ended. And indeed, our local sales in China for the first quarter were up behind that strong consumption, meaningfully, fourth quarter to first quarter. Now the comparison with the first quarter of 2014 is down due to the comparison with what was our highest quarter in 2014, which, again, you will remember was the quarter before the down-stocking occurred. So what I'm saying is our consumption is leading our sales back up. Our market share and that consumption predict continued growth in sales. And I think most importantly, the second quarter in China is off to a brisk start. So consumption is good and that future growth for that business will continue to build."

And of course, the couponing behind the trial for those new products would have been in the first quarter of 2014. So there's a timing aspect to that as well. We have, indeed, taken pricing in Brazil. But I would comment on Brazil that it is a different story to China and that the marketplace economic activity and, indeed, our categories worsened since the last time we spoke in January. I don't think that's new news to everyone. It has been widely reported. Pleasingly, as Bina said, our market share, approaching 72%, is up year-on-year. In fact, when I was down there 2 weeks ago, the General Manager said with great pride that it was the highest market share in 19 years. But who's looking? And so our shares continue to be strong, i.e. we're growing faster than the market growth. And as you would imagine, given our experience in Latin America, we're doing a very, shall we say, attentive job of managing our cost structure. But I think it's fair to say that we should expect, and indeed, we are planning for, a slower Brazil marketplace for the balance of this year. Now the organic growth outcome, I think you can do your own math. We provided a range of 4% to 7% because of the choppiness and volatility in our world. And if -- to put that in comparison, that 4% is up against the highest quarter of last year at 6.5%. So the compares ease a little bit as we go forward. And if the China growth returns the way we expect it to, it will clearly move us up that range. So we're still comfortable with the 4% to 7% range, and we'll see how it unfolds quarter-by-quarter."

Well, I don't like being categorized as the last guy standing. And Venezuela is a unique case. I don't know what data you're seeing, Bill, but our Home Care business is not a focus for us in Venezuela. And indeed, material availability is modest in that business. I think as you heard Bina talk, we're quite pleased with our Home Care and our Personal Care business. Yes, there are more competitors in Personal Care than we find in Oral Care. But if you take Personal Care against the company, Personal Care organic grew around 3% in the first quarter, quite healthy growth. And more competitors mean the marketplace is more fragmented, and therefore, you can garner progress because there are simply more players in the space. And I think some of the examples Bina quoted are very good examples of where we're doing precisely that in emerging markets as well as developed markets. So no, we still think there is opportunity for growth in those categories, and we're going after it."

And then on where the pricing has been driving your overall pricing, so Latin America and Africa/Eurasia, both in kind of 7.5%, 8%. Both of those, as you comment, are driven by highly inflationary areas. So Venezuela, as an example, in Latin America, call it, 50% or 60% inflation, it's 3% of your business, overall, 10% of that region, Africa/Eurasia, Russia, obviously, the driver there or one of the potential drivers there.

Sustainably both of the negative, sort of bad stuff and then potentially the good stuff on pricing."

The -- if we take pricing overall, and you may have missed the response we gave a little bit earlier, we continue to believe we have pricing power. And therefore, the growth pricing we've been able to take is around 4.5%. And we have reinvested some of that in the trade spending activity to grow market share, which, along with the traditional advertising we have invested, have continued to be productive. We are growing market shares broadly, and we are seeing our gross margin expand. We think in terms of the pricing in Africa/Eurasia and Latin America that, that is sustainable. We're not, again, going to talk about Venezuela specifically other than to say when we got pricing in the fourth quarter of last year, so did many of our competitors. And regardless of what the inflation is in a country, in Venezuela's case, pricing is controlled by the government. So we don't have the flexibility to follow the inflation with self-directed pricing in Venezuela. So Venezuela is all rollover in 2015. I would also say that we have very broad-based pricing increases across all of Latin America. You forgot Hill's, where I think we've got a very good balance between effective pricing and volume growth on that business and beginning to see the gross margin build back nicely, which was clearly one of our objectives. The U.S., North America pricing possibility, that will always be a bit choppy, given the timing of couponing behind new products and the fact that couponing goes into price. And I think there will continue to be pricing pressure in Europe, but our expectation is that it will ease over the balance of the year compared to the first quarter level. Now in Asia, specific to China, we made some corrective pricing actions on a couple of our businesses, which are now baked in for the full year. I think that was responding to all the questions you asked, at least I hope so."

At the same time, because of the economic decline, several of the categories did go negative in volume terms. So not all the categories were positive from a volume point of view. The other thing one has to say, and I spent 3 days down there not so long ago, is there is quite a bit of short-term disruption in the marketplace. The economy slows down. You have the various scandals unfolding day after day. Interest rates go up. And what happens is the indirect retailers take a step back and wait to see how everything is going to settle out. So there is an added element, I would say, of short-term hesitation in terms of the way the market would normally line up.

With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer. 
We're pleased with how this year has started out, with solid organic sales growth and encouraging growth margin improvement despite the major currency headwinds we have been facing. Our business is on track. And as Ian said in this morning's press release, our anticipated full year earnings per share decline reflects a double-digit increase on a currency-neutral basis, of course, excluding restructuring charges. And as you'll hear in more detail shortly, we made very good market share progress across categories and divisions. This is a result of ongoing innovation around the world, supported by a healthy level of advertising. And while our reported advertising was down absolutely versus the year-ago quarter, the 10.6% level as a percent of sales is up meaningfully from the fourth quarter 2014 level of 9.7% and compares to a level in last year's first quarter of 11.1%, the highest for last year. And as we've said on many occasions, it's the combination of this reported advertising and our very impactful in-store activities which drive volume and market share growth. And our efforts in the area of efficiency continued to pay off, with our Funding the Growth initiatives off to a very good start. In fact, it's the strongest first quarter we've had in that area in some time. In addition, our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track and delivering the savings we had projected. And as referenced in the press release, our balance sheet is strong. Working capital levels are below last year. 
So let's turn to the divisions, starting with North America. Our North American business continues to grow. As mentioned in the press release, our year-to-date market share is up in toothpaste and manual toothbrushes. In addition, it's up in mouthwash, body wash, liquid hand soap and fabric conditioner. 
In the toothpaste whitening category, the February launch of Colgate Optic White Platinum Express White has added incremental share. Our year-to-date share for whitening is 5.8%, which grew to 6.8% in March. Part of our successful integrated marketing campaign included the use of YouTube beauty experts to engage our millennial consumer. Another 2015 toothpaste innovation is Colgate Enamel Health Multi-Protection toothpaste, which includes premium packaging. 
In the body wash category, our year-to-date share is up over a full point to almost 10%. Our February launches of both Irish Spring Signature For Men and Softsoap Fresh & Glow have contributed to these results. 
And our liquid hand soap share is at 31.4% year-to-date, with the most recent share at 33.1%, largely driven by the Softsoap Fragrant Foaming Collection. 
We're also very pleased with our Tom's of Maine business, which is growing very strongly. Innovation as well as increased distribution have played a role. We're getting good traction with our recent launch of a line of baby products. Our in-store execution has been excellent, including a very impactful Earth Day event. And you'll hear about more new products later in the year. 
So let's turn then to Europe/South Pacific. Momentum is strong across this division, and market shares are growing. Our strong organic volume growth of 5.5% is the highest in almost 5 years. Our year-to-date market share is up in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, liquid hand soap, shower gel and fabric conditioner. 
Our year-to-date toothpaste share is at 36.4%, up 40 basis points, with the most recent reading at 37%. Toothpaste innovation this quarter includes Colgate Total Daily Repair. This new product helps reverse early damage for better oral health. It's an everyday multi-benefit toothpaste with proactive repair benefits and is priced at a premium to the base business. In the whitening category, we're launching Colgate Max White for men with powerful stain removal for whiter teeth. And more toothpaste innovation is planned for the second half of this year. 
Our manual toothbrush share is up 2 full points to 26.9% on a year-to-date basis, with the most recent share at 27.2%. And innovative products such as Colgate 360° and Colgate Slim Soft toothbrushes reported by excellent in-store execution have helped drive these results. The U.K. and Australia had particularly good performance, with year-to-date toothbrush shares up 660 basis points and 240 basis points, respectively, clearly strengthening already robust leadership positions. 
In the Personal Care category, we're also launching a new men's variance, Palmolive Men Fresh Care. This is a 3-in-1 product, which combines a face, body and hair wash in one convenient package. We told you last quarter about a new line under the Sanex brand, Sanex ADVANCED. This has had excellent trade acceptance and in-store implementation. We expect that share results should follow soon. 
Our year-to-date fabric conditioner share is up 80 basis points to 27.4%, with the most recent period at 27.7%. This was helped by the launch of Soupline Paradise Sensations, which brings new trends to the fabric conditioner category with its powerful bundle impact and sophisticated fragrances. The pipeline of products moving forward is strong, with the relaunch of Soupline Perfect Glide and Magic Moments, offering easy ironing and superior long-lasting fragrance. The new premium look with outstanding on-shelf impact and a high-performing formula commands a premium price. 
Turning then to Latin America. Organic sales growth was strong in this region, despite a strong year-ago comparison. And as elsewhere, premium innovation has helped drive results. 
Our regional toothpaste share is up 150 basis points to 77.7% on a year-to-date basis, with good gains in many countries. In Brazil, we're up 40 basis points year-over-year to 71.7%, while our nearest competitor has seen sequential declines in the last 3 bimonthly share periods. In Mexico, we're up 110 basis points to 80.6% and this despite continued promotional pressure from some of our competitors. 
In manual toothbrushes, premium offerings such as Colgate 360° and Colgate Slim Soft have contributed to share growth in many countries. In Mexico, our leadership share increased 80 basis points to 43.1% on a year-to-date basis, widening the gap between our nearest competitor to 150 basis points. In Colombia, our year-to-date share increased 30 basis points to 46.7%. 
In bar soap, the year has started strong, with the division holding market leadership at 30.7%. Both equities, Palmolive and Protex, continued to be the #1 and #2 brands across Latin America. And we achieved record high shares in Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala. 
Our market-leading fabric conditioner business in Mexico expanded its market share by 50 basis points to 47.2% on a year-to-date basis. Newly launched Suavitel Aroma Intense achieved a 1.4% share in the direct trade in the first quarter. And a new smaller base business size helped compete with low-priced local competitors in the bodega retail environment. 
Innovation in Latin America continues this quarter across categories. To build on our success in the whitening category, we are launching Luminous White Advanced toothpaste in Brazil. This is Colgate's most advanced whitening toothpaste, which intensifies the white of your teeth 3 shades whiter. Its unique formula contains the same ingredient dentists use, and you can feel it working while you brush. As a companion product, we will offer Colgate 360° Luminous White toothbrush, with stain-erasing cups and a 2x whitening action. 
In the mid-tier segment and as a companion to our Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Neutrazucar toothpaste, we are relaunching Colgate Zig Zag Maximum Cavity Protection toothbrush. The product has multi-angled bristles and a flexible neck which help with plaque removal. 
And in the Personal Care category, we have just launched a new line under the Protex brand. Protex Complete 12 body wash, hand soap and bar soap, providing long-lasting antibacterial protection. 
Turning then to Asia. As you've seen, organic sales performance in this region was somewhat muted this quarter. But going forward, we have a full pipeline of new products to reignite growth. 
In India, our toothpaste share is up 30 basis points to 54.6% on a year-to-date basis, fueled by the launch of Colgate Active Salt and Colgate Max Fresh. In the Philippines, our toothpaste share increased 120 basis points to 60.9%, with the most recent read at 61.2%. Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection toothpaste has achieved almost a 3% share of that market. 
Our manual toothbrush shares increased in 5 of 10 countries around the region, with our divisional year-to-date share at 29.9%, down modestly from the year-ago period but still the market leading position. 
And we continue to grow our mouthwash business. Our regional share is up 30 basis points to 24% on a year-to-date basis. 
In India, Colgate Plax Active Salt and Colgate Plax Visible White helped drive our market share up 100 basis points to 18.2%, while in the Philippines, Colgate Plax Jasmine Tea was a major driver of a 220 basis point increase to 26.8%, with the most recent read at 27.9%. 
And in the second quarter, the innovation continues. In toothpaste, we will launch Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair & Prevent, which repairs the sensitive areas of teeth and with regular use, provides lasting protection to prevent sensitivity from returning. In the base sensitivity line comes Colgate Sensitive with Sensifoam to reach all areas of the teeth. 
For the Thai market, we're launching Colgate Salt Charcoal. And as you know, charcoal is an attractive ingredient to consumers in this region based on local insights. 
In manual toothbrushes, we've just introduced Colgate Slim Soft Gold Charcoal toothbrush, with less than 0.01 millimeters slim tip antibacterial bristles for deep but gentle cleaning. And we're extending charcoal to the value portion of our toothbrush business with Colgate Zig Zag Charcoal toothbrush. 
In personal care in Thailand, we will launch a line of soap, body wash and hand soap, Protex Omega 3, body wash with Omega 3 essential oil and which washes away 99.9% of bacteria while keeping your skin feeling moisturized. Also in that market, we will introduce Protex Intimate Care feminine wash, the bundle now selling in Brazil. 
Turning to Africa/Eurasia. Organic sales in this region were strong, building on the momentum we saw as we exited 2014. And innovation has driven these good results across categories. 
Our regional toothpaste share is up 90 basis points year-to-date to 33.7%, with market share increases in virtually every country. Our share in Russia was up 160 basis points; in South Africa, 120 basis points; and in Turkey, 130 basis points. Similarly, our toothbrush share increased everywhere with the exception of East-West Africa. Shares in Russia, South Africa and Turkey increased 170 basis points, 90 basis points and 50 basis points, respectively. 
Our bar soap share was also up across the region, up 290 basis points year-to-date. In South Africa, our share increased 180 basis points to 32.4%, thanks to the new products we told you about in previous quarters: Protex Men and Protex African Therapy. 
And more innovation is planned for this quarter. In toothpaste, we will be launching Colgate Optic White Whiten and Restore. The formula with an active mineral complex and fresh mint flavor provides 1 shade whiter teeth in 1 week while helping to restore enamel strength. And the consumer can have the confidence of always being able to look her best without compromising the health of her mouth. 
In Russia, following on the success of our Altai Herbs bundle, we will be introducing Colgate Plax Forte Oak Bark & Fir mouthwash. Oak Bark & Fir are attractive ingredients to consumers in this part of the world based on local insights. 
And in the shower gel category, we are adding a new variant to our successful Palmolive Spa Gourmet line, Mint Shake, with an uplifting mint fragrance and rich creamy formula infused with natural mint extracts that leave your skin feeling pampered. 
To build on our success in bar soaps, we're launching Protex Complete 12, similar to the bundle launching across Latin America. 
And Hill's. Hill's solid organic sales growth was a good balance between volume and price, both here and overseas. In addition, it's encouraging that gross profit margin is up year-over-year. As you may recall, we indicated this would indeed happen despite initial costs associated with reformulation of new and existing products. 
And we're pleased that in the U.S. market, retail consumption in the large format retailers is up nicely. Among the drivers are our new premium Hill's Science Diet offerings, which have been supported in-store with impactful displays and are growing faster than the rest of the Hill's Science Diet line. 
This quarter, we've begun a 10-week turnaround campaign to support Hill's Science Diet Perfect Weight. The objective here is to educate consumers about pet weight loss, creating awareness and buzz around the product to drive trial. Consumer engagement activities will be both in-store and online. 
Hill's Ideal Balance also continued to perform well. Hill's Ideal Balance Crafted was launched in the first quarter. This new sub-line with its premium positioning offers authentic ingredients prepared with care. A full support campaign has included new product kits and feeding trials along with online ratings and reviews. 
The packaging and messaging relaunch of our Hill's Prescription Diet line is off to a good start. Here in the U.S., it's received excellent feedback from the profession. The packaging is seen as being more consumer-friendly with increased and clearer descriptive. And this is now rolling out across Europe. 
So in summary, we're very pleased with the way 2015 has started out. The momentum we saw as we exited 2014 has continued in many regions of the world. Our new product pipeline is full across all categories, and our ongoing savings programs as well as our Global Growth and Efficiency Program are providing funds to support that robust innovation. And as we implement our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, our people are becoming even more focused on winning on the ground each and every day. We look forward to sharing our progress with you as we go forward through the year. 
And now, Danny, I'd like to open it up for questions."

We pick up a positive benefit of pricing at 1 percentage point. Between Funding the Growth and a very modest contribution from restructuring, we pick up another 170 basis points. And as Bina said in her remarks, you can see that, that places us with a far quicker start on our Funding the Growth in 2015 than we had prior year because of the intense focus we have put there. Material prices were a headwind of 230 basis points, and that was almost wholly a transaction impact. There's another 10 basis points of other, and that gets you to the current year of gross profit of 58.9%. We were very pleased with the 30 basis points improvement we had in the first quarter. Indeed, many external views saw our gross profit coming down because of that foreign exchange transaction impact. And we like to think that the balance we're finding between pricing, between Funding the Growth, between Global Growth and Efficiency, driving our innovation and meeting competitive marketplace needs is allowing us to grow the top line while, at the same time, increasing our gross margin. And as we said on the last call, and it remains true for this year, we expect our gross margin to continue to build across the year. And we still plan to expand that gross margin on the year between 50 and 100 basis points. So I think that captures the gross margin approach and thinking from our side. In terms of the marketplaces, I wouldn't say we have seen anything holistically different. We see in pockets increased promotional activity. We see in other pockets increased couponing activity. And we see in other locations, frankly, an easing in the promotional environment. We do see quite a lot of pullback from our principal competitors in media advertising across the first quarter of the year. And I would say our reaction to it is as our reaction has always been, we balance between driving trial for our innovation and meeting promotional needs when they are there, but at the same time, growing and growing our gross margin. And that continues to be our view of the external environment promotionally for the balance of the year."

As you correctly say, we use pricing along with other vehicles to offset that transaction impact of foreign exchange. But I return to the point that I think we're working very hard to maintain that right balance, so we can invest to grow market share and drive the top line while increasing our gross margin. And we feel we started the year in a good place with that 30 margin point expansion, knowing that pricing takes a little bit of time to catch up with the foreign exchange impact. So more pricing across the balance of the year and reiterating the plan to expand our gross margin, again, across the balance of the year to increase by 50 to 100 basis points for the full year."

And so I guess, how do we look at sort of the time frame that it takes to react to some of this emerging market currency volatility in the transactional FX? Is it something where the pricing goes in relatively quickly? Or do you sort of have to wait for things to stabilize as we look at sort of how to balance, again, some of the wild movements in the currency and whether or not if you price for transactional and then the currency moves in your favor, there's an additional spread that works in your favor?"

It's -- in some situations where the marketplace change is significant and dire, we, along with others, tend to take significant pricing steps very quickly. Russia would be a very clear example. In others, we are more balanced in doing it. If I broaden the discussion a little bit and you think about selling price increases, in fact, our selling price increases in the quarter were between 4% and 5%. Then with some of the activities we have at the store level, we spent some of that back. So you end up with the net pricing number, which is what you see at 2.4% and on balance between the two, still grew gross profit by 30 basis points and kept advertising at a healthy level of 10.6%. So that's what we tend to be juggling with as we balance gross pricing with how we execute in the marketplace. And our responsiveness will be as the market dictates, and our balance between the gross and the effective pricing will reflect also marketplace needs. But again, that balance will see our gross margin expand as the year unfolds by 50 to 100 basis points, which sees us with our traditional advertising up absolutely and as a percent of sales on the year."

And it looks to me that the operating margin is kind of back to close to an all-time high level, which is awesome. But over the last few years, it seems like when margin has crept up, then you soon thereafter lose share, and there's kind of been a trade-off. And I'm wondering, number one, if you can comment on that and whether there's been more structural change so that we really should think that a 27-plus percent operating margin is sustainable for Hill's, combined with an outlook for top line growth. And also, as the Hill's business sort of expands, I know you've entered some new markets like Eastern Europe and Latin America, I assume you're not opening up manufacturing yet in those places. So is there a risk that there is more transactional cost to the business as currencies move and you don't have local manufacturing for that business specifically?"

And I think all of these are a balance between the value of the consumer believes that they are paying for and the gross margin that, that delivers. So Bina went through much of the innovation that we can so far talk about on the Hill's business thus far this year, and a large part of that is accretive from a gross margin point of view. So we're creating innovation that is margin-accretive that the consumer is attracted to. So you will remember, when we went through the process of turning Hill's around, we said one of the key strategic things we wanted to do was to make the innovation flow in Hill's sustainable, not episodic. And we have that now. So yes, we do believe, and it was part of our plan when we made the investment in gross margin, that we would return to historical levels. Now from a local country expansion point of view, we're not in any new markets compared to the emerging markets that we had already been in, like Russia, like Brazil, like Mexico, those types of marketplace. And indeed, we do have a transaction burden because we don't make Hill's products in Russia, for example. But all of that is based into our business plan. We make the same pricing adjustments to address the transaction impact on Hill's as we do for the Colgate business. And maybe strategically down the road one day, if we were to invest in capacity, of course, that would give us further margin improvement on those businesses. The other comment I would make is we are finding with Hill's and our engagement with the Hill's consumer that the emotional connection is so rich that you can engage with that consumer through digital vehicles almost entirely because they will spend extraordinarily (sic) [extraordinary] time finding out information, and they will spend extraordinary time with Hill's representatives to take care of their pets. So with that business, in particular, we're building a very efficient model of targeting and reaching the consumer given the emotional investment they have in the category of the brand and, of course, their pet. So long story short, we think it's sustainable."

And so let me make a few remarks around China because that really is the country, the geography to discuss. I think the first thing to say is that you will remember, we were one of the first to recognize that trade destocking was occurring in the second quarter last year. And we said that destocking process would be completed by the end of 2014, and the trade inventories would be back to balance. And that has happened. The inventory destocking is completed in China. If you look at our consumption in China, which is to say, the consumer's purchases of our products, our quarter 1 consumption was up a healthy mid-single digits, in line with the marketplace. Our January, February market share was up meaningfully from the fourth quarter of 2014 when the destocking ended. And indeed, our local sales in China for the first quarter were up behind that strong consumption, meaningfully, fourth quarter to first quarter. Now the comparison with the first quarter of 2014 is down due to the comparison with what was our highest quarter in 2014, which, again, you will remember was the quarter before the down-stocking occurred. So what I'm saying is our consumption is leading our sales back up. Our market share and that consumption predict continued growth in sales. And I think most importantly, the second quarter in China is off to a brisk start. So consumption is good and that future growth for that business will continue to build."

And yes, I would say there has been some modulation in the promotion activity. And indeed, you will remember, the first quarter for us last year was the quarter in which we had launched many, many of our new products. And of course, the couponing behind the trial for those new products would have been in the first quarter of 2014. So there's a timing aspect to that as well. We have, indeed, taken pricing in Brazil. But I would comment on Brazil that it is a different story to China and that the marketplace economic activity and, indeed, our categories worsened since the last time we spoke in January. I don't think that's new news to everyone. It has been widely reported. Pleasingly, as Bina said, our market share, approaching 72%, is up year-on-year. In fact, when I was down there 2 weeks ago, the General Manager said with great pride that it was the highest market share in 19 years. But who's looking? And so our shares continue to be strong, i.e. we're growing faster than the market growth. And as you would imagine, given our experience in Latin America, we're doing a very, shall we say, attentive job of managing our cost structure. But I think it's fair to say that we should expect, and indeed, we are planning for, a slower Brazil marketplace for the balance of this year. Now the organic growth outcome, I think you can do your own math. We provided a range of 4% to 7% because of the choppiness and volatility in our world. And if -- to put that in comparison, that 4% is up against the highest quarter of last year at 6.5%. So the compares ease a little bit as we go forward. And if the China growth returns the way we expect it to, it will clearly move us up that range. So we're still comfortable with the 4% to 7% range, and we'll see how it unfolds quarter-by-quarter."

And if I could squeeze in a related follow-up. What would trigger -- on FX, what would trigger a move to the SIMADI rate in Venezuela for you?

The foreign exchange impact on the year is around 10%, more or less. It is more on the bottom line as it was in the first quarter. I think top to bottom was 10% and 14% on the first quarter. So it's about a 10% impact on the year. There are no other factors affecting our guidance other than, and I stress, the translation impact of foreign exchange because as you know well, we seek to cover the transaction impact because that is what leads to operating results."

But if you take Personal Care against the company, Personal Care organic grew around 3% in the first quarter, quite healthy growth. And more competitors means the marketplace is more fragmented, and therefore, you can garner progress because there are simply more players in the space.

The -- if we take pricing overall, and you may have missed the response we gave a little bit earlier, we continue to believe we have pricing power. And therefore, the growth pricing we've been able to take is around 4.5%. And we have reinvested some of that in the trade spending activity to grow market share, which, along with the traditional advertising we have invested, have continued to be productive. We are growing market shares broadly, and we are seeing our gross margin expand. We think in terms of the pricing in Africa/Eurasia and Latin America that, that is sustainable. We're not, again, going to talk about Venezuela specifically other than to say when we got pricing in the fourth quarter of last year, so did many of our competitors. And regardless of what the inflation is in a country, in Venezuela's case, pricing is controlled by the government. So we don't have the flexibility to follow the inflation with self-directed pricing in Venezuela. So Venezuela is all rollover in 2015. I would also say that we have very broad-based pricing increases across all of Latin America. You forgot Hill's, where I think we've got a very good balance between effective pricing and volume growth on that business and beginning to see the gross margin build back nicely, which was clearly one of our objectives. The U.S., North America pricing possibility, that will always be a bit choppy, given the timing of couponing behind new products and the fact that couponing goes into price. And I think there will continue to be pricing pressure in Europe, but our expectation is that it will ease over the balance of the year compared to the first quarter level. Now in Asia, specific to China, we made some corrective pricing actions on a couple of our businesses, which are now baked in for the full year. I think that was responding to all the questions you asked, Ali, at least I hope so."

At the same time, because of the economic decline, several of the categories did go negative in volume terms. So not all the categories were positive from a volume point of view. The other thing one has to say, and I spent 3 days down there not so long ago, is there is quite a bit of short-term disruption in the marketplace. The economy slows down. You have the various scandals unfolding day after day. Interest rates go up. And what happens is the indirect retailers take a step back and wait to see how everything is going to settle out. So there is an added element, I would say, of short-term hesitation in terms of the way the market would normally line up. But as I said earlier, our focus is going to be on growing market share, controlling our costs, expanding gross margin and weathering what we believe will be a slower Brazil environment for the balance of this year."

With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.
We're very pleased with the continued strong organic sales growth in our business across all divisions. In fact, the pace of such growth has accelerated nearly everywhere. Innovation continues to play an important role at our successful array of new products across categories has resulted in strong and growing market shares.
As Ian said in the press release, our robust organic sales growth is particularly notable in the phase of challenging macroeconomic conditions in many markets, however, foreign exchange continue to be an even more significant headwind and that is continuing into the third quarter.
And as you know, we're diligent in taking pricing to offset currency-related transaction cost and are pleased that even with the pricing we have taken, there is still a good balance with volume. Our savings programs are delivering excellent results both our ongoing funding initiatives as well as our Global Growth and Efficiency Program.
Cash generation is solid and our working capital is low, down year-over-year. So we think we're making good progress in 2015 and have good plans in place to keep up the momentum. So let's turn to the divisions, starting with North America.
We're pleased with the solid organic sales growth in North America this quarter, an acceleration from the first quarter 2015 growth, driven by a solid volume increase of 3%. And as mentioned in the press release, U.S. market shares are strong across many categories.
Innovation continues to play a critical role although we also see strength in the base business. For instance, Colgate Total toothpaste continues to maintain a market share of around 10%. In the first quarter, we launched Colgate Total Mouthwash for gum health which allowed us to drive the regimen concept in-store with the claim of 45% stronger, healthier gums versus non-antibacterial mouthwash. The mouthwash is off to a good start. It's the #1 new item at a major U.S. retailer.
In toothbrushes, our newest addition to the Colgate 360° line is Colgate 360° Optic White Platinum. This has been incremental to the line. Colgate 360° has come from a 13% share for full year 2011 to a 19.3% share of the total category year-to-date. And as we said in the press release, our leadership manual toothbrush here is now well over 40% at 41.4%.
We're particularly pleased with the performance of our Tom's Maine business. Sales are growing healthy double digits with its strongest growth in our top 10 retailers. With the expansion of our sharper marketing initiatives, we achieved our first ever panel displays in many customers during our well-executed April Earth month integrated marketing campaign.
Our new Tom's baby line is off to a very encouraging start with wide acceptance across retail channels. The line is receiving positive online consumer reviews and the body lotion and hair body wash products are within it the top SKUs, ranking and selling ahead of many other big and established baby brands.
The fastest-growing segment within fabric conditioner is. We lost Suavitel Fragrance Pro first in Washington boosters in March of this year with a claim of 5x longer lasting fragrance versus detergent alone. Distribution continues to build within major accounts and our year-to-date share in the overall category is at 18.7%, up 70 basis points with our second quarter share at a record 19.5%.
Looking ahead in the third quarter, we'll be launching Colgate Total Daily Repair toothpaste, which helps reverse early damage for better oral health and goes beyond promoting traditional benefits to a new consumer relevant. It's the best-tasting Colgate Total concept ever and as you can imagine, we'll be backed by a full support plan, including TV, PR and social media, professional and multicultural outreach and, of course, in-store shopper activity.
As you know, in the second half of 2014, we launched Colgate Enamel Health toothpaste. In the first quarter of this year, we added Colgate Enamel Health Multi-Protection toothpaste to the enamel footprint. Now in the third quarter, we're adding Colgate Enamel Health mouthwash to provide a complete regimen solution.
This new mouthwash helps replenish natural calcium, reverse enamel softening and helps prevent cavities, all with the great-tasting flavor. And finally, in the kid's segment, we're launching the first-ever regimen portfolio with minions branding across the toothpaste, toothbrush and mouthwash categories.
Turning then to Europe/South Pacific. We're pleased with the acceleration in organic sales growth in this region from the first quarter, continued innovation has contributed to the results. Consequently, our regional year-to-date market share is up in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, Martha Reeves, body wash, liquid hand soap, underarm protection and fabric conditioner.
The regional launch of our premium-priced Colgate Max White One Optic toothpaste has been incremental to our share in the whitening category and is helped to increase overall toothpaste share in France, Italy and Spain. In addition, in France, a strong integrated marketing campaign has helped grow our elements toothpaste business in the mass channel. Growth in our manual toothbrush business has been driven by innovation and excellent in-store execution. The favorable gap between us and our nearest competitor has widened over the last 5 years from just 70 basis points to almost 7 full points on a year-to-date basis.
Across Europe, our manual toothbrush share is up 150 basis points to 24.6% year-to-date. And in Australia, our share is up 170 basis points to 63.3% year-to-date with the most recently at 63.8%.
And we told you last quarter about an exciting new innovation in Personal Care, Sanex Advanced. This is off to a very good start. The line of body washes and underarm deodorant has been incremental to the business and in the last month, our body wash share has met or exceeded our goal in France, Spain and Belgium.
Innovation continues in the second half of 2015. In the toothpaste category, we're just now launching Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair & Prevent toothpaste. This premium priced offering repairs sensitive areas of the teeth and prevent sort of sensitivity for instant and lasting relief. An intensive sharper marketing program will support a complete relaunch of our Colgate 360° manual toothbrushes that provide superior cleaning for a whole mouth clean versus ordinary flat trim toothbrush.
This premium price line, which includes Colgate 360° Expert White and Colgate 360° For Man should help continue the excellent momentum we have seen in this category.
And in our body wash business, will be launching Palmolive Gourmet body washes. The line of creamy body but their washes with a great ingredients, including vanilla, chocolate and peach, which have already been very successful in the Africa/Eurasia division.
Moving onto Latin America. We're pleased with the continued strong organic sales growth in this region. With our largest subsidiary in the region, Mexico and Brazil, delivered solid performance. And of particular note, with Brazil, where organic sales growth accelerated nicely from the first quarter. Market shares for Latin America increased year-to-date in toothpaste, shampoo, liquid cleaners, dishwashing liquid and fabric conditioners. Our regional toothpaste share is at 75.7% year-to-date, up 70 basis points and the highest level in 4 years despite competitive entries during that time period. 
In Brazil, our year-to-date share is up 40 basis points to almost 72% while in Mexico, our year-to-date share increased 70 basis points to 81%.
Our Home Care business in Mexico is extremely strong. This dish liquid share at 52.2% year-to-date, up almost 3 points. Liquid cleaner share at a 33.5% year-to-date, up 80 basis points, and fabric conditioner shares are at 48.6% year-to-date, up almost 2 points.
In the dish category, the launch of Axion Complete exceeded expectations and our very successful thank you Mom campaign behind the Suavitel, our leading fabric conditioner, helped to further strengthen that brand equity.
Our innovation pace will continue in the second half. Colgate Luminous White Advanced toothpaste will be rolled out throughout the region. This is Colgate's most advanced whitening toothpaste available in Latin America. It intensifies the white of your teeth, 3 shades whiter with the unique formula that uses the same ingredient dentist use.
Accompanying the toothpaste will be relaunches of Colgate Luminous White mouthwash and toothbrush. In the Personal Care category, we will be expanding the distribution of Protex Complete 12, a range of bar soap, liquid hand soap and body wash that provides long-lasting antibacterial protection and offers 12x more protection than nonantibacterial bar soap.
And in Home care, we'll be introducing a rinse-free formula to our base Suavitel fabric conditioner business. Currently available only in premium offerings, which should further enhance our strong #1 position.
Moving to Asia. We're pleased with the acceleration of organic sales growth in Asia from the first quarter. In particular, our business in China is performing well and back to solid growth. As we said in the press release, we maintained our strong leadership in toothpaste across the region. In India, our year-to-date share is stable at 54.8% with the most recent read at 55.1%. And in China, we hold the $1 position at almost 34% year-to-date. 
Our toothbrush business in the Philippines is strong and growing and the premium and super premium segments. Our year-to-date share is at a record 57.4%, up 70 basis points with the most recent read at 58.3%.
Our Colgate 360° Charcoal Gold toothbrush, first launched in China, has been successful in this market as well. Our regional share in mouthwash is at a record 23.5% year-to-date, up 60 basis points with particularly strong performance in the Philippines and Hong Kong. And as elsewhere, more new products are planned for the balance of the year.
In China, we will be relaunching our base Colgate anticavity toothpaste in both the widening and all-around anticavity segment. Elsewhere in the region, we're excited about our Colgate Total Charcoal Deep Clean toothpaste gel, which has a unique antibacterial formula that reduces bacteria on a 100% of your mouth surfaces and provides 12-hour protection for a healthier mouth.
In toothbrushes, we were introducing a line extension of our Colgate natural assets toothbrush, which has bristles. In addition, across the region, we're launching Colgate Kids Spiderman and Barbie toothbrushes with .01 millimeters slim tip results.
Africa/Eurasia. As elsewhere, significant currency headwinds affected our financial results in this division. Good organic sales growth of 4% was price driven as we took pricing actions to help offset transaction costs. However, with negative 21.5% foreign exchange across the division, we couldn't recoup all the losses. So it's encouraging our local businesses are doing well and our market shares are generally solid. 
Our regional toothpaste share is up 100 basis points to 32.9% year-to-date with our most recent read at 33%. Notably, our share in Russia increased 2 full points to 33.6% year-to-date with the most recent read at a record high of 34.1%.
Both Colgate Total and Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Sugar Acid Neutralizer toothpaste have performed very well. Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection was launched in early 2015 and already reached almost a full share point nationally and has garnered 1.2 share points in the modern trade. 
In Turkey, our share increased 120 basis points to 26.6% year-to-date. And in South Africa, our share was up 60 basis points to 50.3% year-to-date.
Our toothbrush share is up in 15 in 16 countries, which represent over over 99% of our toothbrush business in the division. In Russia, incremental listings in the country's largest retailer have contributed year-to-date share increase of 240 basis points to 47.2%, with the most recent read at 47.7%.
And in Turkey, our very successful Colgate Slim Soft toothbrush has helped grow our share by 150 basis points to 28.3% year-to-date. Our regional bar soap share is up 290 basis points to 22.6% year-to-date, driven by gains in our 2 top markets, South Africa and Russia.
More innovation is planned to the second half the year. We will be refreshing both our base business sensitive toothpaste as well as launching our premium Colgate Optic White toothpaste with new and more impactful graphics.
In South Africa, where we have a strong Protex business, we will introduce Protex Complete 12 bar soap, with provides 12x more term production and offers long lasting antigerm action. 
And finally, Hill's. We're pleased with Hill's strong organic sales performance in the quarter. The business is on track and innovation is driving both the domestic and international business.
Our unique weight loss product, Prescription Diet Metabolic, canine and feline food is gaining share globally. We recently introduced a product along with and that has accelerated the growth in the wet segment. The product comes in a new global packaging design and has been supported with a global testimonial campaign as well as print and online media.
Adding to this successful innovation in April of this year was Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus mobility canine food and Metabolic Plus Urinary feline food. These new foods, which are nutritionally formulated for concurrent health conditions have been the primary focus of our 2015 conferences.
Another global success in the Prescription Diet line has been the upgrade to the formula for kidney care diet and cat. Cats with renal conditions typically suffer a loss of appetite so it's difficult to get them to eat the food, which will help improve their condition. This product contains our new eat technology enhanced appetite trigger, which improves appetite while helping to both preserve lean muscle mass and increase energy. Feedback from our vets have been exited and we've received excellent testimonials from clients and the veterinary health care teams.
As you expect, we have more innovation plan for the balance of the year. We keep the momentum in our Prescription Diet business in the third quarter. In the U.S., we're getting begin the rollout of Prescription Diet by the sensitive, the first product in the GI segment for food sensitivities, free of what, gluton, lactose, lactose and soy protein. A trial program and pet parent guide help veterinarians and pet parents to see the differences food makes. These are part of the completed INC bundled with trade ads, printed in the as well as in-clinic seminars.
A new product in our Science Diet line is urinary hairball control feline food, the only wellness food that addresses the 2 most common conditions in healthy cats. We launched this month in the U.S. is supported to the PetSmart stores associate feeding program as well as from PetCo's whole pet specialists.
So in summary, we are pleased with the way 2015 is progressing, particularly in light of the macroeconomic challenges that we and others space around the world. We're committed to investing in that business in order to drive solid organic sales growth and global market shares.
We will continue to focus on brand building innovation as well as our worldwide productivity programs. Colgate people around the world are implementing our effective strategies, which we expect will allow us to continue to deliver solid results.
And we look forward to sharing these results as we go through the balance of the year. 
And now, Jessica, that's the end of my prepared remarks. I'd like to turn it over to questions."

But looking to develop the P&L, particularly gross profit, the leakage of cost inflation, which I know includes FX and I suspect is predominantly FX-related remains sizable. How do you wrestle with the balance of getting more price to cover some of that even if it comes of the expense of some near-term market share versus continue to drive the market share? And do you think you're at the right balance right now or should you be leaning little more towards price?"
262247,306718914,842738,"Colgate-Palmolive Co., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2015",2015-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Colgate-Palmolive Company","Executives","Well, thanks for the question, Jason. We didn't rehearse this but it's a perfect lead into some remarks I was wanting to make to put the gross profit in context to tell you exactly your question how we're thinking about that balance over the rest of the y",846,"Well, thanks for the question, Jason. We didn't rehearse this but it's a perfect lead into some remarks I was wanting to make to put the gross profit in context to tell you exactly your question how we're thinking about that balance over the rest of the year. And then probably I'll just go through the gross margin roll forward to save time somebody else asking the question. I think to begin with, it goes without saying that 2015 is a volatile year. And I characterize as we all know the economic challenges in many parts of the world and I think very specifically, as Bina mentioned, a continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which accelerated across the second quarter and in fact, has continued to strengthen with current rates we're seeing into the third. And so as you put it, we are very well pleased with the continued strong, in fact, accelerating organic growth in our business. And we see that over all having a healthy balance between volume and pricing, which is a balanced one tries to maintain. Indeed, as we look across each of our 4 business categories, we see a healthy balance between volume and price. And I would say at this stage, that we are still expecting top line organic growth for the full year to be in the 4% to 7% range. And when you step back from that and say what is making that work, we think it's 3 things. Our innovation is clearly working and it is broad and it is lined up well for the future. We believe, as we have said before, that our commercial programs, which is a combination of traditional advertising and trade spending, are effective. And that together, the strength of our innovation and the effectiveness of those commercial programs are seeing market share is growing quite broadly. So in some, our strategy is delivering strong brand-led growth and double-digit EPS increases on a currency-neutral basis. Now you rightly say, our gross margin in the quarter was pressured more than expected despite the fact that we realized good pricing, that as you will see when I go through the gross margin roll forward, we had good continued delivery of strong funding the growth and restructuring savings. Indeed, we offset year-to-date the dollar impact of the cost increases so far this year. But in the second quarter, specifically, we faced 3 unanticipated negative impacts on our material costs. Obviously, we expected a meaningful impact from foreign exchange transaction costs but we did incur the incremental costs of the faster than forecast foreign exchange deterioration. We saw in several high inflation emerging markets, including Venezuela, an increase in local material costs in the quarter. But finally, well there's no significant factor in the overall gross margin decline, we did see additional material cost increases in Venezuela but due to a slowdown in dollars received at the official rate. Now what to do over the balance of the year? As you would expect, our planned response is if additional pricing. And as I've said on the last call, as we think about pricing, we try and maintain this balance of between volume and price. In some situations, Africa/Eurasia, as Bina mentioned, where the exchange impact is so significant, we take extremely aggressive action and indeed currency volume to get price and stabilize the business. In other parts of the world, we seek to maintain a balance but regardless of approach, additional pricing is planned for the balance of the year. Clearly, we will redouble our focus on funding the growth and we intend to take full advantage of generally weakening commodity materials pricing, which on the last call, we said would really begin to benefit towards the end of the second quarter. So those are our 3 responses. We believe we have planned them in a way that will allow us the maintenance of the top line growth in that 4% to 7% range. And now our thinking for the year will see a sequential improvement in gross margin across the balance of the year. And for the full year, an increase of 10 to 30 basis points. So let me go from that to the gross profit roll forward. So if we take the second quarter, we start with the prior year at 58.8. We pick up a 1 point benefited from pricing. We pick up 2.2 points of favorable from funding the growth and the modest contribution from restructuring. And we take a negative impact of 3.5 points of material prices, which trace back to the unexpected impacts, I just referenced, 20 basis points of other, which gets you to the 58.3 in the quarter, the 50 basis points decline. So that's how we're thinking about it. And as you rightly say, one is trying always to find a good balance between the top line growth and the recovery of the ratio in gross margins. And we think we have that in the plan for the balance of the year. Thanks for the question."

I think the first thing I would say in terms of the breath of information that we provide on Venezuela. We have I think, over time, been providing increasing disclosure in our Qs and Ks, and I think you will find that continues to be the case when you read the Q on this quarter. As you know or may know or you will now go, for the first 6 months of this year, Venezuela represented about 4% of our revenue and 2% of base business operating profit for the 6 months ended in June. And we do provide in the Q the detail of the net monetary assets that we hold of just over $600 million and then on monetary assets that we hold of just under $300 million that could the subject to impairment. We also provide information as to the effect on that if we had to go to the SMRT rate, which would see us with a charge of about $340 million aftertax or $0.37 per diluted share. And that would also likely lead to an impairment of our nonmonetary assets. And we also provide, as we've done for some time, the Colgate's total investment in Venezuela, which is about $1 billion. The reason we continue to manage Venezuela the way we do, first of all, we have for 2014 and into 2015, been receiving dollars and are able to operate our business even though, as you say, that has become a little bit more volatile in the second quarter. Second, each company has its own facts and circumstances. And we still understand that our dividends would be remitted at the rate and therefore, that's why we translate the business at that. And, of course, we move to the SICAD away from the official rate so it is a little bit more conservative. But as you rightly indicate, Venezuela is a period-to-period assessment. You will see in our Q that our conclusion of the end of the second quarter is that we will maintain the translation rate we have and that we will continue to consolidate that business. And we will, specific to our fact and circumstances, as we always do, to continue to revisit that quarter upon quarter."

As you rightly say or suggest, and we have seen and without about it on the last call, we have seen many competitors in several significant markets around the world, substantially pulled back on traditional advertising and therefore, we can accomplish our strategic objectives and not lose competitive presence on the ground. And as we've tried to express before, a lot of what you can do at the retail level today is far more sophisticated and strategic than may be 10 years ago. And we make no apology for choosing to construct our marketing programs with good, reliance on both. We talk about integrated marketing communications and we talk about reaching consumers at all touch points, which, of course, yes, include traditional television and digital but also includes the retail, dental, professional, veterinary professional environments that shape their purchasing decisions. I would not project seeing our advertising levels decline meaningfully. In fact, as we think about this year, we expect to be upon a local currency basis and probably at about the same level as last year on a ratio basis. But it will obviously, again, as we go forward, look at what it takes to build the engagement with our consumers to keep growing market share and therefore our brands and therefore the top line of the company."

To be clear, I'm not saying that our share of voice is necessarily higher by market. I'm saying that is you use of that is the measure of consumer engagement, which is the question of all hypothesis event, which gives to a number, we have remained competitive. And back to the comment we made earlier, our objective is to make sure we have a brand awareness of our base business and build trial for new businesses. And we believe the spend levels we have do that. If you at the category rates of growth, I would argue that growing categories is a lot more complicated than simply media pressure. Obviously, in our advertising, we do the educational work but sometimes, perhaps, we don't talk about it and our people don't focus on it enough. But how you go-to-market, the depth of distribution you build, decisive and pricing you have in your portfolio in the the price points you have in your portfolio amplified by price, both at the low end and the high end, creates access points for people to come into and stay in a category. And we put an awful lot of pressure and effort making sure we can stop talk because of our portfolio the right way in order to keep the category penetration up and keep the growth rates of the categories at healthy levels. And all of that you see in the portfolio choices we make him a the size and pricing choices we make, the distribution gains we get right down to the furthest rural areas. And that is very much a driver on sustaining the category growth. Now it's a very big discussion, Ali, and I'm not trying to trivialize it. I'm just trying to suggest that there are more factors that come to bear then just advertising. And then to come to your second . And some of you have already started to indicate these. So let me try and respond to the question and be clear. Ask we said in our release, current spot rates, we continue to expect a low-single digit earnings per share decline on a dollar basis, excluding, of course, the restructuring and the other charges we highlighted in the release. Now to be clear, low single-digit earnings decline range, dollar earnings decline range is minus 1% to minus 3%. And as much we have seen continued significant deterioration in foreign exchange rates over the course of the second quarter and since we last spoke, we would expect to be at the more negative end of that range, which would still reflect a double-digit increase on a currency-neutral basis."

I guess, they've been often discussed by several folk in China. Certainly, we see them in Latin America. And your best way of responding and the way we try to respond is to understand the consumer and make sure that the innovation we are providing is competitive against the benefit or the product offering, the local competitor is providing. And then secondly, when you mentioned go-to-market, it is often the case with the local competitor that they have a particular infrastructure that can build down distribution and a lot of activity again at retail level and you just need to be effective in making sure that your products are available at any rate to that competitor and that you have the same degree of activity at retail level to compete with them. Now China is an interesting example where our market share over the last several years has gone up from 29 to 34. One of that principal competitors has come down from 25 to under 14, and another has come down from 12 to high single-digit and the local competitor has really taken the difference. So without making one example predicted for the world come I think it demonstrates we have managed to defend and continued to grow our business quite well. But it comes down to product offering and the strength of your goal to market particularly downstream and particularly activity at retail."

The appearance of the Blue Buffalo in the pet superstores is not a new thing. They have been for a long while and our presence in those stores and our activities in those stores has not been affected. So we saw a very good growth. And as we have tried to say several times on the calls, one of the big differences we were strafing for was stream of innovation on Hill's so that it was not episodic at that we have a flow of innovation, both on the business and the Prescription Diet business and we think we have that. I mean, who couldn't love innovation that has enhanced appetite trigger built into it. I bet the pets go for that. So it's, driven by innovation. Now where blue Buffalo will be new is in the more therapeutic side of the business. They have announced 2 entries in only 2 segments, 1 is gastrointestinal. You will remember from Bina's remarks that we're going to market with a very compelling gastrointestinal product right now, with the Prescription Diet line. So I come back to the innovation. It's -- we think it's strong and we think it will see as well with our very elevated share with the vets, which as you rightly say, continued to grow in the second quarter. So I think we're well positioned with both, Javier."

We've always had this situation. I try to say earlier in response to a question. In some cases, Russia would be a classic example where a emerges, you take a very aggressive pricing and accept the fallout of the volume just to stay stabilize the business. In other cases, you simply can't take pricing quickly enough and intelligently manage the balance between volume, price and therefore, the top line growth in response to transaction, which hits you the minute the exchange slides. So our pricing benefit from that will be progressive over the balance of the year. And you're correct, we'll continue into 2016. So as we look at the balance of the year, yes, it is -- to do with the Global Growth and Efficiency Program. And, as I said, advertising will be broadly in line with last year. You may recall the last time we spoke from a ratio point of view, you may recall the last time we spoke, we talked about it being up. So heavily lead by global growth and efficiency.

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our second quarter 2015 earnings release conference call.
With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.
We're very pleased with the continued strong organic sales growth in our business across all divisions. In fact, the pace of such growth has accelerated nearly everywhere. Innovation continues to play an important role, and our successful array of new products across categories has resulted in strong and growing market shares.
As Ian said in the press release, our robust organic sales growth is particularly notable in the phase of challenging macroeconomic conditions in many markets, however, foreign exchange continue to be an even more significant headwind and that is continuing into the third quarter.
And as you know, we're diligent in taking pricing to offset currency-related transaction costs and are pleased that even with the pricing we have taken, there is still a good balance with volume. Our savings programs are delivering excellent results, both our ongoing funding-the-growth initiatives as well as our Global Growth and Efficiency Program.
Cash generation is solid and our working capital is low, down year-over-year. So we think we're making good progress in 2015 and have good plans in place to keep up the momentum. So let's turn to the divisions, starting with North America.
We're pleased with the solid organic sales growth in North America this quarter, an acceleration from the first quarter 2015 growth, driven by a solid volume increase of 3%. And as mentioned in the press release, U.S. market shares are strong across many categories.
Innovation continues to play a critical role, although we also see strength in the base business. For instance, Colgate Total toothpaste continues to maintain a market share of around 10%. In the first quarter, we launched Colgate Total Mouthwash for gum health, which allowed us to drive the regimen concept in-store with a claim of 45% stronger, healthier gums versus nonantibacterial mouthwash. The mouthwash is off to a great start. It's the #1 new item at a major U.S. retailer.
In toothbrushes, our newest addition to the Colgate 360° line is Colgate 360° Optic White Platinum. This has been incremental to the line. Colgate 360° has come from a 13% share for full year 2011 to a 19.3% share of the total category year-to-date. And as we said in the press release, our leadership manual toothbrush share is now well over 40% at 41.4%.
We're particularly pleased with the performance of our Tom's of Maine business. Sales are growing healthy double digits with its strongest growth in our top 10 retailers. With the expansion of our sharper marketing initiatives, we achieved our first ever displays in many customers during our well-executed April Earth month integrated marketing campaign.
Our new Tom's baby line is off to a very encouraging start with wide acceptance across retail channels. The line is receiving positive online consumer reviews and the body lotion and hair body wash products are within the top SKUs, ranking and selling ahead of many other big and established baby brands.
The fastest-growing segment within fabric conditioners is scent boosters. We launched Suavitel Fragrance Pearls in wash scent boosters in March of this year with a claim of 5x longer lasting fragrance versus detergent alone. Distribution continues to build within major accounts and our year-to-date share in the overall category is at 18.7%, up 70 basis points with our second quarter share at a record 19.5%.
Looking ahead in the third quarter, we'll be launching Colgate Total Daily Repair toothpaste, which helps reverse early damage for better oral health and goes beyond promoting traditional benefits to a new consumer relevant space. It's the best-tasting Colgate Total concept ever and as you can imagine, will be backed by a full support plan, including TV, PR and social media, professional and multicultural outreach and, of course, in-store shopper activity.
As you know, in the second half of 2014, we launched Colgate Enamel Health toothpaste. In the first quarter of this year, we added Colgate Enamel Health Multi-Protection toothpaste to the enamel footprint. Now in the third quarter, we're adding Colgate Enamel Health Mouthwash to provide a complete regimen solution.
This new mouthwash helps replenish natural calcium, reverses enamel softening and helps prevent cavities, all with a great-tasting flavor. And finally, in the kid's segment, we're launching the first-ever regimen portfolio with Minions branding across the toothpaste, toothbrush and mouthwash categories.
Turning then to Europe/South Pacific. We're pleased with the acceleration in organic sales growth in this region from the first quarter, continued innovation has contributed to the results. Consequently, our regional year-to-date market share are up in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouth rinse, body wash, liquid hand soap, underarm protection and fabric conditioner.
The regional launch of our premium-priced Colgate Max White One Optic toothpaste has been incremental to our share in the whitening category and has helped to increase overall toothpaste share in France, Italy and Spain. In addition, in France, a strong integrated marketing campaign has helped grow our elmex Sensitive toothpaste business in the mass channel. Growth in our manual toothbrush business has been driven by innovation and excellent in-store execution. The favorable gap between us and our nearest competitor has widened over the last 5 years from just 70 basis points to almost 7 full points on a year-to-date basis.
Across Europe, our manual toothbrush share is up 150 basis points to 24.6% year-to-date. And in Australia, our share is up 170 basis points to 63.3% year-to-date with the most recent read at 63.8%.
And we told you last quarter about an exciting new innovation in Personal Care, Sanex ADVANCED. This is off to a very good start. The line of body washes and underarm deodorants has been incremental to the business and in the last month, our body wash share has met or exceeded our goal in France, Spain and Belgium.
Innovation continues in the second half of 2015. In the toothpaste category, we're just now launching Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair & Prevent toothpaste. This premium priced offering repairs sensitive areas of the teeth and prevents further sensitivity for instant and lasting relief. An extensive shopper marketing program will support a complete relaunch of our Colgate 360° manual toothbrushes, which provides superior cleaning for a whole mouth clean versus an ordinary flat trim toothbrush.
This premium price line, which includes Colgate 360° Expert White and Colgate 360° For Men should help continue the excellent momentum we've seen in this category.
And in our body wash business, we'll be launching Palmolive Gourmet body washes, a line of creamy body butter washes with fragrant ingredients, including vanilla, chocolate and peach, which have already been very successful in the Africa/Eurasia division.
Moving onto Latin America. We're pleased with the continued strong organic sales growth in this region. 2 of our largest subsidiaries in the region, Mexico and Brazil, delivered solid performance. And of particular note, with Brazil, where organic sales growth accelerated nicely from the first quarter. Market shares for Latin America increased year-to-date in toothpaste, shampoo, liquid cleaners, dishwashing liquid and fabric conditioners. Our regional toothpaste share is at 75.7% year-to-date, up 70 basis points, the highest level in 4 years despite competitive entries during that time period. 
In Brazil, our year-to-date share is up 40 basis points to almost 72%. While in Mexico, our year-to-date share increased 70 basis points to 81%.
Our Home Care business in Mexico is extremely strong. Dish liquid shares are at 52.2% year-to-date, up almost 3 points; liquid cleaner share are at 33.5% year-to-date, up 80 basis points; and fabric conditioner shares are at 48.6% year-to-date, up almost 2 points.
In the dish category, the launch of Axion Complete exceeded expectations and our very successful thank you mom campaign behind the Suavitel, our leading fabric conditioner, helped to further strengthen that brand equity.
Our innovation pace will continue in the second half. Colgate Luminous White Advanced toothpaste will be rolled out throughout the region. This is Colgate's most advanced whitening toothpaste available in Latin America. It intensifies the white of your teeth 3 shades whiter with a unique formula that uses the same ingredient dentists use.
Accompanying the toothpaste will be relaunches of Colgate Luminous White mouthwash and toothbrush. In the Personal Care category, we will be expanding the distribution of Protex Complete 12, a range of bar soap, liquid hand soap and body wash that provides long-lasting antibacterial protection and offers 12x more protection than nonantibacterial bar soap.
And in Home Care, we'll be introducing a rinse-free formula to our base Suavitel fabric conditioner business, currently available only in premium offerings, which should further enhance our strong #1 position.
Moving to Asia. We're pleased with the acceleration of organic sales growth in Asia from the first quarter. In particular, our business in China is performing well and back to solid growth. As we said in the press release, we maintain our strong leadership in toothpaste across the region. In India, our year-to-date share is stable at 54.8% with the most recent read at 55.1%. And in China, we hold the #1 position at almost 34% year-to-date. 
Our toothbrush business in the Philippines is strong and growing in the premium and super premium segments. Our year-to-date share is at a record 57.4%, up 70 basis points with the most recent read at 58.3%.     
Our Colgate 360° Charcoal Gold toothbrush, first launched in China, has been successful in this market as well. Our regional share in mouthwash is at a record 23.5% year-to-date, up 60 basis points with particularly strong performance in the Philippines and Hong Kong. And as elsewhere, more new products are planned for the balance of the year.
In China, we will be relaunching our base Colgate anticavity toothpaste in both the whitening and all-around anticavity segment. Elsewhere in the region, we're excited about our Colgate Total Charcoal Deep Clean toothpaste gel, which has a unique antibacterial formula that reduces bacteria on 100% of your mouth's surfaces and provides 12-hour protection for a healthier mouth.
In toothbrushes, we're introducing a line extension of our Colgate natural essences toothbrush, which has lotus-infused bristles. In addition, across the region, we're launching Colgate Kids Spiderman and Barbie toothbrushes with .01 millimeter slim tip bristles.
Africa/Eurasia. As elsewhere, significant currency headwinds affected our financial results in this division. Good organic sales growth of 4% was price driven as we took pricing actions to help offset transaction costs. However, with negative 21.5% foreign exchange across the division, we couldn't recoup all the losses. So it's encouraging that our local businesses are doing well and our market shares are generally solid. 
Our regional toothpaste share is up 100 basis points to 32.9% year-to-date with our most recent read at 33%. Notably, our share in Russia increased 2 full points to 33.6% year-to-date with the most recent read at a record high, 34.1%.
Both Colgate Total and Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Sugar Acid Neutralizer toothpaste have performed very well. Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection was launched in early 2015 and has already reached almost a full share point nationally and has garnered 1.2 share points in the modern trade. 
In Turkey, our share increased 120 basis points to 26.6% year-to-date. And in South Africa, our share was up 60 basis points to 50.3% year-to-date.
Our toothbrush share is up in 15 and 16 countries, which represent over 99% of our toothbrush business in the division. In Russia, incremental listings in the country's largest retailer have contributed to year-to-date share increase of 240 basis points to 47.2%, with the most recent read at 47.7%.
And in Turkey, our very successful Colgate Slim Soft toothbrush has helped grow our share by 150 basis points to 28.3% year-to-date. Our regional bar soap share is up 290 basis points to 22.6% year-to-date, driven by gains in our 2 top markets, South Africa and Russia.
More innovation is planned for the second half of the year. We will be refreshing both our base business sensitive toothpaste as well as launching our premium Colgate Optic White toothpaste with new and more impactful graphics.
In South Africa, where we have a strong Protex business, we will introduce Protex Complete 12 bar soap, which provides 12x more germ protection and offers long lasting antigerm action. 
And finally, Hill's. We're pleased with Hill's strong organic sales performance in the quarter. The business is on track and innovation is driving both the domestic and international business.
Our unique weight loss product, Prescription Diet Metabolic, canine and feline food is gaining share globally. We recently introduced a stew product along with the dry and that has accelerated growth in the wet segment. The product comes in a new global packaging design and has been supported with a global testimonial campaign as well as print and online media.
Adding to this successful innovation in April of this year was Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus Mobility canine food and Metabolic Plus Urinary feline food. These new foods, which are nutritionally formulated for concurrent health conditions have been the primary focus of our 2015 pet conferences.
Another global success in the Prescription Diet line has been the upgrade of our KD formula for kidney care diet in cat. Cats with renal conditions typically suffer a loss of appetite so it's difficult to get them to eat the food, which will help improve their condition. This product contains our new eat technology enhanced appetite trigger, which improves appetite while helping to both preserve lean muscle mass and increase energy. Feedback from vets have been excellent and we've received excellent testimonials from clients and the veterinary health care teams.
As you expect, we have more innovation planned for the balance of the year. Keep the momentum in our Prescription Diet business in the third quarter, in the U.S., we're beginning the rollout of Prescription Diet i/d Sensitive, the first product in the GI segment for food sensitivities, free of wheat, gluten, lactose, lactose and soy protein. A trial program and pet parent guide help veterinarians and pet parents to see the differences food makes. These are part of a complete IMC bundled with trade ads, printed in detailers as well as in-clinic seminars.
A new product in our Science Diet line is urinary hairball control feline food, the only wellness food that addresses the 2 most common conditions in healthy cats. The launch this month in the U.S. is supported to the PetSmart stores associate feeding program as well as from PETCO's whole pet specialists.
So in summary, we are pleased with the way 2015 is progressing, particularly in light of the macroeconomic challenges that we and others face around the world. We're committed to investing in that business in order to drive solid organic sales growth and global market shares.

And certainly, as ran through the market share performance, it's indeed impressive. But looking through the belly of the P&L, particularly at gross profit, the leakage of cost inflation, which I know includes FX and I suspect is predominantly FX-related, remains sizable. How do you wrestle with the balance of getting more price to cover some of that even if it comes to the expense of some near-term market share versus continue to drive the market share? And do you think you're at the right balance right now or should you be leaning a little more towards price?"

We didn't rehearse this but it's a perfect lead into some remarks I was wanting to make to put the gross profit in context and tell you to exactly your question how we're thinking about that balance over the rest of the year. And then probably I'll just go through the gross margin roll forward to save time somebody else asking the question. I think to begin with, it goes without saying that 2015 is a volatile year and characterized, as we all know, by economic challenges in many parts of the world and I think very specifically, as Bina mentioned, a continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which accelerated across the second quarter and in fact, has continued to strengthen with current rates we're seeing into the third. And so as you put it, we are very well pleased with the continued strong, in fact, accelerating organic growth in our business. And we see that overall having a healthy balance between volume and pricing, which is a balance one tries to maintain. Indeed, as we look across each of our 4 business categories, we see a healthy balance between volume and price. And I would say at this stage, that we are still expecting top line organic growth for the full year to be in the 4% to 7% range. And when you step back from that and say what is making that work, we think it's 3 things. Our innovation is clearly working and it is broad and it is lined up well for the future. We believe, as we have said before, that our commercial programs, which is a combination of traditional advertising and trade spending, are effective. And that together, the strength of our innovation and the effectiveness of those commercial programs are seeing market shares growing quite broadly. So in sum, our strategy is delivering strong brand-led growth and double-digit EPS increases on a currency-neutral basis. Now as you rightly say, our gross margin in the quarter was pressured more than expected despite the fact that we realized good pricing, that as you will see when I go through the gross margin roll forward, we had good continued delivery of strong funding-the-growth and restructuring savings. Indeed, we offset year-to-date the dollar impact of the cost increases so far this year. But in the second quarter, specifically, we faced 3 unanticipated negative impacts on our material costs. Obviously, we expected a meaningful impact from foreign exchange transaction costs but we did incur the incremental costs of the faster than forecast foreign exchange deterioration. We saw in several high inflation emerging markets, including Venezuela, an increase in local material costs in the quarter. Finally, while not a significant factor in the overall gross margin decline, we did see additional material cost increases in Venezuela but due to a slowdown in dollars received at the official rate. Now what to do over the balance of the year? As you would expect, our planned response is additional pricing. And as I said on the last call, as we think about pricing, we try and maintain this balance between volume and price. In some situations, Africa/Eurasia, as Bina mentioned, where the exchange impact is so significant, we take extremely aggressive action and indeed concede volume to get price and stabilize the business. In other parts of the world, we seek to maintain a balance but regardless of approach, additional pricing is planned for the balance of the year. Clearly, we will redouble our focus on funding the growth and we intend to take full advantage of generally weakening commodity materials pricing, which on the last call, we said would really begin to benefit towards the end of the second quarter. So those are our 3 responses. We believe we have planned them in a way that will allow us the maintenance of the top line growth in that 4% to 7% range. And now our thinking for the year will see a sequential improvement in gross margin across the balance of the year. And for the full year, an increase of 10 to 30 basis points. So let me go from that to the gross profit roll forward. So if we take the second quarter, we start with the prior year at 58.8%. We pick up a 1 point benefit from pricing. We pick up 2.2 points of favorable from funding the growth and the modest contribution from restructuring. And we take a negative impact of 3.5 points of material prices, which trace back to the unexpected impacts I just referenced, 20 basis points of other, which gets you to the 58.3% in the quarter, the 50 basis points decline. So that's how we're thinking about it. And as you rightly say, one is trying always to find a good balance between the top line growth and the recovery of the ratio in gross margins. And we think we have that in the plan for the balance of the year. Thanks for the question."

So I know there are legal and accounting guidelines that dictate the appropriate treatment of Venezuela but I'm wondering how much discretion there is on those matters because at some level, it just feels like kind of taking the hit, so to speak, and moving on would provide some benefit, especially if your access to dollars is decelerating, as you mentioned in response to Jason's question."

I think the first thing I would say in terms of the breadth of information that we provide on Venezuela, we have, I think, over time, been providing increasing disclosure in our Qs and Ks, and I think you will find that continues to be the case when you read the Q on this quarter. As you know or may know or you will now know, for the first 6 months of this year, Venezuela represented about 4% of our revenue and 2% of base business operating profit for the 6 months ended in June. And we do provide in the Q the detail of the net monetary assets that we hold of just over $600 million and then nonmonetary assets that we hold of just under $300 million that could be subject to impairment. We also provide information as to the effect on that if we had to go to the SIMADI rate, which would see us with a charge of about $340 million aftertax or $0.37 per diluted share. And that would also likely lead to an impairment of our nonmonetary assets. And we also provide, as we have done for some time, Colgate's investment in Venezuela, which is about $1 billion. Now the reason we continue to manage Venezuela the way we do, first of all, we have for 2014 and into 2015, been receiving dollars and are able to operate our business even though, as you say, that has become a little bit more volatile in the second quarter. Second, each company has its own facts and circumstances. And we still understand that our dividends would be remitted at the SICAD rate and therefore, that's why we translate the business at that. And of course, we move to the SICAD away from the official rate so it is a little bit more conservative. But as you rightly indicate, Venezuela is a period-to-period assessment. You will see in our Q that our conclusion at the end of the second quarter is that we will maintain the translation rate we have and that we will continue to consolidate that business. And we will, specific to our facts and circumstances, as we always do, to continue to revisit that quarter upon quarter."

As you rightly say or suggest, and we have seen and we talked about it on the last call, we have seen many competitors in several significant markets around the world, substantially pull back on traditional advertising and therefore, we can accomplish our strategic objectives and not lose competitive presence on the ground. And as we've tried to express before, a lot of what you can do at the retail level today is far more sophisticated and strategic than maybe 10 years ago. And we make no apology for choosing to construct our marketing programs with good reliance on both. We talk about integrated marketing communications and we talk about reaching consumers at all touch points, which, of course, yes, include traditional television and digital but also includes the retail, dental professional, veterinary professional environments that shape their purchasing decisions. I would not project seeing our advertising levels decline meaningfully. In fact, as we think about this year, we expect to be up on a local currency basis and probably at about the same level as last year on a ratio basis. But we'll obviously, again, as we go forward, look at what it takes to build the engagement with our consumers to keep growing market share and therefore our brands and therefore the top line of the company."

To be clear, I'm not saying that our share of voice is necessarily higher by market.

Obviously, in our advertising, we do the educational work but sometimes, perhaps, we don't talk about it enough or people don't focus on it enough. But how you go to market, the depth of distribution you build, the sizing pricing you have in your portfolio, indeed, the price points you have in your portfolio amplified by price, both at the low end and the high end, creates access points for people to come into and stay in a category. And we put an awful lot of pressure and effort making sure we can strut our portfolio the right way in order to keep the category penetration up and keep the growth rates of the categories at healthy levels. And all of that you see in the portfolio choices we make, the sizing pricing choices we make, the distribution gains we get right down to the furthest rural areas. And that is very much a driver on sustaining our category growth. Now it's a very big discussion, Ali, and I'm not trying to trivialize it. I'm just trying to suggest there are more factors that come to bear than just advertising. And then to come to your second point, and some of you have already started to indicate this. So let me try and respond to the question and be clear. As we said in our release, at current spot rates, we continue to expect a low-single digit earnings per share decline on a dollar basis, excluding, of course, the restructuring and the other charges we highlighted in the release. Now to be clear, low single-digit earnings decline range, dollar earnings decline range is minus 1% to minus 3%. And in as much as we have seen continued significant deterioration in foreign exchange rates over the course of the second quarter and since we last spoke, we would expect to be at the more negative end of that range, which would still reflect a double-digit increase on a currency-neutral basis."

Now China is an interesting example where our market share over the last several years has gone up from 29% to 34%. One of that principal competitors has come down from 25% to under 14%, and another has come down from 12% to high single-digit and the local competitor has really taken the difference.

I mean who couldn't love innovation that has enhanced appetite trigger built into it. I bet the pets go for that. So it's driven by innovation. Now where Blue Buffalo will be new is in the more therapeutic side of the business. They have announced 2 entries in only 2 segments, 1 is derm, 1 is gastrointestinal. You will remember from Bina's remarks that we are going to market with a very compelling gastrointestinal product right now with the Prescription Diet line. So I come back to the innovation.

In other cases, you simply can't take pricing quickly enough and intelligently manage the balance between volume, price and therefore, the top line growth in response to transaction, which hits you the minute the exchange slides. So our pricing benefit from that will be progressive over the balance of the year. And you're correct, will continue into 2016. So as we look at the balance of the year, yes, it is to do with the Global Growth and Efficiency Program. And as I said, advertising will be broadly in line with last year. You may recall the last time we spoke from a ratio point of view, you may recall the last time we spoke, we talked about it being up. So heavily led by global growth and efficiency.

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our second quarter 2015 earnings release conference call.
With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.
We're very pleased with the continued strong organic sales growth in our business across all divisions. In fact, the pace of such growth has accelerated nearly everywhere. Innovation continues to play an important role, and our successful array of new products across categories has resulted in strong and growing market shares.
As Ian said in the press release, our robust organic sales growth is particularly notable in the phase of challenging macroeconomic conditions in many markets, however, foreign exchange continue to be an even more significant headwind and that is continuing into the third quarter.
And as you know, we're diligent in taking pricing to offset currency-related transaction costs and are pleased that even with the pricing we have taken, there is still a good balance with volume. Our savings programs are delivering excellent results, both our ongoing funding-the-growth initiatives as well as our Global Growth and Efficiency Program.
Cash generation is solid and our working capital is low, down year-over-year. So we think we're making good progress in 2015 and have good plans in place to keep up the momentum. So let's turn to the divisions, starting with North America.
We're pleased with the solid organic sales growth in North America this quarter, an acceleration from the first quarter 2015 growth, driven by a solid volume increase of 3%. And as mentioned in the press release, U.S. market shares are strong across many categories.
Innovation continues to play a critical role, although we also see strength in the base business. For instance, Colgate Total toothpaste continues to maintain a market share of around 10%. In the first quarter, we launched Colgate Total Mouthwash for gum health, which allowed us to drive the regimen concept in-store with a claim of 45% stronger, healthier gums versus nonantibacterial mouthwash. The mouthwash is off to a great start. It's the #1 new item at a major U.S. retailer.
In toothbrushes, our newest addition to the Colgate 360° line is Colgate 360° Optic White Platinum. This has been incremental to the line. Colgate 360° has come from a 13% share for full year 2011 to a 19.3% share of the total category year-to-date. And as we said in the press release, our leadership manual toothbrush share is now well over 40% at 41.4%.
We're particularly pleased with the performance of our Tom's of Maine business. Sales are growing healthy double digits with its strongest growth in our top 10 retailers. With the expansion of our sharper marketing initiatives, we achieved our first ever end-aisle displays in many customers during our well-executed April Earth month integrated marketing campaign.
Our new Tom's baby line is off to a very encouraging start with wide acceptance across retail channels. The line is receiving positive online consumer reviews and the body lotion and hair body wash products are within the top SKUs, ranking and selling ahead of many other big and established baby brands.
The fastest-growing segment within fabric conditioners is scent boosters. We launched Suavitel Fragrance Pearls in wash scent boosters in March of this year with a claim of 5x longer lasting fragrance versus detergent alone. Distribution continues to build within major accounts and our year-to-date share in the overall category is at 18.7%, up 70 basis points with our second quarter share at a record 19.5%.
Looking ahead in the third quarter, we'll be launching Colgate Total Daily Repair toothpaste, which helps reverse early damage for better oral health and goes beyond promoting traditional benefits to a new consumer relevant space. It's the best-tasting Colgate Total concept ever and as you can imagine, will be backed by a full support plan, including TV, PR and social media, professional and multicultural outreach and, of course, in-store shopper activity.
As you know, in the second half of 2014, we launched Colgate Enamel Health toothpaste. In the first quarter of this year, we added Colgate Enamel Health Multi-Protection toothpaste to the enamel footprint. Now in the third quarter, we're adding Colgate Enamel Health Mouthwash to provide a complete regimen solution.
This new mouthwash helps replenish natural calcium, reverses enamel softening and helps prevent cavities, all with a great-tasting flavor. And finally, in the kid's segment, we're launching the first-ever regimen portfolio with Minions branding across the toothpaste, toothbrush and mouthwash categories.
Turning then to Europe/South Pacific. We're pleased with the acceleration in organic sales growth in this region from the first quarter, continued innovation has contributed to the results. Consequently, our regional year-to-date market share are up in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouth rinse, body wash, liquid hand soap, underarm protection and fabric conditioner.
The regional launch of our premium-priced Colgate Max White One Optic toothpaste has been incremental to our share in the whitening category and has helped to increase overall toothpaste share in France, Italy and Spain. In addition, in France, a strong integrated marketing campaign has helped grow our elmex Sensitive toothpaste business in the mass channel. Growth in our manual toothbrush business has been driven by innovation and excellent in-store execution. The favorable gap between us and our nearest competitor has widened over the last 5 years from just 70 basis points to almost 7 full points on a year-to-date basis.
Across Europe, our manual toothbrush share is up 150 basis points to 24.6% year-to-date. And in Australia, our share is up 170 basis points to 63.3% year-to-date with the most recent read at 63.8%.
And we told you last quarter about an exciting new innovation in Personal Care, Sanex ADVANCED. This is off to a very good start. The line of body washes and underarm deodorants has been incremental to the business and in the last month, our body wash share has met or exceeded our goal in France, Spain and Belgium.
Innovation continues in the second half of 2015. In the toothpaste category, we're just now launching Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair & Prevent toothpaste. This premium priced offering repairs sensitive areas of the teeth and prevents further sensitivity for instant and lasting relief. An extensive shopper marketing program will support a complete relaunch of our Colgate 360° manual toothbrushes, which provides superior cleaning for a whole mouth clean versus an ordinary flat trim toothbrush.
This premium price line, which includes Colgate 360° Expert White and Colgate 360° For Men should help continue the excellent momentum we've seen in this category.
And in our body wash business, we'll be launching Palmolive Gourmet body washes, a line of creamy body butter washes with fragrant ingredients, including vanilla, chocolate and peach, which have already been very successful in the Africa/Eurasia division.
Moving onto Latin America. We're pleased with the continued strong organic sales growth in this region. 2 of our largest subsidiaries in the region, Mexico and Brazil, delivered solid performance. And of particular note, with Brazil, where organic sales growth accelerated nicely from the first quarter. Market shares for Latin America increased year-to-date in toothpaste, shampoo, liquid cleaners, dishwashing liquid and fabric conditioners. Our regional toothpaste share is at 75.7% year-to-date, up 70 basis points, the highest level in 4 years despite competitive entries during that time period. 
In Brazil, our year-to-date share is up 40 basis points to almost 72%. While in Mexico, our year-to-date share increased 70 basis points to 81%.
Our Home Care business in Mexico is extremely strong. Dish liquid shares are at 52.2% year-to-date, up almost 3 points; liquid cleaner share are at 33.5% year-to-date, up 80 basis points; and fabric conditioner shares are at 48.6% year-to-date, up almost 2 points.
In the dish category, the launch of Axion Complete exceeded expectations and our very successful thank you mom campaign behind the Suavitel, our leading fabric conditioner, helped to further strengthen that brand equity.
Our innovation pace will continue in the second half. Colgate Luminous White Advanced toothpaste will be rolled out throughout the region. This is Colgate's most advanced whitening toothpaste available in Latin America. It intensifies the white of your teeth 3 shades whiter with a unique formula that uses the same ingredient dentists use.
Accompanying the toothpaste will be relaunches of Colgate Luminous White mouthwash and toothbrush. In the Personal Care category, we will be expanding the distribution of Protex Complete 12, a range of bar soap, liquid hand soap and body wash that provides long-lasting antibacterial protection and offers 12x more protection than nonantibacterial bar soap.
And in Home Care, we'll be introducing a rinse-free formula to our base Suavitel fabric conditioner business, currently available only in premium offerings, which should further enhance our strong #1 position.
Moving to Asia. We're pleased with the acceleration of organic sales growth in Asia from the first quarter. In particular, our business in China is performing well and back to solid growth. As we said in the press release, we maintain our strong leadership in toothpaste across the region. In India, our year-to-date share is stable at 54.8% with the most recent read at 55.1%. And in China, we hold the #1 position at almost 34% year-to-date. 
Our toothbrush business in the Philippines is strong and growing in the premium and super premium segments. Our year-to-date share is at a record 57.4%, up 70 basis points with the most recent read at 58.3%.     
Our Colgate 360° Charcoal Gold toothbrush, first launched in China, has been successful in this market as well. Our regional share in mouthwash is at a record 23.5% year-to-date, up 60 basis points with particularly strong performance in the Philippines and Hong Kong. And as elsewhere, more new products are planned for the balance of the year.
In China, we will be relaunching our base Colgate anticavity toothpaste in both the whitening and all-around anticavity segment. Elsewhere in the region, we're excited about our Colgate Total Charcoal Deep Clean toothpaste gel, which has a unique antibacterial formula that reduces bacteria on 100% of your mouth's surfaces and provides 12-hour protection for a healthier mouth.
In toothbrushes, we're introducing a line extension of our Colgate natural essences toothbrush, which has lotus-infused bristles. In addition, across the region, we're launching Colgate Kids Spiderman and Barbie toothbrushes with .01 millimeter slim tip bristles.
Africa/Eurasia. As elsewhere, significant currency headwinds affected our financial results in this division. Good organic sales growth of 4% was price driven as we took pricing actions to help offset transaction costs. However, with negative 21.5% foreign exchange across the division, we couldn't recoup all the losses. So it's encouraging that our local businesses are doing well and our market shares are generally solid. 
Our regional toothpaste share is up 100 basis points to 32.9% year-to-date with our most recent read at 33%. Notably, our share in Russia increased 2 full points to 33.6% year-to-date with the most recent read at a record high, 34.1%.
Both Colgate Total and Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Sugar Acid Neutralizer toothpaste have performed very well. Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection was launched in early 2015 and has already reached almost a full share point nationally and has garnered 1.2 share points in the modern trade. 
In Turkey, our share increased 120 basis points to 26.6% year-to-date. And in South Africa, our share was up 60 basis points to 50.3% year-to-date.
Our toothbrush share is up in 15 and 16 countries, which represent over 99% of our toothbrush business in the division. In Russia, incremental listings in the country's largest retailer have contributed to year-to-date share increase of 240 basis points to 47.2%, with the most recent read at 47.7%.
And in Turkey, our very successful Colgate Slim Soft toothbrush has helped grow our share by 150 basis points to 28.3% year-to-date. Our regional bar soap share is up 290 basis points to 22.6% year-to-date, driven by gains in our 2 top markets, South Africa and Russia.
More innovation is planned for the second half of the year. We will be refreshing both our base business sensitive toothpaste as well as launching our premium Colgate Optic White toothpaste with new and more impactful graphics.
In South Africa, where we have a strong Protex business, we will introduce Protex Complete 12 bar soap, which provides 12x more germ protection and offers long lasting antigerm action. 
And finally, Hill's. We're pleased with Hill's strong organic sales performance in the quarter. The business is on track and innovation is driving both the domestic and international business.
Our unique weight loss product, Prescription Diet Metabolic, canine and feline food is gaining share globally. We recently introduced a stew product along with the dry and that has accelerated growth in the wet segment. The product comes in a new global packaging design and has been supported with a global testimonial campaign as well as print and online media.
Adding to this successful innovation in April of this year was Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus Mobility canine food and Metabolic Plus Urinary feline food. These new foods, which are nutritionally formulated for concurrent health conditions have been the primary focus of our 2015 pet conferences.
Another global success in the Prescription Diet line has been the upgrade of our KD formula for kidney care diet in cat. Cats with renal conditions typically suffer a loss of appetite so it's difficult to get them to eat the food, which will help improve their condition. This product contains our new eat technology enhanced appetite trigger, which improves appetite while helping to both preserve lean muscle mass and increase energy. Feedback from vets have been excellent and we've received excellent testimonials from clients and the veterinary health care teams.
As you expect, we have more innovation planned for the balance of the year. Keep the momentum in our Prescription Diet business in the third quarter, in the U.S., we're beginning the rollout of Prescription Diet i/d Sensitive, the first product in the GI segment for food sensitivities, free of wheat, gluten, lactose -- lactose and soy protein. A trial program and pet parent guide help veterinarians and pet parents to see the differences food makes. These are part of a complete IMC bundled with trade ads, printed in detailers as well as in-clinic seminars.
A new product in our Science Diet line is urinary hairball control feline food, the only wellness food that addresses the 2 most common conditions in healthy cats. The launch this month in the U.S. is supported to the PetSmart stores associate feeding program as well as from PETCO's whole pet specialists.
So in summary, we are pleased with the way 2015 is progressing, particularly in light of the macroeconomic challenges that we and others face around the world. We're committed to investing in that business in order to drive solid organic sales growth and global market shares.
We will continue to focus on brand building innovation as well as our worldwide productivity programs. Colgate people around the world are implementing our effective strategies, which we expect will allow us to continue to deliver solid results.
And we look forward to sharing these results as we go through the balance of the year. 
And now Jessica, that's the end of my prepared remarks. I'd like to turn it over to questions."

And certainly, as you ran through the market share performance, it's indeed impressive. But looking through the belly of the P&L, particularly at gross profit, the leakage of cost inflation, which I know includes FX and I suspect is predominantly FX-related, remains sizable. How do you wrestle with the balance of getting more price to cover some of that even if it comes to the expense of some near-term market share versus continuing to drive the market share? And do you think you're at the right balance right now or should you be leaning a little more towards price?"
262247,306718914,843540,"Colgate-Palmolive Co., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2015",2015-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Colgate-Palmolive Company","Executives","Well, thanks for the question, Jason. We didn't rehearse this but it's a perfect lead into some remarks I was wanting to make to put the gross profit in context and tell you to exactly your question how we're thinking about that balance over the rest of t",840,"Well, thanks for the question, Jason. We didn't rehearse this but it's a perfect lead into some remarks I was wanting to make to put the gross profit in context and tell you to exactly your question how we're thinking about that balance over the rest of the year. And then probably I'll just go through the gross margin roll forward to save time somebody else asking the question. I think to begin with, it goes without saying that 2015 is a volatile year and characterized, as we all know, by economic challenges in many parts of the world and I think very specifically, as Bina mentioned, a continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which accelerated across the second quarter and in fact, has continued to strengthen with current rates we're seeing into the third. And so as you put it, we are very well pleased with the continued strong, in fact, accelerating organic growth in our business. And we see that overall having a healthy balance between volume and pricing, which is a balance one tries to maintain. Indeed, as we look across each of our 4 business categories, we see a healthy balance between volume and price. And I would say at this stage, that we are still expecting top line organic growth for the full year to be in the 4% to 7% range. And when you step back from that and say what is making that work, we think it's 3 things. Our innovation is clearly working and it is broad and it is lined up well for the future. We believe, as we have said before, that our commercial programs, which is a combination of traditional advertising and trade spending, are effective. And that together, the strength of our innovation and the effectiveness of those commercial programs are seeing market shares growing quite broadly. So in sum, our strategy is delivering strong brand-led growth and double-digit EPS increases on a currency-neutral basis. Now as you rightly say, our gross margin in the quarter was pressured more than expected despite the fact that we realized good pricing, that as you will see when I go through the gross margin roll forward, we had good continued delivery of strong funding-the-growth and restructuring savings. Indeed, we offset year-to-date the dollar impact of the cost increases so far this year. But in the second quarter, specifically, we faced 3 unanticipated negative impacts on our material costs. Obviously, we expected a meaningful impact from foreign exchange transaction costs but we did incur the incremental costs of the faster than forecast foreign exchange deterioration. We saw in several high inflation emerging markets, including Venezuela, an increase in local material costs in the quarter. Finally, while not a significant factor in the overall gross margin decline, we did see additional material cost increases in Venezuela but due to a slowdown in dollars received at the official rate. Now what to do over the balance of the year? As you would expect, our planned response is additional pricing. And as I said on the last call, as we think about pricing, we try and maintain this balance between volume and price. In some situations, Africa/Eurasia, as Bina mentioned, where the exchange impact is so significant, we take extremely aggressive action and indeed concede volume to get price and stabilize the business. In other parts of the world, we seek to maintain a balance but regardless of approach, additional pricing is planned for the balance of the year. Clearly, we will redouble our focus on funding the growth and we intend to take full advantage of generally weakening commodity materials pricing, which on the last call, we said would really begin to benefit towards the end of the second quarter. So those are our 3 responses. We believe we have planned them in a way that will allow us the maintenance of the top line growth in that 4% to 7% range. And now our thinking for the year will see a sequential improvement in gross margin across the balance of the year. And for the full year, an increase of 10 to 30 basis points. So let me go from that to the gross profit roll forward. So if we take the second quarter, we start with the prior year at 58.8%. We pick up a 1 point benefit from pricing. We pick up 2.2 points of favorable from funding the growth and the modest contribution from restructuring. And we take a negative impact of 3.5 points of material prices, which trace back to the unexpected impacts I just referenced, 20 basis points of other, which gets you to the 58.3% in the quarter, the 50 basis points decline. So that's how we're thinking about it. And as you rightly say, one is trying always to find a good balance between the top line growth and the recovery of the ratio in gross margins. And we think we have that in the plan for the balance of the year. Thanks for the question."

Just clearly, it's a topic that comes up every time you visit with us in one form or another. You obviously continue to account for C-P Venezuela at the SICAD rate. Many others have either shifted to SIMADI or else chosen to deconsolidate as we saw from P&G this morning. So I know there are legal and accounting guidelines that dictate the appropriate treatment of Venezuela but I'm wondering how much discretion there is on those matters because at some level, it just feels like kind of taking the hit, so to speak, and moving on would provide some benefit, especially if your access to dollars is decelerating, as you mentioned in response to Jason's question."

I think the first thing I would say in terms of the breadth of information that we provide on Venezuela, we have, I think, over time, been providing increasing disclosure in our Qs and Ks, and I think you will find that continues to be the case when you read the Q on this quarter. As you know or may know or you will now know, for the first 6 months of this year, Venezuela represented about 4% of our revenue and 2% of base business operating profit for the 6 months ended in June. And we do provide in the Q the detail of the net monetary assets that we hold of just over $600 million and then nonmonetary assets that we hold of just under $300 million that could be subject to impairment. We also provide information as to the effect on that if we had to go to the SIMADI rate, which would see us with a charge of about $340 million aftertax or $0.37 per diluted share. And that would also likely lead to an impairment of our nonmonetary assets. And we also provide, as we have done for some time, Colgate's total [ph] investment in Venezuela, which is about $1 billion. Now the reason we continue to manage Venezuela the way we do, first of all, we have for 2014 and into 2015, been receiving dollars and are able to operate our business even though, as you say, that has become a little bit more volatile in the second quarter. Second, each company has its own facts and circumstances. And we still understand that our dividends would be remitted at the SICAD rate and therefore, that's why we translate the business at that. And of course, we move to the SICAD away from the official rate so it is a little bit more conservative. But as you rightly indicate, Venezuela is a period-to-period assessment. You will see in our Q that our conclusion at the end of the second quarter is that we will maintain the translation rate we have and that we will continue to consolidate that business. And we will, specific to our facts and circumstances, as we always do, to continue to revisit that quarter upon quarter."

As you rightly say or suggest, and we have seen and we talked about it on the last call, we have seen many competitors in several significant markets around the world, substantially pull back on traditional advertising and therefore, we can accomplish our strategic objectives and not lose competitive presence on the ground. And as we've tried to express before, a lot of what you can do at the retail level today is far more sophisticated and strategic than maybe 10 years ago. And we make no apology for choosing to construct our marketing programs with good reliance on both. We talk about integrated marketing communications and we talk about reaching consumers at all touch points, which, of course, yes, include traditional television and digital but also includes the retail, dental professional, veterinary professional environments that shape their purchasing decisions. I would not project seeing our advertising levels decline meaningfully. In fact, as we think about this year, we expect to be up on a local currency basis and probably at about the same level as last year on a ratio basis. But we'll obviously, again, as we go forward, look at what it takes to build the engagement with our consumers to keep growing market share and therefore our brands and therefore the top line of the company."

But you did see flat volume in Latin America understanding on the pricing mix that you got or the price part you got, Africa/Eurasia was down 3, which is some of the worse we've seen. And I get the share of voice comment. Our share of voice isn't lower, it's actually higher and that's where we're gaining share. As we've seen, your brethren are feeling quite some pain as well. But what happens to the category? So what's that category responsibility? I mean maybe share of voice isn't the right metric because the category itself should be, could be growing a little bit faster going forward. So I wanted to get your thoughts on that a little bit. And I know it's only one question, but just a clarification on the gross margin that you described earlier on, if you would, please. So the gross margin guidance is down from like 80 basis points at the high end, but you're still at this kind of negative low single-digits EPS growth number. I'm trying to get a better understanding what the offsets are to stay in that low-single digits or is it just kind of worse low-single digits when you describe it for the year?"

To be clear, I'm not saying that our share of voice is necessarily higher by market. I'm saying that if you use that as the measure of consumer engagement, which is a question of all hypothesis even though it gives you a number, we have remained competitive. And back to the comment we made earlier, our objective is to make sure we have a brand awareness of our base business and build trial for new businesses. And we believe the spend levels we have do that. If you look at the category rates of growth, I would argue that growing categories is a lot more complicated than simply media pressure. Obviously, in our advertising, we do the educational work but sometimes, perhaps, we don't talk about it enough or people don't focus on it enough. But how you go to market, the depth of distribution you build, the sizing pricing you have in your portfolio, indeed, the price points you have in your portfolio amplified by price, both at the low end and the high end, creates access points for people to come into and stay in a category. And we put an awful lot of pressure and effort making sure we can strut our portfolio the right way in order to keep the category penetration up and keep the growth rates of the categories at healthy levels. And all of that you see in the portfolio choices we make, the sizing pricing choices we make, the distribution gains we get right down to the furthest rural areas. And that is very much a driver on sustaining our category growth. Now it's a very big discussion, Ali, and I'm not trying to trivialize it. I'm just trying to suggest there are more factors that come to bear than just advertising. And then to come to your second point, and some of you have already started to indicate this. So let me try and respond to the question and be clear. As we said in our release, at current spot rates, we continue to expect a low-single digit earnings per share decline on a dollar basis, excluding, of course, the restructuring and the other charges we highlighted in the release. Now to be clear, low single-digit earnings decline range, dollar earnings decline range is minus 1% to minus 3%. And in as much as we have seen continued significant deterioration in foreign exchange rates over the course of the second quarter and since we last spoke, we would expect to be at the more negative end of that range, which would still reflect a double-digit increase on a currency-neutral basis."

Now China is an interesting example where our market share over the last several years has gone up from 29% to 34%. One of that principal competitors has come down from 25% to under 14%, and another has come down from 12% to high single-digit and the local competitor has really taken the difference.

I mean who couldn't love innovation that has enhanced appetite trigger built into it. I bet the pets go for that. So it's driven by innovation.

With me this morning are Ian Cook, President, Chairman and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.
We're pleased with the continued solid organic sales growth, of course, negative foreign exchange continue to be a major challenge but as you'll hear, our market share as our strong and growing, one the best indications of the health of the business. Happily, gross profit margin increased in the quarter, as a result of our funding-the-growth initiatives, pricing actions and our Global Growth and Efficiency Program. Worldwide, our overhead cost are down on a dollar basis.
Now while reported advertising was down on a dollar basis, we think we're getting good results from the dollars we spend both in-store and out. Digital advertising is growing in fact, as an example, in Latin America, we are increasing our investment in digital to better reach our younger audiences as well as to drive engagement. And as we focus on developing strategic collaboration for partners such as Google and Facebook, we're better able to measure the results of our investments. Marketing mix model studies from several countries across Latin America show an ROI for digital investments that is 3 to 4x higher than TV, confirming this shift is right to drive our business.
Our balance sheet remains solid and we're making very good progress on working capital. So let's get right into the divisions, starting with the North America.
Innovation continues to fuel our success in North America. As mentioned in the press release, our market share are up year-to-date into toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, liquid hand soap, body wash and fabric conditioners. And this was true on a quarter-over-quarter comparison as well. At the same time, we've seen a decline in private label shares in many of our categories, indicating the consumers preference for branded products and the strength of our equities.
In the toothpaste category, the launch of Colgate Total Daily Repair supported by engaging media campaign and strong in-store shopper material has added incremental share to the baseline products. In the whitening segment, we offer a full range of products, toothpaste, toothbrushes and mouthwash. Our Colgate Optic White toothpaste has grown share from 2.4% in the third quarter of 2011 to a 5.7% share in the most recent quarter. 
Colgate Enamel Health has also seen good growth, increasing a full share point quarter-over-quarter. Another exciting opportunity is the sensitivity segment, where we are a strong #2 player. That segment has seen a compound growth of 7.7% over the last 4 years versus 2.8% for toothpaste overall. 
In the mouthwash category, where our share is up year-to-date 20 basis points, both Colgate Total for Gum Health and Colgate Enamel Health Mouthwash are picking up momentum. Our Colgate Total for Gum Health variant is the #1 new item in the leading retailer and receiving full support in store. 
In liquid hand soap, our year-to-date share is up almost a full point to a leading 30.6%, while private label products have declined almost 2 full points year-to-date, the lowest level in at least 5 years. 
Premium offerings such as Softsoap Fragrant Foaming Collection and hand soap offer distinctive benefits. Similarly, Softsoap fresh and body wash with real extract with the unique formula giving you healthy looking skin that glows, earlier this year has increased our share in that category by almost a full point year-to-date. 
Fabric conditioner has also continued to perform well. Suavitel Fragrance Pearls in wash scent boosters, which provide 5x longer lasting fragrance versus detergent alone, which we told you about last quarter have helped increase our national share almost a full point year-to-date, now approaching 20% of the market. 
More trial-focused programs are expected to drive further growth in the fourth quarter. Now as you'd expect, our new product is well populated and we will share with you some more exciting innovations slated for early 2016 on future calls. 
Turning now to Europe/South Pacific. Our business there is showing encouraging signs of recovery with innovation playing a critical role. Our market shares are up year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, body wash, shower gel, underarm protection and fabric conditioners. 
In toothpaste, we're very excited about the early successes of our loans of Colgate Max White Expert White toothpaste, the latest premium offering in this fast-growing segment. Launched in the U.K. in June, it achieved a 2.7% share in August and was named the best new toiletries launched for 2015 by one of our larger drug retailers. 
Two products under the Elmex brand developed specifically for the pharmacy channel, Elmex Sensitive Professional and Elmex Antiquaries Professional have driven our pharmacy share in France to a leadership position of 26.3% year-to-date and now ahead of the nearest competitor by 150 basis points. 
In manual toothbrushes, our leading market share in Europe is up 130 basis points year-to-date to 24.6%, with our nearest competitor down to 17.4%. Driving these excellent results has been the relaunch across the region of our Colgate 360° manual toothbrush line. Priced at the super premium tier, these brushes deliver superior cleaning for a whole mouth clean and have been supported by a full shopper program. 
We're also very encouraged by our launch of Sanex Advanced range of body washes, underarm protection and body and hand lotion. This innovation brings dermatological expertise for skin specific needs to a third growth pillar for Sanex, leading the brand towards a more professional approach in [indiscernible]. Early results are excellent. Since launch, Sanex is the fastest-growing brand in both body washes and underarms and in our top markets of France, Spain and the U.K., our market shares are up in both categories. 
In fabric conditioners, our market shares are up 20 basis points year-to-date to 24% across the European region with the most recent read at 24.5%. Contributing to this success is Soupline Fruity Sensations with a striking look and feel and new different and long-lasting fragrances. More innovation is found across our categories for the rest of this year and into 2016. Specifically, in Oral Care, we will be launching the Colgate Expert White Toothpaste and built-in Whitening Pen. As you know, that product form has helped drive our manual toothbrush share to record high tier in the U.S. 
In toothpaste, we will be launching Colgate Total Proof. This innovation uses breakthrough color change technology that turns the white paste into blue foam while brushing, giving consumers the confidence of the ultimate clean feeling. 
Turning then to Latin America. Business across the region is solid and [indiscernible] innovation has driven market share increases. Our regional market shares are up year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, toilet soap, liquids soap, hand dish and liquid cleaners. And even in the phase of some economic uncertainties in countries such as Brazil, our category still show solid local currency growth. 
Our regional toothpaste share is up 2 full points year-to-date to 78.2%. In Brazil, our market share is up 50 basis points year-to-date to 72%, the highest share in over 20 years and in the phase of continued heightened competitive activity. Colgate Total 12 relaunched in August with the positioning of protects 100% of the surfaces of the mouth. Now has an 18.5% share in the most recent period. 
In Mexico, our share is up 1 point year-to-date to 81.3% with the most recent read at 81.6%, while our major competitor shows continued share decline. 
Contributing to this success is our premium priced Colgate Luminos White Advanced, Colgate's most advanced whitening toothpaste formulated to intensify the whiteness of your teeth by 3 shades. 
In manual toothbrushes, our market share is up 230 basis points year-to-date to 45.4% with the most recent read at 49.8%. In Mexico, we recently reintroduced our Colgate 360° line with the new packaging structure with premium finishing and improved benefit communication, all mouth clean with 151% more bad breath bacteria removal. As a result, the Colgate 360° Equity is up 110 basis points year-to-date, reaching a record 11.1% share. 
Our leading year-to-date bar soap share is at 30.8% with the most recent read at 32%. Record high shares were achieved in Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala. And our 2 equities, Protex and Palmolive, continue to hold the #1 and 2 positions across the region. 
In Mexico, where we have a strong Home Care business, our results are excellent across the 3 subcategories, hand dish, liquid cleaners and fabric conditioners. Our market shares are up on a year-to-date basis, 230 feet, 40 and 150 basis points, respectively to 52.6%, 33.5% and 48.4%. 
So looking ahead, to further boost our leading manual toothbrush share, we are now in the process of launching Colgate Slim Soft White with 17 times slimmer tips, spiral drizzles will provide both whitening and deep yet, gentle cleaning. And innovation launching now in fabric conditioners is Suavitel goodbye rinse, the market-leading Suavitel with an improve no-rinse formula. And as you would expect, more innovation is planned for 2016 to continue the momentum in this region. 
Turning then to Asia. We're pleased with the strength of the business particularly in our 2 largest markets, China and India, which both delivered good volume growth. Category growth rates remain mid-single-digit in China while in India, our categories are growing as well. 
In India, our year-to-date toothpaste share is at almost 55% on a national basis and close to 59% in rural markets. Our market-leading manual toothbrush share is 43.6% year-to-date and our launch of Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Enamel Repair toothpaste while in its early days is doing well. 
Our Colgate 360° Charcoal Gold toothbrush launched earlier in other Asian markets is now contributing to the results in India. This successful innovation with antibacterial bristles provides a whole mouth clean and has achieved strong shares across the region in the most recent period, 1.4% in Hong Kong, 2.5% in the Philippines, 1.3% in Taiwan and almost 2% in Malaysia and has an incremental in each market. 
More innovation is slated for this quarter and beyond. In China, we will be launching 2 new products developed to appeal to local consumer preferences.

And for women, Protex Intimate, with antibacterial protection for long long-lasting freshness and well-being sensation everyday. 
Africa/Eurasia. As you know, several of our larger markets in Africa/Eurasia region had been facing major currency headwinds.

And in answering it, as you did, let's take a little bit broader perspective and then come back to your specific question. So the world we're dealing in today in terms of our categories, so I'm talking Colgate businesses now and the categories in which we do business, North America economic scene, we have a world where our categories are growing between 0% and 2% in the developed world, in Europe, the low end of that and in the U.S. at the upper end of that 0% to 2% growth. In the emerging markets, through this call, the growth rates in our categories continue to be mid-single digits generally. And our objective, business objective in that arena has been to have a sustainable rates of growth organically in that 4% to 7% range that we mentioned at the beginning of the year, which we think we continue into the third quarter. And we continue to talk about 4% to 7% for the year. And indeed, as we think about 2016, we begin our budgeting process with the same ambition next year and the way that you get that consistent rate of growth is by building your brands. And you build your brands as measured in market share. And as we choose investment vehicles to build those brands, you're focusing on trial and repeat purchase of our new innovation and our existing businesses. And don't forget in many of these emerging markets, consumer behavior is challenged by local category conditions in those markets and in-store engagement can be more persuasive than what we're educated as being proper advertising investment. So we balance and like to think we invest smartly in traditional media, the traditional television, magazine, radio, sampling devices that would be in that, that advertising number, with an increasing shift as being pointed  out to digital, digital being most lower cost than the battery of return and frankly, Latin America with millennials are now the predominant parent generation, a better way of engaging with that Colgate group. And then as you indicated, the in-store work that we do that in this volatile times can be particularly powerful. Now all of that said, as we think about going forward, we begin our process for the budget in 2016 even though we haven't yet fully began that process if we look at the array of innovation we have over the next 3 years, starting in 2016. I think it would be safe to say that our expectation that our traditional advertising ratios would be up in 2016."

So no, obviously, you don't find yourself in a place where all of your engagement with consumer happens at the retail level. But with the data available to us today, with the techniques available to us today, with some of the in-store engagement materials available to us to today, which are brand and benefit and therapy Colgate, specific, including sometimes the coloring of the shelves, the house, Oral Care part of that retail, that is wonderful environment to get consumers to make that final decision, particularly if they are in a stressed, highly devalued geography. You still have the advertising and we can debate traditional versus the style that is making the awareness connection and seeking to provoke the trial but you miss everything if you don't get a gauge with that consumer when they come to that store to make sure that trial is your product. So yes, it is not a balance. So it is not a journey to everything at retail.

But no, I would not take the notion that forever going forward, our traditional media to sales percentage, the 1 you do see will be lower and stay lower.

We're pleased with the continued solid organic sales growth. Of course, negative foreign exchange continues to be a major challenge. But as you'll hear, our market shares are strong and growing, one the best indications of the health of a business. Happily, gross profit margin increased in the quarter as a result of our funding-the-growth initiatives, pricing actions and our Global Growth and Efficiency Program. Worldwide, our overhead costs are down on a dollar basis.
Now while reported advertising was down on a dollar basis, we think we're getting good results from the dollars we spend both in-store and out. Digital advertising is growing. In fact, as an example, in Latin America, we are increasing our investment in digital to better reach our younger audiences as well as to drive engagement.
And as we focus on developing strategic collaboration with partners such as Google and Facebook, we're better able to measure the results of our investments. Marketing mix model studies from several countries across Latin America show an ROI for digital investments that is 3 to 4x higher than TV, confirming this shift is right to drive our business.
Our balance sheet remains solid and we're making very good progress on working capital. So let's get right into the divisions, starting with the North America.
Innovation continues to fuel our success in North America. As mentioned in the press release, our market shares are up year-to-date into toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, liquid hand soap, body wash and fabric conditioners. And this was true on a quarter-over-quarter comparison as well. At the same time, we've seen a decline in private label shares in many of our categories, indicating the consumers' preference for branded products and the strength of our equities.
In the toothpaste category, the launch of Colgate Total Daily Repair, supported by an engaging media campaign and strong in-store shopper material, has added incremental share to the baseline products. In the whitening segment, we offer a full range of products, toothpaste, toothbrushes and mouthwash. Our Colgate Optic White toothpaste has grown share from 2.4% in the third quarter of 2011 to a 5.7% share in the most recent quarter.
Colgate Enamel Health has also seen good growth to mention, [ph] increasing a full share point quarter-over-quarter. Another exciting opportunity is the sensitivity segment, where we are a strong #2 player. That segment has seen a compound growth of 7.7% over the last 4 years versus 2.8% for toothpaste overall.
In the mouthwash category, where our share is up year-to-date 20 basis points, both Colgate Total for Gum Health and Colgate Enamel Health Mouthwash are picking up momentum. Our Colgate Total for Gum Health variant is the #1 new item in the leading retailer and receiving full support in store.
In liquid hand soaps, our year-to-date share is up almost a full point to a leading 30.6%, while private label products have declined almost 2 full points year-to-date, the lowest level in at least 5 years. Premium offerings such as Softsoap Fragrant Foaming Collection and Décor Collection foaming hand soaps offer distinctive benefits. Similarly, Softsoap Fresh & Glow body wash with real extracts with a unique formula, giving you healthy looking skin that glows, launched earlier this year, has increased our share in that category by almost a full point year-to-date.
Fabric conditioner has also continued to perform well. Suavitel Fragrance Pearls in-wash scent boosters, which provide 5x longer lasting fragrance versus detergent alone, which we told you about last quarter, have helped increase our national share almost a full point year-to-date, now approaching 20% of the market.
More trial-focused programs are expected to drive further growth in the fourth quarter. Now as you'd expect, our new product grid is well populated, and we will share with you some more exciting innovations slated for early 2016 on future calls.
Turning then to Europe/South Pacific. Our business there is showing encouraging signs of recovery, with innovation playing a critical role. Our market shares are up year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, body wash, shower gel, underarm protection and fabric conditioners.
In toothpaste, we're very excited about the early successes of our launch of Colgate Max White Expert White toothpaste, the latest premium offering in this fast-growing segment. Launched in the U.K. in June, it achieved a 2.7% share in August and was named the best new toiletries launched for 2015 by one of our larger drug retailers. 
Two products under the elmex brand developed specifically for the pharmacy channel, elmex SENSITIVE PROFESSIONAL and elmex ANTI-CARIES PROFESSIONAL, have driven our pharmacy share in France to a leadership position of 26.3% year-to-date and now ahead of the nearest competitor by 150 basis points.
In manual toothbrushes, our leading market share in Europe is up 130 basis points year-to-date to 24.6%, with our nearest competitor down to 17.4%. Driving these excellent results has been the relaunch across the region of our Colgate 360° manual toothbrush line. Priced at the super premium tier, these brushes deliver superior cleaning for a whole mouth clean and have been supported by a full shopper program.
We're also very encouraged by our launch of Sanex ADVANCED range of body washes, underarm protection and body and hand lotion. This innovation brings dermatological expertise for skin-specific needs to a third growth pillar for Sanex, leading the brand towards a more professional approach in mass. [ph] Early results are excellent. Since launch, Sanex is the fastest-growing brand in both body washes and underarm. And in our top markets of France, Spain and the U.K., our market shares are up in both categories.
In fabric conditioners, our market shares are up 20 basis points year-to-date to 24% across the European region with the most recent read at 24.5%. Contributing to this success is Soupline Fruity Sensations with a striking look and feel and new different and long-lasting fragrances. More innovation is found across our categories for the rest of this year and into 2016. Specifically, in Oral Care, we will be launching the Colgate Optic White Toothbrush + Built-In Whitening Pen. Now as you know, that product form has helped drive our manual toothbrush share to record high tier in the U.S.
In toothpaste, we will be launching Colgate Total Proof. This innovation uses breakthrough color change technology that turns the white paste into a blue foam while brushing, giving consumers the confidence of the ultimate clean feeling.
Turning then to Latin America. Business across the region is solid and as elsewhere, innovation has driven market share increases. Our regional market shares are up year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, toilet soap, liquids soap, shampoo, hand dish and liquid cleaners. And even in the phase of some economic uncertainties in countries such as Brazil, our category still show solid local currency growth.
Our regional toothpaste share is up 2 full points year-to-date to 78.2%. In Brazil, our market share is up 50 basis points year-to-date to 72%, the highest share in over 20 years and in the phase of continued heightened competitive activity. Colgate Total 12 relaunched in August with a positioning of protects 100% of the surfaces of the mouth, now has an 18.5% share in the most recent period. 
In Mexico, our share is up 1 point year-to-date to 81.3%, with the most recent read at 81.6%, while our major competitor shows continued share decline. Contributing to this success is our premium-priced Colgate Luminous White Advanced, Colgate's most advanced whitening toothpaste formulated to intensify the whiteness of your teeth by 3 shades.
In manual toothbrushes, our market share is up 230 basis points year-to-date to 45.4%, with the most recent read at 49.8%. In Mexico, we recently reintroduced our Colgate 360° line with a new packaging structure with premium finishing and improved benefit communication, whole mouth clean with 151% more bad breath bacteria removal. As a result, the Colgate 360° equity is up 110 basis points year-to-date, reaching a record 11.1% share.
Our leading year-to-date bar soap share is at 30.8%, with the most recent read at 32%. Record high shares were achieved in Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala. And our 2 equities, Protex and Palmolive, continue to hold the #1 and 2 positions across the region.
In Mexico, where we have a strong Home Care business, our results are excellent across the 3 subcategories: Hand dish, liquid cleaners and fabric conditioners. Our market shares are up on a year-to-date basis, 230, 40 and 150 basis points, respectively, to 52.6%, 33.5% and 48.4%.
So looking ahead, to further boost our leading manual toothbrush share, we are now in the process of launching Colgate Slim Soft White with 17x slimmer tip spiral bristles, which provide both whitening and deep yet gentle cleaning. An innovation launching now in fabric conditioners is Suavitel GoodBye Rinse, the market-leading Suavitel with an improved no-rinse formula. And as you would expect, more innovation is planned for 2016 to continue the momentum in this region.
Turning then to Asia. We're pleased with the strength of the business, particularly in our 2 largest markets, China and India, which both delivered good volume growth. Category growth rates remain mid-single digit in China, while in India, our categories are growing as well.
In India, our year-to-date toothpaste share is at almost 55% on a national basis and close to 59% in rural markets. Our market-leading manual toothbrush share is 43.6% year-to-date, and our launch of Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Enamel Repair toothpaste, while in its early days, is doing well. 
Our Colgate 360° Charcoal Gold toothbrush, launched earlier in other Asian markets, is now contributing to the results in India. This successful innovation with antibacterial bristles provides a whole mouth clean and has achieved strong shares across the region in the most recent period, 1.4% in Hong Kong, 2.5% in the Philippines, 1.3% in Taiwan and almost 2% in Malaysia and has an incremental in each market. More innovation is slated for this quarter and beyond.
In China, we will be launching 2 new products developed to appeal to local consumer preferences: Colgate Power White Lemon Salt toothpaste for freshness and whitening experience with a lemon and sea salt flavor; and Colgate 360° Gold Ginseng Gum Care toothpaste, which contains ginseng essence and enhances the gum's power of defense.
Two popular Colgate Total variants, Charcoal Deep Clean and Pro Gum, will now be available in a gel format in addition to the paste. And in Thailand, in the Personal Care category, we're launching products for both men and women: For men, Protex Men 3-in-1, an all-in-one body cleansing solution with antibacterial protection; and for women, Protex Intimate, with antibacterial protection for long-lasting freshness and well-being sensation every day.
Africa/Eurasia. As you know, several of our larger markets in Africa/Eurasia region had been facing major currency headwinds. Despite the pricing actions we have taken to combat the currency headwinds, our organic sales growth is holding at mid-single digits, market shares are increasing and successful innovation is fueling our growth.
Our regional toothpaste share is up a full point year-to-date to almost 33%. In Russia, our share is up 230 basis points year-to-date to 34.2%, hitting a record share of 35.1% in the most recent period.
We recently launched Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with Sugar Acid Neutralizer, which has already reached a 0.7% share year-to-date and contributed to the share gains. In South Africa, our share grew 150 basis points year-to-date to 50.2%, driven by new marketing campaigns behind Colgate Total.
In toothbrushes, our share declined in only 1 country and was up in the majority of our markets. In Russia, where we achieved incremental listings in Russia's #1 retailer, our toothpaste -- toothbrush share grew 270 basis points year-to-date to 48.1%, with the most recent read at 49.4%. And in Turkey, our share grew 10 basis points year-to-date to 28.6%, with the most recent read at 29.7%. And in South Africa, our share was up 30 basis points year-to-date to 38.2%, with the most recent read at 38.6%.
Our bar soap business continued with strong momentum in our 2 biggest markets, Russia and South Africa. The recent introduction of Protex Men Power contributed to a regional share gain of 150 basis points year-to-date to almost 24%. More innovation is slated for this quarter.
Across the region, we will be relaunching our base Colgate Sensitive toothpaste and our line of Plax Mouthwash. In the Personal Care category, we will be launching a body wash occupying the new energizing segment for men's body wash, Palmolive Men Citrus Crush. It invites the consumer to experience an intense invigorating shower with bergamot and grapefruit ingredients sourced from the purest substances of nature and a sparkling citrus fragrance to spoil the senses.
And Hill's. Hill's delivered another solid quarter of organic sales growth, with a good balance of volume and price. Here in the U.S., superstore retail consumption showed a good increase. Innovation across Hill's Prescription Diet and Hill's Science Diet as well as volume growth in our ideal balance brand contributed to our good results.
Our Prescription Diet Metabolic canine and feline foods continued to gain share around the world. Our new stews form has accelerated our growth in the wet segment. We continue to receive endorsement from key thought leaders. And the global rollout this year of Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus breakthrough dual-efficacy food with nutrition and clinically proven to address obesity and concurrent conditions has added to the momentum of the business.
It's now selling in 38 countries and has benefited from extensive sampling to drive awareness and trial. Our ongoing global integrated marketing campaign includes professional print, online media, in-clinic seminars and recommendation tools and testimonial videos to showcase efficacy. 
In our wellness business, one of our newer launches, Hill's Science Diet Urinary and Hairball Control, is meeting with excellent results. The only wellness food that addresses the 2 most common conditions in healthy cats, it was among the top 3 wet variants in the U.S. market during the first 3 months after its launched and has a very high star rating on Amazon.com. It's been the product focus for our nutritional consultants at PetSmart and PETCO and has received good in-store activation feedback. Building on our success in the U.S., it has just been launched in Europe. 
And as we look into 2016, there's more exciting innovation news, which we will discuss with you on future calls.
So in summary, we're pleased with the continued solid organic sales growth and market share gains around the world. Our innovation pipeline is as full as ever and our savings programs are on track.
Colgate people around the world continue to focus on our 4 strategic initiatives, delivering consistent results. So we look forward to sharing our results with you as we finish the year.
And now Kelly, I should like to turn it over for questions."

I think last quarter, you had indicated local currency advertising will be roughly flat year-over-year as a percent of sales in 2015. Is that still the case? How are you thinking about that line item? And then the real question on that front is, it's now been 6 quarters in a row where AMT has been down substantially as a percentage of sales. I know you've indicated before it's been funneled back into promotion, which has been effective given the market share performance. But the level of pullback in AMT is really striking relative to your traditional -- the way you've run the business. So I guess, what gives you confidence this won't come back to bite you in the long run in terms of lower demand going forward, particularly given the macro situation out there right now?"

As you might imagine, not an unexpected question. And in answering it, as you did, let's take a little bit broader perspective and then come back to your specific question. So the world we're dealing in today in terms of our cat",446,"Yes, thanks. Thanks, Dara. As you might imagine, not an unexpected question. And in answering it, as you did, let's take a little bit broader perspective and then come back to your specific question. So the world we're dealing in today in terms of our categories, so I'm talking Colgate businesses now and the categories in which we do business, not the macroeconomic scene, we have a world where our categories are growing between 0% and 2% in the developed world, in Europe at the low end of that and in the U.S. at the upper end of that 0% to 2% growth. In the emerging markets, through this call, the growth rates in our categories continue to be mid-single digits generally. And our objective, business objective in that arena has been to have a sustainable rate of growth organically in that 4% to 7% range that we mentioned at the beginning of the year, which we think we continue into the third quarter. And we continue to talk about 4% to 7% for the year. And indeed, as we think about 2016, we begin our budgeting process with the same ambition next year. And the way that you get that consistent rate of growth is by building your brands, and you build your brands as measured in market share. And as we choose investment vehicles to build those brands, you're focusing on trial and repeat purchase of our new innovation and our existing businesses. And don't forget, in many of these emerging markets, consumer behavior is challenged by local category conditions in those markets, and in-store engagement can be more persuasive than what we were all educated as being proper advertising investment. So we balance and like to think we invest smartly in traditional media, the traditional television, magazine, radio, sampling devices that would be in that advertising number, with an increasing shift as being appointed out to digital, digital being both lower cost and a better rate of return and frankly, like Latin America, where millennials are now the predominant parents generation, a better way of engaging with that Colgate group. And then as you indicated, our -- the in-store work that we do that in these volatile times can be particularly powerful. Now all of that said, as we think about going forward and we begin our process for the budget in 2016, even though we haven't yet fully begun that process, if we look at the array of innovation we have over the next 3 years, starting in 2016, I think it would be safe to say that our expectation would be that our traditional advertising ratios would be up in 2016."

Doesn't that suggest that the consumers are making more and more decisions at the shelf and that's been a trend going on for a while? It seemed like it's accelerating. So that does reduce your -- such a competitive advantage over the long term? Because I think it's tough to really differentiate yourself as much in-store as one could do through traditional media, as an example. Perhaps online, although I'd say that the ROI there is still pretty iffy because there's no long-term history. So how do you balance that? Is that -- are you setting yourself up in a tougher situation by pushing more in-store for the long term given you're trying to differentiate your brand?"

And I think if you were to go back to again the days when many of us made our marketing bones, in-store activity was pretty rudimentary. There was a cardboard display stuck at the end of a shelf with a $0.99 off flag on it, hardly brand building in nature, and that is why everybody has this aversion, if you will, to in-store investment versus the supposed quality of the engagement we get from their traditional media, understanding that, that will -- today is so fragmented that it is less precise than perhaps many of us believed historically. So no, obviously, you don't find yourself in a place where all of your engagement with consumer happens at the retail level. But with the data available to us today, with the techniques available to us today, with some of the in-store engagement materials available to us to today, which are brand and benefit and therapy, open brackets, Colgate, specific, including sometimes the coloring of the shelves that house Oral Care products at retail, that is a wonderful environment to get consumers to make that final decision, particularly if they are in a stressed, highly devalued geography. You still have the advertising and we can debate traditional versus digital, but is making the awareness connection and seeking to provoke the trial, but you miss everything if you don't get engage with that consumer when they come to that store to make sure that trial engendered is for your product. So yes, it is a balance. So it is not a journey to everything at retail. But I think the historical perceptions of what you can do at retail and frankly, a prejudice that says what you do, do at retail is, by definition, not brand building, I'm afraid it's a little bit old-school."

Think about our market share and think about how much of that shelf we have. Then think about red, then think about a program that may take a local dentist with an incentive to go to a store and buy Colgate that is hitting you in the face with a therapeutic health message. So you're coming in provoked by the dentist and Colgate is engaging you at shelf. A competitor can spend more money they're not going to get at that presence at retail. So I would argue, it is differentiating and the presence you have at retail with the market shares we have in our specific categories come back to the more fragmented media market. You can argue, which is more likely to get the consumer's attention. Having said that, I am still old-school and I agree with you. A good copy is a very important part of marketing mix. But it's a marketing mix, I would argue it is not simply more of the store but everything on media. Things are much more balanced."

So what I can tell you is that what you are calling trade spending is up this year. But to come back to your more fundamental question, a few things. Number one, this notion of shopper marketing is not a third quarter 2015 comment. We have been trying to make this point unsuccessfully for the last 2 to 3 years for the reasons I detailed a little bit earlier. We believe, well done, it is part of building brands. Number two, you're right, digital, I think, will become an important way to target and reach different consumer groups going forward, and that carries with it a different dollar to the traditional media. But no, I would not take the notion that forever, going forward, our traditional media to sales percentage, the one you do see, will be lower and stay lower. That, as I said earlier in response to a question, I think, will be driven by the innovation spread that we have. And as I said earlier, even though we haven't finished the budget process -- actually, we haven't even started the budget process. But when you look at our innovation grid for the next 3 years, starting in 2016, I think my expectation would be that you will see that ratio head back up a little bit in 2016. So it'll move around. I'm just trying to assert that there's no good and bad, it's all in the marketing mix and they are all legitimate ways of engaging with consumers. And particularly, in volatile times with high devaluations, that closure, if you will, with the consumer on sale in those highly devalued [ph] emerging markets happens in that retail environment."

And in many of our key markets, even if you take the old-fashioned measure of share a voice, we remain, just on the face of it, quite competitive.

So this gives us the opportunity to transform a little bit what we are doing with the new structure that we are creating and do it in a time-bound window of 2017 rather than extending it over a longer period.

And number two, in terms of total spending, you're right, the trade spending as a ratio is a multiple of over 3x the traditional advertising spending. And relative to the category growth rates, Bill's question was to do with volume. And my answer to the question was -- this balance between volume and price. And he was asking whether the volume was bottoming out and would come back. And I think the answer we gave was, you would expect that balance to come up once the higher pricing that is being taken had worked its way through and that we didn't expect that to be earlier than 2016."

With me this morning are Ian Cook, President, Chairman and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.
We're pleased with the continued solid organic sales growth. Of course, negative foreign exchange continues to be a major challenge. But as you'll hear, our market shares are strong and growing, one the best indications of the health of a business. Happily, gross profit margin increased in the quarter as a result of our funding-the-growth initiatives, pricing actions and our Global Growth and Efficiency Program. Worldwide, our overhead costs are down on a dollar basis.
Now while reported advertising was down on a dollar basis, we think we're getting good results from the dollars we spend both in-store and out. Digital advertising is growing. In fact, as an example, in Latin America, we are increasing our investment in digital to better reach our younger audiences as well as to drive engagement.
And as we focus on developing strategic collaboration with partners such as Google and Facebook, we're better able to measure the results of our investments. Marketing mix model studies from several countries across Latin America show an ROI for digital investments that is 3 to 4x higher than TV, confirming this shift is right to drive our business.
Our balance sheet remains solid and we're making very good progress on working capital. So let's get right into the divisions, starting with the North America.
Innovation continues to fuel our success in North America. As mentioned in the press release, our market shares are up year-to-date into toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, liquid hand soap, body wash and fabric conditioners. And this was true on a quarter-over-quarter comparison as well. At the same time, we've seen a decline in private label shares in many of our categories, indicating the consumers' preference for branded products and the strength of our equities.
In the toothpaste category, the launch of Colgate Total Daily Repair, supported by an engaging media campaign and strong in-store shopper material, has added incremental share to the baseline products. In the whitening segment, we offer a full range of products, toothpaste, toothbrushes and mouthwash. Our Colgate Optic White toothpaste has grown share from 2.4% in the third quarter of 2011 to a 5.7% share in the most recent quarter.
Colgate Enamel Health has also seen good growth to mention, [ph] increasing a full share point quarter-over-quarter. Another exciting opportunity is the sensitivity segment, where we are a strong #2 player. That segment has seen a compound growth of 7.7% over the last 4 years versus 2.8% for toothpaste overall.
In the mouthwash category, where our share is up year-to-date 20 basis points, both Colgate Total for Gum Health and Colgate Enamel Health Mouthwash are picking up momentum. Our Colgate Total for Gum Health variant is the #1 new item in the leading retailer and receiving full support in store.
In liquid hand soaps, our year-to-date share is up almost a full point to a leading 30.6%, while private label products have declined almost 2 full points year-to-date, the lowest level in at least 5 years. Premium offerings such as Softsoap Fragrant Foaming Collection and Décor Collection foaming hand soaps offer distinctive benefits. Similarly, Softsoap Fresh & Glow body wash with real extracts with a unique formula, giving you healthy looking skin that glows, launched earlier this year, has increased our share in that category by almost a full point year-to-date.
Fabric conditioner has also continued to perform well. Suavitel Fragrance Pearls in-wash scent boosters, which provide 5x longer lasting fragrance versus detergent alone, which we told you about last quarter, have helped increase our national share almost a full point year-to-date, now approaching 20% of the market.
More trial-focused programs are expected to drive further growth in the fourth quarter. Now as you'd expect, our new product grid is well populated, and we will share with you some more exciting innovations slated for early 2016 on future calls.
Turning then to Europe/South Pacific. Our business there is showing encouraging signs of recovery, with innovation playing a critical role. Our market shares are up year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, body wash, shower gel, underarm protection and fabric conditioners.
In toothpaste, we're very excited about the early successes of our launch of Colgate Max White Expert White toothpaste, the latest premium offering in this fast-growing segment. Launched in the U.K. in June, it achieved a 2.7% share in August and was named the best new toiletries launched for 2015 by one of our larger drug retailers. 
Two products under the elmex brand developed specifically for the pharmacy channel, elmex SENSITIVE PROFESSIONAL and elmex ANTI-CARIES PROFESSIONAL, have driven our pharmacy share in France to a leadership position of 26.3% year-to-date and now ahead of the nearest competitor by 150 basis points.
In manual toothbrushes, our leading market share in Europe is up 130 basis points year-to-date to 24.6%, with our nearest competitor down to 17.4%. Driving these excellent results has been the relaunch across the region of our Colgate 360° manual toothbrush line. Priced at the super premium tier, these brushes deliver superior cleaning for a whole mouth clean and have been supported by a full shopper program.
We're also very encouraged by our launch of Sanex ADVANCED range of body washes, underarm protection and body and hand lotion. This innovation brings dermatological expertise for skin-specific needs to a third growth pillar for Sanex, leading the brand towards a more professional approach in mass. [ph] Early results are excellent. Since launch, Sanex is the fastest-growing brand in both body washes and underarm. And in our top markets of France, Spain and the U.K., our market shares are up in both categories.
In fabric conditioners, our market shares are up 20 basis points year-to-date to 24% across the European region with the most recent read at 24.5%. Contributing to this success is Soupline Fruity Sensations with a striking look and feel and new different and long-lasting fragrances. More innovation is found across our categories for the rest of this year and into 2016. Specifically, in Oral Care, we will be launching the Colgate Expert White Toothbrush + Built-In Whitening Pen. Now as you know, that product form has helped drive our manual toothbrush share to record high tier in the U.S.
In toothpaste, we will be launching Colgate Total Proof. This innovation uses breakthrough color change technology that turns the white paste into a blue foam while brushing, giving consumers the confidence of the ultimate clean feeling.
Turning then to Latin America. Business across the region is solid and as elsewhere, innovation has driven market share increases. Our regional market shares are up year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, toilet soap, liquids soap, shampoo, hand dish and liquid cleaners. And even in the face of some economic uncertainties in countries such as Brazil, our category still show solid local currency growth.
Our regional toothpaste share is up 2 full points year-to-date to 78.2%. In Brazil, our market share is up 50 basis points year-to-date to 72%, the highest share in over 20 years and in the face of continued heightened competitive activity. Colgate Total 12 relaunched in August with a positioning of protects 100% of the surfaces of the mouth, now has an 18.5% share in the most recent period. 
In Mexico, our share is up 1 point year-to-date to 81.3%, with the most recent read at 81.6%, while our major competitor shows continued share decline. Contributing to this success is our premium-priced Colgate Luminous White Advanced, Colgate's most advanced whitening toothpaste formulated to intensify the whiteness of your teeth by 3 shades.
In manual toothbrushes, our market share is up 230 basis points year-to-date to 45.4%, with the most recent read at 49.8%. In Mexico, we recently reintroduced our Colgate 360° line with a new packaging structure with premium finishing and improved benefit communication, whole mouth clean with 151% more bad breath bacteria removal. As a result, the Colgate 360° equity is up 110 basis points year-to-date, reaching a record 11.1% share.
Our leading year-to-date bar soap share is at 30.8%, with the most recent read at 32%. Record high shares were achieved in Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala. And our 2 equities, Protex and Palmolive, continue to hold the #1 and 2 positions across the region.
In Mexico, where we have a strong Home Care business, our results are excellent across the 3 subcategories: Hand dish, liquid cleaners and fabric conditioners. Our market shares are up on a year-to-date basis, 230, 40 and 150 basis points, respectively, to 52.6%, 33.5% and 48.4%.
So looking ahead, to further boost our leading manual toothbrush share, we are now in the process of launching Colgate Slim Soft White with 17x slimmer tip spiral bristles, which provide both whitening and deep yet gentle cleaning. An innovation launching now in fabric conditioners is Suavitel GoodBye Rinse, the market-leading Suavitel with an improved no-rinse formula. And as you would expect, more innovation is planned for 2016 to continue the momentum in this region.
Turning then to Asia. We're pleased with the strength of the business, particularly in our 2 largest markets, China and India, which both delivered good volume growth. Category growth rates remain mid-single digit in China, while in India, our categories are growing as well.
In India, our year-to-date toothpaste share is at almost 55% on a national basis and close to 59% in rural markets. Our market-leading manual toothbrush share is 43.6% year-to-date, and our launch of Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Enamel Repair toothpaste, while in its early days, is doing well. 
Our Colgate 360° Charcoal Gold toothbrush, launched earlier in other Asian markets, is now contributing to the results in India. This successful innovation with antibacterial bristles provides a whole mouth clean and has achieved strong shares across the region in the most recent period, 1.4% in Hong Kong, 2.5% in the Philippines, 1.3% in Taiwan and almost 2% in Malaysia and has an incremental in each market. More innovation is slated for this quarter and beyond.
In China, we will be launching 2 new products developed to appeal to local consumer preferences: Colgate Power White Lemon Salt toothpaste for freshness and whitening experienced with a lemon and sea salt flavor; and Colgate 360° Gold Ginseng Gum Care toothpaste, which contains ginseng essence and enhances the gum's power of defense.
Two popular Colgate Total variants, Charcoal Deep Clean and Pro Gum, will now be available in a gel format in addition to the paste. And in Thailand, in the Personal Care category, we're launching products for both men and women: For men, Protex Men 3-in-1, an all-in-one body cleansing solution with antibacterial protection; and for women, Protex Intimate, with antibacterial protection for long-lasting freshness and well-being sensation every day.
Africa/Eurasia. As you know, several of our larger markets in Africa/Eurasia region had been facing major currency headwinds. Despite the pricing actions we have taken to combat the currency headwinds, our organic sales growth is holding at mid-single digits, market shares are increasing and successful innovation is fueling our growth.
Our regional toothpaste share is up a full point year-to-date to almost 33%. In Russia, our share is up 230 basis points year-to-date to 34.2%, hitting a record share of 35.1% in the most recent period.
We recently launched Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with Sugar Acid Neutralizer, which has already reached a 0.7% share year-to-date and contributed to the share gains. In South Africa, our share grew 150 basis points year-to-date to 50.2%, driven by new marketing campaigns behind Colgate Total.
In toothbrushes, our share declined in only 1 country and was up in the majority of our markets. In Russia, where we achieved incremental listings in Russia's #1 retailer, our toothpaste -- toothbrush share grew 270 basis points year-to-date to 48.1%, with the most recent read at 49.4%. And in Turkey, our share grew 10 basis points year-to-date to 28.6%, with the most recent read at 29.7%. And in South Africa, our share was up 30 basis points year-to-date to 38.2%, with the most recent read at 38.6%.
Our bar soap business continued with strong momentum in our 2 biggest markets, Russia and South Africa. The recent introduction of Protex Men Power contributed to a regional share gain of 150 basis points year-to-date to almost 24%. More innovation is slated for this quarter.
Across the region, we will be relaunching our base Colgate Sensitive toothpaste and our line of Plax Mouthwash. In the Personal Care category, we will be launching a body wash occupying the new energizing segment for men's body wash, Palmolive Men Citrus Crush. It invites the consumer to experience an intense invigorating shower with bergamot and grapefruit ingredients sourced from the purest substances of nature and a sparkling citrus fragrance to spoil the senses.
And Hill's. Hill's delivered another solid quarter of organic sales growth, with a good balance of volume and price. Here in the U.S., superstore retail consumption showed a good increase. Innovation across Hill's Prescription Diet and Hill's Science Diet as well as volume growth in our ideal balance brand contributed to our good results.
Our Prescription Diet Metabolic canine and feline foods continued to gain share around the world. Our new stews form has accelerated our growth in the wet segment. We continue to receive endorsement from key thought leaders. And the global rollout this year of Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus breakthrough dual-efficacy food with nutrition and clinically proven to address obesity and concurrent conditions has added to the momentum of the business.
It's now selling in 38 countries and has benefited from extensive sampling to drive awareness and trial. Our ongoing global integrated marketing campaign includes professional print, online media, in-clinic seminars and recommendation tools and testimonial videos to showcase efficacy. 
In our wellness business, one of our newer launches, Hill's Science Diet Urinary and Hairball Control, is meeting with excellent results. The only wellness food that addresses the 2 most common conditions in healthy cats, it was among the top 3 wet variants in the U.S. market during the first 3 months after its launch and has a very high star rating on Amazon.com. It's been the product focus for our nutritional consultants at PetSmart and PETCO and has received good in-store activation feedback. Building on our success in the U.S., it has just been launched in Europe. 
And as we look into 2016, there's more exciting innovation news, which we will discuss with you on future calls.
So in summary, we're pleased with the continued solid organic sales growth and market share gains around the world. Our innovation pipeline is as full as ever and our savings programs are on track.
Colgate people around the world continue to focus on our 4 strategic initiatives, delivering consistent results. So we look forward to sharing our results with you as we finish the year.

I think last quarter, you had indicated local currency advertising will be roughly flat year-over-year as a percent of sales in 2015. Is that still the case? How are you thinking about that line item? And then the real question on that front is, it's now been 6 quarters in a row where AMP [ph] has been down substantially as a percentage of sales. I know you've indicated before it's been funneled back into promotion, which has been effective given the market share performance. But the level of pullback in AMP [ph] is really striking relative to your traditional -- the way you've run the business. So I guess, what gives you confidence this won't come back to bite you in the long run in terms of lower demand going forward, particularly given the macro situation out there right now?"

As you might imagine, not an unexpected question. And in answering it, as you did, let's take a little bit broader perspective and then come back to your specific question.

And in answering it, as you did, let's take a little bit broader perspective and then come back to your specific question. So the world we're dealing in today in terms of our categories, so I'm talking Colgate businesses now and the categories in which we do business, not the macroeconomic scene, we have a world where our categories are growing between 0% and 2% in the developed world, in Europe at the low end of that and in the U.S. at the upper end of that 0% to 2% growth. In the emerging markets, through this call, the growth rates in our categories continue to be mid-single digits generally. And our objective, business objective in that arena has been to have a sustainable rate of growth organically in that 4% to 7% range that we mentioned at the beginning of the year, which we think we continue into the third quarter. And we continue to talk about 4% to 7% for the year. And indeed, as we think about 2016, we begin our budgeting process with the same ambition next year. And the way that you get that consistent rate of growth is by building your brands, and you build your brands as measured in market share. And as we choose investment vehicles to build those brands, you're focusing on trial and repeat purchase of our new innovation and our existing businesses. And don't forget, in many of these emerging markets, consumer behavior is challenged by local category conditions in those markets, and in-store engagement can be more persuasive than what we were all educated as being proper advertising investment. So we balance and like to think we invest smartly in traditional media, the traditional television, magazine, radio, sampling devices that would be in that advertising number, with an increasing shift as being appointed out to digital, digital being both lower cost and a better rate of return and frankly, like Latin America, where millennials are now the predominant parents generation, a better way of engaging with that target group. And then as you indicated, our -- the in-store work that we do that in these volatile times can be particularly powerful. Now all of that said, as we think about going forward and we begin our process for the budget in 2016, even though we haven't yet fully begun that process, if we look at the array of innovation we have over the next 3 years, starting in 2016, I think it would be safe to say that our expectation would be that our traditional advertising ratios would be up in 2016."

Doesn't that suggest that the consumers are making more and more decisions at the shelf and that's been a trend going on for a while? It seemed like it's accelerating. So that does reduce your -- such a competitive advantage over the long term? Because I think it's tough to really differentiate yourself as much in-store as one could do through traditional media, as an example. Perhaps online, although I'd say that the ROI there is still pretty iffy because there's no long-term history. So how do you balance that?

And I think if you were to go back to again the days when many of us made our marketing bones, in-store activity was pretty rudimentary. There was a cardboard display stuck at the end of a shelf with a $0.99 off flag on it, hardly brand building in nature, and that is why everybody has this aversion, if you will, to in-store investment versus the supposed quality of the engagement we get from their traditional media, understanding that, that world today is so fragmented that it is less precise than perhaps many of us believed historically. So no, obviously, you don't find yourself in a place where all of your engagement with consumer happens at the retail level. But with the data available to us today, with the techniques available to us today, with some of the in-store engagement materials available to us to today, which are brand and benefit and therapy, [Colgate], specific, including sometimes the coloring of the shelves that house Oral Care products at retail, that is a wonderful environment to get consumers to make that final decision, particularly if they are in a stressed, highly devalued geography. You still have the advertising and we can debate traditional versus digital, but is making the awareness connection and seeking to provoke the trial, but you miss everything if you don't get engage with that consumer when they come to that store to make sure that trial engendered is for your product. So yes, it is a balance. So it is not a journey to everything at retail. But I think the historical perceptions of what you can do at retail and frankly, a prejudice that says what you do, do at retail is, by definition, not brand building, I'm afraid it's a little bit old-school."

So you're coming in provoked by the dentist and Colgate is engaging you at shelf. A competitor can spend more money they're not going to get at that presence at retail. So I would argue, it is differentiating and the presence you have at retail with the market shares we have in our specific categories come back to the more fragmented media market.

So what I can tell you is that what you are calling trade spending is up this year. But to come back to your more fundamental question, a few things. Number one, this notion of shopper marketing is not a third quarter 2015 comment. We have been trying to make this point unsuccessfully for the last 2 to 3 years for the reasons I detailed a little bit earlier. We believe, well done, it is part of building brands. Number two, you're right, digital, I think, will become an important way to target and reach different consumer groups going forward, and that carries with it a different dollar to the traditional media. But no, I would not take the notion that forever, going forward, our traditional media to sales percentage, the one you do see, will be lower and stay lower. That, as I said earlier in response to a question, I think, will be driven by the innovation spread that we have. And as I said earlier, even though we haven't finished the budget process -- actually, we haven't even started the budget process. But when you look at our innovation grid for the next 3 years, starting in 2016, I think my expectation would be that you will see that ratio head back up a little bit in 2016. So it'll move around. I'm just trying to assert that there's no good and bad, it's all in the marketing mix and they are all legitimate ways of engaging with consumers. And particularly, in volatile times with high devaluations, that closure, if you will, with the consumer on sale in those highly devalued [ph] emerging markets happens in that retail environment."

Now as you look around the world and something I elected not to say, less one sounds defensive, but as you go around the world, in many parts of the world, you continue to see many of our multinational competitors pull back on traditional advertising quite substantially. And in many of our key markets, even if you take the old-fashioned measure of share a voice, we remain, just on the face of it, quite competitive.

So this gives us the opportunity to transform a little bit what we are doing with the new structure that we are creating and do it in a time-bound window of 2017 rather than extending it over a longer period.

And I would further say, when you look at the breakdown of raw materials in today's world, many of those raw materials are dollar-denominated. So even the local competitor is going to be hit with the local currency transaction impact of raw materials coming into the country. So I would say that the incentive to price is fairly elevated across the board."

With me this morning are Ian Cook, President, Chairman and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.
We're pleased with the continued solid organic sales growth. Of course, negative foreign exchange continues to be a major challenge. But as you'll hear, our market shares are strong and growing, one the best indications of the health of a business. Happily, gross profit margin increased in the quarter as a result of our funding-the-growth initiatives, pricing actions and our Global Growth and Efficiency Program. Worldwide, our overhead costs are down on a dollar basis.
Now while reported advertising was down on a dollar basis, we think we're getting good results from the dollars we spend both in-store and out. Digital advertising is growing. In fact, as an example, in Latin America, we are increasing our investment in digital to better reach our younger audiences as well as to drive engagement.
And as we focus on developing strategic collaboration with partners such as Google and Facebook, we're better able to measure the results of our investments. Marketing mix model studies from several countries across Latin America show an ROI for digital investments that is 3 to 4x higher than TV, confirming this shift is right to drive our business.
Our balance sheet remains solid and we're making very good progress on working capital. So let's get right into the divisions, starting with the North America.
Innovation continues to fuel our success in North America. As mentioned in the press release, our market shares are up year-to-date into toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, liquid hand soap, body wash and fabric conditioners. And this was true on a quarter-over-quarter comparison as well. At the same time, we've seen a decline in private label shares in many of our categories, indicating the consumers' preference for branded products and the strength of our equities.
In the toothpaste category, the launch of Colgate Total Daily Repair, supported by an engaging media campaign and strong in-store shopper material, has added incremental share to the baseline products. In the whitening segment, we offer a full range of products, toothpaste, toothbrushes and mouthwash. Our Colgate Optic White toothpaste has grown share from 2.4% in the third quarter of 2011 to a 5.7% share in the most recent quarter.
Colgate Enamel Health has also seen good growth to mention, [ph] increasing a full share point quarter-over-quarter. Another exciting opportunity is the sensitivity segment, where we are a strong #2 player. That segment has seen a compound growth of 7.7% over the last 4 years versus 2.8% for toothpaste overall.
In the mouthwash category, where our share is up year-to-date 20 basis points, both Colgate Total for Gum Health and Colgate Enamel Health Mouthwash are picking up momentum. Our Colgate Total for Gum Health variant is the #1 new item in the leading retailer and receiving full support in store.
In liquid hand soaps, our year-to-date share is up almost a full point to a leading 30.6%, while private label products have declined almost 2 full points year-to-date, the lowest level in at least 5 years. Premium offerings such as Softsoap Fragrant Foaming Collection and Décor Collection foaming hand soaps offer distinctive benefits. Similarly, Softsoap Fresh & Glow body wash with real extracts with a unique formula, giving you healthy looking skin that glows, launched earlier this year, has increased our share in that category by almost a full point year-to-date.
Fabric conditioner has also continued to perform well. Suavitel Fragrance Pearls in-wash scent boosters, which provide 5x longer lasting fragrance versus detergent alone, which we told you about last quarter, have helped increase our national share almost a full point year-to-date, now approaching 20% of the market.
More trial-focused programs are expected to drive further growth in the fourth quarter. Now as you'd expect, our new product grid is well populated, and we will share with you some more exciting innovations slated for early 2016 on future calls.
Turning then to Europe/South Pacific. Our business there is showing encouraging signs of recovery, with innovation playing a critical role. Our market shares are up year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, body wash, shower gel, underarm protection and fabric conditioners.
In toothpaste, we're very excited about the early successes of our launch of Colgate Max White Expert White toothpaste, the latest premium offering in this fast-growing segment. Launched in the U.K. in June, it achieved a 2.7% share in August and was named the best new toiletries launched for 2015 by one of our larger drug retailers. 
Two products under the elmex brand developed specifically for the pharmacy channel, elmex SENSITIVE PROFESSIONAL and elmex ANTI-CARIES PROFESSIONAL, have driven our pharmacy share in France to a leadership position of 26.3% year-to-date and now ahead of the nearest competitor by 150 basis points.
In manual toothbrushes, our leading market share in Europe is up 130 basis points year-to-date to 24.6%, with our nearest competitor down to 17.4%. Driving these excellent results has been the relaunch across the region of our Colgate 360° manual toothbrush line. Priced at the super premium tier, these brushes deliver superior cleaning for a whole mouth clean and have been supported by a full shopper program.
We're also very encouraged by our launch of Sanex ADVANCED range of body washes, underarm protection and body and hand lotion. This innovation brings dermatological expertise for skin-specific needs to a third growth pillar for Sanex, leading the brand towards a more professional approach in mass. [ph] Early results are excellent. Since launch, Sanex is the fastest-growing brand in both body washes and underarm. And in our top markets of France, Spain and the U.K., our market shares are up in both categories.
In fabric conditioners, our market shares are up 20 basis points year-to-date to 24% across the European region with the most recent read at 24.5%. Contributing to this success is Soupline Fruity Sensations with a striking look and feel and new different and long-lasting fragrances. More innovation is found across our categories for the rest of this year and into 2016. Specifically, in Oral Care, we will be launching the Colgate Expert White Toothbrush + Built-In Whitening Pen. Now as you know, that product form has helped drive our manual toothbrush share to record high tier in the U.S.
In toothpaste, we will be launching Colgate Total Proof. This innovation uses breakthrough color change technology that turns the white paste into a blue foam while brushing, giving consumers the confidence of the ultimate clean feeling.
Turning then to Latin America. Business across the region is solid and as elsewhere, innovation has driven market share increases. Our regional market shares are up year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrushes, mouthwash, toilet soap, liquids soap, shampoo, hand dish and liquid cleaners. And even in the face of some economic uncertainties in countries such as Brazil, our category still show solid local currency growth.
Our regional toothpaste share is up 2 full points year-to-date to 78.2%. In Brazil, our market share is up 50 basis points year-to-date to 72%, the highest share in over 20 years and in the face of continued heightened competitive activity. Colgate Total 12 relaunched in August with a positioning of protects 100% of the surfaces of the mouth, now has an 18.5% share in the most recent period. 
In Mexico, our share is up 1 point year-to-date to 81.3%, with the most recent read at 81.6%, while our major competitor shows continued share decline. Contributing to this success is our premium-priced Colgate Luminous White Advanced, Colgate's most advanced whitening toothpaste formulated to intensify the whiteness of your teeth by 3 shades.
In manual toothbrushes, our market share is up 230 basis points year-to-date to 45.4%, with the most recent read at 49.8%. In Mexico, we recently reintroduced our Colgate 360° line with a new packaging structure with premium finishing and improved benefit communication, whole mouth clean with 151% more bad breath bacteria removal. As a result, the Colgate 360° equity is up 110 basis points year-to-date, reaching a record 11.1% share.
Our leading year-to-date bar soap share is at 30.8%, with the most recent read at 32%. Record high shares were achieved in Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala. And our 2 equities, Protex and Palmolive, continue to hold the #1 and 2 positions across the region.
In Mexico, where we have a strong Home Care business, our results are excellent across the 3 subcategories: Hand dish, liquid cleaners and fabric conditioners. Our market shares are up on a year-to-date basis, 230, 40 and 150 basis points, respectively, to 52.6%, 33.5% and 48.4%.
So looking ahead, to further boost our leading manual toothbrush share, we are now in the process of launching Colgate Slim Soft White with 17x slimmer tip spiral bristles, which provide both whitening and deep yet gentle cleaning. An innovation launching now in fabric conditioners is Suavitel GoodBye Rinse, the market-leading Suavitel with an improved no-rinse formula. And as you would expect, more innovation is planned for 2016 to continue the momentum in this region.
Turning then to Asia. We're pleased with the strength of the business, particularly in our 2 largest markets, China and India, which both delivered good volume growth. Category growth rates remain mid-single digit in China, while in India, our categories are growing as well.
In India, our year-to-date toothpaste share is at almost 55% on a national basis and close to 59% in rural markets. Our market-leading manual toothbrush share is 43.6% year-to-date, and our launch of Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Enamel Repair toothpaste, while in its early days, is doing well. 
Our Colgate 360° Charcoal Gold toothbrush, launched earlier in other Asian markets, is now contributing to the results in India. This successful innovation with antibacterial bristles provides a whole mouth clean and has achieved strong shares across the region in the most recent period, 1.4% in Hong Kong, 2.5% in the Philippines, 1.3% in Taiwan and almost 2% in Malaysia and has an incremental in each market. More innovation is slated for this quarter and beyond.
In China, we will be launching 2 new products developed to appeal to local consumer preferences: Colgate Power White Lemon Salt toothpaste for freshness and whitening experienced with a lemon and sea salt flavor; and Colgate 360° Gold Ginseng Gum Care toothpaste, which contains ginseng essence and enhances the gum's power of defense.
Two popular Colgate Total variants, Charcoal Deep Clean and Pro Gum, will now be available in a gel format in addition to the paste. And in Thailand, in the Personal Care category, we're launching products for both men and women: For men, Protex Men 3-in-1, an all-in-one body cleansing solution with antibacterial protection; and for women, Protex Intimate, with antibacterial protection for long-lasting freshness and well-being sensation every day.
Africa/Eurasia. As you know, several of our larger markets in Africa/Eurasia region had been facing major currency headwinds. Despite the pricing actions we have taken to combat the currency headwinds, our organic sales growth is holding at mid-single digits, market shares are increasing and successful innovation is fueling our growth.
Our regional toothpaste share is up a full point year-to-date to almost 33%. In Russia, our share is up 230 basis points year-to-date to 34.2%, hitting a record share of 35.1% in the most recent period.
We recently launched Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with Sugar Acid Neutralizer, which has already reached a 0.7% share year-to-date and contributed to the share gains. In South Africa, our share grew 150 basis points year-to-date to 50.2%, driven by new marketing campaigns behind Colgate Total.
In toothbrushes, our share declined in only 1 country and was up in the majority of our markets. In Russia, where we achieved incremental listings in Russia's #1 retailer, our toothpaste -- toothbrush share grew 270 basis points year-to-date to 48.1%, with the most recent read at 49.4%. And in Turkey, our share grew 10 basis points year-to-date to 28.6%, with the most recent read at 29.7%. And in South Africa, our share was up 30 basis points year-to-date to 38.2%, with the most recent read at 38.6%.
Our bar soap business continued with strong momentum in our 2 biggest markets, Russia and South Africa. The recent introduction of Protex Men Power contributed to a regional share gain of 150 basis points year-to-date to almost 24%. More innovation is slated for this quarter.
Across the region, we will be relaunching our base Colgate Sensitive toothpaste and our line of Plax Mouthwash. In the Personal Care category, we will be launching a body wash occupying the new energizing segment for men's body wash, Palmolive Men Citrus Crush. It invites the consumer to experience an intense invigorating shower with bergamot and grapefruit ingredients sourced from the purest substances of nature and a sparkling citrus fragrance to spoil the senses.
And Hill's. Hill's delivered another solid quarter of organic sales growth, with a good balance of volume and price. Here in the U.S., superstore retail consumption showed a good increase. Innovation across Hill's Prescription Diet and Hill's Science Diet as well as volume growth in our ideal balance brand contributed to our good results.
Our Prescription Diet Metabolic canine and feline foods continued to gain share around the world. Our new stews form has accelerated our growth in the wet segment. We continue to receive endorsement from key thought leaders. And the global rollout this year of Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus breakthrough dual-efficacy food with nutrition and clinically proven to address obesity and concurrent conditions has added to the momentum of the business.
It's now selling in 38 countries and has benefited from extensive sampling to drive awareness and trial. Our ongoing global integrated marketing campaign includes professional print, online media, in-clinic seminars and recommendation tools and testimonial videos to showcase efficacy. 
In our wellness business, one of our newer launches, Hill's Science Diet Urinary and Hairball Control, is meeting with excellent results. The only wellness food that addresses the 2 most common conditions in healthy cats, it was among the top 3 wet variants in the U.S. market during the first 3 months after its launch and has a very high star rating on Amazon.com. It's been the product focus for our nutritional consultants at PetSmart and PETCO and has received good in-store activation feedback. Building on our success in the U.S., it has just been launched in Europe. 
And as we look into 2016, there's more exciting innovation news, which we will discuss with you on future calls.
So in summary, we're pleased with the continued solid organic sales growth and market share gains around the world. Our innovation pipeline is as full as ever and our savings programs are on track.
Colgate people around the world continue to focus on our 4 strategic initiatives, delivering consistent results. So we look forward to sharing our results with you as we finish the year.

I think last quarter, you had indicated local currency advertising will be roughly flat year-over-year as a percent of sales in 2015. Is that still the case? How are you thinking about that line item? And then the real question on that front is, it's now been 6 quarters in a row where AMP [ph] has been down substantially as a percentage of sales. I know you've indicated before it's been funneled back into promotion, which has been effective given the market share performance. But the level of pullback in AMP [ph] is really striking relative to your traditional -- the way you've run the business. So I guess, what gives you confidence this won't come back to bite you in the long run in terms of lower demand going forward, particularly given the macro situation out there right now?"

And in answering it, as you did, let's take a little bit broader perspective and then come back to your specific question. So the world we're dealing in today in terms of our categories, so I'm talking Colgate businesses now and the categories in which we do business, not the macroeconomic scene, we have a world where our categories are growing between 0% and 2% in the developed world, in Europe at the low end of that and in the U.S. at the upper end of that 0% to 2% growth. In the emerging markets, through this call, the growth rates in our categories continue to be mid-single digits generally. And our objective, business objective in that arena has been to have a sustainable rate of growth organically in that 4% to 7% range that we mentioned at the beginning of the year, which we think we continue into the third quarter. And we continue to talk about 4% to 7% for the year. And indeed, as we think about 2016, we begin our budgeting process with the same ambition next year. And the way that you get that consistent rate of growth is by building your brands, and you build your brands as measured in market share. And as we choose investment vehicles to build those brands, you're focusing on trial and repeat purchase of our new innovation and our existing businesses. And don't forget, in many of these emerging markets, consumer behavior is challenged by local category conditions in those markets, and in-store engagement can be more persuasive than what we were all educated as being proper advertising investment. So we balance and like to think we invest smartly in traditional media, the traditional television, magazine, radio, sampling devices that would be in that advertising number, with an increasing shift as being appointed out to digital, digital being both lower cost and a better rate of return and frankly, like Latin America, where millennials are now the predominant parents generation, a better way of engaging with that target group. And then as you indicated, our -- the in-store work that we do that in these volatile times can be particularly powerful. Now all of that said, as we think about going forward and we begin our process for the budget in 2016, even though we haven't yet fully begun that process, if we look at the array of innovation we have over the next 3 years, starting in 2016, I think it would be safe to say that our expectation would be that our traditional advertising ratios would be up in 2016."

Doesn't that suggest that the consumers are making more and more decisions at the shelf and that's been a trend going on for a while? It seemed like it's accelerating. So that does reduce your -- such a competitive advantage over the long term? Because I think it's tough to really differentiate yourself as much in-store as one could do through traditional media, as an example. Perhaps online, although I'd say that the ROI there is still pretty iffy because there's no long-term history. So how do you balance that?

And I think if you were to go back to again the days when many of us made our marketing bones, in-store activity was pretty rudimentary. There was a cardboard display stuck at the end of a shelf with a $0.99 off flag on it, hardly brand building in nature, and that is why everybody has this aversion, if you will, to in-store investment versus the supposed quality of the engagement we get from their traditional media, understanding that, that world today is so fragmented that it is less precise than perhaps many of us believed historically. So no, obviously, you don't find yourself in a place where all of your engagement with consumer happens at the retail level. But with the data available to us today, with the techniques available to us today, with some of the in-store engagement materials available to us to today, which are brand and benefit and therapy, Colgate, specific, including sometimes the coloring of the shelves that house Oral Care products at retail, that is a wonderful environment to get consumers to make that final decision, particularly if they are in a stressed, highly devalued geography. You still have the advertising and we can debate traditional versus digital, but is making the awareness connection and seeking to provoke the trial, but you miss everything if you don't get engage with that consumer when they come to that store to make sure that trial engendered is for your product. So yes, it is a balance. So it is not a journey to everything at retail. But I think the historical perceptions of what you can do at retail and frankly, a prejudice that says what you do, do at retail is, by definition, not brand building, I'm afraid it's a little bit old-school."

So I would argue, it is differentiating and the presence you have at retail with the market shares we have in our specific categories come back to the more fragmented media market. You can argue, which is more likely to get the consumer's attention. Having said that, I am still old-school and I agree with you where good copy is a very important part of marketing mix.

But you're right. When pricing is very aggressive, needs as much [ph] from a dollar point of view that tends to depress volume in the short haul. So without being glib, I think my answer would be once the necessary wave of pricing is behind us and everybody else that's taking pricing, I think you can expect the balance between price and volume to move back more onto the volume side of the equation. When exactly that will be is difficult to tell. I would certainly say it would be no earlier than next year."

So what I can tell you is that what you are calling trade spending is up this year. But to come back to your more fundamental question, a few things. Number one, this notion of shopper marketing is not a third quarter 2015 comment. We have been trying to make this point unsuccessfully for the last 2 to 3 years for the reasons I detailed a little bit earlier. We believe, well done, it is part of building brands. Number two, you're right, digital, I think, will become an important way to target and reach different consumer groups going forward, and that carries with it a different dollar to the traditional media. But no, I would not take the notion that forever, going forward, our traditional media to sales percentage, the one you do see, will be lower and stay lower. That, as I said earlier in response to a question, I think, will be driven by the innovation spread that we have. And as I said earlier, even though we haven't finished the budget process -- actually, we haven't even started the budget process. But when you look at our innovation grid for the next 3 years, starting in 2016, I think my expectation would be that you will see that ratio head back up a little bit in 2016. So it'll move around. I'm just trying to assert that there's no good and bad, it's all in the marketing mix and they are all legitimate ways of engaging with consumers. And particularly, in volatile times with high devaluations, that closure, if you will, with the consumer on sale in those highly devalued [ph] emerging markets happens in that retail environment."

Now as you look around the world and something I elected not to say, less one sounds defensive, but as you go around the world, in many parts of the world, you continue to see many of our multinational competitors pull back on traditional advertising quite substantially. And in many of our key markets, even if you take the old-fashioned measure of share a voice, we remain, just on the face of it, quite competitive. Now we have seen some corroborating signals of certain businesses exited by competitors in order to realize price. You see the public information in India and you see that in the marketplace.

So this gives us the opportunity to transform a little bit what we are doing with the new structure that we are creating and do it in a time-bound window of 2017 rather than extending it over a longer period.
