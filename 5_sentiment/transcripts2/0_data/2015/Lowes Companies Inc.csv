Comp growth was driven by a 4.9% increase in comp average ticket and a 2.3% increase in comp transactions. The mix of comp ticket and comp transactions was consistent with our expectations. 
Comparable sales growth for our U.S. business was 7.4% for the quarter. We saw balanced performance across the country again this quarter, with all 3 divisions, the North, South and West, generating comps within a tight range. In fact, all 14 regions had comps greater than 5%. 
Likewise, we reported positive comps in all 12 product categories, and our Pro Services business continued its strong performance, with comp sales in line with company average during the quarter. 
I'm also pleased to share that our team in Canada delivered double-digit comps in local currency for the seventh consecutive quarter. 
We remain focused on improving our profitability even while investing in key capabilities to drive sales growth. For the quarter, we drove 115 basis points of operating margin expansion and earnings per share of $0.46, a 59% increase over last year's fourth quarter. 
For the year, we delivered comparable sales growth of 4.3% and earnings per share of $2.71, a 27% increase over fiscal 2013. 
Delivering on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter, we repurchased $1 billion of stock under our share repurchase program and paid $225 million in dividends. For the year, we repurchased $3.9 billion of stock and paid $822 million in dividends. 
As we head into fiscal 2015, microeconomic fundamentals are aligned for modestly stronger home improvement industry growth. Jobs, incomes, household financial conditions are expected to continue strengthening in 2015, building on the momentum gained in 2014. 
Coupled with an increase in revolving credit usage, these trends set the stage for higher discretionary consumer spending, and the sharp decline in energy prices should allow consumers to pump less money into their tanks and more into home improvement and other forms of discretionary spending. 
Improvements in housing should persist in 2015 as well. Strong income gains, mortgage rates that remain historically low and moderating home price growth should keep home affordability at elevated levels and provide more support for home buying 2015. 
Expected growth in the home improvement market is further supported by recent consumer confidence groups [ph] and the results of our fourth quarter consumer sentiment survey, which revealed that homeowners' views around personal finances and home values continue to improve. In fact, approximately 1/2 of homeowners now believe the value of their homes is increasing. 
Along with the positive progression in sentiment, this quarter, even more homeowners indicated their home improvement spending was increased. And while most of the home improvement projects they have planned are still small-ticket, the survey indicated boost in plans for big-ticket projects versus this time last year. 
In 2015, we will continue to focus on a few key priorities to capitalize on opportunities within an improving economy. We'll further pursue top line growth by differentiating ourselves through better customer experiences and improving our product and service offerings for the Pro customer. 
In addition, we continue developing omnichannel capabilities as part of our long-term commitment to meet customers on their terms whenever and wherever they choose to engage with us. 
We also remain committed to improving our productivity and profitability, with opportunities in a few specific areas, including store payroll, marketing and leveraging our scale to get cost savings on indirect spend. These efforts give us confidence in our business outlook for 2015. Bob will share these details in a few minutes. 
But first, I would like to thank our more than 265,000 employees for their hard work and dedication. Their steadfast commitment to serving customers is critical to our success and an important driver of this quarter's strong results. Thanks again for your interest. And with that, let me turn the call over to Rick."

This progr",1236,"Thanks, Robert, and good morning, everyone. As Robert stated, we delivered strong performance in the quarter, and I'm pleased to share that our store employees [indiscernible] record pay-up from ourselves and service employee incentive program. This program rewards store employees for achieving the sales and profitability targets and for delivering outstanding customer service. 
We continue to capitalize on an improving macro backdrop through our enhanced sales operations planning process, improving relevance with the Pro and expanding customer experience design capabilities. 
In the fourth quarter, we used our enhanced Sales & Operations Planning process to coordinate inventory flows, advertising and training around our celebrated season, winter campaign. With this campaign, we targeted 4 important Southern [ph] locations into our refresh, holiday decorating, gifting and getting organized. For each occasion, our store, logistics, merchandising and marketing teams collaborated to ensure that we had relevant products available to customers at the right time, that they were effectively advertised and strategically promoted to drive traffic and cross merchandise to build the basket. As a result, we drove both online and in-store transactions and ticket growth, and we fulfilled orders in the most convenient manner our customer. Our ability to sell products from a store, online, in-home or through contact centers is a distinct, competitive advantage that allows us to engage customers on their terms whenever and wherever they choose. 
We know that, for many projects, more than half of the customers research online before making an in-store purchase. And for purchases made on Lowe's.com, approximately 60% [ph] are pick up in-store; 10% are delivered from the store; and the remaining 30% are a partial shift. This speaks to our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure with the omnichannel capabilities we are introducing. 
From a category standpoint, we drove above-company average comps in kitchen, appliances, lumber, raw materials, millwork and outdoor power equipment. We drove company average comps in fashion fixtures, tools and hardware. 
Customers are increasingly interested in refreshing the interior and exterior of their homes, so we used targeted promotions, coupled with our investment in project specialists, to drive performance in fashion fixtures, flooring, kitchens, appliances and millwork. We are pleased with the project specialist programs. Currently, we have project specialists who focus on exterior the home of the available across all U.S. stores. 
Our interior project specialists program has an average ticket of about $10,000, and customer satisfaction scores over 15 points higher than the industry standard. So we're expanding it to another 470 stores in 2015, reaching over 3/4 of our stores by year-end. With our ability to ordinate sound, provide design expertise and find the right contract to visit the job, we are rapidly becoming the project authority of home improvement. 
Within lumber and materials, we spent -- we met strong unit demand for dimensional and treated lumber, with robust inventory depth. We also leverage our store's canopy program, and which each market reflects the most relevant lumber build materials to be factor just outside of Pro entrance under the canopy. This program helps Pros quickly find out the lumber, plywood and wildboard, quick out -- quickly check out, receive loading the systems and get back on the job. 
With outdoor power equipment, we met strong Midwest and Northeast demand for snow plowers. 
In tools and hardware, we saw a particular strength in power pneumatic [ph] tools. We had a compelling assortment of national tool brands, and we've expanded our relationship with the [indiscernible] to include  pneumatic tools. Combined with Boston, Lowe's now has the #1 and #2 brands, making us the destination for pneumatic tools, particularly for the Pro. 
Kessler, the innovative leader in [indiscernible] is another important brand for Pro customers. And I'm pleased to announce that we just recently added this leading brand for allowing assortment. The expanded relationship with brands like [indiscernible] and the additions of the brand like Kessler, build on a solid foundation to serve the Pro. 
In fact, 14 consecutive quarters of Pro comps at or above the company average are a testament to this foundation, which includes dedicated service in our stores, inventory depth and our [indiscernible] value proposition. 
Additionally, fuel-based [ph] Pro executives than our national accounts team make it easy for medium to large sized companies and government entities to do business with us. We are also completing our beta test of LowesForPros.com, which has been well-received by our customers. This dedicated platform is fully transactional and will provide Pros usual functionality such as the ability to develop acquisition list and either purchases as well as customized product catalogs. 
This site can also be integrated with purchasing systems among Pros use to manage their business, further streamlining their day-to-day operations and have them working more effectively. 
We have received positive feedback from the flexibility and ease-of-use and expect to make it available to all Pros this spring. 
Last quarter, Mike told you about the holiday decor experience we implemented in all of our stores using the stage created for our outdoor living experience. This stage leverages our largest store format. 
Developed through a collaboration between our merchants, stores and customer experience design team, the holiday decor experience is our customers to decorate, raise their awareness of the breadth of our holiday decor and gift offerings and providing solutions -- project solutions relevant to the holiday micro seasons. The customer response was very positive, and the improved sales, inventory sales group and gross margin for the products included in this set. 
We are now transitioning into this space that our outdoor living experience in preparation for the critical spring selling season. 
In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we are focused on driving productivity and profitability. 
During the quarter, our source once again effectively managed payroll hours as comp sales accelerated, increasing sales by our by approximately 5% and driving 28 basis points of payroll expense leverage. 
They drove this leverage while maintaining great customers satisfaction stores and best-in-class inventory spring performance. We are pleased with the progress this year on sales growth, productivity and operating profitability. And we're committed to further improvement in 2015. 
In 2015, we expect to drive sales growth as we further capitalize on the improving macro backdrop through increased relevance with the Pro, improved customer experiences and the continued development of omnichannel capabilities. We will increase gross margin by continuing to partner with our vendors to drive innovation and lower first cost by leveraging our supply chain fixed cost. We will continue to leverage payroll as we further align payroll hours to customer traffic and more efficiently complete noncustomer-facing task. 
Will also drive expense productivity as we increased sales by reducing fixed expenses. For example, we will reduce our total marketing spend even while increasing our presence in targeted media. And we will obtain further expense efficiency by consolidating procurements of [indiscernible] services across our corporate i-store functions. Likewise, we will increase inventory turns approximately 15 basis points, as we continue to hold inventory per-store flat while increasing comp sales. With solid depth of high velocity items and job [indiscernible] in place, we will obtain additional inventory productivity, as we continue to thoughtfully conduct our line review process. 
We are excited about the further improvements we'll make to our business in 2015 and look forward to sharing our progress as the year unfolds. 
Thank you for interest in Lowe's, and I will now turn the call over to Bob."

Sales for the fourth quarter were $12.5 billion, which represented a 7.6% increase over last year's fourth quarter. Total average ticket increased by 4.9% to $66.17, and total transactions increased 2.5%. 
Comp sales were 7.3% in the quarter. As you heard from Rick, further momentum from our initiatives and improving execution drove balanced performance in the quarter. 
Comp average ticket increased 4.9%, and comp transactions increased 2.3%. 
Looking at monthly trends. Comps were 6.7% in November, 7.2% in December and 8.2% in January. For the year, total sales were $56.2 billion, an increase of 5.3% [ph], driven by a comp sales increase of 4.3%, a full year sales compared with partial year following the August 2013 acquisition and new stores. 
For 2014, comp average ticket increased 2.4%, and comp transactions increased 1.8%. 
Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 34.6% of sales, which is roughly flat to last year. In the quarter, the mix of products sold negatively impacted gross margin by 25 basis points. 
Also, price actions hurt gross margin by approximately 10 basis points. These items were essentially offset by value improvement and better seasonal to sell-through, which helped by 15 and 10 basis points, respectively. 
For the year, gross margin of 34.79% represented an increase of 20 basis points over 2013. SG&A for Q4 was 25.24% of sales, which leveraged 88 basis points. The SG&A leverage was driven by a variety of factors. In the quarter, store payroll leveraged 28 basis points due to better alignment of hours and customer traffic and strong comp sales. 
Property tax expense leveraged 21 basis points due to favorability in valuations recognized this year. 
At our analyst conference in December, we noted that expense productivity would come from utilizing our scale to reduce the spend on indirect goods and services. In the quarter, these efforts allowed us to leverage telecommunications and car [ph] expenses. Also, given the sales growth, we're able to leverage fixed costs. 
Lastly, we have approximately 30 basis points of expense leverage associated with last year's asset procurement. 
These items were offset somewhat by employee interest deleverage of 30 basis points. Our higher expenses were driven by both higher enrollment as well as cost inflation. 
For the year, SG&A was 23.62% [ph] of sales and leveraged 46 basis points versus 2013. 
Depreciation expense was $362 million for the quarter, which is 2.89% of sales and leveraged 28 basis points. The leverage was driven by higher sales as well as assets becoming fully depreciated. 
Earnings before interest and taxes for the quarter were 6.53% of sales, which represented a 115 basis point increase. 
For the year, EBITDA of 8.53% [ph] represented an increase of 76 basis points over 2013. 
Interest expense at $132 million for the quarter leveraged 5 basis points as a percentage of sales. 
Pretax earnings for the quarter were 5.48% of sales. Effective tax rate for Q4 was 34.5%. The lower rate this quarter, relative to the 38.7% [ph] last year, was driven by tax provisions that had inspired but were retroactively extended by Congress for calendar 2014 in the fourth [ph] quarter. 
The tax rate for the quarter was also lower than our expected 36%, resulting in an EPS benefit of $0.01 per share. 
For the year, the effective tax rate is 36.9% compared to 37.8% for 2013. The lower tax rate for the year was the result of the settlement of prior year tax matters. 
Q4 net earnings of $450 million increased 47% versus last year. Earnings per share of $0.46 for the quarter were up 59% to last year. For 2014, earnings per share of $2.71 were up 27% [ph] versus 2013. 
Earnings per share performance for both the fourth quarter and the year represent record highs for the company. 
Transitioning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $466 million. Inventory of $8.9 billion was down $216 million or 2.4% from last year. The decrease was a result of better inventory management and improved sales proceeds from goods. 
Inventory turnover was 3.85, an increase of 11 basis points over last year. 
Asset turnover increased 10 basis points to 1.69. Moving on to liabilities. Accounts payable of $5.1 billion was up $116 million or 2.3% to last year. The increase relates to almost 2-day improvement in days payable outstanding. 
At the end of the fourth quarter, adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR was 2.15 [ph]. Return on invested capital increased 243 basis points to 13.9%. 
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Cash flow from operations was $4.9 billion, an increase of 20% over last year, due to net earnings growth and working capital. Capital expenditures were $880 million, down 6% from last year. 
Free cash flow of $4 billion represented a 20% increase over 2013. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 14.9 million shares for $1 billion through the open-market. 
For the year, we repurchased almost 74 million shares for a total of $3.9 billion. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address Lowe's' business outlook. As Robert noted, economic forecasts suggest modestly stronger growth in the home improvement industry in 2015. While we are optimistic about both the macro forecasts and our improving execution, we've taken a prudent approach to our 2015 outlook. 
For the year, we expect total sales increase of approximately 4.5% to 5%, driven by comp sales increase of 4% [indiscernible] 
[Audio Gap] 
2-year comps will improve sequentially through the year. 
We are anticipating an EBIT increase of 80 to 100 basis points. As I noted during our analyst investor conference in December, we are now targeting 25 to 30 basis points of EBIT expansion [indiscernible] above 1%. While this is our expectation for the year, there will be some choppiness quarter-to-quarter. 
For example, let me offer 2 items that will put pressure on the flow-through for the first quarter. In Q1 last year, we had 70 basis points of gross margin expansion, our strongest quarter of the year. This year, we expect gross margin to be flattish in Q1 while improving roughly 20 basis points for the year. 
Also, in Q1 last year, with our lowest comp and, therefore, reduced bonus accruals. This year, we plan to improve a target levels, resulting in deleverage 25 basis points in Q1 while leveraging roughly 10 basis points for the year. 
We expect that most of the EBIT improvement will come from SG&A. Expense leverage will come in store payroll, marketing, bonus and leveraging our scale to achieve cost savings on indirect spend. 
In addition, we expect a fixed cost leverage  associated with sales growth. 
The effective tax rate is expected to be 38.1%. Higher tax rate relative to 2014 is a result of the settlement of prior year tax matters recognized in Q1 2014. 
A higher tax rate impacts earnings by roughly $0.06 per share. 
For the year, we expect earnings per share of approximately $3.29, which represents a 22.5% increase over 2014. We are forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $5 billion. 
Our capital plan for 2015 is approximately $1.2 billion. 
This results in estimated free cash flow of $3.8 billion for 2015. 
We expect to issue incremental debt during the year as we manage to the 2.25x lease adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR target. 
With approximately $2.4 billion remaining under share repurchase authorization at the end of the fiscal year, our guidance assumes approximately $3.8 billion of share repurchases for 2015. All future share repurchases authorizations are subject to board approval. 
Regina, we're now ready for questions."

Th",666,"Good morning, and thanks for your interest in Lowe's. I'm pleased that we delivered another strong quarter, with comparable sales growth of 7.3%. Comp growth was driven by a 4.9% increase in comp average ticket and a 2.3% increase in comp transactions. The mix of comp ticket and comp transactions was consistent with our expectations.
Comparable sales growth for our U.S. business was 7.4% for the quarter. We saw balanced performance across the country again this quarter, with all 3 divisions, the North, South and West, generating comps within a tight range. In fact, all 14 regions had comps greater than 5%.
Likewise, we reported positive comps in all 12 product categories, and our ProServices business continued its strong performance, with comp sales in line with the company average during the quarter. I'm also pleased to share that our team in Canada delivered double-digit comps in local currency for the seventh consecutive quarter.
We remain focused on improving our profitability even while investing in key capabilities to drive sales growth. For the quarter, we drove 115 basis points of operating margin expansion and earnings per share of $0.46, a 59% increase over last year's fourth quarter. For the year, we delivered comparable sales growth of 4.3% and earnings per share of $2.71, a 27% increase over fiscal 2013.
Delivering on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter, we repurchased $1 billion of stock under our share repurchase program and paid $225 million in dividends. For the year, we repurchased $3.9 billion of stock and paid $822 million in dividends.
As we head into fiscal 2015, macroeconomic fundamentals are aligned for modestly stronger home improvement industry growth. Jobs, incomes, household financial conditions are expected to continue strengthening in 2015, building on the momentum gained in 2014. Coupled with an increase in revolving credit usage, these trends set the stage for higher discretionary consumer spending, and the sharp decline in energy prices should allow consumers to pump less money into their tanks and more into home improvement and other forms of discretionary spending.
Improvements in housing should persist in 2015 as well. Strong income gains, mortgage rates that remain historically low and moderating home price growth should keep home affordability at elevated levels and provide more support for home buying in 2015. Expected growth in the home improvement market is further supported by recent consumer confidence readings and the results of our fourth quarter consumer sentiment survey, which revealed that homeowners' views around personal finances and home values continue to improve. In fact, approximately 1/2 of homeowners now believe the value of their homes is increasing.
Along with the positive progression in sentiment, this quarter, even more homeowners indicated their home improvement spending was increased. And while most of the home improvement projects they have planned are still small ticket, the survey indicated a boost in plans for big-ticket projects versus this time last year.
In 2015, we will continue to focus on a few key priorities to capitalize on opportunities within an improving economy. We'll further pursue top line growth by differentiating ourself through [ph] better customer experiences and improving our product and service offerings for the Pro customer. In addition, we continue developing omni-channel capabilities as part of our long-term commitment to meet customers on their terms whenever and wherever they choose to engage with us.
We also remain committed to improving our productivity and profitability, with opportunities in a few specific areas, including store payroll, marketing and leveraging our scale to get cost savings on indirect spend. These efforts give us confidence in our business outlook for 2015. Bob will share these details in a few minutes.
But first, I would like to thank our more than 265,000 employees for their hard work and dedication. Their steadfast commitment to serving customers is critical to our success and an important driver of this quarter's strong results.
Thanks again for your interest. And with that, let me turn the call over to Rick."

As Robert stated, we delivered strong performance in the quarter, and I'm pleased to share that our store employees earned a record payout from our sales and service employee incentive program. This program rewards store employees for achieving their sales and profitability targets and for delivering outstanding customer service. We continue to capitalize on an improving macro backdrop through our enhanced sales operations planning process, improving relevance with the Pro and expanding customer experience design capabilities.
In the fourth quarter, we used our enhanced Sales & Operations Planning process to coordinate inventory flows, advertising and training around our Celebrate the Season winter campaign. With this campaign, we targeted 4 important shopping occasions: Interior refresh, holiday decorating, gifting and getting organized. For each occasion, our store, logistics, merchandising and marketing teams collaborated to ensure that we had relevant products available to customers at the right time, that they were effectively advertised and strategically promoted to drive traffic and cross merchandise to build the basket.
As a result, we drove both online and in-store transactions and ticket growth, and we fulfilled orders in the most convenient manner for customer. Our ability to sell products from a store, online, in-home or through our contact centers is a distinct competitive advantage that [ph] allows us to engage customers on their terms [ph] whenever and wherever they choose.
We know that, for many projects, more than half of customers research online before making an in-store purchase. And for purchases made on lowes.com, approximately 60% are picked up in-store, 10% are delivered from the store and the remaining 30% are a partial shift. This speaks to our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure with the omni-channel capabilities we are introducing.
From a category standpoint, we drove above company average comps in flooring, kitchen, appliances, lumber, build materials, millwork and outdoor power equipment. We drove company average comps in fashion fixtures, tools and hardware.
Customers are increasingly interested in refreshing the interior and exterior of their homes, so we used targeted promotions, coupled with our investment in project specialists, to drive performance in fashion fixtures, flooring, kitchens, appliances and millwork. We are pleased with the project specialist programs. Currently, we have project specialists who focus on exterior of the home available across all U.S. stores.
Our interior project specialists program has an average ticket above $10,000, and customer satisfaction scores over 15 points higher than the industry standard. So we're expanding it to another 470 stores in 2015, reaching over 3/4 of our stores by year-end. With our ability to coordinate style, provide design expertise and find the right contractor to do the job, we are rapidly becoming the project authority of home improvement.
Within lumber and build materials, we spent -- we met strong unit demand for dimensional and treated lumber with robust inventory depth. We also leveraged our stores' canopy program, in which each market stacks [ph] the most relevant lumber and build materials to be stacked just outside of the Pro entrance under the canopy. This program helps Pros quickly find out inside [ph] lumber, plywood and wall [ph] board, quick out -- quickly check out, receive loading [ph] assistance and get back on the job. 
With outdoor power equipment, we met strong Midwest and Northeast demand for snow throwers. In tools and hardware, we saw a particular strength in power and pneumatic tools, we have a compelling assortment of national tool brands and we've expanded our relationship with Hitachi to include pneumatic tools. Combined with Bostitch, Lowe's now has the #1 and #2 brands, making us the destination for pneumatic tools, particularly for the Pro.
Kichler, the innovative leader in decorative lighting is another important brand for Pro customers. And I'm pleased to announce that we just recently added this leading brand for lighting assortment. The expanded relationships with brands like Hitachi and the additions of brands like Kichler build on a solid foundation to serve the Pro. In fact, 14 consecutive quarters of Pro comps at or above the company average are a testament to this foundation, which includes dedicated service in our stores, inventory depth and our 5 ways [ph] to save value proposition.
Additionally, bill-based [ph] Pro account executives and our national accounts team make it easy for medium- to large-sized companies and government entities to do business with us. We are also completing our beta test of LowesForPros.com, which has been well received by our pilot customers. This dedicated platform is fully transactional and will provide Pros usual functionality such as the ability to develop requisition lists and view the purchase history as well as customized product catalogs.
This site can also be integrated with purchasing systems Pros use to manage their business, further streamlining their day-to-day operations and help with them working more effectively. We have received positive feedback on the site's flexibility and ease of use and expect to make it available to all Pros this spring.
Last quarter, Mike told you about the holiday decor experience we implemented in all of our stores using the stage [ph] created for our outdoor living experience. This stage leverages our largest store format. Developed through a collaboration between our merchants, stores and customer experience design team, the holiday decor experience inspired customers to decorate, raise their awareness of the breadth of our holiday decor and gift offerings and provided solutions -- positive solutions relevant to the holiday macro season.
The customer response was very positive, and we improved sales, inventory sales group and gross margin for the products included in this set. We are now transitioning this space back to our outdoor living experience in preparation for the critical spring selling season.
In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we are focused on driving productivity and profitability. During the quarter, our stores once again effectively managed payroll hours as comp sales accelerated, increasing sales by hour by approximately 5% and driving 28 basis points of payroll expense leverage.
They drove this leverage while maintaining great customer satisfaction stores and best-in-class inventory shrink performance. We are pleased with the progress this year on sales growth, productivity and operating profitability, and we're committed to further improvement in 2015.
In 2015, we expect to drive sales growth as we further capitalize on the improving macro backdrop through increased relevance with the Pro, improved customer experiences and the continued development of omni-channel capabilities. We will increase gross margin by continuing to partner with our vendors to drive innovation and lower first [ph] cost by leveraging our supply chain fixed cost. We will continue to leverage payroll as we further align payroll hours to customer traffic and more efficiently complete noncustomer-facing task.
We will also drive expense productivity as we increase sales by reducing fixed expenses. For example, we will reduce our total marketing spend even while increasing our presence in targeted digital media. And we will obtain further expense efficiency by consolidating the procurement of [indiscernible] business services across our corporate in-store functions.
Likewise, we will increase inventory turns approximately 15 basis points, as we continue to hold the inventory per store flat while increasing comp sales. With solid depth of high-velocity items and job [indiscernible] in place, we will obtain additional inventory productivity as we continue to thoughtfully conduct our line review process.
We are excited about the further improvements we'll make to our business in 2015 and look forward to sharing our progress as the year unfolds. Thank you for interest in Lowe's, and I will now turn the call over to Bob."

Sales for the fourth quarter were $12.5 billion, which represented a 7.6% increase over last year's fourth quarter. Total average ticket increased by 4.9% to $66.17, and total transactions increased 2.5%.
Comp sales were 7.3% in the quarter. As you heard from Rick, further momentum from our initiatives and improving execution drove balanced performance in the quarter. Comp average ticket increased 4.9% and comp transactions increased 2.3%.
Looking at monthly trends. Comps were 6.7% in November, 7.2% in December and 8.2% in January. For the year, total sales were $56.2 billion, an increase of 5.3%, driven by a comp sales increase of 4.3%, a full year of portrait [ph] sales compared with a partial year following the August 2013 acquisition and new stores. For 2014, comp average ticket increased 2.4% and comp transactions increased 1.8%.
Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 34.6% of sales, which is roughly flat to last year. In the quarter, the mix of products sold negatively impacted gross margin by 25 basis points. Also, price actions hurt gross margin by approximately 10 basis points. These items were essentially offset by value improvement and better seasonal sell-through, which helped by 15 and 10 basis points, respectively. For the year, gross margin of 34.79% represented an increase of 20 basis points over 2013.
SG&A for Q4 was 25.24% of sales which leveraged 88 basis points. The SG&A leverage was driven by a variety of factors. In the quarter, store payroll leveraged 28 basis points due to better alignment of hours and customer traffic and strong comp sales. Property tax expense leveraged 21 basis points due to favorability in property valuations recognized this year.
At our analyst conference in December, we noted that expense productivity would come from utilizing our scale to reduce the spend on indirect goods and services. In the quarter, these efforts allowed us to leverage telecommunications and armored car expenses. Also, given the sales growth, we're able to leverage fixed costs. Lastly, we have approximately 30 basis points of expense leverage associated with last year's asset impairments.
These items were offset somewhat by employee interest deleverage of 30 basis points. The higher expenses were driven by both tire and rural [ph] vendor as well as cost inflation.
For the year, SG&A was 23.62% of sales and leveraged 46 basis points versus 2013. Depreciation expense was $362 million for the quarter, which was 2.89% of sales and leveraged 28 basis points. The leverage was driven by higher sales as well as assets becoming fully depreciated.
Earnings before interest and taxes for the quarter were 6.53% of sales, which represented a 115 basis point increase. For the year, EBITDA of 8.53% represented an increase of 76 basis points over 2013. Interest expense at $132 million for the quarter leveraged 5 basis points as a percentage of sales.
Pretax earnings for the quarter were 5.48% of sales. The effective tax rate for Q4 was 34.5%. The lower rate this quarter, relative to the 38.7% last year, was driven by tax provisions that had expired but were retroactively extended by Congress for calendar 2014 in the fourth quarter.
The tax rate for the quarter was also lower than our expected 36%, resulting in an EPS benefit of $0.01 per share. For the year, the effective tax rate is 36.9% compared to 37.8% for 2013. The lower tax rate for the year was the result of the settlement of prior year tax matters.
Q4 net earnings of $450 million increased 47% versus last year. Earnings per share of $0.46 for the quarter were up 59% to last year. For 2014, earnings per share of $2.71 were up 27% versus 2013. The earnings per share performance for both the fourth quarter and the year represent record highs for the company.
Transitioning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $466 million. Inventory of $8.9 billion was down $216 million or 2.4% from last year. The decrease was a result of better inventory management and improved sell-through of seasonal goods. Inventory turnover was 3.85, an increase of 11 basis points over last year. Asset turnover increased 10 basis points to 1.69.
Moving on to liabilities. Accounts payable at $5.1 billion was up $116 million or 2.3% to last year. The increase relates to an almost 2-day improvement in days payable outstanding. At the end of the fourth quarter, lease-adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR was 2.15. Return on invested capital increased 243 basis points to 13.9%.
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Cash flow from operations was $4.9 billion, an increase of 20% over last year due to net earnings growth and working capital. Capital expenditures were $880 million, down 6% from last year. Free cash flow of $4 billion represented a 28% increase over 2013.
During the quarter, we repurchased 14.9 million shares for $1 billion through the open market. For the year, we repurchased almost 74 million shares for a total of $3.9 billion.
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. As Robert noted, economic forecasts suggest modestly stronger growth in the home improvement industry in 2015. While we are optimistic about both the macro forecasts and our improving execution, we've taken a prudent approach to our 2015 outlook.
For the year, we expect total sales increase of approximately 4.5% to 5%, driven by a comp sales increase of 4% to 4.5% in the opening of 15 to 20 stores, which includes 6 [indiscernible] in 2 city center [ph] locations. We expect to report our highest comp in Q1. This is an important quarter for home improvement [indiscernible] compared to last year. While we expect the first half comp to be higher than the second half, we do expect that 2-year comps will improve sequentially through the year. 
We are anticipating an EBIT increase of 80 to 100 basis points. As I noted during our analyst investor conference in December, we are now targeting 25 to 30 basis points of the EBIT expansion per point of comp above 1%. While this is our expectation for the year, there will be some choppiness quarter-to-quarter.
For example, let me offer 2 items that will put pressure on the flow-through for the first quarter. In Q1 last year, we had 70 basis points of gross margin expansion, our strongest quarter of the year. This year, we expect gross margin to be flattish in Q1 while improving roughly 20 basis points for the year. Also, in Q1 last year, we had our lowest comp and therefore, reduced bonus accruals. This year, we plan to accrue to target levels, resulting in a deleverage of 25 basis points in Q1 while leveraging roughly 10 basis points for the year.
We expect that most of the EBIT improvement will come from SG&A. Expense leverage will come in store payroll, marketing, bonus and leveraging our scale to achieve cost savings on indirect spend. In addition, we expect a fixed cost leverage associated with sales growth.
The effective tax rate is expected to be 38.1%. A higher tax rate relative to 2014 is a result of the settlement of prior year tax matters recognized in Q1 2014. A higher tax rate impacts earnings by roughly $0.06 per share.
For the year, we expect earnings per share of approximately $3.29, which represents a 22.5% increase over 2014. We are forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $5 billion. Our capital plan for 2015 is approximately $1.2 billion. This results in estimated free cash flow of $3.8 billion for 2015.
We expect to issue incremental debt during the year as we manage to the 2.25x lease-adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR target. With approximately $2.4 billion remaining under share repurchase authorization at the end of the fiscal year, our guidance assumes approximately $3.8 billion in share repurchases for 2015. All future share repurchase authorizations are subject to board approval.
Regina, we are now ready for questions."

And certainly, there's been a lot of deferred investment, kind of the wish list, the to-do list on the refrigerator. So people are reengaging that. That's what we saw in our survey, where we're starting to see a slight increase in those that are not only taking the discretionary projects on, but also starting to move into larger projects because we're getting confidence in the macroenvironment, confidence in the value of their home. But at end of the day, income on housing are continuing to be the things that drive our business. So there was a little bit of a disconnect in the downturn, but we are seeing consumers reengage.

It was up 25% for the quarter, 2.5% of our total sales for the year. When you look at dot-com, the thing that we're really working on is, as you said, we've been doing online pick up in-store for over a decade. So it's something that we really continue to focus on. Dennis Knowles and the team have done a phenomenal job on store operations and improving the experience on the front end to make it easier for the customers to transact and get the products in and out of store quickly. And it continues to focus on our ability to drive our omni-channel aspects of what we're trying to accomplish and do as an organization, increase that visibility across stores, dot-com, contact centers and on site or in the home. So it's a component of what we're really doing from an overall strategic standpoint. What we've been focused on over the last couple of quarters and in 2014 is really enhancing the experience that the customers have when they jump on our sites. So we've been working on delivery scheduling. You've seen us work on improving our search capabilities and adding several thousand additional search terms to avoid getting back those no search results. We've improved our filtering of products. And we're also working on improving our content -- improved content for 17,000 highly visible items on the site. So we're really looking holistically at the site to make sure that we continue to drive what we are working on. The thing that we're still extremely pleased with is that the store remains very relevant with the customer. And in fact, almost 97%, 98% of all transactions still go through our stores. That's evidenced by the fact that we talk about a 60% pickup, the other 10% delivered and then a large portion of our parcel orders are actually shipped from our stores. So they continue to play a critical role as we leverage that asset and continue to move forward in the future. Mike, I don't know if there's anything that you want to add."

Th",665,"Good morning, and thanks for your interest in Lowe's. I'm pleased that we delivered another strong quarter, with comparable sales growth of 7.3%. Comp growth was driven by a 4.9% increase in comp average ticket and a 2.3% increase in comp transactions. The mix of comp ticket and comp transactions was consistent with our expectations.
Comparable sales growth for our U.S. business was 7.4% for the quarter. We saw balanced performance across the country again this quarter, with all 3 divisions, the North, South and West, generating comps within a tight range. In fact, all 14 regions had comps greater than 5%.
Likewise, we reported positive comps in all 12 product categories, and our ProServices business continued its strong performance, with comp sales in line with the company average during the quarter. I'm also pleased to share that our team in Canada delivered double-digit comps in local currency for the seventh consecutive quarter.
We remain focused on improving our profitability even while investing in key capabilities to drive sales growth. For the quarter, we drove 115 basis points of operating margin expansion and earnings per share of $0.46, a 59% increase over last year's fourth quarter. For the year, we delivered comparable sales growth of 4.3% and earnings per share of $2.71, a 27% increase over fiscal 2013.
Delivering on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter, we repurchased $1 billion of stock under our share repurchase program and paid $225 million in dividends. For the year, we repurchased $3.9 billion of stock and paid $822 million in dividends.
As we head into fiscal 2015, macroeconomic fundamentals are aligned for modestly stronger home improvement industry growth. Jobs, incomes, household financial conditions are expected to continue strengthening in 2015, building on the momentum gained in 2014. Coupled with an increase in revolving credit usage, these trends set the stage for higher discretionary consumer spending. And the sharp decline in energy prices should allow consumers to pump less money into their tanks and more into home improvement and other forms of discretionary spending.
Improvements in housing should persist in 2015 as well. Strong income gains, mortgage rates that remain historically low and moderating home price growth should keep home affordability at elevated levels and provide more support for home buying in 2015. Expected growth in the home improvement market is further supported by recent consumer confidence readings and the results of our fourth quarter consumer sentiment survey, which revealed that homeowners' views around personal finances and home values continue to improve. In fact, approximately 1/2 of homeowners now believe the value of their homes is increasing.
Along with the positive progression in sentiment, this quarter, even more homeowners indicated their home improvement spending was increasing. And while most of the home improvement projects they have planned are still small ticket, the survey indicated a boost in plans for big-ticket projects versus this time last year.
In 2015, we will continue to focus on a few key priorities to capitalize on opportunities within an improving economy. We'll further pursue top line growth by differentiating ourself through better customer experiences and improving our product and service offerings for the Pro customer. In addition, we continue developing omni-channel capabilities as part of our long-term commitment to meet customers on their terms, whenever and wherever they choose to engage with us.
We also remain committed to improving our productivity and profitability, with opportunities in a few specific areas, including store payroll, marketing and leveraging our scale to get cost savings on indirect spend. These efforts give us confidence in our business outlook for 2015. Bob will share these details in a few minutes.
But first, I would like to thank our more than 265,000 employees for their hard work and dedication. Their steadfast commitment to serving customers is critical to our success and an important driver of this quarter's strong results.
Thanks again for your interest. And with that, let me turn the call over to Rick."

As Robert stated, we delivered strong performance in the quarter, and I'm pleased to share that our store employees earned a record payout from our Sales Service Employee Incentive program. This program rewards store employees for achieving their sales and profitability targets and for delivering outstanding customer service. We continue to capitalize on an improving macro backdrop through our enhanced sales operations planning process, improving relevance with the Pro and expanding customer experience design capabilities.
In the fourth quarter, we used our enhanced Sales & Operations Planning process to coordinate inventory flows, advertising and training around our Celebrate the Season winter campaign. With this campaign, we targeted 4 important shopping occasions: interior refresh, holiday decorating, gifting and getting organized. For each occasion, our store, logistics, merchandising and marketing teams collaborated to ensure that we had relevant products available to customers at the right time, that they were effectively advertised and strategically promoted to drive traffic and cross merchandise to build the basket.
As a result, we drove both online and in-store transactions and ticket growth, and we fulfilled orders in the most convenient manner for customers. Our ability to sell products from a store, online, in-home or through our contact centers is a distinct competitive advantage because it allows us to engage customers on their terms, whenever and wherever they choose.
We know that for many projects, more than half of customers research online before making an in-store purchase. And for purchases made on lowes.com, approximately 60% are picked up in-store, 10% are delivered from the store and the remaining 30% are parcel shipped. This speaks to our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure with the omni-channel capabilities we are introducing.
From a category standpoint, we drove above-company-average comps in flooring, kitchen, appliances, lumber, building materials, millwork and outdoor power equipment. We drove company average comps in fashion fixtures, tools and hardware.
Customers are increasingly interested in refreshing the interior and exterior of their homes, so we used targeted promotions, coupled with our investment in Project Specialists, to drive performance in fashion fixtures, flooring, kitchens, appliances and millwork. We are pleased with the Project Specialist programs. Currently, we have Project Specialists who focus on exterior of the home available across all U.S. stores.
Our interior Project Specialists program has an average ticket above $10,000, and customer satisfaction scores over 15 points higher than the industry standard. So we're expanding it to another 470 stores in 2015, reaching over 3/4 of our stores by year-end. With our ability to coordinate style, provide design expertise and find the right contractor to do the job, we are rapidly becoming the project authority of home improvement.
Within lumber and building materials, we spent -- we met strong unit demand for dimensional and treated lumber with robust inventory depth. We also leveraged our stores' canopy program, in which each market selects the most relevant lumber and build materials to be stacked just outside of the Pro entrance under the canopy. This program helps Pros quickly find items like lumber, plywood and wall board, quick out -- quickly check out, receive loading assistance and get back on the job. 
With outdoor power equipment, we met strong Midwest and Northeast demand for snow throwers. In tools and hardware, we saw a particular strength in power and pneumatic tools, we have a compelling assortment of national tool brands and we've expanded our relationship with Hitachi to include pneumatic tools. Combined with Bostitch, Lowe's now has the #1 and #2 brands, making us the destination for pneumatic tools, particularly for the Pro.
Kichler, the innovative leader in decorative lighting, is another important brand for Pro customers. And I'm pleased to announce that we just recently added this leading brand to our lighting assortment. The expanded relationships with brands like Hitachi and the additions of brands like Kichler build on a solid foundation to serve the Pro. In fact, 14 consecutive quarters of Pro comps at or above the company average are a testament to this foundation, which includes dedicated service in our stores, inventory depth and our ""5 ways to save"" value proposition.
Additionally, bill-based [ph] Pro account executives and our national accounts team make it easy for medium- to large-sized companies and government entities to do business with us. We are also completing our beta test of LowesForPros.com, which has been well received by our pilot customers. This dedicated platform is fully transactional and will provide Pros useful functionality such as the ability to develop requisition lists and view the purchase history as well as customized product catalogs.
This site can also be integrated with purchasing systems Pros use to manage their business, further streamlining their day-to-day operations and help with them working more effectively. We have received positive feedback on the site's flexibility and ease of use and expect to make it available to all Pros this spring.
Last quarter, Mike told you about the holiday decor experience we implemented in all of our stores using the stage created for our outdoor living experience. This stage leverages our largest store format. Developed through a collaboration between our merchants, stores and customer experience design team, the holiday decor experience inspired customers to decorate, raise their awareness of the breadth of our holiday decor and gift offerings and provided solutions -- positive solutions relevant to the holiday micro season.
The customer response was very positive, and we improved sales, inventory sell-through and gross margin for the products included in this set. We are now transitioning this space back to our outdoor living experience in preparation for the critical spring selling season.
In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we are focused on driving productivity and profitability. During the quarter, our stores once again effectively managed payroll hours as comp sales accelerated, increasing sales by hour by approximately 5% and driving 28 basis points of payroll expense leverage.
They drove this leverage while maintaining great customer satisfaction scores and best-in-class inventory shrink performance. We are pleased with the progress this year on sales growth, productivity and operating profitability, and we're committed to further improvement in 2015.
In 2015, we expect to drive sales growth as we further capitalize on the improving macro backdrop through increased relevance with the Pro, improved customer experiences and the continued development of omni-channel capabilities. We will increase gross margin by continuing to partner with our vendors to drive innovation and lower first costs by leveraging our supply chain fixed cost. We will continue to leverage payroll as we further align payroll hours to customer traffic and more efficiently complete noncustomer-facing tasks.
We will also drive expense productivity as we increase sales by reducing fixed expenses. For example, we will reduce our total marketing spend even while increasing our presence in targeted digital media. And we will obtain further expense efficiency by consolidating the procurement of [indiscernible] business services across our corporate in-store functions.
Likewise, we will increase inventory turns approximately 15 basis points, as we continue to hold the inventory per store flat while increasing comp sales. With solid depth of high-velocity items and job lot quantities in place, we will obtain additional inventory productivity as we continue to thoughtfully conduct our line review process.
We are excited about the further improvements we'll make to our business in 2015 and look forward to sharing our progress as the year unfolds. Thank you for interest in Lowe's, and I will now turn the call over to Bob."

Sales for the fourth quarter were $12.5 billion, which represented a 7.6% increase over last year's fourth quarter. Total average ticket increased by 4.9% to $66.17, and total transactions increased 2.5%.
Comp sales were 7.3% in the quarter. As you heard from Rick, further momentum from our initiatives and improving execution drove balanced performance in the quarter. Comp average ticket increased 4.9% and comp transactions increased 2.3%.
Looking at monthly trends. Comps were 6.7% in November, 7.2% in December and 8.2% in January. For the year, total sales were $56.2 billion, an increase of 5.3%, driven by a comp sales increase of 4.3%, a full year of Orchard sales compared with a partial year following the August 2013 acquisition and new stores. For 2014, comp average ticket increased 2.4% and comp transactions increased 1.8%.
Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 34.6% of sales, which is roughly flat to last year. In the quarter, the mix of products sold negatively impacted gross margin by 25 basis points. Also, price actions hurt gross margin by approximately 10 basis points. These items were essentially offset by value improvement and better seasonal sell-through, which helped by 15 and 10 basis points, respectively. For the year, gross margin of 34.79% represented an increase of 20 basis points over 2013.
SG&A for Q4 was 25.24% of sales, which leveraged 88 basis points. The SG&A leverage was driven by a variety of factors. In the quarter, store payroll leveraged 28 basis points due to better alignment of hours and customer traffic and strong comp sales. Property tax expense leveraged 21 basis points due to favorability in property valuations recognized this year.
At our analyst conference in December, we noted that expense productivity would come from utilizing our scale to reduce the spend on indirect goods and services. In the quarter, these efforts allowed us to leverage telecommunications and armored car expenses. Also, given the sales growth, we're able to leverage fixed costs. Lastly, we have approximately 30 basis points of expense leverage associated with last year's asset impairments.
These items were offset somewhat by employee interest deleverage of 30 basis points. The higher expenses were driven by both higher enrollment as well as cost inflation.
For the year, SG&A was 23.62% of sales and leveraged 46 basis points versus 2013. Depreciation expense was $362 million for the quarter, which was 2.89% of sales and leveraged 28 basis points. The leverage was driven by higher sales as well as assets becoming fully depreciated.
Earnings before interest and taxes for the quarter were 6.53% of sales, which represented a 115-basis-point increase. For the year, EBITDA of 8.53% represented an increase of 76 basis points over 2013. Interest expense at $132 million for the quarter leveraged 5 basis points as a percentage of sales.
Pretax earnings for the quarter were 5.48% of sales. The effective tax rate for Q4 was 34.5%. The lower rate this quarter, relative to the 38.7% last year, was driven by tax provisions that had expired but were retroactively extended by Congress for calendar 2014 in the fourth quarter.
The tax rate for the quarter was also lower than our expected 36%, resulting in an EPS benefit of $0.01 per share. For the year, the effective tax rate is 36.9% compared to 37.8% for 2013. The lower tax rate for the year was the result of the settlement of prior year tax matters.
Q4 net earnings of $450 million increased 47% versus last year. Earnings per share of $0.46 for the quarter were up 59% to last year. For 2014, earnings per share of $2.71 were up 27% versus 2013. The earnings per share performance for both the fourth quarter and the year represent record highs for the company.
Transitioning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $466 million. Inventory of $8.9 billion was down $216 million or 2.4% from last year. The decrease was a result of better inventory management and improved sell-through of seasonal goods. Inventory turnover was 3.85, an increase of 11 basis points over last year. Asset turnover increased 10 basis points to 1.69.
Moving on to liabilities. Accounts payable at $5.1 billion was up $116 million or 2.3% to last year. The increase relates to an almost 2-day improvement in days payable outstanding. At the end of the fourth quarter, lease-adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR was 2.15. Return on invested capital increased 243 basis points to 13.9%.
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Cash flow from operations was $4.9 billion, an increase of 20% over last year due to net earnings growth and working capital. Capital expenditures were $880 million, down 6% from last year. Free cash flow of $4 billion represented a 28% increase over 2013.
During the quarter, we repurchased 14.9 million shares for $1 billion through the open market. For the year, we repurchased almost 74 million shares for a total of $3.9 billion.
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. As Robert noted, economic forecasts suggest modestly stronger growth in the home improvement industry in 2015. While we are optimistic about both the macro forecasts and our improving execution, we've taken a prudent approach to our 2015 outlook.
For the year, we expect total sales increase of approximately 4.5% to 5%, driven by a comp sales increase of 4% to 4.5% and the opening of 15 to 20 stores, which includes 6 Orchard and 2 city center [ph] locations. We expect to report our highest comp in Q1. This is an important quarter for home improvement and the easiest compared to last year. While we expect the first half comp to be higher than the second half, we do expect that 2-year comps will improve sequentially through the year. 
We are anticipating an EBIT increase of 80 to 100 basis points. As I noted during our analyst investor conference in December, we are now targeting 25 to 30 basis points of the EBIT expansion per point of comp above 1%. While this is our expectation for the year, there will be some choppiness quarter-to-quarter.
For example, let me offer 2 items that will put pressure on the flow-through for the first quarter. In Q1 last year, we had 70 basis points of gross margin expansion, our strongest quarter of the year. This year, we expect gross margin to be flattish in Q1 while improving roughly 20 basis points for the year. Also, in Q1 last year, we had our lowest comp and therefore, reduced bonus accruals. This year, we plan to accrue to target levels, resulting in a deleverage of 25 basis points in Q1 while leveraging roughly 10 basis points for the year.
We expect that most of the EBIT improvement will come from SG&A. Expense leverage will come in store payroll, marketing, bonus and leveraging our scale to achieve cost savings on indirect spend. In addition, we expect a fixed cost leverage associated with sales growth.
The effective tax rate is expected to be 38.1%. A higher tax rate relative to 2014 is a result of the settlement of prior year tax matters recognized in Q1 2014. The higher tax rate impacts earnings by roughly $0.06 per share.
For the year, we expect earnings per share of approximately $3.29, which represents a 22.5% increase over 2014. We are forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $5 billion. Our capital plan for 2015 is approximately $1.2 billion. This results in estimated free cash flow of $3.8 billion for 2015.
We expect to issue incremental debt during the year as we manage to the 2.25x lease-adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR target. We have approximately $2.4 billion remaining under share repurchase authorization at the end of the fiscal year. Our guidance assumes approximately $3.8 billion in share repurchases for 2015. All future share repurchase authorizations are subject to board approval.
Regina, we are now ready for questions."

And certainly, there's been a lot of deferred investment, kind of the wish list, the to-do list on the refrigerator. So people are reengaging in that. That's what we saw in our survey, where we're starting to see a slight increase in those that are not only taking the discretionary projects on, but also starting to move into larger projects because they're getting confidence in the macroenvironment, confidence in the value of their home. But at end of the day, income and housing are continuing to be the things that drive our business. So there was a little bit of a disconnect in the downturn, but we are seeing consumers reengage.

Dennis Knowles and the team have done a phenomenal job on store operations and improving the experience on the front end to make it easier for the customers to transact and get the products in and out of store quickly.

So we've been working on delivery scheduling. You've seen us work on improving our search capabilities and adding several thousand additional search terms to avoid getting back those no search results. We've improved our filtering of products. And we're also working on improving our content -- improved content for 17,000 highly visible items on the site. So we're really looking holistically at the site to make sure that we continue to drive what we are working on. The thing that we're still extremely pleased with is that the store remains very relevant with the customer. And in fact, almost 97%, 98% of all transactions still go through our stores.

We're also very careful to make sure that as we tie back our merchandising approaches, that we're leaning into both what's important from a pricing perspective as well was what's important from an online perspective. To Rick's point earlier, a couple of brands have been added, Progress Lighting and Kichler Lighting will be featured online, and our online tools will help them both make selections and ship to the home or make selections and come into our stores and see that product and make the selection.

I'm pleased that we delivered another strong quarter, with comparable sales growth of 5.2%. Comp growth was driven by a 2.9% increase in comp average ticket and a 2.2% increase in comp transactions. Th",650,"Good morning, and thanks for your interest in Lowe's. I'm pleased that we delivered another strong quarter, with comparable sales growth of 5.2%. Comp growth was driven by a 2.9% increase in comp average ticket and a 2.2% increase in comp transactions. The team executed our plan and collaborated across the organization to respond to challenges. We employed a coordinated effort to stagger our spring Black Friday events with a control of cadence, as Mike will describe further, and we were well prepared to meet customers' needs for the season. 
Our ability to adapt to difficult operating conditions was tested by the prolonged labor dispute at West Coast ports, and I'm pleased with the team's diligent effort to minimize the impact these challenges created. I would like to thank our more than 265,000 employees in the field and our support centers for their hard work and dedication to serving customers. 
Comparable sales growth for our U.S. home improvement business was 5.3% for the quarter. And while we saw a stronger performance in areas of country where weather was more favorable, specifically in the West and in Florida, all 14 regions generated positive comps. 
Additionally, our team in Canada delivered their eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit comps in local currency and their highest quarterly comp performance since we entered the market in 2007.
We recorded positive comps in all 13 product categories, with particular strength in appliances as well as seasonal categories, including outdoor power equipment and seasonal living. 
We remain focused on improving our profitability even while investing in key capabilities to drive our sales growth. For the quarter, we drove 76 basis points of operating margin expansion despite experiencing some discrete pressures, as Bob will detail. And we delivered earnings per share of $0.70, a 15% increase over last year's first quarter, which was in line with our expectations. 
Delivering our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter, we repurchased $1 billion of stock under our share repurchase program and paid $222 million in dividends. 
Looking at the balance of the year from an economic perspective. Key drivers of home improvement industry growth, job and income growth, home buying and home price appreciation remains aligned for modestly stronger industry growth. At the same time, lower energy prices should fuel strong consumer spending in 2015. 
We continuously see steady recovery within the housing market, including positive trends in turnover and moderate home price appreciation as measured by the FHFA, the broadest measure of home price growth, which is more in line with our store footprint.
We're also encouraged by the results of our first quarter Consumer Sentiment Survey, where we continue to see homeowners' views around personal finances and home values improved. According to the survey, homeowners are shifting more of their spending to home improvement. As a result, their intentions to begin a home improvement project in the next 6 months were the highest in 6 years, and these planned projects are now almost evenly split between discretionary and nondiscretionary. 
Our key priorities in 2015 should allow us to capitalize on our opportunities with an improving economy. We're pursuing further top line growth but differentiating ourselves with better customer experiences and improving our product and service offering for the Pro customer. 
We also remain committed to improving our productivity and profitability with opportunities in that key specific areas, including store payroll, marketing and leveraging our scale to get cost savings on indirect spend. 
In addition, we continue developing omni-channel capabilities as part of our long-term commitment to meet customers on their terms whenever and wherever they choose to engage with us. 
The execution of our strategic priorities, alongside an improving microeconomic backdrop, together with our keen focus on productivity and profitability, give us confidence in our business outlook for 2015. 
Thanks again for your interest. And with that, let me turn the call over to Mike."

We executed well in the first quarter, growing both average ticket and transactions. We drove traffic to our stores to our Spring Black Friday event, aligned to the expected arrivals of spring from the deep South to the North. 
To ensure our stores are ready to provide inspiration, information and products to customers, we use our enhanced Sales & Operations Planning process to coordinate inventory flow, advertising, product displays and training. And while the situation at the West Coast ports add a complexity towards spring preparation, our transportation and logistics teams successfully collaborated to reroute product to other ports. As a result, our in-stock levels remain high. In fact, sales in our seasonal living category, which includes our highest concentration of imported product such as patios and grills, exceeded expectations. 
We are pleased with our first quarter results, notwithstanding some weather-driven softness. Keep in mind that the outdoor selling season extends well past from Memorial Day. To this point, in the second quarter, sales have exceeded our expectations. So we remain confident in the full year guidance we provided last quarter. 
Looking at category performance. We recorded above company average comps in appliances, outdoor power equipment and seasonal living. We achieved double-digit comps in outdoor power equipment, as [indiscernible] and riding mowers drove strong performance in the West and South. We offer a wide range of mowers so customers maintain their yards, and we continue to provide compelling and exclusive innovations like our home exclusive [indiscernible] all-wheel drive mower and our recently launched Troy-Bilt Flex product. 
The outdoor living we introduced last year drove high single-digit comps in our seasonal living product category and across all 3 geographic divisions. This particular customer experience most benefits our patio and outdoor fashion areas, which acquired strong comps again this quarter over double-digit comps last year. We continue to see strong sales of patio furniture and robust attachment of replacement cushions and other outdoor accessories. 
As a reminder, to create our outdoor living experience, we took advantage of our largest store format to produce a fill, which included removing 15 base of steel racking and opening up 35% more space for curated style. Though customers envision and create the outdoor space, we display patio sets for coordinating rugs, umbrellas and accessories by pillows, implanters, along with grills and other outdoor products, just as you expect to see in your own backyard. We're very pleased with the continued performance of our outdoor living experience. 
In appliances, we drove double-digit comps for the second consecutive quarter. Lowe's offers leading appliance brands such as Whirlpool, KitchenAid, Bosch, Samsung, LG, Electrolux, Frigidaire and GE. And we further strengthened our offering with the home channel exclusive launch of the Frigidaire Pro appliance series. For customers who aspire to have a look and feel of commercial-grade appliances in their home, this exciting launch provides great value with high-end commercial-like aesthetics and quality at an accessible price point. 
In addition to great brands, we provide service advantages of next-day delivery and haul away as well as in-house facilitation of repairs and maintenance. 
To further enhance on appliance shopping experience, towards the end of last year, we worked with our vendor partners to introduce 17 kitchen suites to each door. Each suite includes 4 coordinated appliances: a refrigerator, a range, a microwave and a dishwasher. This suites of customers quickly visualize how a full set of new appliances will look in their existing or remodeled kitchen. 
We're also excited about HGTV HOME by Sherwin Williams, an exclusive for Lowe's in the home channel. This is the first time in more than 40 years that Sherwin Williams-branded products are available to another retailer. 
The brand is the #1 purchase driver on paint, and Sherwin Williams is the most recognized brand. We expect the addition of HGTV HOME by Sherwin Williams to appeal to both DIY and Pro customers. Its long-standing reputation for quality as well as the color expertise of HGTV allows Lowe's to offer customers the top brands they trust for their next paint project. 
We announced this exciting addition in December and set product in all stores by the end of April. Earlier this month, we launched a full national advertising campaign, in conjunction with Sherwin Williams, and digital, TV and print. 
Early customer response is Home Center exclusive brand and to the HGTV curated color set has been positive. Supporting our omni-channel approach to retailing, we are cross-merchandising the Sherwin Williams brand in key areas throughout the store like kitchen vignettes, [indiscernible] and home decor while also leveraging our color visualizer on lowes.com. This visualizer helps customers find the perfect color for the walls by virtually painting their own home or experimenting with a simple room. [indiscernible] order a paint sample for shipment directly to the home or come to our stores for together with a specialist. 
Combined with our outstanding Valspar and EPG Olympic brand partnerships, we expect to grow traffic to our stores and increase overall market share in paint. 
We also continue to strengthen our portfolio of Pro-focused brands. We recently finished rolling up brands such as Go Block Masonry tools, GAF roofing and Owens Corning insulation. And we continue to collect feedback from our Pro customers and store employees to identify other local and national brands that best meet the needs of Pro customers.
Along with strengthening our brand portfolio, we recently made the new LowesForPros.com site available to all Pro customers. Our focus on brands as well as our recent relaunch of LowesForPros.com are part of a broader commitment to build on our strong foundation for the Pro. This foundation includes dedicated service in our stores, inventory depth aligned with the needs of the Pro and our ""5 ways to save"" value proposition. And our fill-based Pro account executives and national accounts team make it easy for medium to large-sized companies and government entities to do business with us. 
In addition to our advocacy to drive top line growth, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability. For the quarter, even with double-digit growth in categories like appliances and outdoor products, we maintained a flat gross margin rate, demonstrating our ability to drive profitability while capitalizing on big-ticket market share opportunities. 
We accomplished this by continuing to partner with our vendors to drive innovation and improve first cost and by leveraging supply-chain fixed cost. Our stores once again effectively managed payroll hours on solid comp sales growth, increasing sales per hour by approximately 4% and driving 15 basis points of payroll expense leverage. They drove this while achieving record customer satisfaction scores and best-in-class inventory performance. 
We also drove productivity in marketing by increasing our presence in targeted digital media and leveraging our investment in MyLowe's. And we're continuing to identify implement additional expense efficiencies throughout the year by consolidating the procurement of summer types of goods and services across our corporate in-store functions. Likewise, with solid depth of high-velocity items and job-like quantities in place and through a continued application of improved analytics to a thoughtful line review process, we're able to hold our inventory per store roughly flat and increase inventory turns by 17 basis points. 
As you can see, we are pleased with our first quarter results and the progress we're making on our initiatives to drive top line growth, productivity and profitability. And we look forward to sharing further progress with you over the course of the year. 
Thank you for interest in Lowe's, and I'll now turn it over to Bob."

Sales for the first quarter were $14.1 billion, an increase of 5.4%. Total average ticket increased 3% to $66.63, and total transaction account increased 2.3%.
As discussed on our fourth quarter call, we had planned for normal weather, and thus, for Q1, we had highest comping quarter of the year. In fact, weather in the Northeast was colder than normal and colder than last year, while the West and Florida experienced the opposite. Therefore, the net impact of weather year-over-year was not the tailwind we expected. As a result, our sales for the quarter were slightly below our expectations, but we're still confident in our outlook for the year.
Comp sales increased 5.2%, as comp average ticket grew by 2.9% and comp transactions were up 2.2%.
Looking at monthly trends. Comps were 5.1% in February, 6.6% in March and 3.8% in April. 
Gross margin for the first quarter was 35.47% of sales, essentially flat to last year and in line with our expectations, with positive rate movement from value improvement, which is offset by 15 basis points of pressure from the mix of products sold. 
SG&A for Q1 is 24.16% of sales, which leveraged 60 [ph] basis points. The expense leverage was driven by advertising, store payroll and impairment. 
Advertising leveraged 25 basis points, driven by the efforts to improve productivity that [indiscernible]. 
Store payroll leveraged 13 basis points, as we continue to optimize our staffing model. 
In the quarter, we had $8 million of long-life asset impairment compared with $23 million in last year's first quarter, resulting in 11 basis points of leverage. Also, there were numerous expenses that leveraged between 5 and 10 basis points in Q1. These items were somewhat offset by bonus, which deleveraged 35 basis points. Our bonus accruals are based on actual performance to date relative to plan. 
Record customer satisfaction scores, coupled with solid Q1 performance this year relative to a tough first quarter last year, resulted in higher bonus expense and, therefore, deleveraged year-over-year. 
Depreciation for the quarter was $365 million, which was 2.59% of sales and leveraged 19 basis points compared to last year's first quarter as a result of higher sales and assets becoming fully depreciated. 
Earnings before interest and taxes increased 76 basis points to 8.72% of sales. On our Q4 call, we discussed the pressure that gross margin and bonus expense would have on first quarter's flow-through. The 18 basis points of flow-through [indiscernible] comp of a 1% [ph] in Q1 was modestly better than our expectations coming into the quarter. 
Interest expense at $134 million for the quarter deleveraged 2 basis points to last year, as total debt increased $1.2 billion versus first quarter of 2014.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.7%, which was higher than the fourth quarter due to the expiration of certain tax provisions. The higher rate relative to the last year was primarily due to a tax settlement in Q1 2014 and negatively impacted first quarter earnings per share comparisons to last year by approximately $0.06. 
Earnings per share of $0.70 for the quarter was in line with our expectations and represented a 14.8% increase over last year's $0.61. 
Now a few items on the balance sheet, starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter was $1.4 billion. Our first quarter inventory balance of $10.6 billion increased $99 million or 9/10 of a percent over Q1 of last year. 
Inventory turnover was 3.78, an increase of 17 basis points over Q1 2014. Asset turnover increased 11 basis points to 1.7. 
Moving on to liability section of the balance sheet. Accounts payable of $8 billion increased $972 million or 13.8% over Q1 last year. The increase in accounts payable is due to the timing of purchases in the quarter versus last year. 
At the end of the first quarter, lease adjusted debt EBITDAR was 2.11. 
Return on invested capital increased 232 basis points for the quarter to 14.34%. 
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Operating cash flow was almost $2.5 billion. Capital expenditures were $232 million, resulting in free cash flow of over $2.2 billion. Free cash flow was $446 billion or 24.8% over the same period last year. 
In the quarter, we repurchased 13.6 million shares for $1 billion. Our board also approved a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization. At quarter-end, we had approximately $6.4 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. 
The remaining $109 million of share repurchase, as the shown on statement of cash flows, links the shares withheld from employees to satisfy statutory tax withholding liabilities as well as the timing of share repurchase settlement across borders. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's' business outlook. As Robert noted, economic forecasts remain aligned for modestly stronger home improvement industry growth in 2015. While we are optimistic about both the macro forecast and our improving execution, we continue to take a prudent approach for our 2015 outlook. 
For the year, we expect the total sales increase of approximately $4.5 billion to 5%, driven by comp sales increase of 4% to 4.5% and the opening of 15 to 20 stores, which include 6 Orchard and 2 city center locations. 
We're anticipating an EBIT increase of 80 to 100 basis points and are targeting 25 to 30 basis points of EBIT expansion per [indiscernible] comp above [ph] 1%. While this is our expectation for the year, there will be some choppiness in quarter-to-quarter. 
Specific to the second quarter, there'll be some gross margin pressure associated with the additional costs related to the West Coast port issue as well as one more port impact from increased promotional intensity that began on Labor Day last year. 
For the year, we expect that most of the EBIT approval come from SG&A. Expense leverage will come from store payroll, marketing, bonus and leveraging our scale to achieve cost savings on indirect spend. In addition, we expect fixed cost leverage associated with sales growth. 
The effective tax rate is expected to be 38.1%. The higher rate relative to 2014 is a result of the settlement of prior tax matters recognized in Q1 2014. 
The higher tax rate impacts earnings growth by roughly $0.06 per share. 
For the year, we expect earnings per share of approximately $3.29, which represents an increase of 21.4% over 2014. 
We are forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $5.1 billion. Our capital forecast for 2015 is now approximately $1.4 billion, which is roughly $200 million higher than planned as a result of acquiring certain target assets in Canada. 
This results in estimated free cash flow of $3.7 billion for 2015. 
We expect to issue incremental debt during the year as we managed to the 2.25x lease adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR target. Our guidance assumes approximately $3.8 billion in share repurchases for 2015. 
Regine, we're now ready for questions."

We introduced new 360 product views to about 11,500 of our highest viewed items, which gives customers the complete view of the item across all aspects. We also introduced product videos to 214 different items that enhance the video capabilities of the customer to actually see the site, CBI item and actually interact with them to a greater degree.

I am pleased that we've delivered another strong quarter with comparable sales growth of 5.2%. Comp growth was driven by a 2.9% increase in comp average ticket and a 2.2% increase in comp transactions.",651,"Good morning, and thanks for your interest in Lowe's. I am pleased that we've delivered another strong quarter with comparable sales growth of 5.2%. Comp growth was driven by a 2.9% increase in comp average ticket and a 2.2% increase in comp transactions. The team executed our plan and collaborated across the organization to respond to challenges. We employed a coordinated effort to stagger our Spring Black Friday events with a controlled cadence, as Mike will describe further, and we were well prepared to meet customers' needs for the season. 
Our ability to adapt to difficult operating conditions was tested by the prolonged labor dispute at West Coast ports. And I'm pleased with the team's diligent effort to minimize the impact these challenges created. I would like to thank our more than 265,000 employees in the field and at our support centers for their hard work and dedication to serving customers. 
Comparable sales growth for our U.S. home improvement business was 5.3% for the quarter. And while we saw stronger performance in areas of the country where weather was more favorable, specifically in the West and in Florida, all 14 regions generated positive comps. Additionally, our team in Canada delivered their eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit comps in local currency and their highest quarterly comp performance since we entered the market in 2007. We recorded positive comps in all 13 product categories with particular strength in appliances as well as seasonal categories, including outdoor power equipment and seasonal living. 
We remain focused on improving our profitability even while investing in key capabilities to drive our sales growth. For the quarter, we drove 76 basis points of operating margin expansion despite experiencing some discrete pressures, as Bob will detail. And we delivered earnings per share of $0.70, a 15% increase over last year's first quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Delivering our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter, we repurchased $1 billion of stock under our share repurchase program and paid $222 million in dividends. 
Looking at the balance of the year from an economic perspective. Key drivers of home improvement industry growth, job and income growth, home buying and home price appreciation remain aligned for modestly stronger industry growth. At the same time, lower energy prices should fuel stronger consumer spending in 2015. We continue to see steady recovery within the housing market, including positive trends in turnover and moderate home price appreciation as measured by the FHFA, the broadest measure of home price growth, which is more in line with our store footprint.
We're also encouraged by the results of our first quarter Consumer Sentiment Survey, where we continue to see homeowners' views around personal finances and home values improve. According to the survey, homeowners are shifting more of their spending to home improvement. As a result, their intentions to begin a home improvement project in the next 6 months were the highest in 6 years. And these planned projects are now almost evenly split between discretionary and nondiscretionary. 
Our key priorities in 2015 should allow us to capitalize on opportunities with an improving economy. We're pursuing further top line growth by differentiating ourselves with better customer experiences and improving our product and service offering for the Pro customer. We also remain committed to improving our productivity and profitability with opportunities in the key specific areas, including store payroll, marketing and leveraging our scale to get cost savings on indirect spend. In addition, we continue developing omni-channel capabilities as part of our long-term commitment to meet customers on their terms whenever and wherever they choose to engage with us. 
The execution of our strategic priorities, alongside an improving macroeconomic backdrop, together with a keen focus on productivity and profitability, give us confidence in our business outlook for 2015. Thanks again for your interest. And with that, let me turn the call over to Mike."

We executed well in the first quarter, growing both average ticket and transactions. We drove traffic to our stores to our Spring Black Friday event, aligned to the expected arrival of spring from the Deep South to the North. To ensure our stores are ready to provide inspiration, information and products to customers, we use our enhanced Sales & Operations Planning process to coordinate inventory flow, advertising, product displays and training. 
And while the situation at the West Coast ports add a complexity to our spring preparation, our transportation and logistics teams successfully collaborated to reroute product to other ports. As a result, our in-stock levels remain high. In fact, sales in our seasonal living category, which includes our highest concentration of imported product, such as patios and grills, exceeded expectations. 
We are pleased with our first quarter results, notwithstanding some weather-driven softness. Keep in mind that the outdoor selling season extends well past Memorial Day. To this point, in the second quarter, sales have exceeded our expectations. So we remain confident in the full year guidance we provided last quarter. 
Looking at category performance. We recorded above company average comps in appliances, outdoor power equipment and seasonal living. We achieved double-digit comps in outdoor power equipment as walk-behind and riding mowers drove strong performance in the West and South. We offer a wide range of mowers to help customers maintain their yards. And we continue to provide compelling and exclusive innovations, like our home channel exclusive Husqvarna All-Wheel Drive mower and our recently launched Troy-Bilt Flex product. 
The outdoor living experience we introduced last year drove high single-digit comps in our seasonal living product category and across all 3 geographical divisions. This particular customer experience most benefits our patio and outdoor fashion areas, which recorded strong comps again this quarter over double-digit comps last year. We continue to see strong sales of patio furniture and robust attachment of replacement cushions and other outdoor accessories. As a reminder, to create our outdoor living experience, we took advantage of our largest store format to produce a show-and-feel, which included removing 15 bays of steel racking and opening up 35% more space for curated style. To help customers envision and create their outdoor space, we displayed patio sets with coordinating rugs, umbrellas and accessories like pillows, implanters, along with grills and other outdoor products, just as you would expect to see in your own backyard. We're very pleased with the continued performance of our outdoor living experience. 
In appliances, we drove double-digit comps for the second consecutive quarter. Lowe's offers leading appliance brands, such as Whirlpool, Kitchenaid, Bosch, Samsung, LG, Electrolux, Frigidaire and GE. And we've further strengthened our offering with the home channel exclusive launch of the Frigidaire Pro appliance series. For customers who aspire to have the look and feel of commercial-grade appliances in their home, this exciting launch provides great value with high-end commercial-like aesthetics and quality at an accessible price point. In addition to great brands, we provide service advantages of next-day delivery and haul-away as well as in-house facilitation of repairs and maintenance. To further enhance on appliance shopping experience, towards the end of last year, we worked with our vendor partners to introduce 17 kitchen suites to each store. Each suite includes 4 coordinated appliances: a refrigerator, a range, a microwave and a dishwasher. These suites help customers quickly visualize how a fuller set of new appliances will look in their existing or remodeled kitchen. 
We're also excited about HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams, an exclusive for Lowe's in the home channel. This is the first time in more than 40 years that Sherwin-Williams-branded products are available to another retailer. Brand is the #1 purchase driver in paint and Sherwin Williams is the most recognized brand. We expect the addition of HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams to appeal to both DIY and Pro customers. Its long-standing reputation for quality as well as the color expertise of HGTV allows Lowe's to offer customers the top brands they trust for their next paint project. We announced this exciting addition in December and set product in all stores by the end of April. 
Earlier this month, we launched a full national advertising campaign in conjunction with Sherwin-Williams in digital, TV and print. Early customer response to this home channel exclusive brand and to the HGTV curated color set has been positive. Supporting our omni-channel approach to retailing, we are cross-merchandising the Sherwin-Williams brand in key areas throughout the store, like kitchen vignettes, bath vignettes and home decor while also leveraging our color visualizer on Lowes.com. This visualizer helps customers find the perfect color for the walls by virtually painting their own home or experimenting with a simple room. Then they come order a paint sample for shipment directly to the home or come into our stores for help pulling their project together with our specialists. Combined with our outstanding Valspar and PPG/Olympic brand partnerships, we expect to grow traffic to our stores and increase overall market share in paint. 
We also continue to strengthen our portfolio of Pro-focused brands. We recently finished rolling out brands such as Goldblatt masonry tools, GAF roofing and Owens Corning insulation. And we continue to collect feedback from our Pro customers and store employees to identify other local and national brands that best meet the needs of Pro customers. Along with strengthening our brand portfolio, we recently made the new LowesForPros.com site available to all Pro customers. Our focus on brands as well as our recent relaunch of LowesForPros.com are part of a broader commitment to build on our strong foundation for the Pro. This foundation includes dedicated service in our stores, inventory depth aligned with the needs of the Pro and our 5 Ways to Save value proposition. And our field-based Pro account executives and national accounts team make it easy for medium- to large-sized companies and government entities to do business with us. 
In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability. For the quarter, even with double-digit growth in categories like appliances and outdoor products, we maintained a flat gross margin rate, demonstrating our ability to drive profitability while capitalizing on big-ticket market share opportunities. We accomplished this by continuing to partner with our vendors to drive innovation and improved first cost and by leveraging supply chain fixed costs. Our stores once again effectively managed payroll hours on solid comp sales growth, increasing sales per hour by approximately 4% and driving 13 basis points of payroll expense leverage. They drove this while achieving record customer satisfaction scores and best-in-class inventory shrink performance. 
We also drove productivity in marketing by increasing our presence in targeted digital media and leveraging our investment in MyLowe's. And we're continuing to identify and implement additional expense efficiencies throughout the year by consolidating the procurement of similar types of goods and services across our corporate in-store functions. Likewise, with solid depth of high-velocity items and job block quantities in place and through a continued application of improved analytics to a thoughtful line review process, we're able to hold inventory per store roughly flat and increase inventory turns by 17 basis points. 
As you can see, we are pleased with our first quarter results and the progress we're making on our initiatives to drive top line growth, productivity and profitability and look forward to sharing further progress with you over the course of the year. Thank you for interest in Lowe's. And I would now turn the call over to Bob."

Sales for the first quarter were $14.1 billion, an increase of 5.4%. Total average ticket increased 3% to $66.63 and total transaction account increased 2.3%. As discussed on our fourth quarter call, we had planne",1158,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the first quarter were $14.1 billion, an increase of 5.4%. Total average ticket increased 3% to $66.63 and total transaction account increased 2.3%. As discussed on our fourth quarter call, we had planned for normal weather and thus, for Q1, to be our highest comping quarter of the year. In fact, weather in the Northeast was colder than normal and colder than last year while the West and Florida experienced the opposite. Therefore, the net impact of weather year-over-year was not the tailwind we expected. 
As a result, our sales for the quarter were slightly below our expectations. But we're still confident in our outlook for the year. Comp sales increased 5.2% as comp average ticket grew by 2.9% and comp transactions were up 2.2%. Looking at monthly trends, comps were 5.1% in February, 6.6% in March and 3.8% in April.  
Gross margin for the first quarter was 35.47% of sales, essentially flat to last year and in line with our expectations. We had positive rate movement from value improvement, which is offset by 15 basis points of pressure from the mix of products sold. SG&A for Q1 is 24.16% of sales, which leveraged 60 basis points. The expense leverage was driven by advertising, store payroll and impairment. Advertising leveraged 25 basis points, driven by the efforts to improve productivity, as Mike shared. Store payroll leveraged 13 basis points as we continue to optimize our staffing model. 
In the quarter, we had $8 million of long-lived asset impairment compared with $23 million in last year's first quarter, resulting in 11 basis points of leverage. Also there were numerous expenses that leveraged between 5 and 10 basis points in Q1. These items were somewhat offset by bonus, which deleveraged 35 basis points. Our bonus accruals are based on actual performance-to-date relative to plan. Record customer satisfaction scores, coupled with solid Q1 performance this year relative to a tough first quarter last year, resulted in higher bonus expense, and therefore, deleveraged year-over-year. 
Depreciation for the quarter was $365 million, which was 2.59% of sales and leveraged 19 basis points compared to last year's first quarter as a result of higher sales and assets becoming fully depreciated. Earnings before interest and taxes increased 76 basis points to 8.72% of sales. On our Q4 call, we discussed the pressure that gross margin and bonus expense would have on first quarter's flow-through. The 18 basis points of flow-through per point of comp above 1% in Q1 was modestly better than our expectations coming into the quarter. Interest expense at $134 million for the quarter deleveraged 2 basis points to last year as total debt increased $1.2 billion versus first quarter of 2014.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.7%, which was higher than the fourth quarter due to the expiration of certain tax provisions. The higher rate relative to the last year was primarily due to a tax settlement in Q1 2014 and negatively impacted first quarter earnings per share comparisons to last year by approximately $0.06. Earnings per share of $0.70 for the quarter was in line with our expectations and represented a 14.8% increase over last year's $0.61. 
Now a few items on the balance sheet, starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter was $1.4 billion. Our first quarter inventory balance of $10.6 billion increased $99 million or 0.9% over Q1 last year. Inventory turnover was 3.78, an increase of 17 basis points over Q1 2014. Asset turnover increased 11 basis points to 1.7. 
Moving on to liability section of the balance sheet. Accounts payable of $8 billion increased $972 million or 13.8% over Q1 last year. The increase in accounts payable is due to the timing of purchases in the quarter versus last year. At the end of the first quarter, lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.11. Return on invested capital increased 232 basis points for the quarter to 14.34%. 
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Operating cash flow was almost $2.5 billion. Capital expenditures were $232 million, resulting in free cash flow of over $2.2 billion. Free cash flow was $446 billion or 24.8% over the same period last year. In the quarter, we repurchased 13.6 million shares for $1 billion. Our board also approved a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization. At quarter end, we had approximately $6.4 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. The remaining $109 million of share repurchase, as shown on the statement of cash flows, relates to the shares withheld from employees to satisfy statutory tax withholding liabilities as well as the timing of share repurchase settlement across quarters. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. As Robert noted, economic forecasts remain aligned for modestly stronger home improvement industry growth in 2015. While we are optimistic about both the macro forecast and our improving execution, we continue to take a prudent approach for our 2015 outlook. 
For the year, we expect a total sales increase of approximately 4.5% to 5%, driven by comp sales increase of 4% to 4.5% and the opening of 15 to 20 stores, which include 6 Orchard and 2 city center locations. We're anticipating an EBIT increase of 80 to 100 basis points and are targeting 25 to 30 basis points of EBIT expansion per point of comp above 1%. 
While this is our expectation for the year, there will be some choppiness quarter-to-quarter. Specific to the second quarter, there will be some gross margin pressure associated with the additional costs related to the West Coast port issue as well as 1 more quarter impact from increased promotional intensity that began at Labor Day last year. For the year, we expect that most of the EBIT improvement will come from SG&A. Expense leverage will come from store payroll, marketing, bonus and leveraging our scale to achieve cost savings on indirect spend. In addition, we expect fixed cost leverage associated with sales growth. 
The effective tax rate is particularly expected to be 38.1%. The higher rate relative to 2014 is a result of the settlement of prior tax matters recognized in Q1 2014. The higher tax rate impacts earnings growth by roughly $0.06 per share. For the year, we expect earnings per share of approximately $3.29, which represents an increase of 21.4% over 2014. 
We are forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $5.1 billion. Our capital forecast for 2015 is now approximately $1.4 billion, which is roughly $200 million higher than planned as a result of acquiring certain Target assets in Canada. This results in an estimated free cash flow of $3.7 billion for 2015. We expect to issue incremental debt during the year as we managed to the 2.25x lease adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR target. Our guidance assumes approximately $3.8 billion in share repurchases for 2015. 
Regina, we're now ready for questions."

So we're very, very comfortable that we're in a pretty good place on this. And as we said, there was no issues relative to flooring going in the quarter. With respect to phthalates, the other concern that was raised on vinyl floorings specifically, more than 90% of our virgin vinyl flooring today is phthalate-free. We'll move that to 100% by year end.

We also introduced 3 other aspects to the site. We introduced new 360 product views to about 11,500 of our highest-viewed items, which gives customers the complete view of the item across all aspects. We also introduced product videos to 214 different items that enhance the video capabilities of the customer to actually see the site, see the item and actually interact with it to a greater degree.

So the approved -- the only aspect of plan that was above plan was the customer-focused program for the store associates. The majority of deleverage came because of the softness last year. Because of the dramatic performance below plan last year, it caused us to unwind some bonus accruals. So coming into the year, we had anticipated having deleverage in Q1.

If the appliances, outdoor power equipment and seasonal living weren't in strong, strong double digit like we have, then the spread wouldn't be as broad as it is. When we go through each of the divisional performances and we look at which ones fell just below the average as a result of the strength that we saw in the above average, as I said earlier, tools and hardware, flooring, kitchens and millwork did extremely well, extremely, extremely well. And then where we saw real pressure was in paint and lumber and building materials specifically. So I wouldn't be worried about the spread. I think for us, the bigger question was could we take in this much of the appliance business and outdoor power equipment business and still manage to a flat gross margin? And we're very comfortable that we're able to take in that much market share and hold gross margin about flat."

I am pleased that we've delivered another strong quarter with comparable sales growth of 5.2%. Comp growth was driven by a 2.9% increase in comp average ticket and a 2.2% increase in comp transactions.",651,"Good morning, and thanks for your interest in Lowe's. I am pleased that we've delivered another strong quarter with comparable sales growth of 5.2%. Comp growth was driven by a 2.9% increase in comp average ticket and a 2.2% increase in comp transactions. The team executed our plan and collaborated across the organization to respond to challenges. We employed a coordinated effort to stagger our Spring Black Friday events with a controlled cadence, as Mike will describe further, and we were well prepared to meet customers' needs for the season. 
Our ability to adapt to difficult operating conditions was tested by the prolonged labor dispute at West Coast ports. And I'm pleased with the team's diligent effort to minimize the impact these challenges created. I would like to thank our more than 265,000 employees in the field and at our support centers for their hard work and dedication to serving customers. 
Comparable sales growth for our U.S. home improvement business was 5.3% for the quarter. And while we saw stronger performance in areas of the country where weather was more favorable, specifically in the West and in Florida, all 14 regions generated positive comps. Additionally, our team in Canada delivered their eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit comps in local currency and their highest quarterly comp performance since we entered the market in 2007. We recorded positive comps in all 13 product categories with particular strength in appliances as well as seasonal categories, including outdoor power equipment and seasonal living. 
We remain focused on improving our profitability even while investing in key capabilities to drive our sales growth. For the quarter, we drove 76 basis points of operating margin expansion despite experiencing some discrete pressures, as Bob will detail. And we delivered earnings per share of $0.70, a 15% increase over last year's first quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Delivering our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter, we repurchased $1 billion of stock under our share repurchase program and paid $222 million in dividends. 
Looking at the balance of the year from an economic perspective, key drivers of home improvement industry growth, job and income growth, home buying and home price appreciation remain aligned for modestly stronger industry growth. At the same time, lower energy prices should fuel stronger consumer spending in 2015. We continue to see steady recovery within the housing market, including positive trends in turnover and moderate home price appreciation as measured by the FHFA, the broadest measure of home price growth, which is more in line with our store footprint.
We're also encouraged by the results of our first quarter Consumer Sentiment Survey, where we continued to see homeowners' views around personal finances and home values improve. According to the survey, homeowners are shifting more of their spending to home improvement. As a result, their intentions to begin a home improvement project in the next 6 months were the highest in 6 years. And these planned projects are now almost evenly split between discretionary and nondiscretionary. 
Our key priorities in 2015 should allow us to capitalize on opportunities with an improving economy. We're pursuing further top line growth by differentiating ourselves with better customer experiences and improving our product and service offering for the Pro customer. We also remain committed to improving our productivity and profitability with opportunities in a few specific areas, including store payroll, marketing and leveraging our scale to get cost savings on indirect spend. In addition, we continue developing omni-channel capabilities as part of our long-term commitment to meet customers on their terms whenever and wherever they choose to engage with us. 
The execution of our strategic priorities, alongside an improving macroeconomic backdrop, together with a keen focus on productivity and profitability, give us confidence in our business outlook for 2015. Thanks again for your interest. And with that, let me turn the call over to Mike."

We executed well in the first quarter, growing both average ticket and transactions.

We executed well in the first quarter, growing both average ticket and transactions. We drove traffic to our stores to our Spring Black Friday event, aligned to the expected arrival of spring from the Deep South to the North. To ensure our stores are ready to provide inspiration, information and products to customers, we use our enhanced Sales & Operations Planning process to coordinate inventory flow, advertising, product displays and training. 
And while the situation at the West Coast ports added complexity to our spring preparation, our transportation and logistics teams successfully collaborated to reroute product to other ports. As a result, our in-stock levels remain high. In fact, sales in our seasonal living category, which includes our highest concentration of imported products, such as patios and grills, exceeded expectations. 
We are pleased with our first quarter results, notwithstanding some weather-driven softness. Keep in mind that the outdoor selling season extends well past Memorial Day. To this point, in the second quarter, sales have exceeded our expectations. So we remain confident in the full year guidance we provided last quarter. 
Looking at category performance. We recorded above company average comps in appliances, outdoor power equipment and seasonal living. We achieved double-digit comps in outdoor power equipment as walk-behind and riding mowers drove strong performance in the West and South. We offer a wide range of mowers to help customers maintain their yards. And we continue to provide compelling and exclusive innovations, like our home channel exclusive Husqvarna All-Wheel Drive mower and our recently launched Troy-Bilt Flex product. 
The outdoor living experience we introduced last year drove high single-digit comps in our seasonal living product category and across all 3 geographical divisions. This particular customer experience most benefits our patio and outdoor fashion areas, which recorded strong comps again this quarter over double-digit comps last year. We continue to see strong sales of patio furniture and robust attachment of replacement cushions and other outdoor accessories. As a reminder, to create our outdoor living experience, we took advantage of our largest store format to produce a showroom feel, which included removing 15 bays of steel racking and opening up 35% more space for curated style. To help customers envision and create their outdoor space, we displayed patio sets with coordinating rugs, umbrellas and accessories like pillows and planters, along with grills and other outdoor products, just as you would expect to see in your own backyard. We're very pleased with the continued performance of our outdoor living experience. 
In appliances, we drove double-digit comps for the second consecutive quarter. Lowe's offers leading appliance brands, such as Whirlpool, Kitchenaid, Bosch, Samsung, LG, Electrolux, Frigidaire and GE. And we've further strengthened our offering with the home channel exclusive launch of the Frigidaire Pro appliance series. For customers who aspire to have the look and feel of commercial-grade appliances in their home, this exciting launch provides great value with high-end commercial-like aesthetics and quality at an accessible price point. In addition to great brands, we provide service advantages of next-day delivery and haul-away as well as in-house facilitation of repairs and maintenance. To further enhance on appliance shopping experience, towards the end of last year, we worked with our vendor partners to introduce 17 kitchen suites to each store. Each suite includes 4 coordinated appliances: a refrigerator, a range, a microwave and a dishwasher. These suites help customers quickly visualize how a full set of new appliances will look in their existing or remodeled kitchen. 
We're also excited about HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams, an exclusive for Lowe's in the home channel. This is the first time in more than 40 years that Sherwin-Williams-branded products are available through another retailer. Brand is the #1 purchase driver in paint and Sherwin-Williams is the most recognized brand. We expect the addition of HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams to appeal to both DIY and Pro customers. Its long-standing reputation for quality as well as the color expertise of HGTV allows Lowe's to offer customers the top brands they trust for their next paint project. We announced this exciting addition in December and set product in all stores by the end of April. 
Earlier this month, we launched a full national advertising campaign in conjunction with Sherwin-Williams in digital, TV and print. Early customer response to this home channel exclusive brand and to the HGTV curated color set has been positive. Supporting our omni-channel approach to retailing, we are cross-merchandising the Sherwin-Williams brand in key areas throughout the store, like kitchen vignettes, bath vignettes and home decor while also leveraging our color visualizer on Lowes.com. This visualizer helps customers find the perfect color for their walls by virtually painting their own home or experimenting with a simple room. Then they come order a paint sample for shipment directly to the home or come into our stores for help pulling their project together with our specialists. Combined with our outstanding Valspar and PPG/Olympic brand partnerships, we expect to grow traffic to our stores and increase overall market share in paint. 
We also continue to strengthen our portfolio of Pro-focused brands. We recently finished rolling out brands such as Goldblatt masonry tools, GAF roofing and Owens Corning insulation. And we continued to collect feedback from our Pro customers and store employees to identify other local and national brands that best meet the needs of Pro customers. Along with strengthening our brand portfolio, we recently made the new LowesForPros.com site available to all Pro customers. Our focus on brands as well as our recent relaunch of LowesForPros.com are part of a broader commitment to build on our strong foundation for the Pro. This foundation includes dedicated service in our stores, inventory depth aligned with the needs of the Pro and our 5 Ways to Save value proposition. And our field-based Pro account executives and national accounts team make it easy for medium- to large-sized companies and government entities to do business with us. 
In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability. For the quarter, even with double-digit growth in categories like appliances and outdoor products, we maintained a flat gross margin rate, demonstrating our ability to drive profitability while capitalizing on big-ticket market share opportunities. We accomplished this by continuing to partner with our vendors to drive innovation and improved first cost and by leveraging supply chain fixed costs. Our stores once again effectively managed payroll hours on solid comp sales growth, increasing sales per hour by approximately 4% and driving 13 basis points of payroll expense leverage. They drove this while achieving record customer satisfaction scores and best-in-class inventory shrink performance. 
We also drove productivity in marketing by increasing our presence in targeted digital media and leveraging our investment in MyLowe's. And we're continuing to identify and implement additional expense efficiencies throughout the year by consolidating the procurement of similar types of goods and services across our corporate in-store functions. Likewise, with solid depth of high-velocity items and job lot quantities in place and through a continued application of improved analytics to a thoughtful line review process, we're able to hold inventory per store roughly flat and increase inventory turns by 17 basis points. 
As you can see, we are pleased with our first quarter results and the progress we're making on our initiatives to drive top line growth, productivity and profitability and look forward to sharing further progress with you over the course of the year. Thank you for interest in Lowe's. And I would now turn the call over to Bob."

Sales for the first quarter were $14.1 billion, an increase of 5.4%. Total average ticket increased 3% to $66.63 and total transaction count increased 2.3%. As discussed on our fourth quarter call, we had planned",1156,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the first quarter were $14.1 billion, an increase of 5.4%. Total average ticket increased 3% to $66.63 and total transaction count increased 2.3%. As discussed on our fourth quarter call, we had planned for normal weather and thus, for Q1, to be our highest comping quarter of the year. In fact, weather in the Northeast was colder than normal and colder than last year while the West and Florida experienced the opposite. Therefore, the net impact of weather year-over-year was not the tailwind we expected. 
As a result, our sales for the quarter were slightly below our expectations. But we're still confident in our outlook for the year. Comp sales increased 5.2% as comp average ticket grew by 2.9% and comp transactions were up 2.2%. Looking at monthly trends, comps were 5.1% in February, 6.6% in March and 3.8% in April.  
Gross margin for the first quarter was 35.47% of sales, essentially flat to last year and in line with our expectations. We had positive rate movement from value improvement, which is offset by 15 basis points of pressure from the mix of products sold. SG&A for Q1 is 24.16% of sales, which leveraged 60 basis points. The expense leverage was driven by advertising, store payroll and impairment. Advertising leveraged 25 basis points, driven by the efforts to improve productivity, as Mike shared. Store payroll leveraged 13 basis points as we continued to optimize our staffing model. 
In the quarter, we had $8 million of long-lived asset impairment compared with $23 million in last year's first quarter, resulting in 11 basis points of leverage. Also there were numerous expenses that leveraged between 5 and 10 basis points in Q1. These items were somewhat offset by bonus, which deleveraged 35 basis points. Our bonus accruals are based on actual performance-to-date relative to plan. Record customer satisfaction scores, coupled with solid Q1 performance this year relative to a tough first quarter last year, resulted in higher bonus expense, and therefore, deleveraged year-over-year. 
Depreciation for the quarter was $365 million, which was 2.59% of sales and leveraged 19 basis points compared to last year's first quarter as a result of higher sales and assets becoming fully depreciated. Earnings before interest and taxes increased 76 basis points to 8.72% of sales. On our Q4 call, we discussed the pressure that gross margin and bonus expense would have on first quarter's flow-through. The 18 basis points of flow-through per point of comp above 1% in Q1 was modestly better than our expectations coming into the quarter. Interest expense at $134 million for the quarter deleveraged 2 basis points to last year as total debt increased $1.2 billion versus first quarter of 2014.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.7%, which was higher than the fourth quarter due to the expiration of certain tax provisions. The higher rate relative to the last year was primarily due to a tax settlement in Q1 2014 and negatively impacted first quarter earnings per share comparisons to last year by approximately $0.06. Earnings per share of $0.70 for the quarter was in line with our expectations and represented a 14.8% increase over last year's $0.61. 
Now a few items on the balance sheet, starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter was $1.4 billion. Our first quarter inventory balance of $10.6 billion increased $99 million or 0.9% over Q1 last year. Inventory turnover was 3.78, an increase of 17 basis points over Q1 2014. Asset turnover increased 11 basis points to 1.7. 
Moving on to liability section of the balance sheet. Accounts payable of $8 billion increased $972 million or 13.8% over Q1 last year. The increase in accounts payable is due to the timing of purchases in the quarter versus last year. At the end of the first quarter, lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.11. Return on invested capital increased 232 basis points for the quarter to 14.34%. 
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Operating cash flow was almost $2.5 billion. Capital expenditures were $232 million, resulting in free cash flow of over $2.2 billion. Free cash flow was $446 billion or 24.8% over the same period last year. In the quarter, we repurchased 13.6 million shares for $1 billion. Our board also approved a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization. At quarter end, we had approximately $6.4 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. The remaining $109 million of share repurchases shown on the statement of cash flows, relates to the shares withheld from employees to satisfy statutory tax withholding liabilities as well as the timing of share repurchase settlement across quarters. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. As Robert noted, economic forecasts remain aligned for modestly stronger home improvement industry growth in 2015. While we are optimistic about both the macro forecast and our improving execution, we continue to take a prudent approach to our 2015 outlook. 
For the year, we expect a total sales increase of approximately 4.5% to 5%, driven by comp sales increase of 4% to 4.5% and the opening of 15 to 20 stores, which include 6 Orchard and 2 city center locations. We're anticipating an EBIT increase of 80 to 100 basis points and are targeting 25 to 30 basis points of EBIT expansion per point of comp above 1%. 
While this is our expectation for the year, there will be some choppiness quarter-to-quarter. Specific to the second quarter, there will be some gross margin pressure associated with the additional costs related to the West Coast port issue as well as 1 more quarter impact from increased promotional intensity that began Labor Day last year. For the year, we expect that most of the EBIT improvement will come from SG&A. Expense leverage will come from store payroll, marketing, bonus and leveraging our scale to achieve cost savings on indirect spend. In addition, we expect fixed cost leverage associated with sales growth. 
The effective tax rate is particularly expected to be 38.1%. The higher rate relative to 2014 is a result of the settlement of prior tax matters recognized in Q1 2014. The higher tax rate impacts earnings growth by roughly $0.06 per share. For the year, we expect earnings per share of approximately $3.29, which represents an increase of 21.4% over 2014. 
We are forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $5.1 billion. Our capital forecast for 2015 is now approximately $1.4 billion, which is roughly $200 million higher than planned as a result of acquiring certain Target assets in Canada. This results in an estimated free cash flow of $3.7 billion for 2015. We expect to issue incremental debt during the year as we manage to the 2.25x lease adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR target. Our guidance assumes approximately $3.8 billion in share repurchases for 2015. 
Regina, we're now ready for questions."

One was relating to formaldehyde, in particular -- with one particular partner. What we did, in essence, was we took -- we put the products from that particular partner on hold. And we're going ahead and we'll review the certifications. All of our partners are required to give us certification. We're reviewing the certification and making sure that there aren't any issues. And so we'll work through that. As we look at our portfolio, we're very comfortable that we don't have issues. Our vendors are largely U.S. They've all certified with us that there are no issues. So we're very, very comfortable that we're in a pretty good place on this. And as we said, there was no issues relative to flooring going in the quarter. 
With respect to phthalates, the other concern that was raised on vinyl flooring specifically, more than 90% of our virgin vinyl flooring today is phthalate-free. We'll move that to 100% by year end. And again, we're comfortable that there's no big issues. And as we work with our vendor partners and we continue to scrub this, they're not finding any issues as well. So we don't see any impact on the quarter. And frankly, our flooring business continues to do well. And our reviews with our vendor partners continues to give us the kind of expected results that we expect."

In addition to that, we have more space dedicated to the appliance category than certainly most, if not all, of our competitors. And we offer the full way of brands. And so we like our position to go after market share in appliances. We've done a couple of things. We continue to launch exclusive and innovative products, like the Frigidaire Pro series that we've talked about. That's a home channel exclusive. And we also put in kitchen vignettes so that customers can walk in and see full vignettes of appliances and shop the different brands, looking at the -- how a kitchen would look, be it a recently remodeled kitchen or an existing kitchen with full vignettes. And we've seen a couple of things coming from that. First, our appliance sales remained strong, double digit both this quarter and last quarter. We've also seen an expansion of number of appliances per ticket. And so we feel real good about our position in the appliance business. We feel real good about our initiatives and we feel real good about the support our vendor partners continues to give us to ensure that we retain the #1 position in appliances."

A few things that we continue to do, Mike talked about the new paint configuration tool that was launched to help customers visualize paint in their home. We made several other strategic changes to the site throughout the quarter as we continued to look for ways to improve the site, along with the filtering process, improving better filtering and better search terms. 
We also introduced 3 other aspects to the site. We introduced new 360 product views to about 11,500 of our highest-viewed items, which gives customers the complete view of the item across all aspects. We also introduced product videos to 214 different items that enhance the video capabilities of the customer to actually see the site, see the item and actually interact with it to a greater degree. And then we also enhanced the images to 9,400 items on the site in the quarter as well to make sure that we did showcase the product in a much better way to the customer.

When you couple that with our approach to go after more of that Pro business, that's also facilitated the need for the merchants to do somethings very different, a different look on how we approach brands relative to national brands versus private label brands and those categories that lean very heavily to Pro. We're doing a lot of things very different. Here's how I answer that. I think you see a difference in our stores. I think our merchants and our vendor partners are excited about the changes that we've made. I think they like the success that we see in growth. And I think they're working through it well.

Obviously, the first quarter this year, we got a 5.2% comp in the first quarter, so we're running ahead of what our trajectory -- or what our guidance is for the entire year. So obviously, coming out of the first quarter, we feel much better about being ahead of what we guided to for the year than the position we were in last year, where we had a large deficit to make up, so."

We delivered solid results for the quarter, and I would like to thank our employees for their hard work and commitment to serving customers. Comparable sales grew 4.3%, primarily driven by a 3.3% increase in average ticket. We achieved this growth by executing well in a challenging environment that included an increasingly severe drought in California and historic flooding in Texas. In fact, comparable sales growth for our U.S. home improvement business was 4.6% for the quarter with all 14 regions generating positive comps and positive comps in 11 of 13 product categories. 
Our seasonal business performed well. Strength in outdoor power equipment and seasonal living offset some of the weakness and -- some of the softness in lawn and garden, which was most pronounced in the West. We also experienced solid growth in big-ticket discretionary project categories such as kitchens, flooring, millwork and fashion fixtures. And for the third quarter in a row, we drove double digit comps in appliances. 
Our team in Canada continued to deliver strong comps in local currency. Building on the momentum we've been gaining, we're accelerating our store expansion in this market. We recently acquired 12 former Target store locations and 1 distribution center with plans to open these locations in 2016 and 2017. Combined with our organic expansion plans, we expect to have roughly 70 stores in Canada by 2017. 
Our business in Mexico also performed well during the quarter, achieving double-digit comps in local currency. However, as the U.S. dollars strengthened, we experienced a 30 basis point drag on our consolidated comp due to foreign currency.
For the quarter, gross margin contracted 8 basis points, primarily due to the strength in appliances and outdoor power equipment. We leveraged operating in the quarter and delivered earnings per share of $1.20, a 15% increase over last year's second quarter. 
Delivering on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter, we repurchased $1.5 billion of stock under our share repurchase program and paid $218 million in dividends. In May, our Board of Directors approved a 22% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.23 per share to $0.28 per share.
Looking forward to the second half of 2015, key drivers of the home improvement industry remain supportive for growth. Economists are forecasting a modest acceleration in both incomes and consumer spending this year and recovering the housing market continues with moderate home price appreciation and stronger gains in housing turnover. We also continue to be encouraged by the results of our second quarter Consumer Sentiment Survey. Roughly half of respondents indicated that they believe their home values are increasing, double the number from 2012. And this positive sentiment around home values is through the spending patterns with plans to begin a home improvement project in the next 6 months continuing its recent upward trend. Further, survey respondents indicated that growth in their home improvement spending is outpacing increases in their overall spending, suggesting an affinity -- the strengthening affinity for the home.
Our key priorities in 2015 should allow us to capitalize on opportunities within an improving economy. We are pursuing further top line growth through continued development of omni-channel capabilities, differentiating our shelves through better customer experiences and improving our product and service offering for the Pro customer. We also remain committed to improving our productivity and profitability with opportunities in a few specific areas, including store payroll, marketing and leveraging our scale to get cost savings on indirect spend. strategic priorities alongside an improving macroeconomic backdrop together with our keen focus on productivity and profitability give us confidence in our business outlook for 2015.

During the second quarter, we recorded our strongest performance in big-ticket categories such as appliances, kitchens, outdoor power equipment and seasonal living. This is a reflection of consumers' increasing desire to invest in their homes as well as the strength of our product offerings in these categories and our evolving omni-channel capabilities. In appliances, we drove double-digit comps for the third consecutive quarter. In addition to our leading brands in this category such as Whirlpool, KitchenAid, Bausch, Samsung, LG, Electrolux, Frigidaire and GE, we provide services managers like delivery and Holloway and facilitate in-home repairs and maintenance. We have further strengthened our offering with the home channel exclusive launch of the Frigidaire Pro plan series and the introduction of 17 kitchen suites. And understanding that more than 80% of customers start shopping for appliances online, we have enhanced our presentation on Lowes.com, including improved product search, enhanced videos, improved presentation like 360-degree views and simplified product groupings. It's no wonder that for the seventh time in the last 8 years, J.D. Power and Associates has ranked Lowe's highest in customer satisfaction among appliance retailers based upon our knowledgeable sales specialist, breadth of assortment, competitive pricing and delivery.
In order to sell the entire kitchen, we display our kitchen products, including counters and countertops, immediately adjacent to our appliance offering. This quarter, we drove above-average comps in kitchens through a combination of targeted promotions and our investment in projects specialists who meet customers in their homes. These employees represent another important element of our omni-channel strategy. We now have project specialists who focus on the exterior of the home available across all U.S. stores, and we are expanding our interior project specialist program into another 470 stores, reaching over 3/4 of our stores by year-end. With our ability to coordinate style, provide design expertise and find the right contractor to do the job, we are rapidly becoming the project authority in home improvement. 
We achieved high single-digit comps in outdoor power equipment with particular strength in riding mowers and pressure washers. We offer a wide range of mowers to help customers maintain their yards, and we continue to provide compelling and exclusive brands and innovations like our innovative Kobalt 80-volt [ph] handheld outdoor power tools and our home channel exclusive, hustler 60-inch 0 turn [ph] movers, a brand landscapers know and trust. 
The outdoor living experience we introduced last year drove strong comps in our seasonal living product category. In fact, our patio and outdoor fashion area recorded strong solid comps again this quarter on top of double-digit comps last quarter assisted by robust attachment of replacement cushions and other outdoor accessories. Entering the second half of the year, we will use this seasonal space to address customer needs for the fall by planting leaf removal, home and exterior maintenance. Then as winter arrives, we will help customers refresh their homes for holiday guests, decorate and organize their home after the holidays. We will focus on using this space to provide the inspiration, guidance, products and services that customers need to tackle the projects that are relevant for each macro season.
Our performance in paint was in line with the industry. We are pleased with the launch of HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams and look forward to building further momentum with this brand. Brand is the #1 purchase driver in paint, and Sherman-Williams is the most recognized brand in the category. We expect the addition of HGTV by Sherman-Williams to appeal to both DIY and Pro customers. Its long-standing reputation for quality as well as the color expertise of HGTV allows Lowe's to offer customers the top brands they trust for their next paint project. Combined with our outstanding Olympic brand partnerships, we expect to grow traffic to our stores and increase overall market share in paint.
We also continue to strengthen our portfolio of Pro-focused brands. In addition to the brands we rolled out in the first quarter, including tools and Owens Corning insulation, last month we expanded our line of Hitachi and fasteners, a home channel exclusive to Lowe's stores nationwide. Lowe's now offers the broadest selection of Hitachi power tools with the latest innovations that delivered lighter, faster and more durable products. We continue to get feedback from our Pro customers and employees to identify other local and national brands that best meets the needs of Pro customers. Along with strengthening our brand portfolio, we officially relaunched LowesForPros.com at the beginning of the second quarter and have seen an increase in use by our Pro customers, in line with our expectations. So far, we have been promoting LowesForPros online and through Pro social media, and in the third quarter, we will begin the formal launch through our Pro appreciation days as well as other media. We continue to actually serve the Pro through our account executive ProServices or AEPs. AEPs call their regional customers to help them order and replenish products across multiple stores. We currently have approximately 135 AEPs in the field, an increase of 25 over last year. 
Our AEPs have been very effective in growing our business with larger Pro customers, especially maintenance, repair and operations, or MRO customers. We are pleased with the program's results. Excluding the AEPs we added this year, we saw double-digit second quarter growth in AEP sales, which contributed to solid Pro comp sales growth in the quarter. Our focus on strengthening our portfolio brands, serving regional Pro customers through AEPs as well as our recent relaunch of LowesForPros.com are part of a broader commitment to build on our strong foundation with the Pro.
In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability. For the quarter, we capitalized on big-ticket market share opportunities with strong growth in categories like appliances and outdoor products, which contributed to a slight decline in gross margin rate but substantial margin dollar growth. We mitigated the unfavorable mix impact by continuing to partner with our vendors to drive innovation, improve cost through shared efficiencies and to achieve higher sell-through of seasonal products. 
Our store teams once again effectively managed payroll, increasing sales per hour in line with comps. We continue to leverage our prior technology investments as well as improved selling processes enabled by our customer experience design team. Most importantly, we have achieved this greater payroll efficiency while improving customer satisfaction scores. We also drove productivity in marketing by increasing our presence in targeted digital media and leveraging our investment in My Lowe's. And we continue to identify and implement additional expense efficiencies throughout the year by consolidating the procurement of types of goods and services across our corporate and store functions. The quarter tested the flexibility and capabilities of our supply chain, and we passed that test with flying colors. To meet a heightened demand in the Pacific Northwest where temperatures were unusually warm, our distribution teams were portable air-conditioners from the Northeast. Likewise, they were instrumental in moving products to Eastern Texas so we could help customers recover from flooding and begin the process of repairing and rebuilding in the wake of storms. 
While inventory at quarter end was up 4% of last year, it reflects our commitment to being in stock for items that are most relevant to our customers. For instance, we ended the second quarter with higher levels of appliances to support exceptionally strong sales as well as higher levels of portable air-conditioning units and grills. We expect to sell-through most of the seasonal inventory in the third quarter and to end the year with minimal growth in seasonal -- in inventory per store. We are pleased with our agile execution in the second quarter. We continue to make progress on our initiatives to drive top line growth and our focused on improving productivity and profitability. We look forward to sharing further progress with you over the course of the year. Thank you for your interest in Lowe's, and I will now turn the call over to Bob."

Sales for the second quarter were $17.3 billion, an increase of 4.5%. The sales increase was driven by both ticket and transactions with total average ticket up 3.3% to $67.83 while total customer transactions grew 1.",1145,"Thanks, Rick. Good morning, everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $17.3 billion, an increase of 4.5%. The sales increase was driven by both ticket and transactions with total average ticket up 3.3% to $67.83 while total customer transactions grew 1.2%. Comp sales were 4.3% driven by a comp average ticket increase of 3.3% and comp transactions growth of 1%. 
Looking at monthly trends. Comps were 3.6% in May, 4.6% in June and 4.6% in July. In Q2, July 4 fell in fiscal July this year and fiscal June last year. While the shift did not affect comp sales for the quarter, it did impact the monthly spread. We estimate that normalizing for the timing of the holiday, June and July comps would have been 3.9% and 5.8%, respectively. 
Year-to-date total sales of $31.5 billion were up 4.9% versus the first half of 2014 driven by a 4.7% increase in comp sales. Gross margin for the second quarter was 34.47% of sales, which decreased 8 basis points from Q2 last year. The declining gross margin was driven by mix and promotional activity. The mix of products sold, primarily appliances and outdoor power equipment, negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 20 basis points. Also, we have noted our efforts to adjust our promotional calendar to be more competitive with the market. We anniversary-ed this promotional change in the third quarter. The pressure from these items was largely offset by value improvement. Year-to-date gross margin was 34.92% of sales, a decrease of 6 basis points from the first half of 2014.
SG&A for Q2 was 20.94% of sales, which leveraged [ph] 39 basis points, which brings leverage the variety of expenses including store payroll bonus, maintenance and repairs, utilities, advertising and payroll taxes. These items were somewhat offset by store closing costs of $13 million related to a lease termination for a recent relocation as well as updated lease assumptions for stores closed in 2011. Also, in the quarter, our Canadian business incurred $4 million of expenses associated with the recent purchase of certain target assets. This was primarily related to lease termination costs for our existing distribution center as we work to transition into the larger former target facility, in addition to the repairing cost associated with the 12 store leases that we assumed. These 2 items totaled $17 million and impacted EBITDA and EPS by 10 basis points and a penny per share, respectively. 
Year-to-date SG&A was 22.39% of sales, which leveraged 48 basis points versus the first half of 2014. Depreciation for the quarter was $375 million, which was 2.16% of sales and leveraged 10 basis points. In Q2, earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, increased 41 basis points to 11.37% of sales. For the first half of 2015, EBIT was 10.18% of sales, which was 56 basis points higher in the same period last year. For the quarter, interest expense was $133 million. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.8%. Earnings per share was $1.20 for the second quarter, an increase of 15.4% over last year. For the first 6 months of 2015, earnings per share of $1.90 represented a 15.9% increase over the first half of 2014. The $1.90 was in line with our year-to-date plan.
Now to the balance sheet starting with assets. 
Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter was $900 million. Our inventory balance of $9.7 billion increased $389 million or 4% versus Q2 last year. As Rick mentioned, the increase was driven by appliances that support sales growth as well as seasonal inventory. Inventory turnover was 3.9, up 16 basis points over last year as the turnover increased 11 basis points to 1.74. 
Moving onto the liability section of the balance sheet. Accounts payable of $7.1 billion represented a 15% increase over Q2 last year, primarily due to the timing of purchases year-over-year. 
At the end of the second quarter, debt to EBITDAR was 2.08x. Return on invested capital increased 237 basis points for the quarter to 14.98%.
Looking at the statement cash flows. Year-to-date operating cash flow was almost $4.2 billion and capital expenditures were $570 million, resulting in free cash flow of nearly $3.6 billion, which is up 2% to last year. In May, we entered into a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement. At this point, we expect to receive approximately 14.5 million shares, but the ultimate number of shares will be determined upon completion of the program in the third quarter. We also repurchased approximately 7.2 million shares for $500 million in the open market. In total, we repurchased $1.5 billion in the quarter. We have approximately $4.9 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization.
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. As Robert noted, the key drivers of the home improvement industry remain supportive for growth. For the year, we expect total sales increase of approximately 4.5% to 5% driven by account sales increase of 4% to 4.5% and the addition of 15 to 20 stores, which includes 5 Orchard and 2 city center locations.
We are anticipating an EBIT increase of 80 to 100 basis points and I'm targeting 25 to 30 basis points of EBIT expansion for comparable 1%. [ph] While this our expectation for the year, there will be some choppiness quarter-to-quarter. 
For the year, we expect most of the EBIT will come from SG&A. Expense leverage will come from store payroll, marketing, bonus and leveraging our scale to achieve cost savings on indirect spend. In addition, we expect fixed cost leverage associated with sales growth. 
Our confidence that flow-through will accelerate in the second half of 2015 is based on a few items: First, gross margin pressure from both the changes in the promotional calendar and mix should dissipate in the second half and we have much future second half prior year comparisons.
Also, in the fourth quarter of 2014, we increased bonus accruals, which should drive leverage in Q4 this year. Lastly, we expect additional leverage from credit as a result of program growth. 
The effective tax rate is expected to be 38.1%. The high rate relative to 2014 is a result of settlement the prior tax matters recognized in Q1 2014. The higher tax rate impacts earnings growth by roughly $0.06 per share. For the year, we expect earnings per share of approximately $3.29, which represents an increase of 21.4% over 2014. We are forecasting cash flow from operations to be approximately $5 billion. Our capital forecast for 2015 is now approximately $1.3 billion with results in estimated of free cash flow $3.7 billion for 2015. We expect to issue incremental debt during the year as we manage to the 2.25x lease-adjusted debt to EBITDAR target. Our guidance assumes approximately 3.8 billion share repurchases for 2015.
Virginia, we are now ready for questions."

So there's a number of items that gives us confidence that second half flow-through is going to be higher than first half. I called out 3 in my comments, so let me give you a little more color around those 3. I mentioned the promotional calendar and mix pressure dissipating as well as easier compares. If you look at 2014, gross margin improved 42 basis points in the first half of 2014 and declined 6 basis points in the second half, so we do have easier compares in the second half. For 2015, gross margin declined 6 basis points. We expect about 20 basis points of improvement in the second half or roughly 26 basis points swing. Second, in bonus, for the first half of 2015, we've seen 7 basis points of deleverage in bonus. We expect about 13 basis points of leverage in the second half of 2015 or roughly a 20 basis point swing. Lastly, credit. Credit was flat to 2014 for the first half. We expect about 15 basis points of leverage in the second half of 2015 for a swing of 15 basis points. So those 3 items are the lion's share of what gives us confidence in the flow-through. We do have a couple of other items given timing of projects like facilities, repairs and store projects where the first half is little heavier than the second half, but we do have a number of items that will give us confidence in the second half flow-through."

Rick talked about the good work done with the store operations team to continue to thoughtfully put associates in front of customers that allows us to be more effective in our utilization of payroll. That certainly continues in the second half of the year. I mentioned the credit. We've got project-related expenses around facilities repairs and projects in the first half weighted we get benefit there and then indirect spend as the capability could use to get momentum that should give us some benefit -- greater benefit in the second half of the year. So what I have to say is there's not a lot of difference in the comp first half versus second half, and we got some other discrete items that should drive SG&A leverage."

We've been very pleased with receptivity of the site itself. We're measuring things such as category of products that are being purchased, assortments that are being evaluated. We're looking at the amount of channel pickup. Are they picking up in store, they're picking up through the delivery or is it being parceled? So we think we're very pleased with what we're seeing from that standpoint so far. As Robert said on Lowes.com, we grew roughly 20% in the quarter. And I think that continues to be driven by several factors, and one of the most being the new innovation that we're putting on the site itself. When you look at what we've been able to do in the last first half of the year, the patio configuration tool, you heard me talk about a helping the seasonal living categories in the quarter. There's no doubt that, that tool is really helping us from a dot-com standpoint. And then you look at what we've done to really be able to show product differently on the site. We've increased the number of 360-degree product views, another 3,500 items are added during the quarter in Q2, gives us up to roughly 15,000 items were able to spend the view that category. Product videos, we talked about how increasingly the appliance shoppers going to dot-com first to evaluate product categories. We added another 200 videos into that category during the quarter, added 4,000 enhanced images and pictures to the site as well, introduced the search engine capabilities that we're looking at for more intuitive search. And so as a result of that, we saw traffic to Lowes.com increased 19% for the quarter, and we saw a slight increase in conversion as well. So when you look at the holistic aspect of the dot-com platform, we feel very good with the innovations we've added, with the technology improvements that we've made. Like I said earlier, with LowesForPros, we're very pleased with what we've seen there. We've actually seen double-digit increase in new customers to Lowe's that are on the site that had not previously shopped with us before, which is very exciting when we think through the rollout of the site itself."

We delivered solid results for the quarter, and I would like to thank our employees for their hard work and commitment to serving customers. Comparable sales grew 4.3%, primarily driven by a 3.3% increase in average ticket. We achieved this growth by executing well in a challenging environment that included an increasingly severe drought in California and historic flooding in Texas. In fact, comparable sales growth for our U.S. home improvement business was 4.6% for the quarter with all 14 regions generating positive comps and positive comps in 11 of 13 product categories. 
Our seasonal business performed well. Strength in outdoor power equipment and seasonal living offset some of the weakness in -- some of the softness in lawn and garden, which was most pronounced in the West. 
We also experienced solid growth in big-ticket discretionary project categories such as kitchens, flooring, millwork and fashion fixtures. And for the third quarter in a row, we drove double digit comps in appliances. 
Our team in Canada continued to deliver strong comps in local currency. Building on the momentum we've been gaining, we're accelerating our store expansion in this market. We recently acquired 12 former Target store locations and 1 distribution center with plans to open these locations in 2016 and 2017. Combined with our organic expansion plans, we expect to have roughly 70 stores in Canada by 2017. 
Our business in Mexico also performed well during the quarter, achieving double-digit comps in local currency. However, as the U.S. dollars strengthened, we experienced a 30 basis point drag on our consolidated comp due to foreign currency.
For the quarter, gross margin contracted 8 basis points, primarily due to the strength in appliances and outdoor power equipment. 
We leveraged operating salaries in the quarter and delivered earnings per share of $1.20, a 15% increase over last year's second quarter. 
Delivering on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter, we repurchased $1.5 billion of stock under our share repurchase program and paid $218 million in dividends. In May, our Board of Directors approved a 22% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.23 per share to $0.28 per share.
Looking forward to the second half of 2015, key drivers of the home improvement industry remain supportive for growth. Economists are forecasting a modest acceleration in both incomes and consumer spending this year, and recovery in the housing market continues with moderate home price appreciation and stronger gains in housing turnover. 
We also continue to be encouraged by the results of our second quarter Consumer Sentiment Survey. Roughly half of respondents indicated that they believe their home values are increasing, double the number from 2012. And this positive sentiment around home values is reading [ph] through to spending patterns with plans to begin a home improvement project in the next 6 months continuing its recent upward trend. Further, survey respondents indicated that growth in their home improvement spending is outpacing increases in their overall spending, suggesting an affinity -- the strengthening affinity for the home.
Our key priorities in 2015 should allow us to capitalize on opportunities within an improving economy. We are pursuing further top line growth through continued development of omni-channel capabilities, differentiating ourselves through better customer experiences and improving our product and service offering for the Pro customer. We also remain committed to improving our productivity and profitability with opportunities in a few specific areas including store payroll, marketing and leveraging our scale to get cost savings on indirect spend. The execution of our strategic priorities alongside an improving macroeconomic backdrop, together with our keen focus on productivity and profitability, give us confidence in our business outlook for 2015. 
Thanks again for your interest. And with that, let me turn the call over to Rick."

During the second quarter, we recorded our strongest performance in big-ticket categories such as appliances, kitchens, outdoor power equipment and seasonal living. This is a reflection of consumers' increasing desire to invest in their homes as well as the strength of our product offerings in these categories and our evolving omni-channel capabilities. 
In appliances, we drove double-digit comps for the third consecutive quarter. In addition to our leading brands in this category such as Whirlpool, KitchenAid, Bosch, Samsung, LG, Electrolux, Frigidaire and GE, we provide service advantages like delivery and haul away and facilitate in-home repairs and maintenance. We have further strengthened our offering with the home channel exclusive launch of the Frigidaire Pro appliance series and the introduction of 17 kitchen suites. 
And understanding that more than 80% of customers start shopping for appliances online, we have enhanced our presentation on Lowes.com including improved product search, enhanced videos, improved presentation like 360-degree views and simplified product groupings. 
It's no wonder that for the seventh time in the last 8 years, J.D. Power and Associates has ranked Lowe's highest in customer satisfaction among appliance retailers based upon our knowledgeable sales specialists, breadth of assortment, competitive pricing and delivery.
In order to sell the entire kitchen, we display our kitchen products including cabinets and countertops immediately adjacent to our appliance offering. This quarter, we drove above-average comps in kitchens through a combination of targeted promotions and our investment in projects specialists who meet customers in their homes. These employees represent another important element of our omni-channel strategy. We now have project specialists who focus on the exterior of the home available across all U.S. stores. And we're expanding our interior project specialist program into another 470 stores, reaching over 3/4 of our stores by year-end. With our ability to coordinate style, provide design expertise and find the right contractor to do the job, we are rapidly becoming the project authority in home improvement. 
We achieved high single-digit comps in outdoor power equipment with particular strength in walk-behind and riding mowers and pressure washers. We offer a wide range of mowers to help customers maintain their yards, and we continue to provide compelling and exclusive brands and innovations like our innovative Kobalt 80-volt Handheld Outdoor Power Tools, and our home channel exclusive, Hustler Raptor 60-inch Zero-Turn Mowers, a brand landscapers know and trust. 
The outdoor living experience we introduced last year drove strong comps in our seasonal living product category. In fact, our patio and outdoor fashion area recorded strong solid comps again this quarter on top of double-digit comps last quarter assisted by robust attachment of replacement cushions and other outdoor accessories. 
Entering the second half of the year, we will use this seasonal space to address customer needs for the fall like planting, leaf removal, home winterization and exterior maintenance. Then as winter arrives, we will help customers refresh their homes for holiday guests, decorate and organize their home after the holidays. We will focus on using this space to provide the inspiration, guidance, products and services that customers need to tackle the projects that are relevant for each micro-season.
Our performance in paint was in line with the industry. We are pleased with the launch of HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams and look forward to building further momentum with this brand. Brand is the #1 purchase driver in paint and Sherwin-Williams is the most recognized brand in the category. We expect the addition of HGTV by Sherwin-Williams to appeal to both DIY and Pro customers. Its long-standing reputation for quality as well as the color expertise of HGTV allows Lowe's to offer customers the top brands they trust for their next paint project. Combined with our outstanding Valspar and PPG/Olympic brand partnerships, we expect to grow traffic to our stores and increase overall market share in paint.
We also continue to strengthen our portfolio of Pro-focused brands. In addition to the brands we rolled out in the first quarter including Goldblatt measuring tools, GAF roofing and Owens Corning insulation, last month we expanded our line of Hitachi pneumatic nailers and fasteners, a home channel exclusive to Lowe's stores nationwide. Lowe's now offers the broadest selection of Hitachi power tools with the latest innovations that deliver lighter, faster and more durable products. 
We continue to collect feedback from our Pro customers and employees to identify other local and national brands that best meet the needs of Pro customers. Along with strengthening our brand portfolio, we officially relaunched LowesForPros.com at the beginning of the second quarter and have seen an increase in use by our Pro customers, in line with our expectations. So far, we have been promoting LowesForPros online and through Pro social media, and in the third quarter, we will begin the formal launch through our Pro Appreciation days as well as other media. 
We continue to actually serve the Pro through our Account Executive ProServices or AEPs. AEPs call in regional customers to help them order and replenish products across multiple stores. We currently have approximately 135 AEPs in the field, an increase of 25 over last year. Our AEPs have been very effective in growing our business with larger Pro customers, especially Maintenance, Repair and Operations or MRO customers. We are pleased with the program's results. Excluding the AEPs we added this year, we saw double-digit second quarter growth in AEP sales, which contributed to solid Pro comp sales growth in the quarter. Our focus on strengthening our portfolio of brands, serving regional Pro customers through AEPs as well as our recent relaunch of LowesForPros.com are part of a broader commitment to build on our strong foundation with the Pro.
In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability. For the quarter, we capitalized on big-ticket market share opportunities with strong growth in categories like appliances and outdoor products, which contributed to a slight decline in gross margin rate, but substantial margin dollar growth. We mitigated the unfavorable mix impact by continuing to partner with our vendors to drive innovation, improve first costs through shared efficiencies and to achieve higher sell-through of seasonal products. 
Our store teams once again effectively managed payroll, increasing sales per hour in line with comps. We continue to leverage our prior technology investments as well as improved selling processes enabled by our customer experience design team. Most importantly, we have achieved this greater payroll efficiency while improving customer satisfaction scores. We also drove productivity in marketing by increasing our presence in targeted digital media and leveraging our investment in MyLowe's. And we continue to identify and implement additional expense efficiencies throughout the year by consolidating the procurement of similar types of goods and services across our corporate and store functions. 
The quarter tested the flexibility and capabilities of our supply chain and we passed that test with flying colors. To meet a heightened demand in the Pacific Northwest where temperatures were unusually warm, our distribution teams worked efficiently to move portable air-conditioners from the Northeast. Likewise, they were instrumental in moving products to Eastern Texas so we could help customers recover from flooding and begin the process of repairing and rebuilding in the wake of storms. 
While inventory at quarter end was up 4% of last year, it reflects our commitment to being in stock for items that are most relevant to our customers. For instance, we ended the second quarter with higher levels of appliances to support exceptionally strong sales as well as higher levels of portable air-conditioning units and grills. We expect to sell through most of the seasonal inventory in the third quarter and to end the year with minimal growth in seasonal -- in inventory per store. 
We are pleased with our agile execution in the second quarter. We continue to make progress on our initiatives to drive top line growth and are focused on improving productivity and profitability. We look forward to sharing further progress with you over the course of the year. 
Thank you for your interest in Lowe's, and I will now turn the call over to Bob."

Sales for the second quarter were $17.3 billion, an increase of 4.5%. The sales increase was driven by both ticket and transactions with total average ticket up 3.3% to $67.83 while total customer transactions gre",1150,"Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $17.3 billion, an increase of 4.5%. The sales increase was driven by both ticket and transactions with total average ticket up 3.3% to $67.83 while total customer transactions grew 1.2%. Comp sales were 4.3% driven by a comp average ticket increase of 3.3% and comp transactions growth of 1%. 
Looking at monthly trends. Comps were 3.6% in May, 4.6% in June and 4.6% in July. In Q2, July 4 fell in fiscal July this year and fiscal June last year. While the shift did not affect comp sales for the quarter, it did impact the monthly spread. We estimate that normalizing for the timing of the holiday, June and July comps would have been 3.9% and 5.8%, respectively. 
Year-to-date total sales of $31.5 billion were up 4.9% versus the first half of 2014 driven by a 4.7% increase in comp sales. 
Gross margin for the second quarter was 34.47% of sales, which decreased 8 basis points from Q2 last year. The decline in gross margin was driven by mix and promotional activity. The mix of products sold, primarily appliances and outdoor power equipment, negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 20 basis points. Also, we have noted our efforts to adjust our promotional calendar to be more competitive with the market. We anniversary-ed this promotional change in the third quarter. The pressure from these items was largely offset by value improvement. Year-to-date gross margin was 34.92% of sales, a decrease of 6 basis points from the first half of 2014.
SG&A for Q2 was 20.94% of sales, which leveraged 39 basis points, which brings leverage in a variety of expenses including store payroll, bonus, maintenance and repairs, utilities, advertising and payroll taxes. These items were somewhat offset by store closing costs of $13 million related to a lease termination for recent relocation as well as updated lease assumptions for stores closed in 2011. 
Also, in the quarter, our Canadian business incurred $4 million of expenses associated with the recent purchase of certain Target assets. This was primarily related to lease termination costs for our existing distribution center as we worked to transition into the larger former Target facility. In addition, there were carrying costs associated with the 12 store leases that we assumed. These 2 items totaled $17 million and impacted EBIT and EPS by 10 basis points and a $0.01 per share, respectively. 
Year-to-date SG&A was 22.39% of sales, which leveraged 48 basis points versus the first half of 2014. 
Depreciation for the quarter was $375 million, which was 2.16% of sales and leveraged 10 basis points. 
In Q2, earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT increased 41 basis points to 11.37% of sales. For the first half of 2015, EBIT was 10.18% of sales, which was 56 basis points higher in the same period last year. 
For the quarter, interest expense was $133 million. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.8%. 
Earnings per share was $1.20 for the second quarter, an increase of 15.4% over last year. For the first 6 months of 2015, earnings per share of $1.90 represented a 15.9% increase over the first half of 2014. The $1.90 was in line with our year-to-date plan.
Now to a few items on the balance sheet starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter was $900 million. 
Our inventory balance of $9.7 billion increased $389 million or 4% versus Q2 last year. As Rick mentioned, the increase was driven by appliances that support sales growth as well as seasonal inventory. Inventory turnover was 3.9, up 16 basis points over last year. 
Asset turnover increased 11 basis points to 1.74. 
Moving onto the liability section of the balance sheet. Accounts payable of $7.1 billion represented a 15% increase over Q2 last year, primarily due to the timing of purchases year-over-year. 
At the end of the second quarter, lease-adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR was 2.08x. Return on invested capital increased 237 basis points for the quarter to 14.98%.
Looking at the statement cash flows. Year-to-date operating cash flow was almost $4.2 billion and capital expenditures were $570 million, resulting in free cash flow of nearly $3.6 billion, which is up 2% to last year. 
In May, we entered into a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement. At this point, we expect to receive approximately 14.5 million shares, but the ultimate number of shares will be determined upon completion of the program in the third quarter. We also repurchased approximately 7.2 million shares for $500 million through the open market. In total, we repurchased $1.5 billion in the quarter. We have approximately $4.9 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization.
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. As Robert noted, the key drivers of the home improvement industry remain supportive for growth. For the year, we expect total sales increase of approximately 4.5% to 5% driven by account sales increase of 4% to 4.5% and the addition of 15 to 20 stores, which includes 5 Orchard and 2 city center locations.
We are anticipating an EBIT increase of 80 to 100 basis points and I'm targeting 25 to 30 basis points of EBIT expansion per point of comp above 1%. While this our expectation for the year, there will be some choppiness quarter-to-quarter. 
For the year, we expect most of the EBIT improvement will come from SG&A. Expense leverage will come from store payroll, marketing, bonus and leveraging our scale to achieve cost savings on indirect spend. In addition, we expect fixed cost leverage associated with sales growth. 
Our confidence that flow-through will accelerate in the second half of 2015 is based on a few items: first, gross margin pressure from both the changes in the promotional calendar and mix should dissipate in the second half and we have much easier second half prior year comparisons. Also, in the fourth quarter of 2014, we increased bonus accruals, which should drive leverage in Q4 this year. Lastly, we expect additional leverage from credit as a result of program growth. 
The effective tax rate is expected to be 38.1%. The higher rate relative to 2014 is a result of a settlement of prior tax matters recognized in Q1 2014. The higher tax rate impacts earnings growth by roughly $0.06 per share. 
For the year, we expect earnings per share of approximately $3.29, which represents an increase of 21.4% over 2014. 
We are forecasting cash flow from operations to be approximately $5 billion. 
Our capital forecast for 2015 is now approximately $1.3 billion, which results in an estimated free cash flow $3.7 billion for 2015. 
We expect to issue incremental debt during the year as we manage to the 2.25x lease-adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR target.

So there's a number of items that gives us confidence that second half flow-through is going to be higher than the first half. I called out 3 in my comments, so let me give you a little bit more color around those 3. I mentioned the promotional calendar and mix pressure dissipating as well as easier compares. If you look at 2014, gross margin improved 42 basis points in the first half of 2014 and declined 6 basis points in the second half, so we do have easier compares in the second half. For 2015, gross margin declined 6 basis points. We expect about 20 basis points of improvement in the second half or roughly a 26 basis point swing. Second, in bonus, for the first half of 2015, we've seen 7 basis points of deleverage in bonus. We expect about 13 basis points of leverage in the second half of 2015 or roughly a 20 basis point swing. Lastly, credit. Credit was flat to 2014 for the first half. We expect about 15 basis points of leverage in the second half of 2015 for a swing of 15 basis points. So those 3 items are the lion's share of what gives us confidence in the flow-through. We do have a couple of other items given timing of projects like facilities, repairs and store enviro projects where the first half was a little bit heavier than second half, but we do have a number of items that we can point to that give us confidence in the second half flow-through."

So we think we're very pleased with what we're seeing from that standpoint so far. As Robert said on Lowes.com, we grew roughly 20% in the quarter. And I think that continues to be driven by several factors and one of the most being the new innovation that we're putting on the site itself. When you look at what we've been able to do in the last first half of the year, the patio configuration tool, you've heard me talk about accessories helping the seasonal living categories in the quarter. There's no doubt that, that tool is really helping us from a dot-com standpoint. And then you look at what we've done to really be able to show product differently on the site. We've increased the number of 360-degree product views, another 3,500 items were added during the quarter in Q2, gets us up to roughly 15,000 items where we're able to spin the view of that category. Product videos, we talked about how increasingly the appliance shopper is going to dot-com first to evaluate product categories. We added another 200 videos into that category during the quarter, added 4,000 enhanced images and pictures to the site as well, introduced the search engine capabilities that we're looking at for more intuitive search. And so as a result of that, we saw traffic to Lowes.com increase 19% for the quarter and we saw a slight increase in conversion as well. So when you look at the holistic aspect of the dot-com platform, we feel very good with the innovations we've added, with the technology improvements that we've made. Like I said earlier, with LowesForPros, we're very pleased with what we've seen there. We've actually seen double-digit increase in new customers to Lowe's that are on the site that had not previously shopped with us before, which is very exciting when we think through the rollout of the site itself."

We delivered solid results for the quarter, and I would like to thank our employees for their hard work and commitment to serving customers. Comparable sales grew 4.3%, primarily driven by a 3.3% increase in average ticket. We achieved this growth by executing well in a challenging environment that included an increasingly severe drought in California and historic flooding in Texas. In fact, comparable sales growth for our U.S. home improvement business was 4.6% for the quarter with all 14 regions generating positive comps and positive comps in 11 of 13 product categories. 
Our seasonal business performed well. Strength in outdoor power equipment and seasonal living offset some of the weakness in -- some of the softness in lawn and garden, which was most pronounced in the West. 
We also experienced solid growth in big-ticket discretionary project categories such as kitchens, flooring, millwork and fashion fixtures. And for the third quarter in a row, we drove double digit comps in appliances. 
Our team in Canada continued to deliver strong comps in local currency. Building on the momentum we've been gaining, we're accelerating our store expansion in this market. We recently acquired 12 former Target store locations and 1 distribution center with plans to open these locations in 2016 and 2017. Combined with our organic expansion plans, we expect to have roughly 70 stores in Canada by 2017. 
Our business in Mexico also performed well during the quarter, achieving double-digit comps in local currency. However, as the U.S. dollar strengthened, we experienced a 30 basis point drag on our consolidated comp due to foreign currency.
For the quarter, gross margin contracted 8 basis points, primarily due to the strength in appliances and outdoor power equipment. 
We leveraged operating salaries in the quarter and delivered earnings per share of $1.20, a 15% increase over last year's second quarter. 
Delivering on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter, we repurchased $1.5 billion of stock under our share repurchase program and paid $218 million in dividends. In May, our Board of Directors approved a 22% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.23 per share to $0.28 per share.
Looking forward to the second half of 2015, key drivers of the home improvement industry remain supportive for growth. Economists are forecasting a modest acceleration in both incomes and consumer spending this year, and recovery in the housing market continues with moderate home price appreciation and stronger gains in housing turnover. 
We also continue to be encouraged by the results of our second quarter Consumer Sentiment Survey. Roughly half of respondents indicated that they believe their home values are increasing, double the number from 2012. And this positive sentiment around home values is reading [ph] through to spending patterns with plans to begin a home improvement project in the next 6 months continuing its recent upward trend. Further, survey respondents indicated that growth in their home improvement spending is outpacing increases in their overall spending, suggesting an affinity -- the strengthening affinity for the home.
Our key priorities in 2015 should allow us to capitalize on opportunities within an improving economy. We are pursuing further top line growth through continued development of omni-channel capabilities, differentiating ourselves through better customer experiences and improving our product and service offering for the Pro customer. We also remain committed to improving our productivity and profitability with opportunities in a few specific areas including store payroll, marketing and leveraging our scale to get cost savings on indirect spend. The execution of our strategic priorities alongside an improving macroeconomic backdrop, together with our keen focus on productivity and profitability, give us confidence in our business outlook for 2015. 
Thanks again for your interest. And with that, let me turn the call over to Rick."

During the second quarter, we recorded our strongest performance in big-ticket categories such as appliances, kitchens, outdoor power equipment and seasonal living. This is a reflection of consumers' increasing desire to invest in their homes as well as the strength of our product offerings in these categories and our evolving omni-channel capabilities. 
In appliances, we drove double-digit comps for the third consecutive quarter. In addition to our leading brands in this category such as Whirlpool, KitchenAid, Bosch, Samsung, LG, Electrolux, Frigidaire and GE, we provide service advantages like delivery and haul away and facilitate in-home repairs and maintenance. We have further strengthened our offering with the home channel exclusive launch of the Frigidaire Pro appliance series and the introduction of 17 kitchen suites. 
And understanding that more than 80% of customers start shopping for appliances online, we have enhanced our presentation on Lowes.com including improved product search, enhanced videos, improved presentation like 360-degree views and simplified product groupings. 
It's no wonder that for the seventh time in the last 8 years, J.D. Power and Associates has ranked Lowe's highest in customer satisfaction among appliance retailers based upon our knowledgeable sales specialists, breadth of assortment, competitive pricing and delivery.
In order to sell the entire kitchen, we display our kitchen products including cabinets and countertops immediately adjacent to our appliance offering. This quarter, we drove above-average comps in kitchens through a combination of targeted promotions and our investment in projects specialists who meet customers in their homes. These employees represent another important element of our omni-channel strategy. We now have project specialists who focus on the exterior of the home available across all U.S. stores. And we're expanding our interior project specialist program into another 470 stores, reaching over 3/4 of our stores by year-end. With our ability to coordinate style, provide design expertise and find the right contractor to do the job, we are rapidly becoming the project authority in home improvement. 
We achieved high single-digit comps in outdoor power equipment with particular strength in walk-behind and riding mowers and pressure washers. We offer a wide range of mowers to help customers maintain their yards, and we continue to provide compelling and exclusive brands and innovations like our innovative Kobalt 80-volt Handheld Outdoor Power Tools, and our home channel exclusive, Hustler Raptor 60-inch Zero-Turn Mowers, a brand landscapers know and trust. 
The outdoor living experience we introduced last year drove strong comps in our seasonal living product category. In fact, our patio and outdoor fashion area recorded strong solid comps again this quarter on top of double-digit comps last quarter assisted by robust attachment of replacement cushions and other outdoor accessories. 
Entering the second half of the year, we will use this seasonal stage to address customer needs for the fall, like planting, leaf removal, home winterization and exterior maintenance. Then as winter arrives, we will help customers refresh their homes for holiday guests, decorate and organize their home after the holidays. We will focus on using this space to provide the inspiration, guidance, products and services that customers need to tackle the projects that are relevant for each micro-season.
Our performance in paint was in line with the industry. We are pleased with the launch of HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams and look forward to building further momentum with this brand. Brand is the #1 purchase driver in paint and Sherwin-Williams is the most recognized brand in the category. We expect the addition of HGTV by Sherwin-Williams to appeal to both DIY and Pro customers. Its long-standing reputation for quality as well as the color expertise of HGTV allows Lowe's to offer customers the top brands they trust for their next paint project. Combined with our outstanding Valspar and PPG/Olympic brand partnerships, we expect to grow traffic to our stores and increase overall market share in paint.
We also continue to strengthen our portfolio of Pro-focused brands. In addition to the brands we rolled out in the first quarter including Goldblatt masonry tools, GAF roofing and Owens Corning insulation, last month we expanded our line of Hitachi pneumatic nailers and fasteners, a home channel exclusive to Lowe's stores nationwide. Lowe's now offers the broadest selection of Hitachi power tools with the latest innovations that deliver lighter, faster and more durable products. 
We continue to collect feedback from our Pro customers and employees to identify other local and national brands that best meet the needs of Pro customers. Along with strengthening our brand portfolio, we officially relaunched LowesForPros.com at the beginning of the second quarter and have seen an increase in use by our Pro customers, in line with our expectations. So far, we have been promoting LowesForPros online and through Pro social media, and in the third quarter, we will begin the formal launch through our Pro Appreciation days as well as other media. 
We continue to actually serve the Pro through our Account Executive ProServices or AEPs. AEPs call in regional customers to help them order and replenish products across multiple stores. We currently have approximately 135 AEPs in the field, an increase of 25 over last year. Our AEPs have been very effective in growing our business with larger Pro customers, especially Maintenance, Repair and Operations or MRO customers. We are pleased with the program's results. Excluding the AEPs we added this year, we saw double-digit second quarter growth in AEP sales, which contributed to solid Pro comp sales growth in the quarter. Our focus on strengthening our portfolio of brands, serving regional Pro customers through AEPs as well as our recent relaunch of LowesForPros.com are part of a broader commitment to build on our strong foundation with the Pro.
In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability. For the quarter, we capitalized on big-ticket market share opportunities with strong growth in categories like appliances and outdoor products, which contributed to a slight decline in gross margin rate, but substantial margin dollar growth. We mitigated the unfavorable mix impact by continuing to partner with our vendors to drive innovation, improve first costs through shared efficiencies and to achieve higher sell-through of seasonal products. 
Our store teams once again effectively managed payroll, increasing sales per hour in line with comps. We continue to leverage our prior technology investments as well as improved selling processes enabled by our customer experience design team. Most importantly, we have achieved this greater payroll efficiency while improving customer satisfaction scores. We also drove productivity in marketing by increasing our presence in targeted digital media and leveraging our investment in MyLowe's. And we continue to identify and implement additional expense efficiencies throughout the year by consolidating the procurement of similar types of goods and services across our corporate and store functions. 
The quarter tested the flexibility and capabilities of our supply chain and we passed that test with flying colors. To meet a heightened demand in the Pacific Northwest where temperatures were unusually warm, our distribution teams worked efficiently to move portable air-conditioners from the Northeast. Likewise, they were instrumental in moving products to Eastern Texas so we could help customers recover from flooding and begin the process of repairing and rebuilding in the wake of storms. 
While inventory at quarter end was up 4% of last year, it reflects our commitment to being in stock for items that are most relevant to our customers. For instance, we ended the second quarter with higher levels of appliances to support exceptionally strong sales as well as higher levels of portable air-conditioning units and grills. We expect to sell through most of the seasonal inventory in the third quarter and to end the year with minimal growth in seasonal -- in inventory per store. 
We are pleased with our agile execution in the second quarter. We continue to make progress on our initiatives to drive top line growth and are focused on improving productivity and profitability. We look forward to sharing further progress with you over the course of the year. 
Thank you for your interest in Lowe's, and I will now turn the call over to Bob."

Sales for the second quarter were $17.3 billion, an increase of 4.5%. The sales increase was driven by both ticket and transactions with total average ticket up 3.3% to $67.83 while total customer transactions grew 1.2%. Comp sales were 4.3% driven by a comp average ticket increase of 3.3% and comp transactions growth of 1%. 
Looking at monthly trends. Comps were 3.6% in May, 4.6% in June and 4.6% in July. In Q2, July 4 fell in fiscal July this year and fiscal June last year. While the shift did not affect comp sales for the quarter, it did impact the monthly spread. We estimate that normalizing for the timing of the holiday, June and July comps would have been 3.9% and 5.8%, respectively. 
Year-to-date total sales of $31.5 billion were up 4.9% versus the first half of 2014 driven by a 4.7% increase in comp sales. 
Gross margin for the second quarter was 34.47% of sales, which decreased 8 basis points from Q2 last year. The decline in gross margin was driven by mix and promotional activity. The mix of products sold, primarily appliances and outdoor power equipment, negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 20 basis points. Also, we have noted our efforts to adjust our promotional calendar to be more competitive with the market. We anniversary-ed this promotional change in the third quarter. The pressure from these items was largely offset by value improvement. Year-to-date gross margin was 34.92% of sales, a decrease of 6 basis points from the first half of 2014.
SG&A for Q2 was 20.94% of sales, which leveraged 39 basis points, which brings leverage in a variety of expenses including store payroll, bonus, maintenance and repairs, utilities, advertising and payroll taxes. These items were somewhat offset by store closing costs of $13 million related to a lease termination for recent relocation as well as updated lease assumptions for stores closed in 2011. 
Also, in the quarter, our Canadian business incurred $4 million of expenses associated with the recent purchase of certain Target assets. This was primarily related to lease termination costs for our existing distribution center as we worked to transition into the larger former Target facility. In addition, there were carrying costs associated with the 12 store leases that we assumed. These 2 items totaled $17 million and impacted EBIT and EPS by 10 basis points and a $0.01 per share, respectively. 
Year-to-date SG&A was 22.39% of sales, which leveraged 48 basis points versus the first half of 2014. 
Depreciation for the quarter was $375 million, which was 2.16% of sales and leveraged 10 basis points. 
In Q2, earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT increased 41 basis points to 11.37% of sales. For the first half of 2015, EBIT was 10.18% of sales, which was 56 basis points higher in the same period last year. 
For the quarter, interest expense was $133 million. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.8%. 
Earnings per share was $1.20 for the second quarter, an increase of 15.4% over last year. For the first 6 months of 2015, earnings per share of $1.90 represented a 15.9% increase over the first half of 2014. The $1.90 was in line with our year-to-date plan.
Now to a few items on the balance sheet starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter was $900 million. 
Our inventory balance of $9.7 billion increased $389 million or 4% versus Q2 last year. As Rick mentioned, the increase was driven by appliances that support sales growth as well as seasonal inventory. Inventory turnover was 3.9, up 16 basis points over last year. 
Asset turnover increased 11 basis points to 1.74. 
Moving onto the liability section of the balance sheet. Accounts payable of $7.1 billion represented a 15% increase over Q2 last year, primarily due to the timing of purchases year-over-year. 
At the end of the second quarter, lease-adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR was 2.08x. Return on invested capital increased 237 basis points for the quarter to 14.98%.
Looking at the statement cash flows. Year-to-date operating cash flow was almost $4.2 billion and capital expenditures were $570 million, resulting in free cash flow of nearly $3.6 billion, which is up 2% to last year. 
In May, we entered into a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement. At this point, we expect to receive approximately 14.5 million shares, but the ultimate number of shares will be determined upon completion of the program in the third quarter. We also repurchased approximately 7.2 million shares for $500 million through the open market. In total, we repurchased $1.5 billion in the quarter. We have approximately $4.9 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization.
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. As Robert noted, the key drivers of the home improvement industry remain supportive for growth. For the year, we expect total sales increase of approximately 4.5% to 5% driven by account sales increase of 4% to 4.5% and the addition of 15 to 20 stores, which includes 5 Orchard and 2 city center locations.
We are anticipating an EBIT increase of 80 to 100 basis points and are targeting 25 to 30 basis points of EBIT expansion per point of comp above 1%. While this is our expectation for the year, there will be some choppiness quarter-to-quarter. 
For the year, we expect most of the EBIT improvement will come from SG&A. Expense leverage will come from store payroll, marketing, bonus and leveraging our scale to achieve cost savings on indirect spend. In addition, we expect fixed cost leverage associated with sales growth. 
Our confidence that flow-through will accelerate in the second half of 2015 is based on a few items: first, gross margin pressure from both the changes in the promotional calendar and mix should dissipate in the second half and we have much easier second half prior year comparisons. Also, in the fourth quarter of 2014, we increased bonus accruals, which should drive leverage in Q4 this year. Lastly, we expect additional leverage from credit as a result of program growth. 
The effective tax rate is expected to be 38.1%. The higher rate relative to 2014 is a result of a settlement of prior tax matters recognized in Q1 2014. The higher tax rate impacts earnings growth by roughly $0.06 per share. 
For the year, we expect earnings per share of approximately $3.29, which represents an increase of 21.4% over 2014. 
We are forecasting cash flow from operations to be approximately $5 billion. 
Our capital forecast for 2015 is now approximately $1.3 billion, which results in an estimated free cash flow of $3.7 billion for 2015. 
We expect to issue incremental debt during the year as we manage to the 2.25x lease-adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR target. 
Our guidance assumes approximately $3.8 billion share repurchases for 2015.
Virginia, we are now ready for questions."

So there's a number of items that gives us confidence that second half flow-through is going to be higher than the first half. I called out 3 in my comments, so let me give you a little bit more color around those 3. I mentioned the promotional calendar and mix pressure dissipating as well as easier compares. If you look at 2014, gross margin improved 42 basis points in the first half of 2014 and declined 6 basis points in the second half, so we do have easier compares in the second half. For 2015, gross margin declined 6 basis points. We expect about 20 basis points of improvement in the second half or roughly a 26 basis point swing. Second, in bonus, for the first half of 2015, we've seen 7 basis points of deleverage in bonus. We expect about 13 basis points of leverage in the second half of 2015 or roughly a 20 basis point swing. Lastly, credit. Credit was flat to 2014 for the first half. We expect about 15 basis points of leverage in the second half of 2015 for a swing of 15 basis points. So those 3 items are the lion's share of what gives us confidence in the flow-through. We do have a couple of other items given timing of projects like facilities, repairs and store enviro projects where the first half was a little bit heavier than second half, but we do have a number of items that we can point to that give us confidence in the second half flow-through."

We've been very pleased with receptivity of the site itself. We're measuring things such as category of products that are being purchased, assortments that are being evaluated. We're looking at the amount of channel pickup: are they picking up in-store, are they picking up through the delivery or is it being parceled. So we think we're very pleased with what we're seeing from that standpoint so far. As Robert said on Lowes.com, we grew roughly 20% in the quarter. And I think that continues to be driven by several factors and one of the most being the new innovation that we're putting on the site itself. When you look at what we've been able to do in the last first half of the year, the patio configuration tool, you've heard me talk about accessories helping the seasonal living categories in the quarter. There's no doubt that, that tool is really helping us from a dot-com standpoint. And then you look at what we've done to really be able to show product differently on the site. We've increased the number of 360-degree product views, another 3,500 items were added during the quarter in Q2, gets us up to roughly 15,000 items where we're able to spin the view of that category. Product videos, we talked about how increasingly the appliance shopper is going to dot-com first to evaluate product categories. We added another 200 videos into that category during the quarter, added 4,000 enhanced images and pictures to the site as well, introduced the search engine capabilities that we're looking at for more intuitive search. And so as a result of that, we saw traffic to Lowes.com increase 19% for the quarter and we saw a slight increase in conversion as well. So when you look at the holistic aspect of the dot-com platform, we feel very good with the innovations we've added, with the technology improvements that we've made. Like I said earlier, with LowesForPros, we're very pleased with what we've seen there. We've actually seen a double-digit increase in new customers to Lowe's that are on the site that had not previously shopped with us before, which is very exciting when we think through the rollout of the site itself."

While our businesses in Canada and Mexico delivered high single-digit comps in local currency, our consolidated comp was negatively impacted by foreign currency translation.
We generated positive comps in 12 of 13 product categories with outdoor power equipment delivering flat comps on top of double-digit comps last year. We had strength in seasonal living as customers took the opportunity to extend the outdoor season, driven by warmer and drier weather early in the quarter. Tools and hardware also performed well as both Pro and DIY customers responding to the improvement we continue to make in our assortment, further enhanced by exciting home center exclusives. And our strong brand and service advantage in appliances continue to drive double-digit comps in the category for the fourth quarter in a row. 
Lastly, our Pro business also performed well as we continue to build deeper relationships for the Pro by enhancing our product and service offering to meet their unique needs.
For the quarter, gross margin expanded 26 basis points, and we effectively controlled expenses, delivering 130 basis points of operating margin expansion and earnings per share of $0.80, a 36% increase over last year's third quarter.
Delivering our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter, we repurchased $750 million of stock under our share repurchase program and paid $260 million in dividends.
We've been working to improve our product and service offering for the Pro customer and differentiating ourselves to better customer experiences that make us the project authority. And we continue to enhance our omni-channel capabilities, transforming our brand from a multichannel offering, in-store, digital, in-home and by phone to 1 omni-channel experience where all of our channels work in concert with one another. To clarify, this transition is about -- this transformation is about much more than growing our e-commerce business. Our efforts were centered around supporting customers at every step of the home improvement journey and building greater affinity for the Lowe's brand. I'm particularly encouraged by the momentum we're gaining through increased engagement with our in-home selling efforts. 
During the third, quarter we expanded our Project Specialist Interiors programs to an additional 475 stores and now offer the program in 1365 stores across the country. Coupled with our Project Specialist Exteriors program, which is available at all U.S. home improvement stores and our highly motivated team of account executive ProServices will continue to strengthen relationships with regional Pro customers, we have a strong outside selling force of more than 3,000 people who are able to meet customers on their terms either in their home or at their place of business.
The execution of our strategic priorities, alongside a favorable macroeconomic backdrop make this an exciting time forward-looking statements. In fact, the forecast for key drivers of the home improvement industry remain conducive for growth at least through 2017. Steady job and income gains coupled with persistent home price appreciation and strengthening homebuying keep home improvement growth buoyant. We continue to be pleased with the results of our quarterly consumer sentiment surveys. Most encouraging this quarter is that the desire to invest in the home continues to grow as survey respondents are indicating that growth in their home improvement spending is outpacing increases in their overall spending. In fact, the number of homeowners indicating that their home improvement spending increased has almost doubled since 2012, boosted by the persisting recovery in home prices.
This trend underscores the opportunity we have to address the needs of 75 million homeowners across the country who are increasingly willing to engage in home improvement projects in addition to the 5 million who relocate or moved into a new home each year.
Before I close, I'd like to express my appreciation for our employees' purposeful commitment to serving customers. In particular, I'd like to thank those Lowe's team members who worked diligently to assist our neighbors that were impacted by the historic flooding in South Carolina. In addition to working round the clock to ensure our stores in the affected communities were able to provide products needed for storm recovery efforts, many of our employees also pledge their time to help individuals in need. Thanks again for your interest. And with that, let me turn the call over to Rick."

The team executed well, driving traffic to our stores growing both transactions and average ticket for the quarter. Our appliance category experienced the strongest growth in the quarter producing double-digit comps. In addition to our leading brands and service advantages in this category, our investments in customer experience are also having an impact both in-store and online. We have further enhanced our appliance offering with the introduction of 17 appliance suites showcasing coordinated appliances, allowing customers to visualize how their appliance purchase will fit into their space not just as a single replacement purchase but as a full set of new appliances. And because we understand that more than 80% of customers begin their appliance purchase by researching and shopping online, we have enhanced our customer experience and presentation on Lowes.com, including improved product search, enhanced videos, upgraded presentation by 360-degree views and simplified product groupings. In fact, J.D. Power and Associates ranked Lowes.com the #1 appliance retail website for 2015. Our continued focus on improving the omni-channel customer experience together with leading brands, breadth of assortment, competitive pricing, knowledgeable sales specialists as well as delivering combined to drive our share gains in appliances.
Seasonal living also outperformed as we effectively anticipated customer needs and capitalized on favorable weather conditions. Warmer weather in the north and west in the first half of the quarter drove strong demand for air conditioners, and we were able to meet that demand, thanks to the flexibility and capabilities of our distribution teams as they worked efficiently to move product. Further, our customer experience-designed capabilities continue to pay dividends. These capabilities were first introduced to the outdoor living experienced showcasing patio and outdoor fashion, which recorded strong comps again this quarter. Along with the strong sales in patio furniture, we continue to see an increase in attachment of related products such as cushions and other outdoor accessories. Our customer experience design capabilities take advantage of our larger store format to produce a showroom feel and create a more shoppable environment, which drives higher customer engagement and stronger attachment rates. The layout and adjacencies also make it easier for store associates to offer a more coordinated project solution to meet customer needs. As we transition to fall, we leverage this capability to create a seasonal stage to anticipate customers' needs for this season by planting, leaf removal and exterior maintenance. And as winter arrives, we will continue to leverage this capability in seasonal stage to help customers refresh their homes for holiday guests, decorate and organize their home after the holidays. This quarter, we also saw above-average comps in tools and hardware, driven by strong demand as well as our expanded offering, including continued innovation from brands such as Stanley Black & Decker, Hitachi, Bosch, Dewalt, and Erwin and improved brand relevance in critical categories like pneumatics with our expanded line of Hitachi pneumatic nailers and fasteners, a home channel exclusive to Lowe's. We recently completed the reset of our pneumatics destination featuring the 3 strongest brands in the category, Hitachi, Bosch and Our nematic brand partnerships make this a good destination for pros and create opportunities to be more relevant to their business.
Our paint performance was in line with the industry with a low single-digit comp. With our launch of HGTV HOME by Sherman Williams at the beginning of the second quarter, we are now providing our customers with top brands they trust for the next paint project. Olympic provides quality at a lower price and easy application. Valspar specializes in color authority with their Love Your Color guarantee and HGTV HOME by Sherman Williams provides a strong brand recognition, designer coordinated colors and quality customers trust. Paint employees are now able to meet the needs of both DIY and Pro customers who have been shopping us for paint sundries and requesting certain Sherman Williams.
We also continue to see strength in our portfolio of Pro-focused brands. In addition to the brands we rolled out in the first half of the year, including Goldblatt masonry tools, GAF roofing, Owens Corning insulation and Lennox AGC, we are proud to introduce interior doors, a key brand that pros know and trust. These new brands continue to build a momentum with the Pro customer and also represent the powerful partnership between our ProServices and merchandising teams as we work together to incorporate Pro feedback into a better offering and experience. This commitment is also evident in the assignment of field-based merchandising managers who are working closely with the Pro customer to identify local market opportunities and introduce products optimize the local norms to be more relevant with a pro.
Along with strengthening our brand portfolio, we relaunched LowesForPros.com at the beginning of the second quarter, making it easy for pros to manage multiple properties and purchase items like appliances for their locations nationwide. This fall omni-channel experience allows pros to easily order online and choose their preferred fulfillment option of parcel, store pickup or store delivery, saving them time and money. We are also reconnecting with pros who have not recently purchased from Lowe's to show them much changed in our stores and online. We're using targeted marketing as well as pro-focused events to drive awareness and generate new business. For example, September was Pro appreciation month. During the event, we offered vendor demonstrations, special values on core Pro products throughout the store and drive awareness of the support we provide like job site delivery and credit offers. Our focus on strengthening our portfolio of brands, serving Pro customers to our account executive ProServices team as well as the recent relaunch of LowesForPros.com are part of a broader commitment to build on our strong foundation with the Pro. In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability. During the third quarter, our store teams once again effectively managed payroll, increasing sales power in line with comps. We continue to leverage our prior investments, optimizing store labor to meet customer demand and continue to focus on shifting more hours to customer-facing roles. Most important, we have achieved this greater payroll efficiency while improving customer satisfaction stores. We also drove productivity in marketing by using a robust set of analytic tools to optimize our media allocation leading to a reduction in print advertising and increase in digital advertising and an expansion of social media, increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of our media and improving our advertising spend, all while maintaining our customer reach and improvement exposure. While we've already seen positive results from this work, media optimization is a multiyear effort and opportunity. 
We also continue to identify and implement additional expense efficiencies by consolidating the procurement of similar types of business services across our corporate and store functions. For example, this year we have worked cross-functionally to streamline the procurement process for supplies used across our stores, distribution centers and our corporate office early. Results are favorable with savings across multiple lines. We have also worked to increase profitability for the services we offer without impacting the customer experience. For example, as part of our appliance offering, we provide service advantages such as free delivery and haul away. This year, as part of our appliance recycling program, we work directly with recyclers to increase recycling income despite a decline in the metals commodity market. As you can see, we are pleased with the third quarter results and the continued progress of our initiatives to drive top line growth, productivity and profitability. We look forward to sharing further progress with you over the coming quarters. Thank you for your interest in Lowe's, and I will now turn the call over to Bob."

The monthly comps were 5.1% in August, 4.8% in September and 3.7% in October, while the monthly 2-year accelerated through the quarter.
Year-to-date sales of $45.8 billion were up 4.9% versus the first 3 quarters of 2014 driven by a 4.6% increase in comp sales and new stores. Gross margin for the third quarter was 34.75% of sales, which increased 26 basis points over Q3 last year. The increase was driven primarily by better sell-through of seasonal products and product cost inflation. Year-to-date gross margin was 34.87% of sales, an increase of 5 basis points over last year.
SG&A for Q3 was 22.89% of sales, which leveraged 91 basis points, driven primarily by 4 items. Advertising expense leveraged 17 basis points as we transitioned to a more efficient and effective media mix. The proprietary credit program leveraged 16 basis points due to continued growth in the program and lower operating costs. Costs associated with building maintenance and repairs leveraged 15 basis points, largely due to the timing of projects as more of them occurred in the first half of the year versus last year.
Store payroll leveraged 13 basis points as we continue to optimize hours against customer traffic. Numerous other expense lines also leveraged as a result of sales growth. Year-to-date SG&A was 22.5% of sales, which leveraged 60 basis points versus last year. Depreciation for the quarter was $375 million, which was 2.61% of sales and leveraged 13 basis points compared to last year's third quarter as a result of sales growth. In Q3, earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT margin increased 130 basis points to 9.25% of sales. For the first 3 quarters of 2015, EBIT margin was 9.89% of sales, which was a 79 -- which was 79 basis points higher than the same period last year. 
For the quarter, interest expense was $141 million which is flat to last year as a percent of sales. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 38%. The earnings were $736 million for the quarter, an increase of 25.8% over Q3 2014. Earnings per share of $0.80 for the third quarter were up 35.6% to last year. For the first 9 months of 2015, earnings per share of $2.70 was in line with our expectations and represented a 20.5% increase over the same period last year. Now to a few items on the balance sheet starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter was just over $1.2 billion. Our inventory balance of $10.4 billion increased  [ph] $672 million or 6.9% versus Q3 last year. The increase was driven by timing associated with seasonal builds. Inventory turnover is 3.85, up 12 basis points over last year. Asset turnover increased 10 basis points to 1.75.
Moving on to liabilities. Accounts payable of $7.3 billion represented a 15.6% [ph] increase over Q3 last year caused by the timing of purchases year-over-year. In the third quarter, we issued $1.75 billion of unsecured bonds. The bonds consistent of 3-, 10- and 30-year issuances with a weighted average interest rate of 3.45%. A portion of the proceeds was used to repay a $500 million obligation in October. At the end of the quarter, we suggested debt EBITDA was 1.27x. Return on invested capital increased 276 basis points for the quarter to 15.78%. Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Operating cash flow was $4.5 billion. Capital expenditures was $844 million resulting in year-to-date free cash flow of $3.7 billion. In September, we entered into a $500 million accelerated shareholders agreement. We expect to receive approximately 7.3 million shares while the number of shares will be determined upon completion of the program in the fourth quarter. We also repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares for $250 million through the open market. In total, we purchased $750 million in the quarter. We have approximately $4.1 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Looking ahead, I'd like to just several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. As Robert the forecast for key drivers of home home improvement industry remained conducive for growth, and as our year-to-date performance is in line with our expectations, we're maintaining our outlook for the year. We expect total sales increase of approximately 4.5% to 5%, driven by comp sales increase of 4% to 4.5% and the addition of 15 to 20 stores, which includes 5 Orchard and 2 city center locations. We're anticipating an EBIT increase of 80 to 100 basis points and are targeting 25 to 30 basis points of EBIT expansion for [indiscernible] comp of [ph] 1%. While this is our expectation for the year, as we've seen, there will be some choppiness quarter-to-quarter. For the year, we expect that most of the EBIT improvement will come from SG&A. Expense leverage will come from store payroll, marketing and leveraging our scale to achieve cost savings on indirect spend. In addition, we expect fixed cost leverage associated with sales growth.
The effective tax rate is expected to be 38.1%. The higher rate relative to 2014 as a result of  settlement and tax matters recognized in Q1 2014. The higher rate negatively impacts earnings growth by roughly $0.06 per share. For the year, we expect earnings per share of approximately $3.29, which represents an increase of 21.4% over 2014. We are forecasting cash flows from operations to approximate $5 billion. Our capital forecast is approximately $1.3 billion, which results in estimated free cash flow $3.7 billion. We will continue to manage to the 2.25 [indiscernible] adjusted debt-to-EBITDA target. Our guidance assumes approximately $3.8 billion in share repurchases for 2015. Regina, we're now ready for questions."

I'm pleased that we delivered another solid quarter with comparable sales growth of 4.6% or 9.7% on a 2-year basis. Our comp growth was balanced with a 2.5% increase in comp transactions and a 2% increase in average ticket. Our U.S. home improvement business achieved 5% comps for the quarter with all 14 regions generating positive comps. While our businesses in Canada and Mexico delivered high single-digit comps in local currency, our consolidated comp was negatively impacted by foreign currency translation.
We generated positive comps in 12 of 13 product categories with outdoor power equipment delivering flat comps on top of double-digit comps last year. We had strength in seasonal living as customers took the opportunity to extend the outdoor season, driven by warmer and drier weather early in the quarter. Tools and hardware also performed well as both Pro and DIY customers responding to the improvements we continue to make in our assortment, further enhanced by exciting home center exclusives. And our strong brand and service advantage in appliances continue to drive double-digit comps in the category for the fourth quarter in a row. 
Lastly, our Pro business also performed well as we continue to build deeper relationships with the Pro by enhancing our product and service offering to meet their unique needs.
For the quarter, gross margin expanded 26 basis points, and we effectively controlled expenses, delivering 130 basis points of operating margin expansion and earnings per share of $0.80, a 36% increase over last year's third quarter.
Delivering our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter, we repurchased $750 million of stock under our share repurchase program and paid $260 million in dividends.
We've been working to improve our product and service offering for the Pro customer and differentiating ourselves through better customer experiences that make us the project authority. And we continue to enhance our omni-channel capabilities, transforming our brand from a multi-channel offering, in-store, digital, in-home and by phone to an omni-channel experience where all of our channels work in concert with one another. To clarify, this transition is -- this transformation is about much more than growing our e-commerce business. Our efforts were centered around supporting customers at every step of the home improvement journey and building greater affinity for the Lowe's brand. I'm particularly encouraged by the momentum we're gaining through increased engagement with our in-home selling efforts. 
During the third, quarter we expanded our Project Specialist Interiors program to an additional 475 stores and now offer the program in 1,365 stores across the country. Coupled with our Project Specialist Exteriors program, which is available at all U.S. home improvement stores, and our highly motivated team of account executive ProServices who continue to strengthen relationships with regional Pro customers, we have a strong outside selling force of more than 3,000 people who are able to meet customers on their terms either in their home or at their place of business.
The execution of our strategic priorities, alongside a favorable macroeconomic backdrop make this an exciting time for Lowe's. In fact, the forecast for key drivers of the home improvement industry remain conducive for growth at least through 2017. Steady job and income gains coupled with persistent home price appreciation and strengthening homebuying should keep home improvement growth buoyant. We continue to be pleased with the results of our quarterly consumer sentiment surveys. Most encouraging this quarter is that the desire to invest in the home continues to grow as survey respondents are indicating that growth in their home improvement spending is outpacing increases in their overall spending. In fact, the number of homeowners indicating that their home improvement spending increased has almost doubled since 2012, boosted by the persisting recovery in home prices.
This trend underscores the opportunity we have to address the needs of 75 million homeowners across the country who are increasingly willing to engage in home improvement projects in addition to the 5 million who relocate or move into a new home each year.
Before I close, I'd like to express my appreciation for our employees' purposeful commitment to serving customers. In particular, I'd like to thank those Lowe's team members who worked diligently to assist our neighbors that were impacted by the historic flooding in South Carolina. In addition to working round the clock to ensure our stores in the affected communities were able to provide products needed for storm recovery efforts, many of our employees also pledge their time to help individuals in need. 
Thanks again for your interest. And with that, let me turn the call over to Rick."
180871,281514793,905887,"Lowe's Companies Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 18, 2015",2015-11-18,"Earnings Calls","Lowe's Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Robert, and good morning.

The team executed well, driving traffic to our stores growing both transactions and average ticket for the quarter. Our appliance category experienced the strongest growth in the quarter producing double-digit comps. 
In addition to our leading brands and service advantages in this category, our investments in customer experience are also having an impact both in-store and online. We have further enhanced our appliance offering with the introduction of 17 appliance suites showcasing coordinated appliances, allowing customers to visualize how their appliance purchase will fit into their space not just as a single replacement purchase but as a full set of new appliances. And because we understand that more than 80% of customers begin their appliance purchase by researching and shopping online, we have enhanced our customer experience and presentation on Lowes.com, including improved product search, enhanced videos, upgraded presentation by 360-degree views and simplified product groupings. In fact, J.D. Power and Associates ranked Lowes.com the #1 appliance retailer website for 2015. Our continued focus on improving the omni-channel customer experience together with leading brands, breadth of assortment, competitive pricing, knowledgeable sales specialists as well as delivery and haul away combined to drive our share gains in appliances.
Seasonal living also outperformed as we effectively anticipated customer needs and capitalized on favorable weather conditions. Warmer weather in the north and west in the first half of the quarter drove strong demand for air conditioners, and we were able to meet that demand, thanks to the flexibility and capabilities of our distribution teams as they worked efficiently to move product. 
Further, our customer experience-designed capabilities continue to pay dividends. These capabilities were first introduced with the outdoor living experience showcasing patio and outdoor fashion, which recorded strong comps again this quarter. Along with the strong sales in patio furniture, we continue to see an increase in attachment of related products such as cushions and other outdoor accessories. 
Our customer experience design capabilities take advantage of our larger store format to produce a showroom feel and create a more shoppable environment, which drives higher customer engagement and stronger attachment rates. The layout and adjacencies also make it easier for store associates to offer a more coordinated project solution to meet customer needs. As we transition to fall, we leverage this capability to create a seasonal stage to anticipate customers' needs for this season by planting, leaf removal and exterior maintenance. And as winter arrives, we will continue to leverage this capability and seasonal stage to help customers refresh their homes for holiday guests, decorate then organize their home after the holidays. 
This quarter, we also saw above-average comps in tools and hardware, driven by strong demand as well as our expanded offering, including continued innovation from brands such as Stanley Black & Decker, Hitachi, Bosch, DEWALT, LENOX and IRWIN, and improved brand relevance in critical categories like pneumatics with our expanded line of Hitachi pneumatic nailers and fasteners, a home channel exclusive to Lowe's. We recently completed the reset of our pneumatics destination featuring the 3 strongest brands in the category, Hitachi, Bostitch and Paslode. Our pneumatic brand partnerships make us a clear destination for pros and create opportunities to be more relevant to their business.
Our paint performance was in line with the industry with a low single-digit comp. With our launch of HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams at the beginning of the second quarter, we are now providing our customers with top brands they trust for their next paint project. Olympic provides quality at a lower price and easy application. Valspar specializes in color authority with their Love Your Color Guarantee, and HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams provides a strong brand recognition, designer coordinated colors and quality customers trust. Paint employees are now able to meet the needs of both DIY and Pro customers who have been shopping us for paint sundries and requesting Sherwin-Williams.
We also continue to see strength in our portfolio of Pro-focused brands. In addition to the brands we rolled out in the first half of the year, including Goldblatt masonry tools, GAF roofing, Owens Corning insulation and Lennox HVAC, we are proud to introduce Masonite entry and interior doors, offering a key brand that pros know and trust. These new brands continue to build a momentum with the Pro customer and also represent the powerful partnership between our ProServices and merchandising teams as we work together to incorporate Pro feedback into a better offering and experience. This commitment is also evident in the assignment of field-based merchandising managers who are working closely with the Pro customer to identify local market opportunities and introduce products optimized to local norms to be more relevant with the Pro.
Along with strengthening our brand portfolio, we relaunched LowesForPros.com at the beginning of the second quarter, making it easy for pros to manage multiple properties and purchase items like appliances for their locations nationwide. This full omni-channel experience allows pros to easily order online and choose their preferred fulfillment option of parcel, store pickup or store delivery, saving them time and money. We are also reconnecting with pros who have not recently purchased from Lowe's to show them what's changed in our stores and online. We're using targeted marketing as well as pro-focused events to drive awareness and generate new business. For example, September was Pro appreciation month. During the event, we offered vendor demonstrations, special values on core Pro products throughout the store and drove awareness of the support we provide like job site delivery and credit offers. 
Our focus on strengthening our portfolio of brands, serving Pro customers through our account executive ProServices team as well as the recent relaunch of LowesForPros.com are part of a broader commitment to build on our strong foundation with the Pro. 
In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability. During the third quarter, our store teams once again effectively managed payroll, increasing sales power in line with comps. We continue to leverage our power investments, optimizing store labor to meet customer demand and continue to focus on shifting more hours to customer-facing roles. Most importantly, we have achieved this greater payroll efficiency while improving customer satisfaction scores. We also drove productivity in marketing by using a robust set of analytic tools to optimize our media allocation, leading to a reduction in print advertising and an increase in digital advertising and an expansion of social media, increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of our media buy and improving our advertising spend, all while maintaining our customer reach and improvement exposure. While we've already seen positive results from this work, media optimization is a multi-year effort and opportunity. 
We also continue to identify and implement additional expense efficiencies by consolidating the procurement of similar types of goods and services across our corporate and store functions. For example, this year, we have worked cross-functionally to streamline the procurement process for supplies used across our stores, distribution centers and our corporate office. Early results are favorable with savings across multiple lines. We have also worked to increase profitability for the services we offer without impacting the customer experience. 
For example, as part of our appliance offering, we provide service advantages such as free delivery in haul away. This year, as part of our appliance recycling program, we work directly with the end-recyclers to increase recycling income despite a decline in the metals commodity market. 
As you can see, we are pleased with the third quarter results and the continued progress of our initiatives to drive top line growth, productivity and profitability. We look forward to sharing further progress with you over the coming quarters. Thank you for your interest in Lowe's, and I will now turn the call over to Bob."

For the quarter, co",998,"Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the third quarter were $14.4 billion, an increase of 5%, driven primarily by comp sales. Total cost per transactions increased 2.8%, and total average ticket increased 2.1% to $67.34. For the quarter, comp sales were 4.6% as comp transactions grew 2.5% and comp average ticket increased 2%.
The monthly comps were 5.1% in August, 4.8% in September and 3.7% in October, while the monthly 2-year stack accelerated through the quarter.
Year-to-date sales of $45.8 billion were up 4.9% versus the first 3 quarters of 2014 driven by a 4.6% increase in comp sales and new stores. Gross margin for the third quarter was 34.75% of sales, which increased 26 basis points over Q3 last year. The increase was driven primarily by better sell-through of seasonal products and product cost inflation. Year-to-date gross margin was 34.87% of sales, an increase of 5 basis points over last year.
SG&A for Q3 was 22.89% of sales, which leveraged 91 basis points, driven primarily by 4 items. Advertising expense leveraged 17 basis points as we transitioned to a more efficient and effective media mix. The proprietary credit program leveraged 16 basis points due to continued growth in the program and lower operating costs. Costs associated with building maintenance and repairs leveraged 15 basis points, largely due to the timing of projects as more of them occurred in the first half of the year versus last year.
Store payroll leveraged 13 basis points as we continue to optimize hours against customer traffic. Numerous other expense lines also leveraged as a result of sales growth. Year-to-date SG&A was 22.55% of sales, which leveraged 60 basis points versus last year. Depreciation for the quarter was $375 million, which was 2.61% of sales and leveraged 13 basis points compared to last year's third quarter as a result of sales growth. 
In Q3, earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT margin increased 130 basis points to 9.25% of sales. For the first 3 quarters of 2015, EBIT margin was 9.89% of sales, which was a 79 -- which was 79 basis points higher than the same period last year. 
For the quarter, interest expense was $141 million which is flat to last year as a percent of sales. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 38%. 
Net earnings were $736 million for the quarter, an increase of 25.8% over Q3 2014. Earnings per share of $0.80 for the third quarter were up 35.6% to last year. For the first 9 months of 2015, earnings per share of $2.70 was in line with our expectations and represented a 20.5% increase over the same period last year. 
Now to a few items on the balance sheet starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter was just over $1.2 billion. Our inventory balance of $10.4 billion increased $672 million or 6.9% versus Q3 last year. The increase was driven by timing associated with seasonal builds. Inventory turnover is 3.85, up 12 basis points over last year. Asset turnover increased 10 basis points to 1.75.
Moving on to liabilities. Accounts payable of $7.3 billion represented a 13.6% increase over Q3 last year caused by the timing of purchases year-over-year. In the third quarter, we issued $1.75 billion of unsecured bonds. The bonds consisted of 3-, 10- and 30-year issuances with a weighted average interest rate of 3.45%. A portion of the proceeds was used to repay a $500 million obligation in October. At the end of the quarter, lease-adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR was 2.17x. Return on invested capital increased 276 basis points for the quarter to 15.78%. 
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Operating cash flow was $4.5 billion. Capital expenditures was $844 million resulting in year-to-date free cash flow of $3.7 billion. In September, we entered into a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. We expect to receive approximately 7.3 million shares but the ultimate number of shares will be determined upon completion of the program in the fourth quarter. We also repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares for $250 million through the open market. In total, we purchased $750 million in the quarter. We have approximately $4.1 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. As Robert noted, the forecast for key drivers of home improvement industry remained conducive for growth. And as our year-to-date performance is in line with our expectations, we are maintaining our outlook for the year. We expect the total sales increase of approximately 4.5% to 5% driven by comp sales increase of 4% to 4.5% and the addition of 15 to 20 stores, which includes 5 Orchard and 2 city center locations. We're anticipating an EBIT increase of 80 to 100 basis points and are targeting 25 to 30 basis points of EBIT expansion  per point of comp above 1%. While this is our expectation for the year, as we've seen, there will be some choppiness quarter-to-quarter. 
For the year, we expect that most of the EBIT improvement will come from SG&A. Expense leverage will come from store payroll, marketing and leveraging our scale to achieve cost savings on indirect spend. In addition, we expect fixed cost leverage associated with sales growth.
The effective tax rate is expected to be 38.1%. The higher rate relative to 2014 is a result of  settlement of prior tax matters recognized in Q1 2014. The higher rate negatively impacts earnings growth by roughly $0.06 per share. For the year, we expect earnings per share of approximately $3.29, which represents an increase of 21.4% over 2014. 
We are forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $5 billion. Our capital forecast is approximately $1.3 billion, which results in estimated free cash flow $3.7 billion. We will continue to manage to the 2.25x lease-adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR target. Our guidance assumes approximately $3.8 billion in share repurchases for 2015. 
Regina, we're now ready for questions."

But it was a significant increase over what we had seen last year on the third quarter. And as you know, Simeon, it doesn't always turn into action, so it's a leading indicator. But we think that the -- you look at what's happening in the overall microenvironment and we look at what's happening with home prices, it once again speaks to the fact that consumers are reengaging in discretionary spending around the home.

If you really think about it from where we had peaked our operating margins previously to where we're at today and trying to come back in on that, we really are a totally different company. If you think about back in those days, it was single channel. We were on a more rapid expansion of the store footprint, we think the store is still the nucleus of our relationship with the customer, but the store in and of itself was not enough. We really have to be there on an omni-channel basis for the customers. So that's why everything we've been investing in for the past few years is really to be able to deliver that omni-channel offerings, so that we take those stores, we continue to build on those leverage, and we -- the PSI, PSE programs that we just talked about, whether it's the improvements that we've made on dot-com, whether it's all the improvements that we've made with the Pro customer to really get us back to before, whether we can look at other opportunities to try and grow that top line. So certainly, we expect to continue to have gross margin -- I mean, operating margin improvement, continue to have nice flow-through that will drive our comp sales improvement like the guidance that we've given you, but we will continue to look at how the other opportunities -- as the consumer changes the way the consumer wants to interact with us changes, what are the other opportunities where we can do things that will continue to allow us to pursue opportunities for growth, particularly, in a recovering market and the affinity that we're seeing with the consumer around investing in the homes. So whether it's stuff like LowesForPros.com that we invested in because we know that that's a key gap that we had there, whether it's rolling out the additional PSI programs like we added this quarter in the store, you'll see us looking at ways that we can continue to make sure that we're corresponding to where the customer wants to go and will -- whatever that ends up being will end up evaluating that, but also use the base stores we have to continue to drive nice flow-throughs."

That's where we've seen good momentum with HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams. We've got a great relationship with Valspar and with PPG with the Olympic brands. We've leaned pretty heavy into some promotions around paint as you should have seen. Our overall promotional cadence year-over-year is about the same, but we direct a little more towards paint, and we're pretty excited about our paint lineup. But that said, the industry is below the average, and we're running about average with the industry."

I'm pleased that we delivered another solid quarter with comparable sales growth of 4.6% or 9.7% on a 2-year basis. Our comp growth was balanced with a 2.5% increase in comp transactions and a 2% increase in average ticket. Our U.S. home improvement business achieved 5% comps for the quarter with all 14 regions generating positive comps. While our businesses in Canada and Mexico delivered high single-digit comps in local currency, our consolidated comp was negatively impacted by foreign currency translation.
We generated positive comps in 12 of 13 product categories with outdoor power equipment delivering flat comps on top of double-digit comps last year. We had strength in seasonal living as customers took the opportunity to extend the outdoor season, driven by warmer and drier weather early in the quarter. Tools and hardware also performed well as both Pro and DIY customers responded to the improvements we continue to make in our assortment, further enhanced by exciting home center exclusives. And our strong brand and service advantage in appliances continue to drive double-digit comps in the category for the fourth quarter in a row. 
Lastly, our Pro business also performed well as we continue to build deeper relationships with the Pro by enhancing our product and service offering to meet their unique needs.
For the quarter, gross margin expanded 26 basis points, and we effectively controlled expenses, delivering 130 basis points of operating margin expansion and earnings per share of $0.80, a 36% increase over last year's third quarter.
Delivering our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter, we repurchased $750 million of stock under our share repurchase program and paid $260 million in dividends.
We've been working to improve our product and service offering for the Pro customer and differentiating ourselves through better customer experiences that make us the project authority. And we continue to enhance our omni-channel capabilities, transforming our brand from a multi-channel offering, in-store, digital, in-home and by phone to an omni-channel experience where all of our channels work in concert with one another. To clarify, this transition is -- this transformation is about much more than growing our e-commerce business. Our efforts were centered around supporting customers at every step of the home improvement journey and building greater affinity for the Lowe's brand. I'm particularly encouraged by the momentum we're gaining through increased engagement with our in-home selling efforts. 
During the third quarter we expanded our Project Specialist Interiors program to an additional 475 stores and now offer the program in 1,365 stores across the country. Coupled with our Project Specialist Exteriors program, which is available at all U.S. home improvement stores, and our highly motivated team of account executive ProServices who continue to strengthen relationships with regional Pro customers, we have a strong outside selling force of more than 3,000 people who are able to meet customers on their terms either in their home or at their place of business.
The execution of our strategic priorities alongside a favorable macroeconomic backdrop make this an exciting time for Lowe's. In fact, the forecast for key drivers of the home improvement industry remain conducive for growth at least through 2017. Steady job and income gains coupled with persistent home price appreciation and strengthening homebuying should keep home improvement growth buoyant. We continue to be pleased with the results of our quarterly consumer sentiment surveys. Most encouraging this quarter is that the desire to invest in the home continues to grow as survey respondents are indicating that growth in their home improvement spending is outpacing increases in their overall spending. In fact, the number of homeowners indicating that their home improvement spending increased has almost doubled since 2012, boosted by the persisting recovery in home prices.
This trend underscores the opportunity we have to address the needs of 75 million homeowners across the country who are increasingly willing to engage in home improvement projects in addition to the 5 million who relocate or move into a new home each year.
Before I close, I'd like to express my appreciation for our employees' purposeful commitment to serving customers. In particular, I'd like to thank those Lowe's team members who worked diligently to assist our neighbors that were impacted by the historic flooding in South Carolina. In addition to working round the clock to ensure our stores in the affected communities were able to provide products needed for storm recovery efforts, many of our employees also pledged their time to help individuals in need. 
Thanks again for your interest. And with that, let me turn the call over to Rick."

The team executed well, driving traffic to our stores growing both transactions and average ticket for the quarter. Our appliance category experienced the strongest growth in the quarter producing double-digit comps. 
In addition to our leading brands and service advantages in this category, our investments in customer experience are also having an impact both in-store and online. We have further enhanced our appliance offering with the introduction of 17 appliance suites showcasing coordinated appliances, allowing customers to visualize how their appliance purchase will fit into their space not just as a single replacement purchase but as a full set of new appliances. And because we understand that more than 80% of customers begin their appliance purchase by researching and shopping online, we have enhanced our customer experience and presentation on Lowes.com, including improved product search, enhanced videos, upgraded presentation by 360-degree views and simplified product groupings. In fact, J.D. Power and Associates ranked Lowes.com the #1 appliance retailer website for 2015. Our continued focus on improving the omni-channel customer experience together with leading brands, breadth of assortment, competitive pricing, knowledgeable sales specialists as well as delivery and haul away combined to drive our share gains in appliances.
Seasonal living also outperformed as we effectively anticipated customer needs and capitalized on favorable weather conditions. Warmer weather in the north and west in the first half of the quarter drove strong demand for air conditioners, and we were able to meet that demand, thanks to the flexibility and capabilities of our distribution teams as they worked efficiently to move product. 
Further, our customer experience design capabilities continued to pay dividends. These capabilities were first introduced with the outdoor living experience showcasing patio and outdoor fashion, which recorded strong comps again this quarter. Along with the strong sales of patio furniture, we continue to see an increase in attachment of related products such as cushions and other outdoor accessories. 
Our customer experience design capabilities take advantage of our larger store format to produce a showroom feel and create a more shoppable environment, which drives higher customer engagement and stronger attachment rates. The layout and adjacencies also make it easier for store associates to offer a more coordinated project solution to meet customer needs. As we transition to fall, we leverage this capability to create a seasonal stage to anticipate customers' needs for the season like planting, leaf removal and exterior maintenance. And as winter arrives, we will continue to leverage this capability and seasonal stage to help customers refresh their homes for holiday guests, decorate then organize their home after the holidays. 
This quarter, we also saw above-average comps in tools and hardware, driven by strong demand as well as our expanded offering, including continued innovation from brands such as Stanley Black & Decker, Hitachi, Bosch, DEWALT, LENOX and IRWIN, and improved brand relevance in critical categories like pneumatics with our expanded line of Hitachi pneumatic nailers and fasteners, a home channel exclusive to Lowe's. We recently completed the reset of our pneumatics destination featuring the 3 strongest brands in the category, Hitachi, Bostitch and Paslode. Our pneumatic brand partnerships make us a clear destination for pros and create opportunities to be more relevant to their business.
Our paint performance was in line with the industry with a low single-digit comp. With our launch of HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams at the beginning of the second quarter, we are now providing our customers with top brands they trust for their next paint project. Olympic provides quality at a lower price and easy application. Valspar specializes in color authority with their Love Your Color Guarantee, and HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams provides a strong brand recognition, designer coordinated colors and quality customers trust. Paint employees are now able to meet the needs of both DIY and Pro customers who have been shopping us for paint sundries and requesting Sherwin-Williams.
We also continue to see strength in our portfolio of Pro-focused brands. In addition to the brands we rolled out in the first half of the year, including Goldblatt masonry tools, GAF roofing, Owens Corning insulation and Lennox HVAC, we are proud to introduce Masonite entry and interior doors, offering a key brand that pros know and trust. These new brands continue to build a momentum with the Pro customer and also represent the powerful partnership between our ProServices and merchandising teams as we work together to incorporate Pro feedback into a better offering and experience. This commitment is also evident in the assignment of field-based merchandising managers who are working closely with the Pro customer to identify local market opportunities and introduce products optimized to local norms to be more relevant with the Pro.
Along with strengthening our brand portfolio, we relaunched LowesForPros.com at the beginning of the second quarter, making it easy for pros to manage multiple properties and purchase items like appliances for their locations nationwide. This full omni-channel experience allows pros to easily order online and choose their preferred fulfillment option of parcel, store pickup or store delivery, saving them time and money. We are also reconnecting with pros who have not recently purchased from Lowe's to show them what's changed in our stores and online. We're using targeted marketing as well as pro-focused events to drive awareness and generate new business. For example, September was Pro Appreciation month. During the event, we offered vendor demonstrations, special values on core Pro products throughout the store and drove awareness of the support we provide like job site delivery and credit offers. 
Our focus on strengthening our portfolio of brands, serving Pro customers through our account executive ProServices team as well as the recent relaunch of LowesForPros.com are part of a broader commitment to build on our strong foundation with the Pro. 
In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability. During the third quarter, our store teams once again effectively managed payroll, increasing sales power in line with comps. We continue to leverage our power investments, optimizing store labor to meet customer demand and continue to focus on shifting more hours to customer-facing roles. Most importantly, we have achieved this greater payroll efficiency while improving customer satisfaction scores. We also drove productivity in marketing by using a robust set of analytic tools to optimize our media allocation, leading to a reduction in print advertising and an increase in digital advertising and an expansion of social media, increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of our media buy and improving our advertising spend, all while maintaining our customer reach and improvement exposure. While we've already seen positive results from this work, media optimization is a multi-year effort and opportunity. 
We also continue to identify and implement additional expense efficiencies by consolidating the procurement of similar types of goods and services across our corporate and store functions. For example, this year, we have worked cross-functionally to streamline the procurement process for supplies used across our stores, distribution centers and our corporate office. Early results are favorable with savings across multiple lines. We have also worked to increase profitability for the services we offer without impacting the customer experience. 
For example, as part of our appliance offering, we provide service advantages such as free delivery and haul away. This year, as part of our appliance recycling program, we work directly with the end-recyclers to increase recycling income despite a decline in the metals commodity market. 
As you can see, we are pleased with the third quarter results and the continued progress of our initiatives to drive top line growth, productivity and profitability. We look forward to sharing further progress with you over the coming quarters. Thank you for your interest in Lowe's, and I will now turn the call over to Bob."

Total cost per transactions increased 2.8%, and total average ticket increased 2.1% to $67.34. For the quarter, comp sales were 4.6% as comp transactions grew 2.5% and comp average ticket increased 2%.
The monthly comps were 5.1% in August, 4.8% in September and 3.7% in October, while the monthly 2-year stack accelerated through the quarter.
Year-to-date sales of $45.8 billion were up 4.9% versus the first 3 quarters of 2014 driven by a 4.6% increase in comp sales and new stores. Gross margin for the third quarter was 34.75% of sales, which increased 26 basis points over Q3 last year. The increase was driven primarily by better sell-through of seasonal products and product cost deflation. Year-to-date gross margin was 34.87% of sales, an increase of 5 basis points over last year.
SG&A for Q3 was 22.89% of sales, which leveraged 91 basis points, driven primarily by 4 items. Advertising expense leveraged 17 basis points as we transitioned to a more efficient and effective media mix. The proprietary credit program leveraged 16 basis points due to continued growth in the program and lower operating costs. Costs associated with building maintenance and repairs leveraged 15 basis points, largely due to the timing of projects as more of them occurred in the first half of the year versus last year.
Store payroll leveraged 13 basis points as we continue to optimize hours against customer traffic. Numerous other expense lines also leveraged as a result of sales growth. Year-to-date SG&A was 22.55% of sales, which leveraged 60 basis points versus last year. Depreciation for the quarter was $375 million, which was 2.61% of sales and leveraged 13 basis points compared to last year's third quarter as a result of sales growth. 
In Q3, earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT margin increased 130 basis points to 9.25% of sales. For the first 3 quarters of 2015, EBIT margin was 9.89% of sales, which was a 79 -- which was 79 basis points higher than the same period last year. 
For the quarter, interest expense was $141 million which is flat to last year as a percent of sales. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 38%. 
Net earnings were $736 million for the quarter, an increase of 25.8% over Q3 2014. Earnings per share of $0.80 for the third quarter were up 35.6% to last year. For the first 9 months of 2015, earnings per share of $2.70 was in line with our expectations and represented a 20.5% increase over the same period last year. 
Now to a few items on the balance sheet starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter was just over $1.2 billion. Our inventory balance of $10.4 billion increased $672 million or 6.9% versus Q3 last year. The increase was driven by timing associated with seasonal builds. Inventory turnover is 3.85, up 12 basis points over last year. Asset turnover increased 10 basis points to 1.75.
Moving on to liabilities. Accounts payable of $7.3 billion represented a 13.6% increase over Q3 last year caused by the timing of purchases year-over-year. In the third quarter, we issued $1.75 billion of unsecured bonds. The bonds consisted of 3-, 10- and 30-year issuances with a weighted average interest rate of 3.45%. A portion of the proceeds was used to repay a $500 million obligation in October. At the end of the third quarter, lease-adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR was 2.17x. Return on invested capital increased 276 basis points for the quarter to 15.78%. 
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Operating cash flow was $4.5 billion. Capital expenditures was $844 million resulting in year-to-date free cash flow of $3.7 billion. In September, we entered into a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. We expect to receive approximately 7.3 million shares but the ultimate number of shares will be determined upon completion of the program in the fourth quarter. We also repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares for $250 million through the open market. In total, we purchased $750 million in the quarter. We have approximately $4.1 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. 
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. As Robert noted, the forecast for key drivers of home improvement industry remained conducive for growth. And as our year-to-date performance is in line with our expectations, we are maintaining our outlook for the year. We expect a total sales increase of approximately 4.5% to 5% driven by comp sales increase of 4% to 4.5% and the addition of 15 to 20 stores, which includes 5 Orchard and 2 city center locations. We're anticipating an EBIT increase of 80 to 100 basis points and are targeting 25 to 30 basis points of EBIT expansion per point of comp above 1%. While this is our expectation for the year, as we've seen, there will be some choppiness quarter-to-quarter. 
For the year, we expect that most of the EBIT improvement will come from SG&A. Expense leverage will come from store payroll, marketing and leveraging our scale to achieve cost savings on indirect spend. In addition, we expect fixed cost leverage associated with sales growth.
The effective tax rate is expected to be 38.1%. The higher rate relative to 2014 is a result of  settlement of prior tax matters recognized in Q1 2014. The higher rate negatively impacts earnings growth by roughly $0.06 per share. For the year, we expect earnings per share of approximately $3.29, which represents an increase of 21.4% over 2014. 
We are forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $5 billion. Our capital forecast is approximately $1.3 billion, which results in estimated free cash flow of $3.7 billion. We will continue to manage to the 2.25x lease-adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR target. Our guidance assumes approximately $3.8 billion in share repurchases for 2015. 
Regina, we're now ready for questions."

So when that package arrives, it will tell the employee the exact aisle and bay location that product stops. So as you imagine, tremendous efficiency for newer employees and try to manage and navigate our stores makes the whole process much more effective, much more efficient.

Both of those had -- both of those programs had double-digit comps in the quarter. So appliances, PSI, PSE, all running double-digit comps in the quarter.

When you think about it from where we had peaked our operating margins previously to where we're at today and trying to hone back in on that, we really are a totally different company. If you think about back in those days, it was single channel. We were on a rapid expansion of the store footprint, we think the store is still the nucleus of our relationship with the customer, but the store in and of itself is not enough. We really have to be there on an omni-channel basis for the customers. So that's why everything we've been investing in for the past few years is really to be able to deliver that omni-channel offering, so that we take those stores, we continue to build on those and leverage, and we -- the PSI, PSE programs that we just talked about, whether it's the improvements that we've made on dot-com, whether it's all the improvements that we've made with the Pro customer to really get us back to the fore, whether we can look at other opportunities to try and grow that top line. So certainly, we expect to continue to have gross margin -- I mean, operating margin improvement, continue to have nice flow-through that will drive our comp sales improvement like the guidance that we've given you, but we will continue to look at how are the other opportunities -- as the consumer changes, the way the consumer wants to interact with us changes, what are the other opportunities where we can do things that will continue to allow us to pursue opportunities for growth, particularly in a recovering market and the affinity that we're seeing with the consumer around investing in the homes. So whether it's stuff like LowesForPros.com that we invested in because we know that that was a key gap that we had there, whether it's rolling out the additional PSI programs like we added this quarter in the store, you'll see us looking at ways that we can continue to make sure that we're responding to where the customer wants to go and will -- whatever that ends up being, we'll end up evaluating that, but also use the base stores we have to continue to drive nice flow-throughs."
