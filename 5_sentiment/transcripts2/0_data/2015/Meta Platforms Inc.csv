Overall, 2014 wa",1358,"Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone for joining today. This has been a great quarter for Facebook and a great end to the year. Our community continue to grow in size and engagement and we're very pleased with the growth of our business. Overall, 2014 was a year of great progress for the Facebook community, 1.39 billion people now use Facebook each month, and 890 million people daily, an increase of 165 million monthly actives and 133 million daily active this year. Time spent per person per day across our services continue to rise, growing this quarter by more than 10% compared to last year, and that doesn't even include WhatsApp which joined us late last year. These milestones show that our community continues to get stronger. But it's not just our committee where we've made a lot of progress. 2014 was another year of big investments in our future. This year, we made big bets on the next generation of communication and computing platforms by acquiring WhatsApp and Oculus. We focused on serving our community better across all of our products, raising the quality and relevance of content in News Feed, improving our search in video products and improving the performance and efficiency of our mobile apps. And we continue to invest in our employees and infrastructure, growing our headcount by 45% this year and opening our newest data center in November in Iowa.
When you consider the progress of our community and our investments, 2014 was an important year for us and a good sign of how we're thinking about the future. In the next decade, Facebook is focused on our mission to connect the entire world, welcoming billions people to our community and connecting many more people to the Internet through Internet.org. To serve the entire world, we need to build products that serve our community and allow people to share different types of content with different audiences. We need to offer new services and infrastructure at greater scale, and we need to create new tools and innovate to solve fundamental challenges in the places they want to connect.
Doing this will take a lot of effort doing the years and Facebook is going to have to evolve. Similar to our transition to mobile over the last couple of years, now we want to really focus on serving everyone in the world. Our mission has always been to make the world more open and connected. So this is something we've been preparing for over the last decade. Everything we've achieved in 2014 and over the last 10 years has helped us to build the foundation for a future of greater scale. I'm excited for our progress in 2015.
Now with that in mind, I want to talk about the things that we expect to execute on over the next 3, 5 and 10 years. Over the next 3 years, our main focus is to continue to serve and grow our community by delivering better services for people and businesses around the world. One sign of our continued growth and engagement is our progress on visual and public content. More than 2 billion photos are now shared daily across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. Video grew significantly this year to an average of more than 3 million views per day on Facebook. And we now have more than 2 billion interactions every week on Facebook between public figures and their fans.
Instagram is also growing in helping people share and consume the most engaging content in different communities across the world. Instagram reached 300 million monthly actives with more than 70% outside of the U.S. Average time spent using the app continues to be very strong compared to other mobile services. Across Facebook and Instagram, we've done a very good job of engagement, especially when it comes to helping people find and consume content they like. In 2015, we'll continue working on this, as well as developing more ways for people to share even more of the moments they care about on Facebook. 5 years ago, most of the content shared on Facebook was text and some photos. Today, it's primarily photos with some text and videos. Over the next 5 years, we want to keep developing new products and features to help people share the way they want.
When it comes to serving businesses, we've continued to help drive results for our businesses of every size around the world. Last week, a Deloitte report found that in 2014, Facebook created more than $225 billion of global economic impact and 4.5 million new jobs. This is an important reminder of the big opportunity we have to create value for businesses, and why we're committed to serving them well. In 2014, we invested aggressively in improving our Ad Tech and measurement tools, and we're going to continue working to provide new capabilities for marketers. Sheryl will talk about this more in a moment.
Next, let's talk about our efforts over the next 5 years to build the next generation of Facebook services. We expect WhatsApp and Messenger to connect hundreds of millions of more people and become indispensable services for the world, as well as important contributors to our business. Messenger and WhatsApp recently achieved impressive new milestones. In November, Messenger reached 500 million monthly actives, and in the beginning of January, WhatsApp reached 700 million monthly actives with more than 30 billion messages sent each day. These numbers speak to the quality of both products and the size of the opportunity ahead to help billions of people communicate and collaborate.
Search at Facebook is another important effort that we expect to create a lot of value over the next few years. And this quarter, we launched update to Facebook Search to make it easier to find content and post on mobile and desktop. We're going to continue listing to feedback from our community and taking the time to build a really valuable product here. We're optimistic about our ability to deliver value that only Facebook is able to provide.
Working with developers is the other part of our strategy. And this quarter, we continue to make progress with helping developers build, grow and monetize their apps. In October, we rolled out our Audience Network around the world. And since then, the number of apps in the network has nearly tripled, and impressions served by the network have more than quadrupled. In 2015, we'll continue to build upon our long-term goal of making Facebook mutually cross-platform platform that allows developers to share their work across every major mobile platform, and we look forward to sharing more details at our next FA event in San Francisco this March.
Finally, let's talk about our plans over the next decade to connect everyone to the Internet through Internet.org and to develop the next generation of computing platforms Oculus. Internet.org now has a lot of momentum, and we've launched 3 basic Internet services in Zambia, Tanzania, Ghana, Kenya and Colombia. More than 150 million people living in these countries now have the option to connect to the Internet using Internet.org. And we've already connected 6 million of them to the Internet who didn't have access before.
We're very excited by Internet.org's progress, and the level of interest we're seeing across industries, governments and our community. 2015 is going to be an important year for our long-term plans, and I expect us to share more updates about our progress here over the coming months.
Oculus continues to make progress towards the future of immersive VR experiences that are part of daily life for millions of people. This month, the team had another good showing at CES and developer interest in Oculus platform continues to grow. 
So that's my update for this quarter. It's been a good quarter and the good and an important year for us. I want to thank everyone in our Facebook community and our employees, our partners and our stockholders for their support. Thanks to you, our community is growing stronger everyday, and we're making progress towards making the entire world more open and connected. Thanks, and now here's Sheryl."

The Q4 ad revenue grew 53% year-over-year. Our mobile a",962,"Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. [indiscernible] was strong across the board having a great year. This is our first quarter with over $3 billion in ad revenue and over $2 billion in mobile ad revenue. The Q4 ad revenue grew 53% year-over-year. Our mobile ad revenue were 69% of the total ad revenue and doubled in the past year. Our growth is strong across all verticals and marketer segments. We also saw healthy growth around the world, although growth rates outside the U.S. were affected by exchange rates.
Looking back at 2014, our teams made great progress on our 3 main priorities: Capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of marketers using our ad products and making our ads more relevant. We believe that the marketing -- that the market increasingly understands that we have the leading mobile ad product and are the only platform that delivers people-based marketing and scale.
The shift to mobile is changing the way people consume video. As Mark said, video grew genetically on Facebook in 2014, especially around global events like the World Cup and the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge. In just one year, the number of videos posts per person on Facebook increased 75% globally and 94% in the U.S. Today, over 50% of people in the U.S. who come to Facebook daily watch at least 1 video per day. And globally, over 65% of Facebook video views occur on mobile. Marketers have followed this trend and are using video to help people discover and learn about their brands.
In Q4, we expanded autoplay video ads internationally. During the holiday season, we saw many clients telling their stories creatively through video.
2014 was also the year we began scaling Instagram ads. In Q4, we rolled out Instagram ads in Australia and Canada. Marketers are excited to have access to the 300 million people who use Instagram and the creatively it inspires. We're seeing beautiful, creative and great results from brand marketers across verticals from insurance and tax to retail entertainment. For example, another Instagram video advertisers, Banana Republic developed a series of videos to promote its new VR clothing line. The video showed fashion sets from the new collection and over 23 point list and add recall. While it's still early and we are being delivered in our rollout, we believe that Instagram will become core to advertisers' mobile brand building efforts.
We also made progress going the number of marketers using our ad products. Custom Audiences, our suite of proprietary targeting products, has become an essential tool for segmenting current and potential customers. Conversion tracking is a way from marketers to measure the impact of the complaints online is also seeing wider adoption. We've made it easier for businesses of all sizes to plan and manage their ad campaigns and for small businesses to use our targeting tools. Travel company, Thomas Cook, recently used Facebook in Belgium to reach a broad audience and use Custom Audiences to send targeted messages to existing customers based on the place they expressed interest in. They reached 30% of the Belgian population in just one day, and achieved a 3.85x return on investment. Results like these are attracting more marketers of all kinds to our platform.
Finally, we made great progress in improving ad relevance and measurement. To do this, we made significant investments in both our core measurement and targeting tools, as well as Ad Tech. Earlier in 2014, we introduced ad buying capabilities based on frequency metrics, which is similar to how brand marketers buy TV ads and therefore enables better cost comparison. We improved our ads manager product to give better insight into ad campaigns audiences and impact.
In the fall, we relaunched Atlas to help marketers reach real people and measure results across multiple devices. Omnicom was our first global client and this month, we announced a partnership with Havast [ph] to further expand globally. We also invested in Audience Network, which help marketers expand their campaign off of Facebook and LiveRail, which provides publishers with video tools to monetize their inventory more efficiently.
Hopping into 2015, we're excited to build on the progress that he made on our core ad products as well as the newer areas like video, Instagram and Ad Tech. It's still early days and all of these efforts. This a lot of hard work to do, and we plan to invest aggressively.
Our ultimate goal is to be a critical business partner at our clients, providing people-based marketing at scale to build their brands and use their products off shelves. Over the past few weeks, I've had a chance to meet with many of our largest global clients and agency partners and talk about how we can drive real business results for them, making every impression count and every dollar they spend improve their bottom line. Our clients are excited by the opportunity to use video, Instagram and ads on and off Facebook to reach the right people with the right message. In turn, as their ads become more relevant, we provide a better experience for the people who use Facebook.
Coming off our biggest year ever, I want to say a special thank you to the Facebook teams around the world, to our global sales engineering, product design and infrastructure team, your accomplishments over the past year are the reason our business is such a great place. To our entire company, I feel lucky to work with you as we stay focused on our priorities and work together to help connect the world. And to our clients, thank you for your partnership and your trust in us.
Heading into 2015, we have big opportunities and a lot of work ahead. Thanks, and now here is Dave."
20765463,281186151,750438,"Facebook, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2015",2015-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Meta Platforms, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone.

We are very pleased with the continuing growth of o",1181,"Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Q4 wrapped up a strong year for Facebook. In 2014, our revenue grew 58% to approximately $12.5 billion, and we generated over $3.6 billion in free cash flow. We are very pleased with the continuing growth of our network. In December, the number of people using Facebook on an average day increased by 18% compared to last year to 890 million. The daily number represents 64% of the 1.39 billion people who use Facebook during the month. Mobile remains the primary driver of our growth. We ended the year with 1.19 billion people using Facebook on mobile in the month. We also continue to see solid growth with Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp recently crossing 300 million, 500 million and 700 million MAU, respectively.
Turning now to the financials. All of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. In addition, as a reminder, our non-GAAP measures excludes stock-based compensation and the amortization of intangibles. Total revenue in Q4 was $3.9 billion, up 49% or 53% on a constant currency basis. Given how significantly exchange rates have continued to move, we anticipate that this currency headwind will increase in 2015, and will give more color on this later in the call.
Ad revenue was $3.6 billion, up 53% or 58% on a constant currency basis. Mobile ad revenue in Q4 doubled to $2.5 billion or 69% of ad revenue compared to approximately $1.2 billion or 53% of ad revenue last year.
Desktop ad revenue was up approximately 1% despite the fact that overall desktop usage was down. In Q4, the average price per ad increased 335%, while total ad impressions declined 65%. Similar to last quarter, these price volume trends were primarily driven by the redesign of our right-hand column ads, which rolled out in the third quarter.
Total payments and fees revenue was $257 million, up 7%. Note that the growth was driven by revenue from acquisitions made in the past year. On an organic basis, payments revenue from games, which represents the substantial majority of our payments and other fees revenue, declined 10% compared to last year. As previously noted, we expect this trend to continue as desktop usage declines.
Turning now to expenses. Our Q4 total GAAP expenses were $2.7 billion, up 87% and non-GAAP expenses were $1.6 billion, up 50%. GAAP expense growth was driven primarily by significant stock-based compensation and amortization expenses related to the WhatsApp acquisition.
Non-GAAP expense growth was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related costs, cost of revenue and marketing expenses. On a full year basis, our 2014 GAAP expenses were $7.4 billion, up 47% and our non-GAAP expenses were $5.3 billion, up 34%. We ended the year with roughly 9,200 employees, up 45%. Overall, we remain very pleased with our ability to attract and retain top-tier talent.
GAAP operating income was $1.1 billion in Q4, representing a 29% operating margin, down from 44% last year, again primarily due to expenses related to our recent large acquisitions. Non-GAAP operating income was $2.2 billion in Q4, representing a 58% operating margin consistent with the margin last year.
Interest and other income and expense was a net expense of $19 million in Q4 versus a net expense of $3 million in Q4 last year. This increase in expense was primarily due to foreign exchange losses resulting from the periodic remeasurement of our foreign currency balances during the period.
In Q4, we benefited from the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. Our GAAP tax rate was 37%, or would have been approximately 32% excluding the benefit of the tax credit. Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was 31% and would have been approximately 32% excluding this benefit. Q4 net income was $701 million or $0.25 per share and non-GAAP net income was $1.5 billion or $0.54 per share. In 2014, we spent $1.8 billion on CapEx and generated over $3.6 billion of free cash flow. We ended 2014 with $11.2 billion in cash and investments and a net operating loss carryforward of approximately $4.5 billion.
Turning now to the outlook, let me start with revenue. We are still in the early stages building out many aspects of our ads business and we remain optimistic about our long-term opportunities. Looking at 2015, there are a couple of things I want to note. The first involves how the reason movements in exchange rates might impact our 2015 revenue. Assuming exchange rates were to remain constant at today's levels, we would expect that our total revenue in 2015 would be approximately 5% lower than it would be under 2014 exchange rates. Note this 5% represents the expected reduction in 2015 total revenue, not the reduction in the year-over-year growth rate. And second, we're reporting revenue from Atlas, LiveRail and the Audience Network on a net, not a gross basis, so the growth in those products will have less of an impact on our overall reported revenue growth in 2015.
Turning now to expenses. We are tightening our ranges modestly given the greater visibility into 2015 spending. We expect that our full year 2015 total GAAP expenses will increase 55% to 70% compared to 2014. We expect that our 2015 total non-GAAP expenses will increase 50% to 65%.
A simple way of thinking about our investments is across 3 categories: People, product and infrastructure. On the people side, we enter 2015 with 45% more employees than we did a year ago, and we will continue to invest in and grow the talent base throughout the year. In terms of product, we're investing to build great experiences for people, marketers and developers, ranging from our existing products and services to new initiatives such as ad tech, Internet.org, Oculus and WhatsApp. We'll also invest in marketing to support all these initiatives, which as I noted, was a driver of expense growth in Q4.
Turning to infrastructure. We continue to build out our global infrastructure to enable billions of people around the world to connect, message and share with each other. We'll be investing in data centers, our network and servers to grow our existing services and support newer initiatives such as video and our global connectivity efforts through Internet.org. We anticipate our 2015 CapEx will be in the neighborhood of $2.7 billion to $3.2 billion.
We expect stock-based compensation for 2015 to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.3 billion, approximately half of which is related to our prior acquisitions, most notably WhatsApp.
We expect amortization expenses for 2015 to be approximately $700 million to $800 million. And finally, we anticipate our Q1 and full year 2015 GAAP tax rates to be in the mid to high 40s, and non-GAAP rates to be in the mid to high 30s.
In summary, Q4 caps off a great year for Facebook in which we executed well and also made some very important investments for our future. In 2015, we are focused on continuing to execute on the business and investing in our long-term mission and success.
With that, Courtney, let's open up the call for questions."

And then, Dave, I just wanted to follow-up on your question about total expense guidance. Because in the past, you've given us 5-point range, I believe, for total expenses. And this year, it's 15, granted you did tighten it, which we appreciate. And just wondering the parameters around how we think about the low end versus the high end."

And I would say that people remain really excited about Facebook, but people are bigger believers because we've had an opportunity to do more measurement over the past year. So I think there are 2 things about the Facebook platform that are really exciting for brand marketers. The first is the creativity in storytelling, and certainly, as you mentioned, video is a big part of that because video is a format that marketers have used for a long time to build emotional connection to brands. And the second is measurement. And the clients want and what they should what is an ability to look at their ad spend and see how effective it is, not just in the brand less metrics, even though those are important, but in moving products off shelves. And over the past 1.5 years, the investments we have made in building out that measurement have paid off. So when I sit down with client at the beginning of this year compared to last year, we have more actual case studies of marketing we've done with them. We have been able to A-B test, Facebook ads versus no Facebook ads and what the effectiveness is on their sales. And I think across the board, we're showing very healthy, very competitive ROI. The opportunity and the challenge now is to sell. Even for our largest clients globally, we still represent a really small part of what they do, and so it's on us to prove to them that the results we're showing them in these smaller tests can happen in more brands, more countries with a larger part of their business."

So our view on this is that there is a lot of unique content that people have shared in Facebook, a lot of personal content, recommendations from friends that you can get that you wouldn't be able to get from a traditional web servers or other apps. And we're on this multi-year voyage to basically index all the content and make it available to people and rank it well. We started off by launching Graph Search which, I think, included more than at 1 trillion different connections in the system. And the second round of the search progress that we just started rolling out at the end of last year was post search, which now have indexed more than, I think, 1 trillion posts. Which I mean -- the sizes of these purposes are bigger than anything in the traditional web search purpose that you'd find. So it's an interesting and fun challenge to make this work. We're seeing that the people immediately understand how they can use this and find content that they've seen in News Feed before or that they've posted we just a few key words, and we're excited about that, but there's a lot more work to be do. So I'll say were not thinking about advertising on that yet. On the scale that our community operates 1 billion searches per day is actually not that big compared to what we think the opportunity here should be, and we're just continuing to keep on working on it because there's a lot of unique value that people should be able to get from their friends on Facebook through Search."

So what we're seeing, and I alluded to this a bit in my opening remarks, is that there's been this evolution of content on Facebook over the last 10 years towards richer formats that convey more of the moments that people care about. So if you go back 5 years ago, a lot of Facebook was primarily text, right, with a little bit of photos. Now I think the primary mode that people are using to share is photos. And I wouldn't be surprised if in the future that shifted more and more towards videos. So we're thinking about how to enable the consumption first of the content that people were sharing. And this year, an increased focus on new opportunities around production that way, it's easier for people to capture moment that are important to them, create higher quality moment and pieces of content out of those and increase their experiences through that. So there's a lot more to do here and I think that this is going to be one of the big trends over the next 3 or 5 years, the growth in video and richer content in our service."

When you think about what's happening, certainly the growth has been good, but it's still true that marketing dollars have not followed consumer time and the same percentages. So in the U.S., mobile gets 25% of consumer media time, but only 10% of the ad budgets. And to take one comparable example, that means that for every consumer hour spent on print, marketers spend $1 and they spend $0.07 per hour on mobile, which means that we have an opportunity to grow. One of the most important ways we grow is not just bringing more marketers into Facebook, having them use more of our ad products, but as you mentioned, better targeting. A more relevant ad is a better at experience for consumers, but also drives a much higher return for marketers. And since we're running at an auction, as our ads get more relevant and we provide higher ROI, we should be able to continue to grow. I think we've done -- the job over the last year making our ads more relevant, I think those people on this call would say that you see more relevant ads than you used to a year ago, but I still think some of the Facebook ads still has room for improvement in terms of relevance, and so we see a lot of room for improvement there, both on the ROI would deliver and in the experience we can provide consumers."

In terms of the product developments that we do here, we have 4 major groups inside the company. This is kind of how our company is organized, it's we have one which is focused on growing the community; one which is focused on kind of increasing content consumption and on people's engagement; another which is focused on kind of efficiency and helping people get the most value out of each moment that they're spending in Facebook; and then the fourth group is our core business, which is focused on helping people to see the best ads and they basically, make the most money per moment that people are spending at the lowest cost and most efficiency in terms of serving people. And there's I think, big upside in each of those 4 categories. I mean, our community is growing. I mentioned in my comments up on that time spent across our services is growing by -- grew by 10% year-over-year, per person which is pretty meaningful. Utility and efficiency are increasing and, of course, the ad business per person and the efficiency of our services are both increasing as well. So I'm pretty excited about that and think we're organized in a way where we can continue executing at that. The other opportunity is Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, I'm really excited about it, and I do think that they're going to reach the level where they contribute to our business in a pretty big way. But it's really important to get this right and not rush it. And what I'd say around messaging is we're pretty early in that cycle. We're about where Facebook was in around 2006 or 2007. Where at that point, Facebook is just really a consumer product. There were no business was an ecosystem, and a lot of people were telling us, okay, go put better ads in. And that's not wrong. I thought that was the right way to build a product or build the business. Instead, what we did was we built pages, which was a way for businesses to interact for free in the system and start creating organic interactions between people and businesses so we could figure out what the people using Facebook wanted from businesses within Facebook. And we built more tools for pages and businesses to engage. And our recent success with advertising is really just built on some of those organic interactions between people and businesses. And what you see in Messenger and WhatsApp now is we're still a bit in the early end of that curve where their interaction is still primarily people to people, and businesses are starting to figure out in the case of WhatsApp, much less than Messenger so far, with the organic interaction is. But we're going to have to go through a whole cycle of figuring out how that works before really make sense to start monetizing them in a big way. But yes, I'm a big fundamental believer that means is going to be very big contributors to our businesses over time, but we just have to do it right."

We don't get close to that in terms of anyone's marketing spend or the time they spend. What we say to our clients over and over again is that we want to drive the business, and that's probably the most important thing we're doing with the large North American spiders is around the measurement work we've done. Two years ago, we were not able to measure all the way through to purchase off the shelves and now we can. Yesterday, we rolled out a product recall list, which is really that's next generation of our measurement capability, and enables large customers to grow in and set up ads with control test groups so that they can AB test. These group of people saw a Facebook ad, these group of people didn't, and they can measure all the way through the conversion of whatever their measure, whether it's an online conversion to a sale. We think that the measurement out there online and digitally is not particularly accurate. People don't have a real-time based. Our investments in Atlas and through our investments for the core set of measurement tools, we think if we can show the ROI marketers they're getting and we can increasingly do so, we can continue to penetrate the North American market."

So that's a big reason why you see the U.S. doing much better, as well as the fact that's just a more advanced marketing what we've done in terms of just building up the advertiser base and getting adoption of our best targeting products, as Sheryl was talking about. Going to your question on pricing growth, I'd just reiterate what I said in my comments. It's largely due to the right-hand column redesign and then also the shift to mobile where we don't show right-hand column ads, so that's what's really causing the pricing shift. Just fundamentally, we continue to get better at targeting. That drives better engagement. And as a get better engagement, that drives better ROI for our advertisers, which ultimately, I think as Sheryl commented on earlier, gets reflected in better pricing for our ads, and that's a big opportunity for us, and we are seeing that you're getting better and better in driving engagement from the ad units that we have in getting the right and in front of the right person.

If there wasn't consumer of video on Facebook, video ads in your News Feed would be very jarring. As a percentage of the videos you're seeing, video ads into that experience. I don't think it matters as much what the video content is, and so while we're certainly exploring some premium content as you said, we have an NFL Verizon test out there in the public eye, we're already seeing pretty explosive growth without that kind of premium content in the system in large numbers, and so we'll continue to figure out. We're certainly open to increasing video content either way but we haven't quite figured out what the mix needs to be, and right now the growth is very strong. In terms of Atlas, we just relaunched this fall and we're just seeing as deals get done in broad adoption, so I think it's too soon for us to report that Atlas drives an increase in digital spend or an increase in any particular kind of spend. But here's what we believe really deeply, which is that Atlas is going to revitalize marketing by making the measurement more accurate. If you look at how digital ads are being measured, they're being measured based on a cookie-based world that assumes that people have one device largely a PC, and that's not just true. Consumers have phones, they have tablet, they have PCs as well, and the ability to understand that that's one person to serve an ad and measure all the way through correctly, we think, is going to massively improve efficiency in the system as it gets adopted."

So I do think that over the long term, that focusing on helping connect everyone will be a good business opportunity for us as well. We may not be able to tell you exactly how many years that's going to happen in, but as these countries get more connected, the economies grow, the ad markets grow and if Facebook and the other services in our community are the #1 and #2, 3, 4, 5 services that are people are using, then over time, we will be compensated with some of the value that we provided.

So taking your second part first, we're not really making investment decision on short-term fluctuations in currencies, so I would say in general though, it's not affecting those decisions. There are certainly big macro effects that are going on, and part of those is what's driving a lot of the currency fluctuations as well. So you have regions that are certainly growing more quickly and regions that are growing more slowly. So from the macro perspective, maybe the United States is doing better in terms of growth versus Europe, versus Latin America. You see those compounded in both currency and sort of macroeconomic conditions in those regions. So I'd say generally, we've got more favorable market conditions in which are operated in the U.S. Overall, I would say the businesses driven by the fundamentals of continuing to execute against our plan. So whether you're in a market that's suffering a little bit from a macroeconomic headwind, we still have the best mobile products in the market, in that market and we're growing.

So when John and team joined us, one of the first things that we agreed on and why, I think, it made sense for them to join is now that they can focus for a few years on getting to one million more of an ad and continuing to scale beyond that. SMS is an incredibly global and universal product, and I think WhatsApp just has a huge opportunity to serve billions of people. In terms of what the business looks like, I mean, at the end of the day, it's a distribution business like Facebook and Instagram. How you most effectively convert that into business opportunities for customers, whether that's through payments or ads or other different kinds of structures, we'll figure that out what the optimal thing will be. But the first order of thing to do is to help serve billions of people here, help continue to increase engagement. And if people are spending a lot of time in WhatsApp, sending more than 30 billion messages a day, which is really crazy when you think about the volume there compared to the global SMS volume overall. And I think if we do that, there'll be a number of opportunities. I mean, people asked me this question a while ago that without about games on Facebook as well, and I always thought about our business on desktop even though it's payment, is actually the same thing as our business on mobile around app install and engagement. What developers ask for is distribution. And whether they're doing that through payments or ads or whatever it is, it kind of is all the same. The most important thing is to help people connect, help people and businesses connect and create business opportunities, and then you get a small amount of the value that you're creating on top. So that will play's out over the next set of years, and it's one of the intellectual challenges that I'm really looking forward to tackling."

Overall, 201",1365,"Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone, for joining today. This has been a good quarter for Facebook and a great end to the year. Our community continued to grow in size and engagement, and we're very pleased with the growth of our business. 
Overall, 2014 was a year of great progress for the Facebook community, 1.39 billion people now use Facebook each month and 890 million people daily, an increase of 165 million monthly actives and 133 million daily active this year. Time spent per person per day across our services continued to rise, growing this quarter by more than 10% compared to last year. And that doesn't even include WhatsApp, which joined us late last year. 
These milestones show that our community continues to get stronger. But it's not just our committee where we've made a lot of progress. 2014 was also a year of big investments in our future. This year, we made big bets on the next generation of communication and computing platforms by acquiring WhatsApp and Oculus. We focused on serving our community better across all of our products, raising the quality and relevance of content in News Feed, improving our search and video products and improving the performance and efficiency of our mobile apps. And we continue to invest in our employees and infrastructure, growing our headcount by 45% this year and opening our newest data center in November in Altoona, Iowa.
When you consider the progress of our community and our investments, 2014 was an important year for us and a good sign of how we're thinking about the future. In the next decade, Facebook is focused on our mission to connect the entire world, welcoming billions of people to our community and connecting many more people to the Internet through Internet.org. To serve the entire world, we need to build products that serve our community and allow people to share different types of content with different audiences. We need to offer new services and infrastructure at greater scale, and we need to create new tools and innovate to solve fundamental challenges in the places we want to connect.
Doing this will take a lot of effort over the coming years, and Facebook is going to have to evolve. Similar to our transition to mobile over the last couple of years, now we want to really focus on serving everyone in the world. Our mission has always been to make the world more open and connected. So this is something we've been preparing for over the last decade. Everything we've achieved in 2014 and over the last 10 years has helped us to build the foundation for our future of greater scale. I'm excited for our progress in 2015.
Now with that in mind, I want to talk about the things that we expect to execute on over the next 3, 5 and 10 years. Over the next 3 years, our main focus is to continue to serve and grow our community by delivering better services for people and businesses around the world. One sign of our continued growth and engagement is our progress on visual and public content. More than 2 billion photos are now shared daily across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. Video grew significantly this year to an average of more than 3 billion video views per day on Facebook. So we now have more than 2 billion interactions every week on Facebook between public figures and their fans.
Instagram is also growing and helping people share and consume the most engaging content in different communities across the world. Instagram reached 300 million monthly actives with more than 70% outside of the U.S. Average time spent using the app continues to be very strong compared to other mobile services. Across Facebook and Instagram, we've done a very good job on engagement, especially when it comes to helping people find and consume content they like. In 2015, we'll continue working on this, as well as developing more ways for people to share even more of the moments they care about on Facebook. 5 years ago, most of the content shared on Facebook was text and some photos. Today, it's primarily photos with some text and video. Over the next 5 years, we want to keep developing new products and features to help people share the way they want.
When it comes to serving businesses, we've continued to help drive results for businesses of every size around the world. Last week, a Deloitte report found that in 2014, Facebook created more than $225 billion of global economic impact and 4.5 million new jobs. This is an important reminder of the big opportunity we have to create value for businesses and why we're committed to serving them well. In 2014, we invested aggressively in improving our ad tech and measurement tools. We're going to continue working to provide new capabilities for marketers. Sheryl will talk about this more in a moment.
Next, let's talk about our efforts over the next 5 years to build the next generation of Facebook services. We expect WhatsApp and Messenger to connect hundreds of millions of more people and become indispensable services for the world, as well as important contributors to our business. Messenger and WhatsApp recently achieved impressive new milestones. In November, Messenger reached 500 million monthly actives, and in the beginning of January, WhatsApp reached 700 million monthly actives with more than 30 billion messages sent each day. These numbers speak to the quality of both products and the size of the opportunity ahead to help billions of people communicate and collaborate.
Search at Facebook is another important effort that we expect to create a lot of value over the next few years. And this quarter, we launched update to Facebook Search to make it easier to find content and posts on mobile and desktop. We're going to continue listening to feedback from our community and taking the time to build a really valuable product here. We're optimistic about our ability to deliver value that only Facebook is able to provide.
Working with developers is the other part of our strategy. And this quarter, we continue to make progress with helping developers build, grow and monetize their apps. In October, we rolled out our Audience Network around the world. And since then, the number of apps in the network has nearly tripled and impressions served by the network have more than quadrupled. In 2015, we'll continue to build upon our long-term goal of making Facebook a truly cross-platform platform that allows developers to share their work across every major mobile platform, and we look forward to sharing more details at our next F8 event in San Francisco this March.
Finally, let's talk about our plans over the next decade to connect everyone to the Internet through Internet.org and to develop the next generation of computing platforms with Oculus. Internet.org now has a lot of momentum, and we've launched 3 basic Internet services in Zambia, Tanzania, Ghana, Kenya and Colombia. More than 150 million people living in these countries now have the option to connect to the Internet using Internet.org. And we've already connected 6 million of them to the Internet who didn't have access before.
We're very excited by Internet.org's progress and the level of interest we're seeing across industries, governments and our community. 2015 is going to be an important year for our long-term plans, and I expect us to share more updates about our progress here over the coming months.
Oculus continues to make progress towards the future of immersive VR experiences that are part of daily life for millions of people. This month, the team had another good showing at CES, and developer interest in Oculus platform continues to grow. 
So that's my update for this quarter. It's been a good quarter and a good end to an important year for us. I want to thank everyone in our Facebook community and our employees, our partners and our stockholders for their support. Thanks to you, our community is growing stronger every day, and we're making progress towards making the entire world more open and connected. 
Thanks, and now here's Sheryl."

This is our first quarter with over $3 billion in ad revenue and over $2 billion in mobile ad revenue. Our Q4 ad revenue grew 53% year-over-year. Our mobile ad revenue was 69% of the total ad revenue and doubled in the past year. Our growth is strong across all verticals and marketer segments. We also saw healthy growth around the world, although growth rates outside the U.S. were affected by exchange rates.
Looking back at 2014, our teams made great progress on our 3 main priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of marketers using our ad products and making our ads more relevant. We believe that the marketing -- that the market increasingly understands that we have the leading mobile ad product and are the only platform that delivers people-based marketing at scale.
The shift to mobile is changing the way people consume video. As Mark said, video grew genetically on Facebook in 2014, especially around global events like the World Cup and the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge. In just 1 year, the number of video posts per person on Facebook increased 75% globally and 94% in the U.S. Today, over 50% of people in the U.S. who come to Facebook daily watch at least 1 video per day. And globally, over 65% of Facebook video views occur on mobile. Marketers have followed this trend and are using video to help people discover and learn about their brands.
In Q4, we expanded autoplay video ads internationally. During the holiday season, we saw many clients telling their stories creatively through video.
2014 was also the year we began scaling Instagram ads. In Q4, we rolled out Instagram ads in Australia and Canada. Marketers are excited to have access to the 300 million people who use Instagram and the creativity it inspires. We're seeing beautiful, creative and great results from brand marketers across verticals, from insurance and tech to retail and entertainment. For example, as one of our first Instagram video advertisers, Banana Republic developed a series of videos to promote its new BR clothing line. The video showed fashion sketches from the new collection and drove a 23-point lift in ad recall. While it's still early and we're being deliberate in our rollout, we believe that Instagram will become core to advertisers' mobile brand building efforts.
We also made progress growing the number of marketers using our ad products. Custom Audiences, our suite of proprietary targeting products, has become an essential tool for segmenting current and potential customers. Conversion tracking, a way for marketers to measure the impact of their campaigns online, is also seeing wider adoption. We've made it easier for businesses of all sizes to plan and manage their ad campaigns and for small businesses to use our targeting tools. 
Travel company, Thomas Cook, recently used Facebook in Belgium to reach a broad audience and use Custom Audiences to send targeted messages to existing customers based on the places they had expressed interest in. They reached 30% of the Belgian population in just 1 day and achieved a 3.85x return on investment. Results like these are attracting more marketers of all kinds to our platform.
Finally, we made great progress improving ad relevance and measurement. To do this, we made significant investments in both our core measurement and targeting tools, as well as ad tech. Earlier in 2014, we introduced the ad buying capabilities based on reach and frequency metrics, which is similar to how brand marketers buy TV ads and therefore enables better cross-comparison. We improved our Ads Manager product to give better insight into ad campaign's audience and impact.
In the fall, we relaunched Atlas to help marketers reach real people and measure results across multiple devices. Omnicom was our first global client, and this month, we announced a partnership with Havas to further expand globally. We also invested in an Audience Network, which helps marketers extend their campaigns off of Facebook, and LiveRail, which provides publishers with video tools to monetize their inventory more efficiently.
Heading into 2015, we're excited to build on the progress we've made with our core ad products, as well as with newer areas like video, Instagram and Ad Tech. It's still early days in all of these efforts. There's a lot of hard work to do, and we plan to invest aggressively.
Our ultimate goal is to be a critical business partner to our clients, providing people-based marketing at scale to build their brands and move their products off shelves. Over the past few weeks, I've had a chance to meet with many of our largest global clients and agency partners and talk about how we can drive real business results for them, making every impression count and every dollar they spend improve their bottom line. Our clients are excited by the opportunity to use video, Instagram and ads on and off Facebook to reach the right people with the right message. In turn, as their ads become more relevant, we provide a better experience for the people who use Facebook.
Coming off our biggest year ever, I want to say a special thank you to the Facebook teams around the world. To our global sales engineering, product design and infrastructure teams, your accomplishments over the past year are the reason our business is in such a great place. To our entire company, I feel lucky to work with you as we stay focused on our priorities and work together to help connect the world. And to our clients, thank you for your partnership and your trust in us. Heading into 2015, we have big opportunities and a lot of work ahead. 
Thanks, and now here is Dave."
20765463,281186151,750543,"Facebook, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2015",2015-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Meta Platforms, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Q4 wrapped up a strong year for Facebook. In 2014, our revenue grew 58% to approximately $12.5 billion, and we generated over $3.6 billion in free cash flow. We are very pleased with the continuing growth of o",1185,"Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Q4 wrapped up a strong year for Facebook. In 2014, our revenue grew 58% to approximately $12.5 billion, and we generated over $3.6 billion in free cash flow. We are very pleased with the continuing growth of our network. In December, the number of people using Facebook on an average day increased by 18% compared to last year to 890 million. The daily number represents 64% of the 1.39 billion people who use Facebook during the month. Mobile remains the primary driver of our growth. We ended the year with 1.19 billion people using Facebook on mobile in the month. We also continue to see solid growth with Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, recently crossing 300 million, 500 million and 700 million MAU, respectively.
Turning now to the financials. All of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. In addition, as a reminder, our non-GAAP measures exclude stock-based compensation and the amortization of intangibles. Total revenue in Q4 was $3.9 billion, up 49% or 53% on a constant currency basis. Given how significantly exchange rates have continued to move, we anticipate that this currency headwind will increase in 2015. And we'll give more color on this later in the call.
Ad revenue was $3.6 billion, up 53% or 58% on a constant currency basis. Mobile ad revenue in Q4 doubled to $2.5 billion or 69% of ad revenue compared to approximately $1.2 billion or 53% of ad revenue last year. Desktop ad revenue was up approximately 1% despite the fact that overall desktop usage was down. 
In Q4, the average price per ad increased 335%, while total ad impressions declined 65%. Similar to last quarter, these price volume trends were primarily driven by the redesign of our right-hand column ads, which rolled out in the third quarter.
Total payments and other fees revenue was $257 million, up 7%. Note that the growth was driven by revenue from acquisitions made in the past year. On an organic basis, payments revenue from games, which represents the substantial majority of our payments and other fees revenue, declined 10% compared to last year. As previously noted, we expect this trend to continue as desktop usage declines.
Turning now to expenses. Our Q4 total GAAP expenses were $2.7 billion, up 87%, and non-GAAP expenses were $1.6 billion, up 50%. GAAP expense growth was driven primarily by significant stock-based compensation and amortization expenses related to the WhatsApp acquisition. Non-GAAP expense growth was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related costs, cost of revenue and marketing expenses. On a full year basis, our 2014 GAAP expenses were $7.4 billion, up 47%, and our non-GAAP expenses were $5.3 billion, up 34%. 
We ended the year with roughly 9,200 employees, up 45%. Overall, we remain very pleased with our ability to attract and retain top-tier talent.
GAAP operating income was $1.1 billion in Q4, representing a 29% operating margin, down from 44% last year, again primarily due to expenses related to our recent large acquisitions. Non-GAAP operating income was $2.2 billion in Q4, representing a 58% operating margin, consistent with the margin last year.
Interest and other income and expense was a net expense of $19 million in Q4 versus a net expense of $3 million in Q4 last year. This increase in expense was primarily due to foreign exchange losses resulting from the periodic remeasurement of our foreign currency balances during the period.
In Q4, we benefited from the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. Our GAAP tax rate was 37% but would have been approximately 42% excluding the benefit of the tax credit. Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was 31% and would have been approximately 32% excluding this benefit. 
Q4 net income was $701 million or $0.25 per share, and non-GAAP net income was $1.5 billion or $0.54 per share. In 2014, we spent $1.8 billion on CapEx and generated over $3.6 billion of free cash flow. We ended 2014 with $11.2 billion in cash and investments and a net operating loss carryforward of approximately $4.5 billion.
Turning now to the outlook. Let me start with revenue. We are still in the early stages building out many aspects of our ads business, and we remain optimistic about our long-term opportunities. Looking at 2015, there are a couple of things I want to note. The first involves how the recent movements in exchange rates might impact our 2015 revenue. Assuming exchange rates were to remain constant at today's levels, we would expect that our total revenue in 2015 would be approximately 5% lower than it would be under 2014 exchange rates. Note this 5% represents the expected reduction in 2015 total revenue, not the reduction in the year-over-year growth rate. And second, we're reporting revenue from Atlas, LiveRail and the Audience Network on a net, not a gross basis, so the growth in those products will have less of an impact on our overall reported revenue growth in 2015.
Turning now to expenses. We are tightening our ranges modestly given the greater visibility into 2015 spending. We expect that our full year 2015 total GAAP expenses will increase 55% to 70% compared to 2014. We expect that our 2015 total non-GAAP expenses will increase 50% to 65%.
A simple way of thinking about our investments is across 3 categories: people, product and infrastructure. On the people side, we entered 2015 with 45% more employees than we did a year ago, and we will continue to invest in and grow the talent base throughout the year. In terms of product, we are investing to build great experiences for people, marketers and developers, ranging from our existing products and services to newer initiatives such as ad tech, Internet.org, Oculus and WhatsApp. We'll also invest in marketing to support all of these initiatives, which as I noted, was a driver of expense growth in Q4.
Turning to infrastructure. We continue to build out our global infrastructure to enable billions of people around the world to connect, message and share with each other. We will be investing in data centers, our network and servers to grow our existing services and support newer initiatives such as video and our global connectivity efforts through Internet.org. We anticipate our 2015 CapEx will be in the neighborhood of $2.7 billion to $3.2 billion.
We expect stock-based compensation for 2015 to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.3 billion, approximately half of which is related to our prior acquisitions, most notably WhatsApp. We expect amortization expenses for 2015 to be approximately $700 million to $800 million. And finally, we anticipate our Q1 and full year 2015 GAAP tax rates to be in the mid to high 40s and non-GAAP rates to be in the mid to high 30s.
In summary, Q4 capped off a great year for Facebook in which we executed well and also made some very important investments for our future. In 2015, we are focused on continuing to execute on the business and investing in our long-term mission and success.
With that, Courtney, let's open up the call for questions."

And then, Dave, I just wanted to follow-up on your question about total expense guidance. Because in the past, you've given a 5-point range, I believe, for total expenses. And this year, it's 15, granted you did tighten it, which we appreciate. And just wondering the parameters around how we think about the low end versus the high end."

And I would say that people remain really excited about Facebook, but people are bigger believers because we've had an opportunity to do more measurement over the past year. So I think there are 2 things about the Facebook platform that are really exciting for brand marketers. The first is the creativity and storytelling. And certainly, as you mentioned, video is a big part of that because video is a format that marketers have used for a long time to build emotional connection to brands. And the second is measurement. And what clients want and what they should want is an ability to look at their ad spend and see how effective it is not just in the brand lift metrics, even though those are important, but in moving products off shelves. And over the past 1.5 years, the investments we have made in building out that measurement have paid off. So when I sit down with clients at the beginning of this year compared to last year, we have more actual case studies of marketing we've done with them. We have been able to AB [ph] test Facebook ads versus no Facebook ads and what the effectiveness is on their sales. And I think across the board, we're showing very healthy, very competitive ROI. The opportunity and the challenge now is to sell. Even for our largest clients globally, we still represent a really small part of what they do. And so it's on us to prove to them that the results we're showing them in these smaller tests can happen in more brands, more countries with a larger part of their business."

So our view on this is that there's a lot of unique content that people have shared in Facebook, a lot of personal content, recommendations from friends that you can get that you just wouldn't be able to get through a traditional web search service or other apps. And we're on this multi-year voyage to basically index all the content and make it available to people and rank it well. We started off by launching Graph Search, which I think included more than at 1 trillion different connections in the first system. And the second round of the search progress that we just started rolling out at the end of last year was post search, which now had indexed more than, I think, 1 trillion posts, which, I mean, these -- the sizes of these corpuses are bigger than anything in the traditional web search corpus that you'd find. So it's an interesting and fun challenge to make this work. We're seeing that the people immediately understand how they can use this and find content that they've seen in News Feed before or that they've posted with just a few key words. And we're excited about that, but there's a lot more work to do. So I'd say we're not really thinking about advertising in it yet. On the scale that our community operates 1 billion searches per day is actually not that big compared to what we think the opportunity here should be, and we're just continuing to keep on working on it because there's just a lot of unique value that people should be able to get from their friends on Facebook through search."

So if you go back 5 years ago, a lot of Facebook was primarily text, right, and a little bit of photos. Now I think the primary mode that people are using to share is photos. And I wouldn't be surprised if in the future that shifted more and more towards videos. So we're thinking about how to enable the consumption first of the content that people were sharing. And this year, an increased focus on new opportunities around production so that way, it's easier for people to capture moments that are important to them, create higher-quality moment and pieces of content out of those and increase their experiences through that. So there's a lot more to do here, and I think that this is going to be one of the big trends over the next 3 to 5 years, is the growth in video and richer content in our service."

When you think about what's happening, certainly the growth has been good, but it's still true that marketing dollars have not followed the consumer time and the same percentages. So in the U.S., mobile gets 25% of consumer media time but only 10% of the ad budgets. And to take one comparable example, that means that for every consumer hour spent on print, marketers spend $1 and they spend $0.07 per hour on mobile, which means that we have an opportunity to grow. One of the most important ways we grow is not just bringing more marketers into Facebook, having them use more of our ad products, but as you mentioned, better targeting. A more relevant ad is a better ad experience for consumers but also drives a much higher return for marketers. And since we're running an auction, as our ads get more relevant and we provide higher ROI, we should be able to continue to grow. I think we've done a good job over the last year making our ads more relevant. I think those people on this call would say that you see more relevant ads than you used to a year ago, but I still think some of the Facebook ads still have room for improvement in terms of relevance. And so we see a lot of room for improvement there, both on the ROI we deliver and in the experience we can provide consumers."

So I'll add something to that, just on the side of how we think about value through Facebook, and then I'll talk about the other apps. In terms of the product developments that we do here, we have 4 major groups inside the company. This is kind of how our company is organized. We have one which is focused on growing the community; one which is focused on kind of increasing content consumption and people's engagement; another which is focused on kind of efficiency and helping people get the most value out of each moment that they're spending in Facebook; and then the fourth group is our core business, which is focused on helping people to see the best ads and basically make the most money per moment that people are spending at the lowest cost and most efficiency in terms of serving people. And there's, I think, big upside in each of those 4 categories. I mean, our community is growing. I mentioned in my comments upfront that time spent across our services is growing by -- grew by 10% year-over-year per person, which is pretty meaningful. Utility and efficiency are increasing, and of course, the ad business per person and the efficiency of our services are both increasing as well. So I'm pretty excited about that and think we're organized in a way where we can continue executing at that. The other opportunity is Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. I'm really excited about it, and I do think that they're going to reach the level where they contribute to our business in a pretty big way. But it's really important to get this right and not rush it. And what I'd say around Messaging is we're pretty early in that cycle. We're about where Facebook was in around 2006 or 2007 where at that point, Facebook was just really a consumer product. There were no businesses in the ecosystem, and a lot of people were telling us, okay, go put better ads in. And that's just -- that's not wrong. I didn't think that, that was going to be the right way to build the product or build the business. So instead, what we did was we built pages, which was a way for businesses to interact for free in the system and start creating organic interactions between people and businesses so we could figure out what the people using Facebook wanted from businesses within Facebook. And we built more tools for pages and businesses to engage. And our recent success with advertising is really just built on some of those organic interactions between people and businesses. And what you see in Messenger and WhatsApp now is we're still at the early end of that curve where their interaction is still primarily people to people, and businesses are starting to figure out in the case of WhatsApp, much less than Messenger so far, what the organic interaction is. But we're going to have to go through a whole cycle of figuring out how that works before really make sense to start monetizing them in a big way. But yes, I'm a big fundamental believer that these are going to be very big contributors to our businesses over time, but we just have to do it right."

Yesterday, we rolled out a product we call List [ph], which is really the next generation of our measurement capability and enables large customers to go in and set up ads with control test groups and so that they can AB [ph] test. These group of people saw a Facebook ad, these group of people didn't, and they can measure all the way through to conversion of whatever they're measuring, whether it's an online conversion to a sale. We think the measurement out there online and digitally is not particularly accurate. People don't have real people-based measurement. Through our investments in Atlas and through our investments in our -- in the core Facebook measuring tools, we think if we can show the ROI marketers they're getting and we can increasingly do so, we can continue to penetrate the North America market."

So also just building on what Sheryl said, worth noting that the drop in the value of international currencies impacted our results outside of the U.S. So some of what you're seeing here is a result of that. It reduced year-over-year revenue growth rates by 7% to 8% in the different international regions. So that's a big reason why you see the U.S. doing much better, as well as the fact that's just a more advanced marketing in what we've done in terms of just building up the advertiser base and getting adoption of our best targeting products, as Sheryl was talking about. Going to your question on pricing growth, I'd just reiterate what I said in my comments. It's largely due to the right-hand column redesign and then also the shift to mobile where we don't show right-hand column ads. So that's really what's causing the pricing shift. Then fundamentally, we just continue to get better at targeting. That drives better engagement. And as we get better engagement, that drives better ROI for our advertisers, which ultimately, I think as Sheryl commented on earlier, gets reflected in better pricing for our ads. And that's a big opportunity for us, and we are seeing that we're getting better and better at driving engagement from the ad units that we have and getting the right ad in front of the right person. So that's a big factor as well."

If there wasn't consumer video on Facebook, video ads in your News Feed would be very jarring. As a percentage of the videos you're seeing, video ads fit nicely into that experience. I don't think it matters as much what the video content is. And so while we're certainly exploring some premium content, as you said, we have an NFL Verizon test out there in the public eye, we're already seeing pretty explosive growth without that kind of premium content in the system in large numbers, and so we'll continue to figure out. We're certainly open to increasing video content either way, but we haven't quite figured out what the mix needs to be and right now the growth is very strong. In terms of Atlas, we just relaunched this fall, and we're just seeing as deals get done in broad adoption. So I think it's too soon for us to report that Atlas drives an increase in digital spend or an increase in any particular kind of spend. But here's what we believe really deeply, which is that Atlas is going to revitalize marketing by making the measurement more accurate. If you look at how digital ads are being measured, they're being measured based on a cookie-based world that assumes that people have one device, largely a PC, and that's not just true. Consumers have phones. They have tablets. They have PCs as well. And the ability to understand that, that's one person to serve an ad and measure all the way through correctly, we think, is going to massively improve the efficiency in the system as it gets adopted."

So when Jan and team joined us, one of the first things that we agreed on and why, I think, it made sense for them to join is that now they can focus for a few years on getting to 1 billion more of an ad and continuing to scale beyond that. SMS is an incredibly global and universal product, and I think WhatsApp just has a huge opportunity to serve billions of people. In terms of what the business looks like, I mean, at the end of the day, it's a distribution business like Facebook and Instagram. How you most effectively convert that into business opportunities for customers, whether that's through payments or ads or other different kinds of structures, we'll figure that out, what the optimal thing will be. But the first order of thing to do is to help serve billions of people here, help continue to increase engagement. I mean, people are spending a lot of time in WhatsApp, sending more than 30 billion messages a day, which is really crazy when you think about the volume there compared to the global SMS volume overall. And I think if we do that, there'll be a number of opportunities. I mean, people asked me this question a while ago about how we thought about games on Facebook as well, and I always thought about our [indiscernible] business on desktop, even though it was payment, as actually the same thing as our business on mobile around app install and engagement. What developers ask for is distribution. And whether they're doing that through payments or ads or whatever it is, it kind of is all the same. The most important thing is to help people connect, help people and businesses connect to create business opportunities, and then you get a small amount of the value that you're creating on top. So that will play out over the next set of years, and it's one of the intellectual challenges that I'm really looking forward to tackling."

This has been a good quarter for Facebook and a great end to the year. Our community continued to grow in size and engagement, and we're very pleased with the growth of our business. Overall, 201",1365,"Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone, for joining today. This has been a good quarter for Facebook and a great end to the year. Our community continued to grow in size and engagement, and we're very pleased with the growth of our business. 
Overall, 2014 was a year of great progress for the Facebook community, 1.39 billion people now use Facebook each month and 890 million people daily, an increase of 165 million monthly actives and 133 million daily actives this year. Time spent per person per day across our services continued to rise, growing this quarter by more than 10% compared to last year. And that doesn't even include WhatsApp, which joined us late last year. 
These milestones show that our community continues to get stronger. But it's not just our community where we've made a lot of progress. 2014 was also a year of big investments in our future. This year, we made big bets on the next generation of communication and computing platforms by acquiring WhatsApp and Oculus. We focused on serving our community better across all of our products, raising the quality and relevance of content in News Feed, improving our search and video products and improving the performance and efficiency of our mobile apps. And we continue to invest in our employees and infrastructure, growing our headcount by 45% this year and opening our newest data center in November in Altoona, Iowa.
When you consider the progress of our community and our investments, 2014 was an important year for us and a good sign of how we're thinking about the future. In the next decade, Facebook is focused on our mission to connect the entire world, welcoming billions of people to our community and connecting many more people to the Internet through Internet.org. 
To serve the entire world, we need to build products that serve our community and allow people to share different types of content with different audiences. We need to offer new services and infrastructure at greater scale, and we need to create new tools and innovate to solve fundamental challenges in the places we want to connect.
Doing this will take a lot of effort over the coming years, and Facebook is going to have to evolve. Similar to our transition to mobile over the last couple of years, now we want to really focus on serving everyone in the world. Our mission has always been to make the world more open and connected. So this is something we've been preparing for over the last decade. Everything we've achieved in 2014 and over the last 10 years has helped us to build the foundation for our future of greater scale. I'm excited for our progress in 2015.
Now with that in mind, I want to talk about the things that we expect to execute on over the next 3, 5 and 10 years. Over the next 3 years, our main focus is to continue to serve and grow our community by delivering better services for people and businesses around the world. One sign of our continued growth and engagement is our progress on visual and public content. More than 2 billion photos are now shared daily across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. Video grew significantly this year to an average of more than 3 billion video views per day on Facebook. So we now have more than 2 billion interactions every week on Facebook between public figures and their fans.
Instagram is also growing and helping people share and consume the most engaging content in different communities across the world. Instagram reached 300 million monthly actives, with more than 70% outside of the U.S. Average time spent using the app continues to be very strong compared to other mobile services. 
Across Facebook and Instagram, we've done a very good job on engagement, especially when it comes to helping people find and consume content they like. In 2015, we'll continue working on this, as well as developing more ways for people to share even more of the moments they care about on Facebook. 5 years ago, most of the content shared on Facebook was text and some photos. Today, it's primarily photos with some text and video. Over the next 5 years, we want to keep developing new products and features to help people share the way they want.
When it comes to serving businesses, we've continued to help drive results for businesses of every size around the world. Last week, a Deloitte report found that in 2014, Facebook created more than $225 billion of global economic impact and 4.5 million new jobs. This is an important reminder of the big opportunity we have to create value for businesses and why we're committed to serving them well. In 2014, we invested aggressively in improving our ad tech and measurement tools. We're going to continue working to provide new capabilities for marketers. Sheryl will talk about this more in a moment.
Next, let's talk about our efforts over the next 5 years to build the next generation of Facebook services. We expect WhatsApp and Messenger to connect hundreds of millions of more people and become indispensable services for the world, as well as important contributors to our business. Messenger and WhatsApp recently achieved impressive new milestones. In November, Messenger reached 500 million monthly actives, and at the beginning of January, WhatsApp reached 700 million monthly actives, with more than 30 billion messages sent each day. These numbers speak to the quality of both products and the size of the opportunity ahead to help billions of people communicate and collaborate.
Search at Facebook is another important effort that we expect to create a lot of value over the next few years. And this quarter, we launched updates to Facebook Search to make it easier to find content and posts on mobile and desktop. We're going to continue listening to feedback from our community and taking the time to build a really valuable product here. We're optimistic about our ability to deliver value that only Facebook is able to provide.
Working with developers is the other part of our strategy. And this quarter, we continued to make progress with helping developers build, grow and monetize their apps. In October, we rolled out our Audience Network around the world. And since then, the number of apps in the network has nearly tripled and impressions served by the network have more than quadrupled. In 2015, we'll continue to build upon our long-term goal of making Facebook a truly cross-platform platform that allows developers to share their work across every major mobile platform, and we look forward to sharing more details at our next F8 event in San Francisco this March.
Finally, let's talk about our plans over the next decade to connect everyone to the Internet through Internet.org and to develop the next generation of computing platforms with Oculus. Internet.org now has a lot of momentum, and we've launched 3 basic Internet services in Zambia, Tanzania, Ghana, Kenya and Colombia. More than 150 million people living in these countries now have the option to connect to the Internet using Internet.org. And we've already connected 6 million of them to the Internet who didn't have access before.
We're very excited by Internet.org's progress and the level of interest we're seeing across industries, governments and our community. 2015 is going to be an important year for our long-term plans, and I expect us to share more updates about our progress here over the coming months.
Oculus continues to make progress towards the future of immersive VR experiences that are part of daily life for millions of people. This month, the team had another good showing at CES, and developer interest in Oculus platform continues to grow. 
So that's my update for this quarter. It's been a good quarter and a good end to an important year for us. I want to thank everyone in our Facebook community and our employees, our partners and our stockholders for their support. Thanks to you, our community is growing stronger every day, and we're making progress towards making the entire world more open and connected. 
Thanks, and now here's Sheryl."

Q4 was strong across the board, capping a great year. This is our first quarter with over $3 billion in ad revenue and over $2 billion in mobile ad revenue. Our Q4 ad revenue grew 53% year-over-year. Our mobile ad revenue w",965,"Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. Q4 was strong across the board, capping a great year. This is our first quarter with over $3 billion in ad revenue and over $2 billion in mobile ad revenue. Our Q4 ad revenue grew 53% year-over-year. Our mobile ad revenue was 69% of the total ad revenue and doubled in the past year. Our growth was strong across all verticals and marketer segments. We also saw healthy growth around the world, although growth rates outside the U.S. were affected by exchange rates.
Looking back at 2014, our teams made great progress on our 3 main priorities: Capitalizing on the shift to mobile; growing the number of marketers using our ad products; and making our ads more relevant. We believe that the marketing -- that the market increasingly understands that we have the leading mobile ad product and are the only platform that delivers people-based marketing at scale.
The shift to mobile is changing the way people consume video. As Mark said, video grew dramatically on Facebook in 2014, especially around global events like the World Cup and the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge. In just 1 year, the number of video posts per person on Facebook increased 75% globally and 94% in the U.S. Today, over 50% of people in the U.S. who come to Facebook daily watch at least 1 video per day. And globally, over 65% of Facebook video views occur on mobile. Marketers have followed this trend and are using video to help people discover and learn about their brands.
In Q4, we expanded autoplay video ads internationally. During the holiday season, we saw many clients telling their stories creatively through video.
2014 was also the year we began scaling Instagram ads. In Q4, we rolled out Instagram ads in Australia and Canada. Marketers are excited to have access to the 300 million people who use Instagram and the creativity it inspires. We're seeing beautiful, creative and great results from brand marketers across verticals, from insurance and tech to retail and entertainment. For example, as one of our first Instagram video advertisers, Banana Republic developed a series of videos to promote its new BR clothing line. The video showed fashion sketches from the new collection and drove a 23-point lift in ad recall. While it's still early and we're being deliberate in our rollout, we believe that Instagram will become core to advertisers' mobile brand building efforts.
We also made progress growing the number of marketers using our ad products. Custom Audiences, our suite of proprietary targeting products, has become an essential tool for segmenting current and potential customers. Conversion tracking, a way for marketers to measure the impact of their campaigns online, is also seeing wider adoption. We've made it easier for businesses of all sizes to plan and manage their ad campaigns and for small businesses to use our targeting tools. 
Travel company Thomas Cook, recently used Facebook in Belgium to reach a broad audience and used Custom Audiences to send targeted messages to existing customers based on the places they had expressed interest in. They reached 30% of the Belgian population in just 1 day and achieved a 3.85x return on investment. Results like these are attracting more marketers of all kinds to our platform.
Finally, we made great progress improving ad relevance and measurement. To do this, we made significant investments in both our core measurement and targeting tools, as well as ad tech. Earlier in 2014, we introduced ad buying capabilities based on reach and frequency metrics, which is similar to how brand marketers buy TV ads and therefore enables better cross-comparison. We improved our Ads Manager product to give better insights into ad campaign's audience and impact.
In the fall, we re-launched Atlas to help marketers reach real people and measure results across multiple devices. Omnicom was our first global client, and this month, we announced a partnership with Havas to further expand globally. We also invested in an Audience Network, which helps marketers extend their campaigns off of Facebook, and LiveRail, which provides publishers with video tools to monetize their inventory more efficiently.
Heading into 2015, we're excited to build on the progress we've made with our core ad products, as well as with newer areas like video, Instagram and Ad Tech. It's still early days in all of these efforts. There's a lot of hard work to do, and we plan to invest aggressively.
Our ultimate goal is to be a critical business partner to our clients, providing people-based marketing at scale to build their brands and move their products off shelves. Over the past few weeks, I've had a chance to meet with many of our largest global clients and agency partners and talk about how we can drive real business results for them, making every impression count and every dollar they spend improve their bottom line. Our clients are excited by the opportunity to use video, Instagram and ads on and off Facebook to reach the right people with the right message. In turn, as their ads become more relevant, we provide a better experience for the people who use Facebook.
Coming off our biggest year ever, I want to say a special thank you to the Facebook teams around the world. To our global sales, engineering, product design and infrastructure teams, your accomplishments over the past year are the reason our business is in such a great place. To our entire company, I feel lucky to work with you as we stay focused on our priorities and work together to help connect the world. And to our clients, thank you for your partnership and your trust in us. 
Heading into 2015, we have big opportunities and a lot of work ahead. 
Thanks, and now here's Dave."

We are very pleased with the continuing growth of o",1182,"Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Q4 wrapped up a strong year for Facebook. In 2014, our revenue grew 58% to approximately $12.5 billion, and we generated over $3.6 billion in free cash flow. We are very pleased with the continuing growth of our network. In December, the number of people using Facebook on an average day increased by 18% compared to last year to 890 million. The daily number represents 64% of the 1.39 billion people who used Facebook during the month. 
Mobile remains the primary driver of our growth. We ended the year with 1.19 billion people using Facebook on mobile in the month. We also continue to see solid growth with Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp recently crossing 300 million, 500 million and 700 million MAU, respectively.
Turning now to the financials. All of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. In addition, as a reminder, our non-GAAP measures exclude stock-based compensation and the amortization of intangibles. 
Total revenue in Q4 was $3.9 billion, up 49% or 53% on a constant-currency basis. Given how significantly exchange rates have continued to move, we anticipate that this currency headwind will increase in 2015. And we'll give more color on this later in the call.
Ad revenue was $3.6 billion, up 53% or 58% on a constant currency basis. Mobile ad revenue in Q4 doubled to $2.5 billion or 69% of ad revenue compared to approximately $1.2 billion or 53% of ad revenue last year. Desktop ad revenue was up approximately 1% despite the fact that overall desktop usage was down. 
In Q4, the average price per ad increased 335%, while total ad impressions declined 65%. Similar to last quarter, these price volume trends were primarily driven by the redesign of our right-hand column ads, which rolled out in the third quarter.
Total payments and other fees revenue was $257 million, up 7%. Note that the growth was driven by revenue from acquisitions made in the past year. On an organic basis, payments revenue from games, which represents the substantial majority of our payments and other fees revenue, declined 10% compared to last year. As previously noted, we expect this trend to continue as desktop usage declines.
Turning now to expenses. Our Q4 total GAAP expenses were $2.7 billion, up 87%, and non-GAAP expenses were $1.6 billion, up 50%. GAAP expense growth was driven primarily by significant stock-based compensation and amortization expenses related to the WhatsApp acquisition. Non-GAAP expense growth was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related costs, cost of revenue and marketing expenses. On a full year basis, our 2014 GAAP expenses were $7.4 billion, up 47%, and our non-GAAP expenses were $5.3 billion, up 34%. 
We ended the year with roughly 9,200 employees, up 45%. Overall, we remain very pleased with our ability to attract and retain top-tier talent.
GAAP operating income was $1.1 billion in Q4, representing a 29% operating margin, down from 44% last year, again primarily due to expenses related to our recent large acquisitions. Non-GAAP operating income was $2.2 billion in Q4, representing a 58% operating margin, consistent with the margin last year.
Interest and other income and expense was a net expense of $19 million in Q4 versus a net expense of $3 million in Q4 last year. This increase in expense was primarily due to foreign exchange losses resulting from the periodic remeasurement of our foreign currency balances during the period.
In Q4, we benefited from the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. Our GAAP tax rate was 37% but would have been approximately 42% excluding the benefit of the tax credit. Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was 31% and would have been approximately 32% excluding this benefit. 
Q4 net income was $701 million or $0.25 per share, and non-GAAP net income was $1.5 billion or $0.54 per share. In 2014, we spent $1.8 billion on CapEx and generated over $3.6 billion of free cash flow. We ended 2014 with $11.2 billion in cash and investments and a net operating loss carryforward of approximately $4.5 billion.
Turning now to the outlook. Let me start with revenue. We are still in the early stages building out many aspects of our ads business, and we remain optimistic about our long-term opportunities. 
Looking at 2015, there are a couple of things I want to note. The first involves how the recent movements in exchange rates might impact our 2015 revenue. Assuming exchange rates were to remain constant at today's levels, we would expect that our total revenue in 2015 would be approximately 5% lower than it would be under 2014 exchange rates. Note this 5% represents the expected reduction in 2015 total revenue, not the reduction in the year-over-year growth rate. 
And second, we're reporting revenue from Atlas, LiveRail and the Audience Network on a net, not a gross, basis, so the growth in those products will have less of an impact on our overall reported revenue growth in 2015.
Turning now to expenses. We are tightening our ranges modestly given the better visibility into 2015 spending. We expect that our full year 2015 total GAAP expenses will increase 55% to 70% compared to 2014. We expect that our 2015 total non-GAAP expenses will increase 50% to 65%.
A simple way of thinking about our investments is across 3 categories: people, product and infrastructure. On the people side, we enter 2015 with 45% more employees than we did a year ago, and we will continue to invest in and grow the talent base throughout the year. In terms of product, we are investing to build great experiences for people, marketers and developers, ranging from our existing products and services to newer initiatives such as Ad Tech, Internet.org, Oculus and WhatsApp. We'll also invest in marketing to support all of these initiatives, which as I noted, was a driver of expense growth in Q4.
Turning to infrastructure. We continue to build out our global infrastructure to enable billions of people around the world to connect, message and share with each other. We will be investing in data centers, our network and servers to grow our existing services and support newer initiatives such as video and our global connectivity efforts through Internet.org. We anticipate our 2015 CapEx will be in the neighborhood of $2.7 billion to $3.2 billion.
We expect stock-based compensation for 2015 to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.3 billion, approximately half of which is related to our prior acquisitions, most notably WhatsApp. We expect amortization expenses for 2015 to be approximately $700 million to $800 million. And finally, we anticipate our Q1 and full year 2015 GAAP tax rates to be in the mid- to high-40s and non-GAAP rates to be in the mid- to high-30s.
In summary, Q4 capped off a great year for Facebook in which we executed well and also made some very important investments for our future. In 2015, we are focused on continuing to execute on the business and investing in our long-term mission and success.

And I would say that people remain really excited about Facebook, but people are bigger believers because we've had an opportunity to do more measurement over the past year. I think there are 2 things about the Facebook platform that are really exciting for brand marketers. The first is the creativity and storytelling. And certainly, as you mentioned, video is a big part of that because video is a format that marketers have used for a long time to build emotional connection to brands. And the second is measurement. And what clients want and what they should want is an ability to look at their ad spend and see how effective it is not just in the brand lift metrics, even though those are important, but in moving products off shelves. And over the past 1.5 years, the investments we have made in building out that measurement have paid off. So when I sit down with clients at the beginning of this year compared to last year, we have more actual case studies of marketing we've done with them. We have been able to A/B test Facebook ads versus no Facebook ads and what the effectiveness is on their sales. And I think across the board, we're showing very healthy, very competitive ROI. The opportunity and the challenge now is to scale. Even for our largest clients globally, we still represent a really small part of what they do. And so it's on us to prove to them that the results we're showing them in these smaller tests can happen in more brands, more countries with a larger part of their business."

And we're on this multiyear voyage to basically index all the content and make it available to people and rank it well. We started off by launching Graph Search, which I think included more than 1 trillion different connections in the first system. And the second round of the search progress that we just started rolling out at the end of last year was Post Search, which now has indexed more than, I think, 1 trillion posts, which, I mean, these -- the sizes of these corpuses are bigger than anything in the traditional web search corpus that you'd find. So it's an interesting and fun challenge to make this work. We're seeing that the people immediately understand how they can use this and find content that they've seen in News Feed before or that they've posted with just a few key words. And we're excited about that, but there's a lot more work to do. So I'd say we're not really thinking about advertising in it yet. On the scale that our community operates, 1 billion searches per day is actually not that big compared to what we think the opportunity here should be, and we're just continuing to keep on working on it because there's just a lot of unique value that people should be able to get from their friends on Facebook through search."

So what we're seeing, and I alluded to this a bit in my opening remarks, is that there's been this evolution of content on Facebook over the last 10 years towards richer formats that convey more of the moments that people care about. So if you go back 5 years ago, a lot of Facebook was primarily text, right, and a little bit of photos. Now I think the primary mode that people are using to share is photos. And I wouldn't be surprised if in the future that shifted more and more towards videos. So we're thinking about how to enable consumption first of the content that people were sharing. And this year, an increased focus on new opportunities around production, because that way, it's easier for people to capture the moments that are important to them, create higher-quality moments and pieces of content out of those and increase their experiences through that. So there's a lot more to do here, and I think that this is going to be one of the big trends over the next 3 to 5 years, is the growth in video and richer content in our service."

When you think about what's happening, certainly the growth has been good, but it's still true that marketing dollars have not followed the consumer time in the same percentages. So in the U.S., mobile gets 25% of consumer media time, but only 10% of the ad budgets. And to take one comparable example, that means that for every consumer hour spent on print, marketers spend $1 and they spend $0.07 per hour on mobile, which means that we have an opportunity to grow. One of the most important ways we grow is not just bringing more marketers into Facebook, having them use more of our ad products, but as you mentioned, better targeting. A more relevant ad is a better ad experience for consumers but also drives a much higher return for marketers. And since we're running an auction, as our ads get more relevant and we provide higher ROI, we should be able to continue to grow. I think we've done a good job over the last year making our ads more relevant. I think most people on this call would say that you see more relevant ads than you used to a year ago, but I still think some of the Facebook ads still have room for improvement in terms of relevance. And so we see a lot of room for improvement there, both on the ROI we deliver and in the experience we can provide consumers."

So I'll add something to that, just on the side of how we think about value through Facebook, and then I'll talk about the other apps. In terms of the product developments that we do here, we have 4 major groups inside the company. This is kind of how our company is organized. We have one which is focused on growing the community; one which is focused on kind of increasing content consumption and people's engagement; another which is focused on kind of efficiency and helping people get the most value out of each moment that they're spending in Facebook; and then the fourth group is our core business, which is focused on helping people to see the best ads and basically make the most money per moment that people are spending at the lowest cost and most efficiency in terms of serving people. And there's, I think, big upside in each of those 4 categories. I mean, our community is growing. I mentioned in our comments upfront that time spent across our services is growing by -- grew by 10% year-over-year per person, which is pretty meaningful. Utility and efficiency are increasing and, of course, the ad business per person and the efficiency of our services are both increasing as well. So I'm pretty excited about that and think we're organized in a way where we can continue executing against that. The other opportunity is Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. I'm really excited about, and I do think that they're going to reach the level where they contribute to our business in a pretty big way. But it's really important to get this right and not rush it. And what I'd say around Messaging is we're pretty early in that cycle. We're about where Facebook was in around 2006 or 2007 where, at that point, Facebook was just really a consumer product. There were no businesses in the ecosystem, and a lot of people were telling us, okay, go put better ads in. And that just -- that felt wrong. I didn't think that, that was going to be a -- the right way to build the product or build the business. So instead what we did was we built pages, which was a way for businesses to interact for free in the system and start creating organic interactions between people and businesses so we could figure out what the people using Facebook wanted from businesses within Facebook. And we built more tools for pages and businesses to engage. And our recent success with advertising is really just built on some of those organic interactions between people and businesses. And what you see in Messenger and WhatsApp now is we're still at the early end of that curve where their interaction is still primarily people to people, and businesses are starting to figure out, in the case of WhatsApp, much less than Messenger so far, what the organic interaction is. But we're going to have to go through a whole cycle of figuring out how that works before it really makes sense to start monetizing them in a big way. But yes, I mean, I'm a big fundamental believer that these are going to be very big contributors to our businesses over time, but we just have to do it right."

We don't get close to that in terms of anyone's marketing spend or the time they spend. What we say to our clients over and over again is that we want to drive their business. And that's what's probably the most important thing we're doing for these large North American spenders, is around the measurement work we've done. Two years ago, we were not able to measure all the way through to purchase off the shelves and now we can. Yesterday, we rolled out a product we call Lift, which is really the next iteration of our measurement capability and enables large customers to go in and set up ads with control test groups, so that they can A/B test. This group of people saw a Facebook ad, this group of people didn't, and they can measure all the way through to conversion of whatever they're measuring, whether it's an online conversion to a sale. We think the measurement out there online and digitally is not particularly accurate. People don't have real people-based measurement.

So that's a big reason why you see the U.S. doing much better, as well as the fact that that's just a more advanced marketing in what we've done in terms of just building up the advertiser base and getting adoption of our best targeting products, as Sheryl was talking about. Going to your question on pricing growth, I'd just reiterate what I said in my comments. It's largely due to the right-hand column redesign and then also the shift to mobile where we don't show right-hand column ads. So that's really what's causing the pricing shift. Then fundamentally, we just continue to get better at targeting. That drives better engagement. And as we get better engagement, that drives better ROI for our advertisers, which ultimately, I think as Sheryl commented on earlier, gets reflected in better pricing for our ads. And that's a big opportunity for us, and we are seeing that we're getting better and better at driving engagement from the ad units that we have and getting the right ad in front of the right person.

If there wasn't consumer video on Facebook, video ads in your News Feed would be very jarring. As a percentage of the videos you're seeing, video ads fit nicely into that experience. I don't think it matters as much what the video content is. And so while we're certainly exploring some premium content, as you said, we have an NFL Verizon test out there in the public eye, we're already seeing pretty explosive growth without that kind of premium content in the system in large numbers, and so we'll continue to figure out. We're certainly open to increasing video content either way, but we haven't quite figured out what the mix needs to be and right now the growth is very strong. In terms of Atlas, we just relaunched this fall, and we're just seeing those deals get done in broad adoption. So I think it's too soon for us to report that Atlas drives an increase in digital spend or an increase in any particular kind of spend. But here's what we believe really deeply, which is that Atlas is going to revitalize marketing by making the measurement more accurate. If you look at how digital ads are being measured, they're being measured based on a cookie-based world that assumes that people have one device, largely a PC, and that's not just true. Consumers have phones. They have tablets. They have PCs as well. And the ability to understand that that's one person to serve an ad and measure all the way through correctly, we think is going to massively improve the efficiency in the system as it gets adopted."

We can find the right quality and bit rate to send down to the person based on their connection over time and optimize all kinds of different things. So what I think people are finding from public figures to everyday videos that people are uploading is that the best experience that you can get is by uploading content native to Facebook, which is, I think, a big part of the growth that we're seeing here."

So there are impacts like as people start -- as people consume more content on Facebook, within the ratio of ads, the organic content that we'll show, they might see more ads. But overall, our strategy is much less about increasing the volume of ads and much more about increasing the quality of the content and the quality of the targeting to get the right content to the right people.

So I would say in general, no, it's not affecting those decisions. There are certainly big macro effects that are going on, and part of those are what's driving a lot of the currency fluctuation as well. So you have regions that are certainly growing more quickly and regions that are growing more slowly. So from a macro perspective, the United States is doing better in terms of growth versus Europe versus Latin America. You see those compounded in both currency and sort of macroeconomic conditions in those regions. So I'd say generally, we've got more favorable market conditions in which to operate in the U.S. Overall, I would say the business is driven by the fundamentals of us continuing to execute against our plan.

So when Jan and team joined us, one of the first things that we agreed on and why, I think, it made sense for them to join is that now they can focus for a few years on getting to 1 billion more of an ad and continuing to scale beyond that. SMS is an incredibly global and universal product, and I think WhatsApp just has a huge opportunity to serve billions of people. In terms of what the business looks like, I mean, at the end of the day, it's a distribution business like Facebook and Instagram. How you most effectively convert that into business opportunities for customers, whether that's through payments or ads or other different kinds of structures, we'll figure that out, what the optimal thing will be. But the first order of thing to do is to help serve billions of people here, help continue to increase engagement. I mean, people are spending a lot of time in WhatsApp, sending more than 30 billion messages a day, which is really crazy when you think about the volume there compared to the global SMS volume overall. And I think if we do that, there'll be a number of opportunities. I mean, people asked me this question a while ago about how we thought about games on Facebook as well, and I always thought about our canvas business on desktop, even though it was payment, as actually the same thing as our business on mobile around app install and engagement. What developers ask for is distribution. And whether they're doing that through payments or ads or whatever it is, it kind of is all the same. The most important thing is to help people connect, help people and businesses connect, create business opportunities, and then you get a small amount of the value that you're creating on top. So that will play out over the next set of years, and it's one of the intellectual challenges that I'm really looking forward to tackling."

This was a good quarter and a good start to the year. We continue to grow the size and engagement of our community, now with 1.44 billion people using Facebook each month and 936 million people daily. We continue to see strong growth in daily engagements around the world, including in our most engaged markets. On mobile, nearly 1.25 billion people now use Facebook every month, 240 million in a year ago and we now see more than 1 billion of mobile searches everyday.
Looking at our business, we continue to achieve impressive growth. Total revenue grew by 42% year-over-year and advertising revenue grew by 46%. Mobile now accounts for 73% of our ads revenue. These results show that we're making progress on our mission to connect the world and we're executing well against our priorities. But this quarter also shows how Facebook is continuing to make progress for the years ahead. Facebook has evolved from a single blue app on your phone into a family of apps. Now many of these apps are reaching a global scale. More than 1.4 billion people use the core Facebook service, 800 million also use WhatsApp, 700 million use our Groups product, 600 million use Messenger and on Instagram, there are more than 300 million active members of the community. We're building this family of apps because we want people to be able to share whatever their moments they want with all the different sets of people they care about. Over time, we expect people to share richer content with an increasing frequency so we want to continue developing new and better tools to facilitate this expression. So with that in mind, let's talk about the efforts during the quarter.
First, we're working to help people share and connect with all the things they care about today. The important part of the approach is helping our community connect around important public moments and personalities. Facebook is the largest community of sports fans in the world with 650 million people connecting into sports pages. For this year's Super Bowl, more than 65 million people generated more than 265 million interactions on Facebook, the highest level of conversation we've seen for a Super Bowl to date. For the Cricket World Cup, there were more than 700 million interactions by 53 million people, which shows the strength of the global reach of our community. We're also making good progress with video. We're very pleased to have growth here. And this quarter, we reached a new milestone of more than 4 billion videos every -- daily video views. We also launched an embedded video player that allows people to watch Facebook videos across the web and more than 80,000 videos have now been embedded on third-party websites.
Spherical videos are going to be supported in News Feed later this year allowing you to change the viewing angle for more immersive experience. Supporting new types of content like this is an important part of preparing for the future of how people want to share. 
Now another part of our strategy is helping people connect to businesses. This quarter, we announced that there are now 2 million advertisers on Facebook. This is an important milestone for our community and we're encouraged that so many businesses are finding value on Facebook. We continue to focus on innovation in our ads business and Sheryl is going to talk a bit more about that in a moment.
Now here's how were working to develop our family of apps and we can give people more options for sharing in different ways. In the future, we expect that people are going to want to share content with their closest friends at an even greater frequency than they do today, so messaging is a big priority for us. Across the Facebook family of apps, our efforts have a lot of momentum. On average, more than 45 billion messages are sent everyday. With voice calling, we're also starting with some great progress. This quarter, we started rolling out voice over IP calls on WhatsApp to let people call friends for free around the world. And meanwhile, Messenger already accounts for more than 10% of mobile VOIP calls globally. With WhatsApp, we continue to be pleased with our growth and the team remains very focused on building the future to serve the community and expand. For Messenger, this has been a particularly busy quarter. We launched the Messenger platform, which allowed people to use creative new apps to have richer conversation. We're also being rolling of payments on Messenger to give people an easy, secure way to send money to their friends. And we announced a new way for people to communicate with businesses using Messenger. We're really excited that the potential to build Messenger into a service, that helps people to express themselves in rich, new ways and to access useful services.
With Instagram, our growth remains impressive. In this quarter we reached a new milestone of more than 200 million daily actives. Growth in Asia, Europe and Latin America is particularly strong with our community growing in some countries by more than 100% year-over-year including Japan, South Korea and Indonesia. Combined with an average 21 minutes a day that people spend on Instagram, this is a good sign of this community is continuing in a growing streak.
Now let's talk about how were working with developers. Last month, we held F8, our annual event for the global developer community. Creating the future of sharing isn't something that we can do on our own, but by supporting developers we can deliver more apps and experiences for our community. At F8, we connected new tools to help build, grow and monetize that asset including better share experiences from apps to Facebook and new analytics to help developers better understand how people are using their services. More than 30 million apps and sites have been built using Facebook developer tools, and last year we drove more than 3.5 billion app installs. We think these improvements are going to create a lot of value for our community.
All right. Finally, let's talk about some of our most long-term innovation efforts. Internet.org, our efforts to connect everyone in the world to the Internet continues to gather momentum. We've now made free basic Internet services available to more than 800 million people in 9 countries, including just in this quarter, launching in India, Colombia, Ghana, Guatemala and the Philippines. More than 7 million people who weren't connected to the Internet before now use Internet.org to get online. And this year, we expect to connect even more people.
With our efforts in Search AI and Oculus, we're also continue to build a new generation of Internet services that are more useful, intuitive and immersive. And over the coming months, we'll have more to share about these. 
So that's what we're thinking about innovation in the future of sharing, it's been a busy quarter. In the last few months, I visited countries in Asia, Europe and Latin America. In many communities, I've gotten the chance to see how the Internet is changing lives and creating opportunities for people. I've heard from people who can't wait to get access to the same tools that so many of us take for granted. We're making progress on our mission, and working to accelerate towards the day when everyone in the world can be connected. Thanks to our entire community and all of our employees, partners and shareholders for being a part of this journey and for helping to build something great. Now here's Sheryl."

Mobile ad revenue grew 82% and is now 73% of total ad revenue. Our performance is strong across all marketer segments and we're pleased with the broad-based growth across our industry verticals. 
From a regional perspective, we saw strong growth in North America and Asia Pacific, while Latin America and Europe were affected by foreign exchange headwind and macroeconomic factors. That said, we're please with advertiser adoption of our add product across all regions.
Innovation drives our ads business. It's how we continually improve the quality of our ads, offer new tools to marketers and build better experiences for the people who use Facebook. We believe that this ability to innovate will continue to drive our business. So today, I want to focus on innovation across our 3 strategic priorities: Capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of marketers using our ad products and making our ads more relevant.
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. Mobile continues to be a great opportunity for us. People continue to be highly engaged with our mobile apps. In the United States, for example, Facebook and Instagram get more than 1 out of every 5 minutes spent on mobile. Our consumers shift to mobile, businesses are following and we're focusing on helping them take advantage of this opportunity to use mobile to build their businesses. Two new products introduced this quarter are good examples of this. The mobile ads manager app gives marketers the ability to manage their ad campaigns from their mobile devices. It's early, but we're already see more marketers managing their activity on mobile. We also launched a page creation tool for feature phones which has been a big driver of speech adoption and high-growth in emerging markets where smartphones are less common.
Looking ahead, we believe video will play a significant role in bringing more marketers to mobile. Within 75% of global video views on Facebook across mobile and we believe mobile video will become more important to marketers over time. Lionsgate, Age of Adaline premier is a great example. To promote the film, Lionsgate targeted young women on Instagram with multiple video ads over the last few weeks. This week, the film opens on Friday. They are retargeting the audience from Instagram campaign on Facebook. We expect more marketers to put mobile video Atlas the heart of the campaigns in the future and we're well-positioned to drive this shift.
Our second priority is growing to number of marketers using our ad products and we're making great progress. In Q2 of last year, we shared that they reached 30 million active business pages on Facebook. This number continues to grow as more and more small businesses are using our free pages product, and we remain focused on converting these page owners into advertisers. What we're doing is by providing simple, easy-to-use products. Over 80% of our new advertisers start with entry-level tools like a promoted post to our page like. We are increasingly focused on making sure these tools work well on mobile. 
We're also educating marketers on how to use Facebook more effectively. We recently launched 2 online training resources, blueprint for large clients and agencies and learn how videos for small businesses. These efforts are paying off. In Q1, we announced that we now have over 2 million active advertisers.
Our third priority is making our ads more relevant. More relevant ads lead to better returns for marketers and better experiences for people. We're pleased with the increased adoption of our targeting tools like Custom Audiences and conversion lift tracking. In Q1, we introduced dynamic product ads which allow marketers to launch ads to different audiences. We also introduced Carousel Ads on Facebook and Instagram which allow marketers to advertise for specific products. Adoption of our targeting tools in these new ad formats help make our ads more relevant.
We're also focused on insights and measurement. We want to help marketers accurately measure the performance of their campaigns and then apply that learning to improve their returns. In Q1, we released and ads relevance score, a way for marketers to better understand how people respond to their ads. This helps marketers tap different types of creative and optimize performance. We also launched conversion a tool that scientifically measures how much additional businesses is driven from Facebook ads. This is important because it shows that ads on mobile can drive sales in retail stores and via other channels. For example, Sell - Das is a woman's fashion retailer in Europe. Using Conversion Lift, they proved that ads on some Facebook mobile drove sales on desktop and via phone calls to sales reps at their call centers.
On the ad tech side, we're pleased with the results are driving for advertisers and publishers. A good example of this is Chio Mobile. Using native ads from the audience number get the app, the company is getting more than 2x the CPMs compared to other ad networks. We continue to invest in our ad text platform, and our F8 developer conference last month, we made 2 important LiveRail announcements that will improve the relevance of ads that people see across sites, apps and devices. We extended LiveRail's video ad platform into in-an app mobile display which will give publishers better way to manage their ad inventory across devices. We also announced that LiveRail will give publishers access to Facebook's anonymized demographic information enabling us to serve more relevant ads to people.
We've had a great start of the year and we're really optimistic about what's to come. Our teams are executing well, staying focused on our big priorities and continuing to innovate. Now here's Dave."
20765463,290174593,792289,"Facebook, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2015",2015-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Meta Platforms, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 was a strong quarter for Facebook. We generated $3.5 billion in revenue and $1.2 billion in free cash flow and continued making investments to position us for both near-term and long-term growth.We are pl",978,"Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 was a strong quarter for Facebook. We generated $3.5 billion in revenue and $1.2 billion in free cash flow and continued making investments to position us for both near-term and long-term growth.
We are pleased with the growth and engagement of our community. In March, 936 million people used Facebook on an average day, an increase of 17% compared to last year. This daily number represents 65% of the 1.44 billion people who use Facebook during the month of March. 
Mobile remains the key driver of our growth. In March, approximately 1.25 billion people accessed Facebook on mobile devices, up 24% from last year. In addition to Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp continue to grow exceeding 300 million, 600 million and 800 million MAU, respectively.
Now turning to the financials. All of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Additionally, as a reminder, our non-GAAP measures excludes stock-based compensation and the amortization of intangibles.
Total revenue was $3.5 billion, up 42% or 49% on a constant currency basis. Ad revenue was $3.3 billion, up 46% or 55% on a constant currency basis. The general strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the past year had an unfavorable impact on our revenue. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q1 2014 levels, our total revenue this quarter would have been approximately $190 million higher.
Regionally, we saw strong North American ad revenue growth of 53% in the quarter, second only to APAC which grew 57%. Europe and the rest of world revenue grew more slowly at 35% and 32%, respectively, with currency impacts leading to a significant reduction in these region's year-over-year growth rates.
Mobile ad revenue in Q1 was $2.4 billion, up from approximately $1.3 billion last year. Revenue from ad served on personal computers was down approximately 4% and we continue to see overall usage and PCs decline.
In Q1, the average price per ad increased 285%, while total ad impressions declined 62%. Similar to last quarter, these price volume trends were primarily driven by the redesign of our right-hand column ads switch rolled out in the third quarter of last year. To a lesser degree, the shifted usage towards mobile where we don't have right-hand column ads, also contributed to the reported what price volume trends.
Total payments and other fees revenue was $226 million, down 5% compared to last year, a trend we expect to continue. The decline was driven by the year-over-year reduction in payments revenue related to games played on personal computers.
Turning now to expenses. Our Q1 total GAAP expenses were $2.6 billion, up 83% and non-GAAP expenses were $1.7 billion, up 57%. Similar to last quarter, stock-based compensation and amortization expenses related to the WhatsApp acquisition contributed significantly to the year-over-year growth in GAAP expenses. Non-GAAP expense growth was primarily driven by increases in headcount-related costs, cost of revenue and marketing expenses.
We ended Q1 with 10,082 employees, up 48% compared to last year. We remain very pleased with our ability to attract and the team top-tier client. Q1 operating income was $933 million, representing a 26% operating margin. Non-GAAP operating income was $1.8 billion, representing a 52% margin. Our Q1 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 45% and 35%, respectively. Q1 GAAP net income was $512 million or $0.18 per share and non-GAAP net income was $1.2 billion or $0.42 per share.
In Q1, capital expenditures were $502 million, and we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow. We ended the quarter with $12.4 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the outlook, let's start with revenue. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the past year reduced our Q1 total revenue growth rate by 7 percentage points or approximately $190 million. The dollar strengthened over the course of the quarter and in the month of March, our year-over-year total revenue growth rate was approximately 10% lower than it would have been in constant currency terms. Based on this, we estimate that foreign exchange headwinds in Q2 will likely be greater than those we experienced in Q1. In addition, we expect our total payments and other fees revenue to decline on a year-over-year basis for the remainder of the year.
Turning to expense guidance. We are tightening our expense guidance range modestly based on better visibility into our annual spending. We expect that the year-over-year growth rate for total 2015 GAAP expenses will be in the range of 55% to 65% as compared to our prior guidance of 55% to 70%. We expect that the year-over-year growth rate for total 2015 non-GAAP expenses will be in the range of 50% to 60% as compared to our prior guidance of 50% to 65%.
Our expense outlook reflects the broad range of investments that we're making in both our services and infrastructure as we continue to enhance the core experiences on Facebook and Instagram, grow our messaging products, strengthen our advertising business globally and invest in long-term growth areas like Oculus and Internet.org.
The remainder of our guidance remains unchanged. We anticipate our 2015 capital expenditures will be in the neighborhood of $2.7 billion to $3.2 billion. We expect stock-based compensation in 2015 to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.3 billion, approximately half of which is related to our prior acquisitions, most notably WhatsApp. We expect amortization expenses in 2015 to be approximately $700 million to $800 million. And lastly, we anticipate our Q2 and full year 2015 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be consistent with the rates in the first quarter.
In summary, Q1 was a great start to the year for Facebook. We're very pleased with the growth of our community, the strength of our business and the investments we're making to build long-term shareholder value. 
With that, Chris, let's open up the call for questions."

And then in the long term are investing in areas like the next-generation computing platform, Internet.org, AI. In general, I would say our headcount growth has skewed towards the R&D side because a lot of these initiatives have long-term development needs so we've been investing there, but we're investing across the board. In terms of specific headcount guidance, I would just stick with our expense guidance. But I'd note that the 48% year-over-year does include some inorganic growth from the pickup of the 3 larger acquisitions: Oculus, LiveRail and WhatsApp. We haven't lapped those at this point."

The first is that we really have a great platform to do creative storytelling on mobile, and I think we have that in a way that no one else does. Our mobile ad product is so integrated into the user experience and provides real creative flexibility that people have a way to reach people on mobile and that's becoming increasingly important in telling the stories that drive their business. The second thing is video. Video is exploding on Facebook as Mark talked about, and that gives us an opportunity to do a lot of work to put more marketers on video. This is the first time the technology and media vertical was 1 of our top 4 verticals and that's largely because of the use of mobile, and so that's been a really great story for us. In terms of penetration, we work with almost all the large marketers almost everywhere in the world. But even for the largest, the largest clients we have, we are a very small part of their budget. I don't think we have any large clients. If you look at 25% in the U.S. of consumer media time is on mobile and then 20% of mobile time goes to Facebook and Instagram, that would be 5% of U.S. consumer media time. With our largest clients even our large was, we're not close to 5% of their spend. And so I think we have a considerable opportunity to grow.

There's just a lot of different experiences that need to get dealt, and a lot of what we're trying to do is just enable a number of those things through Facebook while also building unique, world-class services to enable people to share all the things they care about with all the different set of people that they care about. So we're going to keep doing more there but we're very happy with where we are now. We have a number of services that are reaching pretty good scale, and I think we'll keep on pushing that."

Our goal when we work with marketers is to drive their business and that means their products off the shelves, their services into the hands of people. And so in order to do that will, we need to work on targeting and we need to work on measurement. So with targeting, a more relevant ad is just better. It's better experience for consumers because they see something they like in their News Feed and has a higher return for marketers. And so we're very focused on getting more people to use our targeting tools from Custom Audiences, with less people target as differently to their current customers are people they'd like to be the customers to look like audiences which enables us to identify the kind of characteristics in their current customers and then find other people on Facebook who share those characteristics. So again, the ad is well-targeted. I think what targeting abilities are be the second to none, and I'll share a recent example. Xfinity [ph] was good for visual disabilities, and what they say they do this by doing an offer commercial the the growth who is blind, imagining what the characters look like. By doing that at the Oscars, that's obviously team and it's a very broad ad and that's because they were both showing up on a but also working on their brand. On Facebook, they took that ad and showed it to movie fans and also people connected to accessibility causes. That's actually pretty specific targeting that lets them hit exactly the right audience and amplify what they were doing on TV, and I think that's the kind of thing that the only can do on scale and just how important targeting is. When you think about closing the loop, you then have to add in the measurement piece. Because if we can connect, people seeing ads on Facebook to what they buy in stores or in other ways, that's how you close the loop. And that's when we put so much investment and hopefully so much innovation behind measurement. So conversion tracking is increasingly used and we work with our marketers to use it even more. And we're also really excited about conversion lift because that's the first product we have which scientifically measures the additional business you get from Facebook ads. It compressed test groups to see the control groups that don't. So whatever you're measuring in terms of conversions whether it's sales or website click the registration, we can A.B. test is exactly what the impact Facebook has. I think this is the beginning of this. I think there are so much more we can do to make ads more relevant on Facebook and so much more we can to to measure results and I think our future growth will depend on executing on that very well."

What we're more focused on doing is providing more higher-quality services for free that you can otherwise get for pay for them. And one thing you may not know about voice calling is that by using the Internet for calling rather than the relatively low bit rate voice networks, you can actually get higher-quality calls using VOIP. So one of our theories in this is that one of the reasons why voice quality has been a little slower to catch on is because you need a large established network of people who you know who have access to be able to receive a voice call before that behavior can maybe take on in the big global community. But now between Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, which are 2 very broad communication networks, we're pretty confident that because of the higher-quality of calling that you can get through the services that we're providing, that this is going to continue growing very quickly. I mean A lot of people are still just very early in rolling out and promoting it, even a Facebook Messenger has been out of the war, we're already more than 10% of the global VOIP market. And I heard this just going to continue growing and we really look forward on getting the stats on WhatsApp VOIP as well."

In terms of integrating them, no, we're not going to do that. One of the things that had been interesting, while we were watching these different services grow, was just how quickly multiple different messaging and communication services we're growing at the same time. It seems other bit counterintuitive at first because it seems like there should've been more overlap than actually in retrospect looking back, seems like there is. So you learn we can look at countries were voice services like WhatsApp like Brazil for example, and what you'll see is that basically people them a little bit differently. So WhatsApp is more of a clear text messaging replacement. Facebook Messenger, people use to connect to people that they know on Facebook primarily, and then there are differences in the feature sets where WhatsApp is extremely utilitarian and focused on texting and not voice calling whereas messengers are very focused on expression and the whole set of things that fit into the tools around the Messenger platform that we rolled out, communicating with businesses now, richer tools to communicate in different ways. So I think that these are just going to keep on growing is my expectation and hope. And we're excited to kind of pursue both different products to serve the different communities."

So many years ago, when the homepage takeover was en vogue we never did that. and effectiveness of us consumer video, that gives us the opportunity to do more marketing video us well. It's still early days and we're very focused on quality, and it's worth noting that not all of the revenue from video is incremental because the video ads take the place of other ads that we would have served into News Feed. That said, we really excited about the opportunity I talked about is increasing the entertainment, and media vertical and brand marketers, particularly I think all marketers have the opportunity to do video, that's pretty exciting, including SMBs who would never be able to hire a film crew and buy a TV ad. We're seeing those great videos and over 1 million SMBs have posted videos and then really small advice around them. That's pretty cool because I don't think there are probably 1 million advertisers who would have bought TV ads in that same period of time. When you think about our marketing growth, I think we have an ability to grow both the number of advertisers who use our platform but also the percentage of their business that we get. So 30 million small business pages continuing to grow, we have an opportunity to their it in those businesses into advertisers and marketers and that's what we've been successful and we're going to continue to focus on that and we do that they building very simple ad products. And then when you think about the percentage of spend we have, what I said before on this call, which is we only have a small percentage that even allege cousins, that's true of our small customers and some will spend a large budget on Facebook that's actually very unusual for this people even the base when a large portion of their budget. When you look at the consumer time we get, we are not getting the equivalent amount of time or resources from our marketers really of any size, and there in lies our opportunity to grow."

In terms of what the opportunity there is to drive it, it's really about increasing the relevance and quality of the ads. That's been a key part of what we've been doing and that will just continue to be big driver in the near and medium term. And we're doing that on the number of different fronts. Part of it's about finding the right format, so it's getting the video units there for the people for whom video ads are going to make sense. It's getting the dynamic product ads in front of people for people who are going to find those ads interesting and engaging, and it's really just continuing to learn more and more about the people are using Facebook and what types of ads they interact with and they like. So that's part of what we try to do across the board. And then at the same time, we're bringing more and more advertisers into the system and that's giving us a better selection of the ads that we can serve to the people using Facebook and that's again improves the quality and the relevance. So the main thing that we're seeing drive this is just improving the quality and the relevance of the ads experience for the people using Facebook, and I think that's going to continue to be the story. I think the specific ads will be part of how we do that but it won't be the only way. It will also be the targeting that we have in the targeting capabilities that we're doing with things like Custom Audiences and getting better and better at that. So there's a lot of different fronts that we're working on. It's hard to tease out of individual component of it. But all in all, we're really pleased with the revenue group that we're seeing.

But if you're a professional publisher, you need to have the ability to the shorter version of the content that you're producing that you're proud of that can load quickly, that can be as rich is the tools, enable people to see, and we're working on a lot of different tools for that. You can imagine that as the tools for any of these contents get better, people taking photos, newspapers writing news articles, advertisers putting out ads for the content that they want to sell, the better that content gets, the more people are excited to see it and that informs the ranking and what the community qualitatively tells us that they want to see from us over time as well, so just a constant cycle on that."

We know that marketers love videos. There's a great opportunity here. It's still early. It's worth pointing out that as Sheryl mentioned, video does display other ads and News Feed. And let me just kind of speaks help to pricing as well. Video is a format that's bid into the auction, so video is effectively winning in the auction a bit higher price, so if somebody is willing to pay more for video and to a different format at but it's not in the price differential. You're paying for video, it's just what are you willing to pay into the system. So there's not differential pricing by product him is just what are you willing to bid for the products that you want to share with the people that you want to show it to and that's how the system works."

This was a good quarter and a good start to the year. We continue to grow the size and engagement of our community, now with 1.44 billion people using Facebook each month and 936 million people",1273,"Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. This was a good quarter and a good start to the year. We continue to grow the size and engagement of our community, now with 1.44 billion people using Facebook each month and 936 million people daily. We continue to see strong growth in daily engagements around the world, including in our most engaged markets. On mobile, nearly 1.25 billion people now use Facebook every month, 240 million in a year ago, and we now see more than 1 billion mobile searches everyday.
Looking at our business. We continue to achieve impressive growth. Total revenue grew by 42% year-over-year and advertising revenue grew by 46%. Mobile now accounts for 73% of our ads revenue. These results show that we're making progress on our mission to connect the world, and we're executing well against our priorities. But this quarter also shows how Facebook is continuing to make progress for the years ahead. Facebook has evolved from a single blue app on your phone into a family of apps. Now many of these apps are reaching a global scale. More than 1.4 billion people use the core Facebook service, 800 million also use WhatsApp, 700 million use our Groups product, 600 million use Messenger and, on Instagram, there are more than 300 million active members of the community. We're building this family of apps because we want people to be able to share whatever moments they want with all the different sets of people they care about. Over time, we expect people to share richer content with an increasing frequency, so we want to continue developing new and better tools to facilitate this expression. So with that in mind, let's talk about our efforts over the quarter.
First, we're working to help people share and connect with all the things they care about today. The important part of the approach is helping our community connect around important public moments and personalities. Facebook is the largest community of sports fans in the world, with 650 million people connecting to sports pages. For this year's Super Bowl, more than 65 million people generated more than 265 million interactions on Facebook, the highest level of conversation we've seen for a Super Bowl to date. For the Cricket World Cup, there were more than 700 million interactions by 53 million people, which shows the strength of the global reach of our community. We're also making good progress with video. We're very pleased with our growth here. In this quarter, we reached a new milestone of more than 4 billion videos every -- daily video views. We also launched an embedded video player that allows people to watch Facebook videos across the web, and more than 80,000 videos have now been embedded on third-party websites.
Spherical videos are going to be supported in News Feed later this year, allowing you to change the viewing angle for a more immersive experience. Supporting new types of content like this is an important part of preparing for the future of how people want to share.
Now another part of our strategy is helping people connect with businesses. This quarter, we announced that there are now 2 million advertisers on Facebook. This is an important milestone for our community, and we're encouraged that so many businesses are finding value on Facebook. We continue to focus on innovation in our ads business, and Sheryl is going to talk a bit more about that in a moment.
Now here's how we're working to develop our family of apps so we can give people more options for sharing in different ways. In the future, we expect that people are going to want to share content with their closest friends at an even greater frequency than they do today. So messaging is a big priority for us. Across the Facebook family of apps, our efforts have a lot of momentum. On average, more than 45 billion messages are sent everyday. With voice-calling, we're also starting to make some good progress. This quarter, we started rolling out voice-over-IP calls on WhatsApp to let people call friends for free around the world. And meanwhile, Messenger already accounts for more than 10% of mobile VOIP calls globally. With WhatsApp, we continue to be pleased with our growth, and the team remains very focused on building new features to serve their community and expand. For Messenger, this has been a particularly busy quarter. We launched the Messenger platform, which allows people to use creative new apps to have richer conversations. We also began rolling out payments on Messenger to give people an easy, secure way to send money to their friends. And we announced a new way for people to communicate with businesses using Messenger. We're really excited by the potential to build Messenger into a service that helps people to express themselves in rich, new ways and to access useful services.
With Instagram, our growth remains impressive. In this quarter, we reached a new milestone of more than 200 million daily actives. Growth in Asia, Europe and Latin America is particularly strong, with our community growing in some countries by more than 100% year-over-year, including Japan, South Korea and Indonesia. Combined with an average 21 minutes a day that people spend on Instagram, this is a good sign of this community's continuing and growing strength.
Now let's talk about how we're working with developers. Last month, we held F8, our annual event for the global developer community. Creating the future of sharing isn't something that we can do on our own but, by supporting developers, we can deliver more apps and experiences for our community. At F8, we presented new tools to help developers build, grow and monetize their apps, including better sharing experiences from apps to Facebook and new analytics to help developers better understand how people are using their services. More than 30 million apps and sites have been built using Facebook developer tools and, last year, we drove more than 3.5 billion app installs. We think these improvements are going to create a lot of value for our community.
All right. Finally, let's talk about some of our most long-term innovation efforts. Internet.org, our efforts to connect everyone in the world to the Internet, continues to gather momentum. We've now made free basic Internet services available to more than 800 million people in 9 countries, including, just in this quarter, launching in India, Colombia, Ghana, Guatemala and the Philippines. More than 7 million people who weren't connected to the Internet before now use Internet.org to get online. And this year, we expect to connect even more people.
With our efforts in search, AI and Oculus, we're also continuing to build a new generation of Internet services that are more useful, intuitive and immersive. And over the coming months, we'll have more to share about these.
So that's how we're thinking about innovation and the future of sharing. It's been a busy quarter. In the last few months, I've visited countries in Asia, Europe and Latin America. In many communities, I've gotten the chance to see how the Internet is changing lives and creating opportunities for people. I've heard from people who can't wait to get access to the same tools that so many of us take for granted. We're making progress on our mission and working to accelerate towards the day when everyone in the world can be connected. Thanks to our entire community and all of our employees, partners and shareholders for being a part of this journey and for helping to build something great. Now here's Sheryl."

Mobile ad revenue grew 82% and is now 73% of total ad revenue. Our performance is strong across all marketer segments and we're pleased with the broad-based growth across our industry verticals.
From a regional perspective, we saw strong growth in North America and Asia Pacific, while Latin America and Europe were affected by foreign exchange headwinds and macroeconomic factors. That said, we're pleased with the advertiser adoption of our ad products across all regions.
Innovation drives our ads business. It's how we continually improve the quality of our ads, offer new tools to marketers and build better experiences for the people who use Facebook. We believe that this ability to innovate will continue to drive our business. So today, I want to focus on innovation across our 3 strategic priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of marketers using our ad products and making our ads more relevant.
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. Mobile continues to be a great opportunity for us. People continue to be highly engaged with our mobile apps. In the United States, for example, Facebook and Instagram get more than 1 out of every 5 minutes spent on mobile. As consumers shift to mobile, businesses are following, and we're focusing on helping them take advantage of this opportunity to use mobile to build their businesses. Two new products we introduced this quarter are good examples of this. The mobile Ads Manager app gives marketers the ability to manage their ad campaigns from their mobile devices. It's early, but we're already seeing more marketers managing their activity on mobile. We also launched a page creation tool for feature phones which has been a big driver of page adoption in high growth, emerging markets where smartphones are less common.
Looking ahead, we believe video will play a significant role in bringing more marketers to mobile. More than 75% of global video views on Facebook occur on mobile, and we believe mobile video will become more important to marketers over time. Lionsgate Age of Adaline premier is a great example. To promote the film, Lionsgate targeted young women on Instagram with multiple video ads over the last few weeks. This week, since the film opens on Friday, they are retargeting the audience from the Instagram campaign on Facebook. We expect more marketers to put mobile video at the heart of their campaigns in the future, and we're well positioned to drive this shift.
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products, and we're making great progress. In Q2 of last year, we shared that we reached 30 million active business pages on Facebook. This number continues to grow as more and more small businesses are using our free pages product, and we remain focused on converting these page owners into advertisers. One way we're doing this by providing simple, easy-to-use products. Over 80% of our new advertisers start with entry-level tools like a Promoted Post to our Page Like. We are increasingly focused on making sure these tools work well on mobile.
We're also educating marketers on how to use Facebook more effectively. We recently launched 2 online training resources blueprint for large clients and agencies and learn how videos for small businesses. These efforts are paying off. In Q1, we announced that we now have over 2 million active advertisers.
Our third priority is making our ads more relevant. More relevant ads lead to better returns for marketers and better experiences for people. We're pleased with the increased adoption of our targeting tools like Custom Audiences and conversion tracking. In Q1, we introduced dynamic product ads, which allow marketers to launch ads for different audiences. We also introduced carousel ads on Facebook and Instagram which allow marketers to advertise for specific products. Adoption of our targeting tools in these new ad formats help make our ads more relevant.
We're also focused on insights and measurement. We want to help marketers accurately measure the performance of their campaigns and then apply that learning to improve their returns. In Q1, we released an ads relevance score, a way for marketers to better understand how people respond to their ads. This helps marketers test different types of creative and optimize performance. We also launched conversion lift, a tool that scientifically measures how much additional business is driven from Facebook ads. This is important because it shows that ads on mobile can drive sales in retail stores and via other channels. For example, Sell-Das [ph] is a women's fashion retailer in Europe. Using conversion lift, they proved that ads on Facebook mobile drove sales on desktop and via phone calls to sales reps at their call centers.
On the Ad Tech side, we're pleased with the results we're driving for advertisers and publishers. A good example of this is Cheetah Mobile. Using native ads from the audience network in its app, the company is getting more than 2x the CPMs compared to other ad networks. We continue to invest in our Ad Tech platform. In our F8 developer conference last month, we made 2 important LiveRail announcements that will improve the relevance of ads people see across sites, apps and devices. We extended LiveRail's video ad platform into in-app mobile display which will give publishers better ways to manage their ad inventory across devices. We also announced that LiveRail will give publishers access to Facebook's anonymized demographic information, enabling us to serve more relevant ads to people.
We've had a great start to the year and we're really optimistic about what's to come. Our teams are executing well, staying focused on our big priorities and continuing to innovate. Now here's Dave."

Q1 was a strong quarter for Facebook. We generated $3.5 billion in revenue and $1.2 billion in free cash flow and continued making investments to position us for both near-term and long-term growth.We are pl",977,"Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 was a strong quarter for Facebook. We generated $3.5 billion in revenue and $1.2 billion in free cash flow and continued making investments to position us for both near-term and long-term growth.
We are pleased with the growth and engagement of our community. In March, 936 million people used Facebook on an average day, an increase of 17% compared to last year. This daily number represents 65% of the 1.44 billion people who use Facebook during the month of March.
Mobile remains the key driver of our growth. In March, approximately 1.25 billion people accessed Facebook on mobile devices, up 24% from last year. In addition to Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp continue to grow, exceeding 300 million, 600 million and 800 million MAU, respectively.
Now turning to the financials. All of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. Additionally, as a reminder, our non-GAAP measures exclude stock-based compensation and the amortization of intangibles.
Total revenue was $3.5 billion, up 42%, or 49% on a constant currency basis. Ad revenue was $3.3 billion, up 46%, or 55% on a constant currency basis. The general strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the past year had an unfavorable impact on our revenue. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q1 2014 levels, our total revenue this quarter would have been approximately $190 million higher.
Regionally, we saw strong North American ad revenue growth of 53% in the quarter, second only to APAC, which grew 57%. Europe and the rest of world revenue grew more slowly at 35% and 32%, respectively, with currency impacts leading to a significant reduction in these region's year-over-year growth rates.
Mobile ad revenue in Q1 was $2.4 billion, up from approximately $1.3 billion last year. Revenue from ad served on personal computers was down approximately 4%, and we continue to see overall usage on PCs decline.
In Q1, the average price per ad increased 285%, while total ad impressions declined 62%. Similar to last quarter, these price volume trends were primarily driven by the redesign of our right-hand column ads which rolled out in the third quarter of last year. To a lesser degree, the shift in usage towards mobile, where we don't have right-hand column ads, also contributed to the reported price volume trends.
Total payments and other fees revenue was $226 million, down 5% compared to last year, a trend we expect to continue. The decline was driven by the year-over-year reduction in payments revenue related to games played on personal computers.
Turning now to expenses. Our Q1 total GAAP expenses were $2.6 billion, up 83%, and non-GAAP expenses were $1.7 billion, up 57%. Similar to last quarter, stock-based compensation and amortization expenses related to the WhatsApp acquisition contributed significantly to the year-over-year growth in GAAP expenses. Non-GAAP expense growth was primarily driven by increases in headcount-related costs, cost of revenue and marketing expenses.
We ended Q1 with 10,082 employees, up 48%, compared to last year. We remain very pleased with our ability to attract and retain top-tier talent. Q1 operating income was $933 million, representing a 26% operating margin. Non-GAAP operating income was $1.8 billion, representing a 52% margin. Our Q1 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 45% and 35%, respectively. Q1 GAAP net income was $512 million or $0.18 per share and non-GAAP net income was $1.2 billion or $0.42 per share.
In Q1, capital expenditures were $502 million, and we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow. We ended the quarter with $12.4 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the outlook. Let's start with revenue. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the past year reduced our Q1 total revenue growth rate by 7 percentage points or approximately $190 million. The dollar strengthened over the course of the quarter and, in the month of March, our year-over-year total revenue growth rate was approximately 10% lower than it would have been in constant currency terms. Based on this, we estimate that foreign exchange headwinds in Q2 will likely be greater than those we experienced in Q1. In addition, we expect our total payments and other fees revenue to decline on a year-over-year basis for the remainder of the year.
Turning to expense guidance. We are tightening our expense guidance range modestly based on better visibility into our annual spending. We expect that the year-over-year growth rate for total 2015 GAAP expenses will be in the range of 55% to 65% as compared to our prior guidance of 55% to 70%. We expect that the year-over-year growth rate for total 2015 non-GAAP expenses will be in the range of 50% to 60% as compared to our prior guidance of 50% to 65%.
Our expense outlook reflects the broad range of investments that we're making in both our services and infrastructure, as we continue to enhance the core experiences on Facebook and Instagram, grow our messaging products, strengthen our advertising business globally and invest in long-term growth areas like Oculus and Internet.org.
The remainder of our guidance remains unchanged. We anticipate our 2015 capital expenditures will be in the neighborhood of $2.7 billion to $3.2 billion. We expect stock-based compensation in 2015 to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.3 billion, approximately half of which is related to our prior acquisitions, most notably WhatsApp. We expect amortization expenses in 2015 to be approximately $700 million to $800 million. And lastly, we anticipate our Q2 and full year 2015 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be consistent with the rates in the first quarter.
In summary, Q1 was a great start to the year for Facebook. We're very pleased with the growth of our community, the strength of our business and the investments we're making to build long-term shareholder value.
With that, Chris, let's open up the call for questions."

In terms of areas for improvement, I think there's a lot we can do. I think you have to look at our Ad Tech investments very holistically from Atlas to LiveRail to the Audience Network. These are all different pieces of the ad stack, but what they're all working on is taking the relevance and the ability to do people-based marketing and make that available to work on Facebook but also off Facebook. We believe that because we can do marketing to people and then measure results across what people do in privacy-protected ways, we have an ability to improve the relevance of marketing, which will make it better for consumers and increase returns for marketers."

The first is that we really have a great platform to do creative storytelling on mobile, and I think we have that in a way that no one else does. Our mobile ad product is so integrated into the user experience and provides real, creative flexibility that people have a way to reach people on mobile, and that's becoming increasingly important in telling the stories that drive their business. The second thing is video. Video is exploding on Facebook as Mark talked about, and that gives us an opportunity to do a lot of work with marketers on video. This is the first time the technology and media vertical was one of our top 4 verticals, and that's largely because of the use of mobile. And so that's been a really great story for us. In terms of penetration, we work with almost all the large marketers almost everywhere in the world. But even for the largest, the largest clients we have, we are a very small part of their budget. I don't think we have any large clients. If you look at -- 25% in the U.S. of consumer media time is on mobile and then 20% of mobile time goes to Facebook and Instagram, that would be 5% of U.S. consumer media time. With our largest clients, even our large ones, we're not close to 5% of their spend. And so I think we have a considerable opportunity to grow, and we also expect those underlying numbers, prime on mobile, to continue to grow."

And our response has been that we're going to focus on improving the quality and relevance, and that's both going to perform better for the people using our services and businesses who are buying ads.

There's just a lot of different experiences that need to get built. And a lot of what we're trying to do is enable a number of those things through Facebook while also building unique, world-class services to enable people to share all the things they care about with all the different sets of people that they care about.

Our goal when we work with marketers is to drive their business, and that means their products off the shelves, their services into the hands of people. And so in order to do that well, we need to work on targeting and we need to work on measurement. So with targeting, a more relevant ad is just better. It's better experience for consumers because they see something they like in their News Feed and it has a higher return for marketers. And so we're very focused on getting more people to use our targeting tools from Custom Audiences, which lets people target ads differently to their current customers or people who they'd like to be their customers, to look like audiences which enables us to identify the kind of characteristics in their current customers and then find other people on Facebook who share those characteristics. So again, the ad is well targeted. I think our targeting abilities are really second to none, and I'll share a recent example. XFINITY put out a voice guide for visual disabilities. And in -- they did this by doing an Oscar commercial with a girl who is blind, imagining what Wizard of Oz characters look like. Now by doing that -- the Oscars, that's obviously TV and it's a very broad ad, and that's because they were both showing a product but also working on they're their brand. On Facebook, they took that ad and showed it to movie fans, Wizard of Oz fans, and also people connected to accessibility causes. That's actually pretty specific targeting that lets them hit exactly the right audience and amplify what they were doing on TV. And I think that's the kind of thing that only we can do at scale and it shows how important targeting is. When you think about closing the loop, you then have to add in the measurement piece. Because if we can connect, people seeing ads on Facebook to what they buy in stores or in other ways, that's how you close the loop. And that's why we put so much investment and, hopefully, so much innovation behind measurement. So conversion tracking is increasingly used and we work with our marketers to use it even more. And we're also really excited about conversion lift because that's the first product we've had which scientifically measures the additional business you get from Facebook ads. It compares test groups that see ads with control groups that don't. So whatever you're measuring in terms of conversions, whether it's sales or website clicks or registration, we can A/B test and see exactly what the impact Facebook has. I think we're still at the beginning of this. I think there is so much more we can do to make ads more relevant on Facebook and so much more we can to to measure results, and I think our future growth will depend on executing on that very well."

And one thing that you may not know about voice calling is that, by using the Internet for calling rather than the relatively low bit rate voice networks, you can actually get higher-quality calls using VOIP. So one of our theories in this is that it's -- one of the reasons why voice calling has been a little slower to catch on is because you need the large established network of people who you know will have access to be able to receive a voice call before it -- before that behavior can really take on the big global community. But now between Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, which are 2 very broad communication networks, we're pretty confident that, because of the higher-quality of calling that you can get through the services that we're providing, that this is going to continue growing very quickly.

One of the things that had been interesting while we were watching these different services grow was just how quickly multiple different messaging and communication services were growing at the same time. It seems a little bit counterintuitive at first because it seemed like there should have been more overlap than it actually, now in retrospect, looking back, seems like there is. So you can look at countries where both services, WhatsApp and Messenger, are growing very quickly like Brazil, for example. And what you'll see is that, basically, people use them a little bit differently. I mean WhatsApp is more of a clear text messaging replacement. Facebook Messenger, people use to connect to people that they know on Facebook primarily. And then there are differences in the feature sets where WhatsApp is extremely utilitarian and focused on texting and now voice calling, whereas Messenger is very focused on expression and the whole set of things that fit into the tools around the Messenger platform that we rolled out at F8, communicating with businesses now, richer tools to communicate in different ways. So I think that these are just going to keep on growing is my expectation and hope. And we're excited to kind of pursue both different products to serve the different communities."

And then, Dave, I guess, for you, just in terms of CapEx. You gave guidance for this year but, again, given sort of the ramp-up in video and search, how should we think about CapEx longer term relative to either in absolute terms or maybe relative to revenue growth?"

S",415,"So for the first question, video is a big opportunity for us. Mark talked about how we have 4 billion video views on Facebook everyday, and we've always believe that the format of our ads should follow the format of what consumers are doing on Facebook. So many years ago, when the homepage takeover was in vogue, we never did that. And so the fact that there's so much consumer video, that gives us the opportunity to do more marketing video as well. It's still early days and we're very focused on quality, and it's worth noting that not all of the revenue from video is incremental because the video ads take the place of other ads that we would have served into News Feed. That said, we're really excited about the opportunity. I talked about it increasing the entertainment and media vertical. And brand marketers, particularly -- but I think all marketers have the opportunity to do video. And that's pretty exciting, including SMBs, who would never be able to hire a film crew and buy a TV ad, we're seeing those put videos in. Over 1 million SMBs have posted videos and on really small ads buys around them. That's pretty cool because I don't think there are probably 1 million advertisers who have bought TV ads in that same period of time. When you think about our marketer growth, I think we have an ability to grow both the number of advertisers who use our platform but also the percentage of their business that we get. So 30 million small business pages continuing to grow. We have an opportunity to turn those businesses into advertisers and marketers, and that's what we've done successfully and we're going to continue to focus on that. And we do that by building very simple ad products. And then when you think about the percentage of spend we have, what I said before on this call, which is we only have a small percentage of even our large customers, that's true of our small customers, too. Now there are some who spend a large portion of their budget on Facebook, but that's actually very unusual for most people, even when they start spending with that for a small portion of their budget. And when you look at the consumer time we get, we are not getting the equivalent amount of time or resources from our marketers, really, of any size, and therein lies our opportunity to grow."

So in terms of the 55% revenue growth, obviously, it's mobile News Feed is what's driving it from a fundamental point of view. In terms of what the opportunity there is to drive it, it's really about increasing the relevance and quality of the ads. That's been a key part of what we've been doing, and that will just continue to be the big driver in the near and medium term. And we're doing that on a number of different fronts. Part of it's about finding the right format, so it's getting the video units there for the people for whom video ads are going to make sense, it's getting the dynamic product ads in front of people for people who are going to find those ads interesting and engaging and it's really just continuing to learn more and more about the people who are using Facebook and what types of ads they interact with and they like. And so that's part of what we're trying to do across the board. And then, at the same time, we're bringing more and more advertisers into the system, and that's giving us a better selection of the ads that we can serve to the people using Facebook and that, again, improves the quality and the relevance. So the main thing that we're seeing drive this is just improving the quality and the relevance of the ads experience for the people using Facebook, and I think that's going to continue to be the story. I think the specific ads will be part of how we do that, but it won't be the only way. It will also be the targeting that we have and the targeting capabilities that we're doing with things like Custom Audiences and getting better and better at that. So there's a lot of different fronts that we're working on. It's hard to tease out every individual component of it. But all in all, we're really pleased with the revenue growth that we're seeing. And also, that's coupled with good engagement growth. So we're doing a nice balance of having an experience that's working well for our advertisers, but it's also working really well for the people who are using Facebook."

So I can speak to both of those. For the News Feed question, the north star for us in News Feed is that we want to produce the best experience for everyone who is using the app and loading News Feed to see what is going on in the world around them, right? So when it comes to -- there are lots of businesses on Facebook, there are professional content producers. Our main interest here is the people and the community who are using News Feed, not those guys, right? So of course, we want to build tools to enable them to share their content and all that, but we're constantly refining the algorithms in order to make it so the experience is the best for you when you open up your phone and look at Facebook and there are a bunch of things that are going on, we want to make sure that we're getting what you care about the most. And we go to a lot of lengths to make sure that we're getting signals from people in our community to make sure that we're doing this correctly in addition to the different signals that we would get from the same people who use the product. We also do a lot of qualitative surveys to see what people -- what makes -- what people write in that they want to see from us, what people tell us is the most important thing that they saw on Facebook today or saw anywhere in the world today and what they would have wanted to have seen on Facebook. And our goal is just to constantly refine this and make it better, and we're going to keep doing that because we think that there's a lot of upside and there's a lot more that we can do. Now at the same time, in order to make this experience good, there also needs to be good content in the system, right? So we need to make sure that people have the tools to be able to share the moments that they care about. But if you're a professional publisher, you need to have the ability to share a version of the content that you're producing that you're proud of that can load quickly, that can be as rich as the tools, enable people to see, and where we're working on a lot of different tools for that. You can imagine that as the tools for any of this content gets better, people taking photos, newspapers writing news articles, advertisers putting out ads for content that they want to sell, the better that content gets, the more people are excited to see it, then that informs the ranking and what the community qualitatively tells us that they want to see from us over time as well, so just a constant cycle on that. What was the other question?"

We know that marketers love videos. There's a great opportunity here. It's still early. It's worth pointing out that, as Sheryl mentioned, video does displace other ads in News Feed. And let me just kind of speak to how that plays into pricing as well. Video is just a format that's bid into the auction, so video is effectively winning in the auction if it's higher priced. So if somebody is willing to pay more for a video, it's going to get served before another type of format ad. But there's not really a price differential you're paying for a video, it's just what are you willing to pay into the system. So there's not differential pricing by product. It's just what are you willing to bid for the format that you want to show to the people that you want to show it to, and that's how the system works."

This was a good quarter and a good start to the year. We continue to grow the size and engagement of our community, now with 1.44 billion people using Facebook each month and 936 million people",1275,"Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. This was a good quarter and a good start to the year. We continue to grow the size and engagement of our community, now with 1.44 billion people using Facebook each month and 936 million people daily. We continue to see strong growth in daily engagements around the world, including in our most engaged markets. On mobile, nearly 1.25 billion people now use Facebook every month, 240 million in a year ago, and we now see more than 1 billion mobile searches every day.
Looking at our business. We continue to achieve impressive growth. Total revenue grew by 42% year-over-year and advertising revenue grew by 46%. Mobile now accounts for 73% of our ads revenue. These results show that we're making progress on our mission to connect the world, and we're executing well against our priorities. But this quarter also shows how Facebook is continuing to make progress for the years ahead. Facebook has evolved from a single blue app on your phone into a family of apps. Now many of these apps are reaching a global scale. More than 1.4 billion people use the core Facebook service, 800 million also use WhatsApp, 700 million use our Groups product, 600 million use Messenger and, on Instagram, there are more than 300 million active members of the community. We're building this family of apps because we want people to be able to share whatever moments they want with all the different sets of people they care about. Over time, we expect people to share richer content with an increasing frequency, so we want to continue developing new and better tools to facilitate this expression. So with that in mind, let's talk about our efforts over the quarter.
First, we're working to help people share and connect with all the things they care about today. The important part of our approach is helping our community connect around important public moments and personalities. Facebook is the largest community of sports fans in the world, with 650 million people connecting to sports pages. For this year's Super Bowl, more than 65 million people generated more than 265 million interactions on Facebook, the highest level of conversation we've seen for a Super Bowl to date. For the Cricket World Cup, there were more than 700 million interactions by 53 million people, which shows the strength of the global reach of our community. We're also making good progress with video. We're very pleased with our growth here. In this quarter, we reached a new milestone of more than 4 billion videos every -- daily video views. We also launched an embedded video player that allows people to watch Facebook videos across the web, and more than 80,000 videos have now been embedded on third-party websites.
Spherical videos are going to be supported in News Feed later this year, allowing you to change your viewing angle for a more immersive experience. Supporting new types of content like this is an important part of preparing for the future of how people want to share.
Now another part of our strategy is helping people connect with businesses. This quarter, we announced that there are now 2 million advertisers on Facebook. This is an important milestone for our community, and we're encouraged that so many businesses are finding value on Facebook. We continue to focus on innovation in our ads business, and Sheryl is going to talk a bit more about that in a moment.
Now here's how we're working to develop our family of apps so we can give people more options for sharing in different ways. In the future, we expect that people are going to want to share content with their closest friends at an even greater frequency than they do today. So messaging is a big priority for us. Across the Facebook family of apps, our efforts have a lot of momentum. On average, more than 45 billion messages are sent every day. With voice-calling, we're also starting to make some good progress. This quarter, we started rolling out voice-over-IP calls on WhatsApp to let people call friends for free around the world. And meanwhile, Messenger already accounts for more than 10% of mobile VOIP calls globally. With WhatsApp, we continue to be pleased with our growth, and the team remains very focused on building new features to serve their community and expand. For Messenger, this has been a particularly busy quarter. We launched the Messenger platform, which allows people to use creative new apps to have richer conversations. We also began rolling out payments on Messenger to give people an easy, secure way to send money to their friends. And we announced a new way for people to communicate with businesses using Messenger. We're really excited by the potential to build Messenger into a service that helps people to express themselves in rich, new ways and to access useful services.
With Instagram, our growth remains impressive. In this quarter, we reached a new milestone of more than 200 million daily actives. Growth in Asia, Europe and Latin America is particularly strong, with our community growing in some countries by more than 100% year-over-year, including Japan, South Korea and Indonesia. Combined with an average 21 minutes a day that people spend on Instagram, this is a good sign of this community's continuing and growing strength.
Now let's talk about how we're working with developers. Last month, we held F8, our annual event for the global developer community. Creating the future of sharing isn't something that we can do on our own but, by supporting developers, we can deliver more apps and experiences for our community. At F8, we presented new tools to help developers build, grow and monetize their apps, including better sharing experiences from apps to Facebook and new analytics to help developers better understand how people are using their services. More than 30 million apps and sites have been built using Facebook developer tools and, last year, we drove more than 3.5 billion app installs. We think these improvements are going to create a lot of value for our community.
All right. Finally, let's talk about some of our most long-term innovation efforts. Internet.org, our efforts to connect everyone in the world to the Internet, continues to gather momentum. We've now made free basic Internet services available to more than 800 million people in 9 countries, including, just in this quarter, launching in India, Colombia, Ghana, Guatemala and the Philippines. More than 7 million people who weren't connected to the Internet before now use Internet.org to get online. And this year, we expect to connect even more people.
With our efforts in search, AI and Oculus, we're also continuing to build a new generation of Internet services that are more useful, intuitive and immersive. And over the coming months, we'll have more to share about these.
So that's how we're thinking about innovation and the future of sharing. It's been a busy quarter. In the last few months, I've visited countries in Asia, Europe and Latin America. In many communities, I've gotten the chance to see how the Internet is changing lives and creating opportunities for people. I've heard from people who can't wait to get access to the same tools that so many of us take for granted. We're making progress on our mission and working to accelerate towards the day when everyone in the world can be connected. Thanks to our entire community and all of our employees, partners and shareholders for being a part of this journey and for helping to build something great. Now here's Sheryl."

Our performance is strong acros",979,"Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. Q1 was a strong quarter and a great start to the year. Ad revenue was $3.3 billion, up 46%, or 55% on a constant currency basis. Mobile ad revenue grew 82% and is now 73% of total ad revenue. Our performance is strong across all marketer segments and we're pleased with the broad-based growth across our industry verticals.
From a regional perspective, we saw strong growth in North America and Asia Pacific, while Latin America and Europe were affected by foreign exchange headwinds and macroeconomic factors. That said, we're pleased with advertiser adoption of our ad products across all regions.
Innovation drives our ads business. It's how we continually improve the quality of our ads, offer new tools to marketers and build better experiences for the people who use Facebook. We believe that this ability to innovate will continue to drive our business. So today, I want to focus on innovation across our 3 strategic priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of marketers using our ad products and making our ads more relevant.
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. Mobile continues to be a great opportunity for us. People continue to be highly engaged with our mobile apps. In the United States, for example, Facebook and Instagram get more than 1 out of every 5 minutes spent on mobile. As consumers shift to mobile, businesses are following, and we're focusing on helping them take advantage of this opportunity to use mobile to build their businesses. Two new products we introduced this quarter are good examples of this. The mobile Ads Manager app gives marketers the ability to manage their ad campaigns from their mobile devices. It's early, but we're already seeing more marketers managing their activity on mobile. We also launched a page creation tool for feature phones which has been a big driver of page adoption in high-growth, emerging markets where smartphones are less common.
Looking ahead, we believe video will play a significant role in bringing more marketers to mobile. More than 75% of global video views on Facebook occur on mobile, and we believe mobile video will become more important to marketers over time. Lionsgate Age of Adaline premiere is a great example. To promote the film, Lionsgate targeted young women on Instagram with multiple video ads over the last few weeks. This week, since the film opens on Friday, they are retargeting the audience from the Instagram campaign on Facebook. We expect more marketers to put mobile video at the heart of their campaigns in the future, and we're well positioned to drive this shift.
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products, and we're making great progress. In Q2 of last year, we shared that we reached 30 million active business pages on Facebook. This number continues to grow as more and more small businesses are using our free pages product, and we remain focused on converting these page owners into advertisers. One way we're doing this by providing simple, easy-to-use products. Over 80% of our new advertisers start with entry-level tools like a Promoted Post to our Page Like. We are increasingly focused on making sure these tools work well on mobile.
We're also educating marketers on how to use Facebook more effectively. We recently launched 2 online training resources, blueprint for large clients and agencies and learn how videos for small businesses. These efforts are paying off. In Q1, we announced that we now have over 2 million active advertisers.
Our third priority is making our ads more relevant. More relevant ads lead to better returns for marketers and better experiences for people. We're pleased with the increased adoption of our targeting tools like Custom Audiences and conversion tracking. In Q1, we introduced dynamic product ads, which allow marketers to launch ads for different audiences. We also introduced carousel ads on Facebook and Instagram which allow marketers to advertise for specific products. Adoption of our targeting tools in these new ad formats help make our ads more relevant.
We're also focused on insights and measurement. We want to help marketers accurately measure the performance of their campaigns and then apply that learning to improve their returns. In Q1, we released an ads relevance score, a way for marketers to better understand how people respond to their ads. This helps marketers test different types of creative and optimize performance. We also launched conversion lift, a tool that scientifically measures how much additional business is driven from Facebook ads. This is important because it shows that ads on mobile can drive sales in retail stores and via other channels. For example, Sell-Das [ph] is a women's fashion retailer in Europe. Using conversion lift, they proved that ads on Facebook mobile drove sales on desktop and via phone calls to sales reps at their call centers.
On the Ad Tech side, we're pleased with the results we're driving for advertisers and publishers. A good example of this is Cheetah Mobile. Using native ads from the audience network in its app, the company is getting more than 2x the CPMs compared to other ad networks. We continue to invest in our Ad Tech platform. At our F8 developer conference last month, we made 2 important LiveRail announcements that will improve the relevance of ads people see across sites, apps and devices. We extended LiveRail's video ad platform into in-app mobile display which will give publishers better ways to manage their ad inventory across devices. We also announced that LiveRail will give publishers access to Facebook's anonymized demographic information, enabling us to serve more relevant ads to people.
We've had a great start to the year and we're really optimistic about what's to come. Our teams are executing well, staying focused on our big priorities and continuing to innovate. Now here's Dave."

Q1 was a strong quarter for Facebook. We generated $3.5 billion in revenue and $1.2 billion in free cash flow and continued making investments to position us for both near-term and long-term growth.
We are pleased with the growth and engagement of our community. In March, 936 million people used Facebook on an average day, an increase of 17% compared to last year. This daily number represents 65% of the 1.44 billion people who used Facebook during the month of March.
Mobile remains the key driver of our growth. In March, approximately 1.25 billion people accessed Facebook on mobile devices, up 24% from last year. In addition to Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp continue to grow, exceeding 300 million, 600 million and 800 million MAU, respectively.
Now turning to the financials. All of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. Additionally, as a reminder, our non-GAAP measures exclude stock-based compensation and the amortization of intangibles.
Total revenue was $3.5 billion, up 42%, or 49% on a constant currency basis. Ad revenue was $3.3 billion, up 46%, or 55% on a constant currency basis. The general strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the past year had an unfavorable impact on our revenue. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q1 2014 levels, our total revenue this quarter would have been approximately $190 million higher.
Regionally, we saw strong North American ad revenue growth of 53% in the quarter, second only to APAC, which grew 57%. Europe and the rest of world revenue grew more slowly at 35% and 32%, respectively, with currency impacts leading to a significant reduction in these regions' year-over-year growth rates.
Mobile ad revenue in Q1 was $2.4 billion, up from approximately $1.3 billion last year. Revenue from ad served on personal computers was down approximately 4%, and we continue to see overall usage on PCs decline.
In Q1, the average price per ad increased 285%, while total ad impressions declined 62%. Similar to last quarter, these price volume trends were primarily driven by the redesign of our right-hand column ads which rolled out in the third quarter of last year. To a lesser degree, the shift in usage towards mobile, where we don't have right-hand column ads, also contributed to the reported price volume trends.
Total payments and other fees revenue was $226 million, down 5% compared to last year, a trend we expect to continue. The decline was driven by the year-over-year reduction in payments revenue related to games played on personal computers.
Turning now to expenses. Our Q1 total GAAP expenses were $2.6 billion, up 83%, and non-GAAP expenses were $1.7 billion, up 57%. Similar to last quarter, stock-based compensation and amortization expenses related to the WhatsApp acquisition contributed significantly to the year-over-year growth in GAAP expenses. Non-GAAP expense growth was primarily driven by increases in headcount-related costs, cost of revenue and marketing expenses.
We ended Q1 with 10,082 employees, up 48%, compared to last year. We remain very pleased with our ability to attract and retain top-tier talent. Q1 operating income was $933 million, representing a 26% operating margin. Non-GAAP operating income was $1.8 billion, representing a 52% margin. Our Q1 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 45% and 35%, respectively. Q1 GAAP net income was $512 million or $0.18 per share and non-GAAP net income was $1.2 billion or $0.42 per share.
In Q1, capital expenditures were $502 million, and we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow. We ended the quarter with $12.4 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the outlook. Let's start with revenue. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the past year reduced our Q1 total revenue growth rate by 7 percentage points or approximately $190 million. The dollar strengthened over the course of the quarter and, in the month of March, our year-over-year total revenue growth rate was approximately 10% lower than it would have been in constant currency terms. Based on this, we estimate that foreign exchange headwinds in Q2 will likely be greater than those we experienced in Q1. In addition, we expect our total payments and other fees revenue to decline on a year-over-year basis for the remainder of the year.
Turning to expense guidance. We are tightening our expense guidance range modestly based on better visibility into our annual spending. We expect that the year-over-year growth rate for total 2015 GAAP expenses will be in the range of 55% to 65% as compared to our prior guidance of 55% to 70%. We expect that the year-over-year growth rate for total 2015 non-GAAP expenses will be in the range of 50% to 60% as compared to our prior guidance of 50% to 65%.
Our expense outlook reflects the broad range of investments that we're making in both our services and infrastructure, as we continue to enhance the core experiences on Facebook and Instagram, grow our messaging products, strengthen our advertising business globally and invest in long-term growth areas like Oculus and Internet.org.
The remainder of our guidance remains unchanged. We anticipate our 2015 capital expenditures will be in the neighborhood of $2.7 billion to $3.2 billion. We expect stock-based compensation in 2015 to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.3 billion, approximately half of which is related to our prior acquisitions, most notably WhatsApp. We expect amortization expenses in 2015 to be approximately $700 million to $800 million. And lastly, we anticipate our Q2 and full year 2015 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be consistent with the rates in the first quarter.
In summary, Q1 was a great start to the year for Facebook. We're very pleased with the growth of our community, the strength of our business and the investments we're making to build long-term shareholder value.
With that, Chris, let's open up the call for questions."

What we're hearing from publishers is that this is a good opportunity, and they're pleased with the extensions we're making because it can make their ad serving and buying more efficient across the platforms they use. In terms of areas for improvement, I think there's a lot we can do. I think you have to look at our Ad Tech investments very holistically from Atlas to LiveRail to the Audience Network. These are all different pieces of the ad stack, but what they're all working on is taking the relevance and the ability to do people-based marketing and make that available to work on Facebook but also off Facebook. We believe that because we can do marketing to people and then measure results across what people do in privacy-protective ways, we have an ability to improve the relevance of marketing, which will make it better for consumers and increase returns for marketers."

In general, I would say our headcount growth has skewed towards the R&D side because a lot of these initiatives have long-term development needs, so we've been investing there, but we are investing across the board. In terms of specific headcount guidance, I would just stick with our expense guidance. But I'd note that the 48% year-over-year does include some inorganic growth from the pickup of the 3 larger acquisitions: Oculus, LiveRail and WhatsApp. We haven't lapped those at this point."

The first is that we really have a great platform to do creative storytelling on mobile, and I think we have that in a way that no one else does. Our mobile ad product is so integrated into the user experience and provides real, creative flexibility that people have a way to reach people on mobile, and that's becoming increasingly important in telling the stories that drive their business. The second thing is video. Video is exploding on Facebook as Mark talked about, and that gives us an opportunity to do a lot of work with marketers on video. This is the first time the technology and media vertical was one of our top 4 verticals, and that's largely because of the use of mobile. And so that's been a really great story for us. In terms of penetration, we work with almost all the large marketers almost everywhere in the world. But even for the largest, the largest clients we have, we are a very small part of their budget. I don't think we have any large clients. If you look at -- 25% in the U.S. of consumer media time is on mobile and then 20% of mobile time goes to Facebook and Instagram, that would be 5% of U.S. consumer media time. With our largest clients, even our large ones, we're not close to 5% of their spend. And so I think we have a considerable opportunity to grow, and we also expect those underlying numbers, prime on mobile, to continue to grow."

And I think what you're seeing is that, as we enable more use cases and as we just get a lot of the basics right around performance and bringing the mobile features into parity and beyond what we've been able to do on desktop, the volume is growing quickly. I think on a recent earnings call, we just announced that we passed 1 billion searches total, so now being more than 1 billion on mobile shows some progress that I'm pretty proud of for the search team."

And we have a lot more coming there, so I'm excited about that. And we definitely do see, in this family of apps strategy, that there's so many new ways that people want to share content and so many different types of sets of people that people want to share with ranging from 1 person at a time and that would be messaging or small group sharing or sharing with interest-based communities or sharing with all your friends at once or sharing with public. There's just a lot of different experiences that need to get built. And a lot of what we're trying to do is enable a number of those things through Facebook while also building unique, world-class services to enable people to share all the things they care about with all the different sets of people that they care about. So we're going to keep on doing more there, but we're happy with where we are now. We have a number of services that are reaching pretty good scale, and I think we'll keep on pushing that."

Our goal when we work with marketers is to drive their business, and that means their products off the shelves, their services into the hands of people. And so in order to do that well, we need to work on targeting and we need to work on measurement. So with targeting, a more relevant ad is just better. It's better experience for consumers because they see something they like in their News Feed and it has a higher return for marketers. And so we're very focused on getting more people to use our targeting tools from Custom Audiences, which lets people target ads differently to their current customers or people who they'd like to be their customers, to look like audiences which enables us to identify the kind of characteristics of their current customers and then find other people on Facebook who share those characteristics. So again, the ad is well targeted. I think our targeting abilities are really second to none, and I'll share a recent example. XFINITY put out a voice guide for visual disabilities. And in -- they did this by doing an Oscar commercial with a girl who is blind, imagining what Wizard of Oz characters look like. Now by doing that -- the Oscars, that's obviously TV and it's a very broad ad, and that's because they were both showing a product but also working on their brand. On Facebook, they took that ad and showed it to movie fans, Wizard of Oz fans, and also people connected to accessibility causes. That's actually pretty specific targeting that lets them hit exactly the right audience and amplify what they were doing on TV. And I think that's the kind of thing that only we can do at scale and it shows how important targeting is. When you think about closing the loop, you then have to add in the measurement piece. Because if we can connect, people seeing ads on Facebook to what they buy in stores or in other ways, that's how you close the loop. And that's why we've put so much investment and, hopefully, so much innovation behind measurement. So conversion tracking is increasingly used and we work with our marketers to use it even more. And we're also really excited about conversion lift because that's the first product we've had which scientifically measures the additional business you get from Facebook ads. It compares test groups that see ads with control groups that don't. So whatever you're measuring in terms of conversions, whether it's sales or website clicks or registration, we can A/B test and see exactly what the impact Facebook has. I think we're still at the beginning of this. I think there is so much more we can do to make ads more relevant on Facebook and so much more we can do to measure results, and I think our future growth will depend on executing on that very well."

What we're focused on doing is providing more -- higher-quality services for free that what you can otherwise get in paying for them. And one thing that you may not know about voice calling is that, by using the Internet for calling rather than the relatively low bit rate voice networks, you can actually get higher-quality calls using VOIP. So one of our theories in this is that it's -- one of the reasons why voice calling has been a little slower to catch on is because you need the large established network of people who you know will have access to be able to receive a voice call before it -- before that behavior can really take on the big global community. But now between Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, which are 2 very broad communication networks, we're pretty confident that, because of the higher-quality of calling that you can get through the services that we're providing, that this is going to continue growing very quickly. I mean, a lot of people still -- we're just very early in rolling out and promoting it. Even in Facebook Messenger, it's been out for a little while, we're already more than 10% of the global VOIP market.

But it needs to do a lot more, obviously, and we're very excited about the road map of things that we have ahead. In terms of integrating them, no, we're not going to do that. One of the things that had been interesting while we were watching these different services grow was just how quickly multiple different messaging and communication services were growing at the same time. It seems a little bit counterintuitive at first because it seemed like there should have been more overlap than it actually, now in retrospect, looking back, seems like there is. So you can look at countries where both services, WhatsApp and Messenger, are growing very quickly like Brazil, for example. And what you'll see is that, basically, people use them a little bit differently. I mean, WhatsApp is more of a clear text messaging replacement. Facebook Messenger, people use to connect with people that they know on Facebook primarily. And then there are differences in the feature sets where WhatsApp is extremely utilitarian and focused on texting and now voice calling, whereas Messenger is very focused on expression and the whole set of things that fit into the tools around the Messenger platform that we rolled out at F8, communicating with businesses now, richer tools to communicate in different ways. So I think that these are just going to keep on growing is my expectation and hope. And we're excited to kind of pursue both different products to serve the different communities."

Mark talked about how we have 4 billion video views on Facebook every day, and we've always believed that the format of our ads should follow the format of what consumers are doing on Facebook. So many years ago, when the homepage takeover was in vogue, we never did that. And so the fact that there's so much consumer video, that gives us the opportunity to do more marketing video as well. It's still early days and we're very focused on quality, and it's worth noting that not all of the revenue from video is incremental because the video ads take the place of other ads that we would have served into News Feed. That said, we're really excited about the opportunity. I talked about it increasing the entertainment and media vertical. And brand marketers, particularly -- but I think all marketers have the opportunity to do video. And that's pretty exciting, including SMBs, who would never be able to hire a film crew and buy a TV ad, we're seeing those put videos in. Over 1 million SMBs have posted videos and done really small ad buys around them. And that's pretty cool because I don't think there are probably 1 million advertisers who have bought TV ads in that same period of time. When you think about our marketer growth, I think we have an ability to grow both the number of advertisers who use our platform but also the percentage of their business that we get. So 30 million small business pages continuing to grow. We have an opportunity to turn those businesses into advertisers and marketers, and that's what we've done successfully and we're going to continue to focus on that. And we do that by building very simple ad products. And then when you think about the percentage of spend we have, what I said before on this call, which is we only have a small percentage of even our large customers, that's true of our small customers, too. Now there are some who spend a large portion of their budget on Facebook, but that's actually very unusual for most people, even when they start spending with us, we're a small portion of their budget. And when you look at the consumer time we get, we are not getting the equivalent amount of time or resources from our marketers, really, of any size, and therein lies our opportunity to grow."

In terms of what the opportunity there is to drive it, it's really about increasing the relevance and quality of the ads. That's been a key part of what we've been doing, and that will just continue to be the big driver in the near and medium term. And we're doing that on a number of different fronts. Part of it's about finding the right format, so it's getting the video units there for the people for whom video ads are going to make sense, it's getting the dynamic product ads in front of people for people who are going to find those ads interesting and engaging and it's really just continuing to learn more and more about the people who are using Facebook and what types of ads they interact with and like. And so that's part of what we're trying to do across the board. And then, at the same time, we're bringing more and more advertisers into the system, and that's giving us a better selection of the ads that we can serve to the people using Facebook and that, again, improves the quality and the relevance.

I think the specific ads will be part of how we do that, but it won't be the only way. It will also be the targeting that we have and the targeting capabilities that we're doing with things like Custom Audiences and getting better and better at that. So there's a lot of different fronts that we're working on. It's hard to tease out every individual component of it. But all in all, we're really pleased with the revenue growth that we're seeing. And also, that's coupled with good engagement growth. So we're doing a nice balance of having an experience that's working well for our advertisers, but it's also working really well for the people who are using Facebook."

But if you're a professional publisher, you need to have the ability to share a version of the content that you're producing that you're proud of that can load quickly, that can be as rich as the tools enable people to see, and where we're working on a lot of different tools for that. You can imagine that as the tools for any of this content get better, people taking photos, newspapers writing news articles, advertisers putting out ads for content that they want to sell, the better that content gets, the more people are excited to see it, then that informs the ranking and what the community qualitatively tells us that they want to see from us over time as well, so just a constant cycle on that. What was the other question?"

We know that marketers love videos. There's a great opportunity here. It's still early. It's worth pointing out that, as Sheryl mentioned, video does displace other ads in News Feed. And let me just kind of speak to how that plays into pricing as well. Video is just a format that's bid into the auction, so video is effectively winning in the auction if it's higher priced. So if somebody is willing to pay more for a video, it's going to get served before another type of format ad. But there's not really a price differential you're paying for a video, it's just what are you willing to pay into the system. So there's not differential pricing by product. It's just what are you willing to bid for the format that you want to show to the people that you want to show it to, and that's how the system works."

This was a good quarter [ph] for us. We've continued to make good progress in the growth of our community with 1.49 billion people now using Facebook each month and more than 1.3 billion people using Facebook on mobile. We've all those continued to make games and engagement. More than 968 million people worldwide now use Facebook daily, and 65% of our monthly actives are daily actives.  Several products in the Facebook app are reaching global scale, too, now with more than 450 million people using Events each month and more than 850 million people using Groups.  When it comes to time spent across Facebook, Messenger and Instagram, people are now spending more than 50 -- sorry, 46 minutes per day on average, and that doesn't include WhatsApp.
Our business performance has grown with our community. This quarter, our total revenue is more than $4 billion for the first time, and our advertising revenue grew by 43% year-over-year. These results reflect the ongoing investments and improvements we made on the quality, performance and usefulness of our services, and continuing to make progress here remains our biggest priority. 
Now with that in mind, I'd like to talk about how we're working on this across our current products, our next generation of apps and our long-term innovation efforts.
Over the next few years, our main focus is on helping our existing communities and businesses reach their full potential. An important part of our strategy is continuing to deliver great experiences across all our products. This means improving the speed and reliability of our apps and building the infrastructure to support our global scale, like our new data center in Texas. Over the last 6 months, we've improved the performance of our core app, reducing crashes on iOS by more than 30% and some Android phones by more than 40%. On Messenger, people can now send messages up to 20% faster, and it's twice as fast when you start the app.  These are just a few examples of how our engineering focus is delivering better experiences for everyone in our community. 
Another part of delivering great experiences is helping people connect to the content they want. This quarter, we've continued to focus on improving people's experience and News Feeds by making it easier to find more relevant and engaging content from friends and the entire community. Connecting people with video content is an important part. The video continues to be some of the richest and most engaging content for people and publishers. And through the start of the year, pages are also sharing more than 40% more videos. This quarter, we updated our News Feed ranking to help people see more the videos they care about and also began testing new options for video monetization to help our partners build their businesses. We're excited about the potential for continued work here.
The focus we've had on video also supports our efforts to connect more people around important public moments and events. From the 59 million people who generated more than 300 million interactions around the Copa America, to the 26 million people who changed their profile pictures for Pride, or more than 150 million people who were notified that their friends were safe after the Nepal earthquake, Facebook has clearly become the home for global conversations about things that people care about. 
And when it comes to serving businesses on our platform, this quarter, we continued to focus on delivering more useful tools and resources to help them achieve their goals. Helping marketers to tell more visually engaging stories through video and ads is an important focus as well as supporting small businesses. There are now more than 40 million small businesses -- small and medium-size businesses using pages on Facebook, so have a big opportunity to create value for communities around the world, and Sheryl is going to talk more about this in a moment.
Next, let talk about how we're building our next generation services, which we also expect to be an important parts of our business over the next few years. With Instagram, the continued growth in the size and engagement of the community shows how this is becoming one of the best places to get a real-time snapshot of the world. For moments from the U.S. presidential campaign trail to NASA's first photos from Pluto, people are using Instagram in a lot of interesting ways. This quarter, we made some big improvements to the app, including upgrading our search and explore functionality and introducing trending content, which we expect will provide even more engaging experiences.
On Messenger, this quarter, we rolled out the number of new features including mobile video calling, new way to share location and the options to sign up for Messenger without using a Facebook account. We also continue to make good progress building the Messenger platform. We expect these improvements to continue making Messenger a more useful and engaging experience for lots of people. More than 700 million people now use Messenger, and we reached more than 1 billion downloads on Android. milestones are a good sign that we're on the right path here.
With WhatsApp, we're pleased with our continued growth, and the team is continuing to roll out new features to serve the whole community. We continue to improve the web experience for WhatsApp as well as launching VoIP Calling to more people and on more devices.
With search, we are considering to build a better experience for our whole community. We recently crossed 1.5 billion searches per day, and we've now indexed more than 2 trillion posts. This is a huge set of unique experiences and perspectives. And by allowing people to unlock this knowledge, we have a huge opportunity create value for the world in the coming years.
Finally, let's talk about our other efforts that we expect to deliver an impact over the longer term. With Internet.org, we have a lot of momentum with our goal of connecting everyone in the world to the Internet. A year ago, we launched the Internet.org app for the first time in Zambia. And since then, we made free basic Internet services available to more than 1 billion people in 17 countries. Our results show that Internet.org is working. After launching free basic services, mobile operators are seeing people adopt to mobile data 50% faster than before. And more than half the new people coming online through Internet.org choose to pay for data and access more Internet services within their first 30 days.
We've recently made changes to Internet.org program for both developers and operators that will give people -- that will give more people access to even more free services. With the Internet.org platform, now it's easy for any developer to create services that integrate with Internet.org. And just this week, we announced a portal for operators that makes it easy for them to quickly launch free basic services in new countries.
We're also making progress on our efforts to connect people living in some of the most remote communities on earth. Our connectivity lab is making work on new technologies for connecting communities that include drones, satellites and laser communication systems, and we'll be share more of our progress here very soon.
And with Oculus, we've announced that the Wrist will ship to consumers in the first quarter of 2016. The team recently introduced details about the full hardware and software experience people can expect, including our new touch controllers. Oculus is going to be the best VR experience in the world when it launches, and I'm really excited for us to begin delivering on the promise of virtual reality.
So that's how we focused our efforts over the last quarter. We're preparing for the future, but we're also working to deliver better experiences and value to our community today. And as usual, I want to thank our whole community, including our employees, our shareholders and our partners. Thanks to you, our community is getting stronger and stronger every day and we're making progress on our mission to make the world more open and connected.
So thank you, and now here's Sheryl."
20765463,305740243,841819,"Facebook, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2015",2015-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Meta Platforms, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. We had another strong quarter and a great first half of the year. Ad revenue grew 43% year-over-year, 55% on a constant-currency basis. Mobile ad revenue grew 74% year-over-year, making it over 3/4 of total ad revenue. Ou",1008,"Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. We had another strong quarter and a great first half of the year. Ad revenue grew 43% year-over-year, 55% on a constant-currency basis. Mobile ad revenue grew 74% year-over-year, making it over 3/4 of total ad revenue. 
Our growth was broad-based across all marketer segments and industry verticals. Similar to Q1, we're pleased with the adoption of our ad products across all regions, and we saw strong revenue growth in North America and Asia Pacific in particular.  We're staying focused on our 3 main priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of Facebook marketers, and making our ads more relevant and effective.
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. People are spending more time in the mobile devices and on Facebook apps. We continue to get more than one out of every 5 minutes on smartphones in the U.S., and mobile usage is driving our growth globally as well. We believe we have the best performing mobile ad product in the market and video is making it even better. With so many consumer videos being watched on Facebook, video ads are a natural part of the News Feed experience. For marketers, video has always been a compelling format. Now Facebook enables mass reach and cross-device targeting and measurement abilities far superior to what other platforms offer.
Mobile video was a major theme at the Con Festival last month, with some of the biggest winners like Under Armour's I will What I Want with Sugar 5 and Procter & Gamble's Like a Girl with Leo Burnett used mobile video in Facebook as part of their campaigns.
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products. In Q2, we announced that 40 million small and medium businesses have active Facebook Pages, and this number continues to grow. 
Earlier this month, I hosted SMB roundtables in Berlin and London. I got to hear first-hand how advertising on Facebook is helping SMB sell their products and businesses, hire new employees and even expand to other cities and countries. One of the business owners I met is Kelly Wright, a single mom who started selling dresses from her home. She began by shooting videos of dresses on her mobile phone and promoting them on Facebook for just a few pounds. Using Facebook as her only marketing channel, Kelly grew her business, Crystal Fashions, to over GBP 3 million  annually, and she now has 10 employees.
We're increasing our engagement to global SMB community and have now have more than 80 local booster events around the world, meeting thousands of businesses and getting their feedback on how we can make our products work better for them. 
We're also building on our leadership teams around the world. In recent week,s, we've added senior talent our international teams including an new head of Latin America and new regional leadership in several countries in EMEA. We also opened an office in Johannesburg, our first in Africa.
Our third priority is making our ads more relevant and effective. Better and more engaging relevant ads are good for people and marketers, and we're working hard to improve them. We continue to innovate at a rapid pace by introducing new ad formats and new tools for marketers. This quarter, we expanded carousel ads, which are multiple images in one ad unit. We introduced dynamic product ads, which allow marketers to upload their product catalog and show the right product to the right person at the right time. We also introduced a new ad format called Lead Ads, a, simpler way for people to connect with companies they're interested in hearing from. 
We continue to focus on providing world-class products and tools for direct response advertisers. Booking.com, a Priceline Group company, is using Facebook-linked ads featuring Book Now button to drive reservations. In Q2, Facebook ads drove a meaningful increase in room reservations for booking.com, helping them meet their ROI goals for the campaign. They're now expanding their use of Facebook ads across multiple markets.
We continue to make progress with ads on Instagram. In Q2, we launched Instagram ads in Brazil, Germany and Japan. We also introduce additional capabilities for marketers including carousel ads on Instagram, which brands are using in creative ways, for example, to showcase the spring fashion collection gradually reveal a full panorama or show different views of a location. Over the coming months, Instagram ads will be available to more advertisers with new formats, better targeting and ability to buy online as well as through third-party planners. As we ramp Instagram ads, we remain focused on quality and relevance to ensure the best experience for people and the highest performance for marketers. And as always, our highest focus is on the consumer experience in Instagram.
Measurement is a key priority of as we work to expand our share of global marketing budgets. Since we introduced Conversion List, which measures the direct impact of Facebook ads have on sales, we've seen adoption for marketers across verticals. When Ocular launch the TLX, the largest launch in their history, they used Facebook video to show the TLX in areas that quickly captured people's attention like imitating a roller coaster. They used our retargeting technology to show more detailed ads only to the people who watched the videos. Using Conversion List, they proved that Facebook ads directly drove vehicle sales.
To help marketers target and measure campaigns both on and off Facebook, we're continuing to build out our ad tech platform with Atlas LiveRail in the Audience Network. Entertainment company Live Nation knew that people browse for concert tickets on mobile devices, but they were never able to measure whether they converted into sales. Using Atlas, Live Nation was able to link mobile ads to 66% more ticket purchases for one of the largest artists. This shows the promise of Atlas to measure cross-device conversion. We're pleased with the progress we're making in all 3 of our main priorities, and we plan to stay focused.
Now here's Dave."

And by this measure, the second quarter was our strongest in terms of community growth since 2013.  Mobile remains the key driver of our growth. In June, approximately 1.31 billion people accessed Facebook on mobile devices, up 23% from last year. 
We also saw strong growth in our next generation of services with Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp now exceeding 300 million, 700 million and 800 million MAU respectively.
Now turning to the financials. All of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Additionally, our non-GAAP measures excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles.
Total revenue was $4 billion, up 39% or 50% on a constant-currency basis. Ad revenue was $3.8 billion, up 43% or 55% on a constant-currency basis. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar has continued to have an unfavorable impact on our revenue. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q2 2014 levels, our total revenue this quarter would have been approximately $330 million higher.
Regionally, we saw strong North American ad revenue growth of 55% in the quarter, and APAC growth also remains strong at 48%. Europe and the rest of the world ad revenue grew more slowly at 30% and 22% respectively as currency had a significant negative impact on each of those regions' year-over-year growth rates.
Mobile is engine of our revenue growth. Mobile ad revenue in Q2 was $2.9 billion, up 74% from last year and represents 76% of our advertising revenue. Revenue from ads served on personal computers was down approximately 8%.
In Q2, the average price per ad increased 220%, while total ad impressions declined 55%. Similar to last quarter, these price volume trends were primarily driven by the redesign of our right-hand-column ads, which rolled out in the third quarter of last year. To a lesser degree, the shift of usage towards mobile, where we don't have right-hand-column ads, also contributed to the reported price-volume trends.
Total payments and other fees revenue was $215 million, down 8% compared to last year. The decline was driven by a 19% year-over-year reduction in payments revenue related to games played on personal computers, offset primarily by the addition of other revenue related to acquisitions closed in the second half of 2014.
Turning now to expenses. Our Q2 total GAAP expenses were $2.8 billion, up 82%, and non-GAAP expenses were $1.8 billion, up 57%. Similar to last quarter, stock-based compensation and amortization expenses related to the WhatsApp acquisition contributed significantly to the year-over-year growth in GAAP expenses. Non-GAAP expenses growth was primarily driven by increases in headcount-related costs, cost of revenue and marketing expenses.
We ended the quarter with 10,955 employees, up 52% compared to last year. With 873 additional employees, Q2 was one of our strongest quarters in terms of hiring, and the majority of the new employees were added in R&D. 
Our Q2 GAAP operating income was $1.3 billion, representing a 31% operating margin. Non-GAAP operating income was $2.2 billion, representing a 55% margin.
Our Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 44% and 36% respectively. Q2 GAAP net income was $719 million or $0.25 per share, and non-GAAP net income was $1.4 billion or $0.50 per share.
In Q2, capital expenditures were $549 million, and we generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow. We ended the year -- sorry, we ended the quarter with $14.1 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the outlook. Let's start with revenue. Since the first quarter of 2014, we have seen year-over-year advertising revenue growth rates decline each subsequent quarter. We expect this trend to continue in Q3 and Q4 as we continue to grow off a much larger base and face currency headwinds due to the strong dollar. In addition, we expect our total payments and other fees revenues to decline on a year-over-year basis for the remainder of the year. The decline in the second half of the year should be closer to the 19% year-over-year decline we experienced in the payments business alone, as we will be lapping periods in which we added other fees revenue from acquisitions closed in the second half of 2014.
Turning to expense guidance. Based on our second quarter results, we are narrowing the expense guidance range for 2015. We now expect the year-over-year growth rate for total 2015 GAAP expenses to be between 55% and 60%, narrowed from the prior range of 55% to 65%. And we expect the year-over-year growth rate for total 2015 non-GAAP expenses to be between 50% and 55%, narrowed from the prior range of 50% to 60%. 
We anticipate our 2015 capital expenditures will be in the neighborhood of $2.5 billion to $3 billion, down slightly from the prior range of $2.7 billion to $3.2 billion.
We continue to expect stock-based compensation in 2015 to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.3 billion, approximately half of which is related to our prior acquisitions, most notably WhatsApp. 
We expect amortization expenses in 2015 to be approximately $700 million to $800 million. 
And lastly, we anticipate our Q3 and full year 2015 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be consistent with the rates in the second quarter.
We had a great first half of the year with solid revenue performance underpinned by healthy community growth across all of our services and regions. We have many exciting opportunities ahead, and we're investing in the talent and resources to capitalize on them as we seek to build long-term shareholder value. With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions."

And the Internet offers the opportunities to make that a lot better. When you look at the specific products that in the work that we're doing, there's this process that we follow that -- well, basically, we look at an area of our products that people are using. So for example, going back a few years, News Feed, right, was -- it's always been since we rolled it out, a very central part of the product. But we're looking at the stuff with increasing rigor now we organized the company into these product groups. And each product group leader will not just look at the product as one thing, but whether the key 3 or 4 or 5 use cases, which often can be their own product lines on their own. And go through them, we've build those out to be world-class. And I think a lot of the success that these has been because of some of the work that we've done a few years back at this point in products like News Feed. And that team has exceeded really well. So when I look forward, I'm very excited by doing the same thing for messaging and groups and video. There's many different use cases. You don't want to just look at these as one thing. There's a bunch of different use cases, and we want to be the best at each of them. And if you have good people leaving 13, then I think you can deliver that over time. So I think yes is the answered your question.

But that's not the end of the line, right? I mean, there's always a richer way that the people want to share and consume thoughts and ideas.

So if you look at what the initial use cases are going to be around that, I think it's a lot of the stuff that you hear people talking about. Video I think will be huge, so just taking that to be 3D and immersive. Gaming will be huge, and these are both areas that Facebook has been involved with. Once you start to get the critical mass, I think you start to get social applications which is what we as a company are more interested in over the long-term and think of a huge amount of potential in addition to the video and gaming stuff, which I think is going to be awesome in the next few years as well."

So our recent example, HTC working with their agency did Instagram videos to raise awareness of the mobile device warranty program. So their targeted 18- to 34-year-olds. They did 5 videos of funny moments of when you're about to break a phone. And they got awareness of what is a warranty program. I think that's not something that you would think typically at Instagram. In terms of Instagram and Facebook, we believe that marketers are looking to connect with people in a really deep way, connect to the right people. And our targeting, we think, is really strong compared to any of the platform at the right time. And that really means mobile. And we see such engagement under Facebook and Instagram, along with a different targeting of ad formats, we believe we'll be able to have, and are already starting to have, a relationship with marketers which grows growth across those platforms. Our focus with the marketing platforms is their business results. I talked about in my remarks how we're looking for conversions. We're trying to help them measure. If you do a car ad for us, how many vehicles were driven off the lot?

When you look at our overall growth, we'll growth is very broad-based. We're broad-based against all of our segments of marketplace marks marketers, and so brands and direct response, SMBs and developers. Definitely a part of the story here is video. Our video demand is very deep. People love the format of video. It's long been used to reach people in a compelling way. And we can do targeting in a way that's really unique. So I'll share another example. Wendy's, working with their agency , launched their jalapeno spicy chicken product, and they were trying to reach millennials and spicy food lovers. So working with us, they did 5 video ads. And on our platform, they could not just do the video format, but they can target millennials and people who like spicy food, which is very specific targeting. They got an 8-point lift in ad recall and 4-point lift in purchase intent among their millennial target. And so what that shows is our growth is driven by the ability of us to do this broad-based consumer media advertising, but do in a more targeted way."

So in terms of -- also you would -- so you'd asked about the growth rate in the back half of the year, so I kind of reiterate what I said in my comments, the business continues to perform very well, driven off the strength of our mobile News Feed ads business. And really consistent with the MAU seen in last several quarters, we would expect that year-over-year ads growth rate to decline modestly in Q3 and Q4. And it's really because we are delivering growth against the much larger scale News Feed business in the prior year period. And also of course, headwinds are an impact as well, as you mentioned."

So the playbook that we're going to run with Messenger and WhatsApp is kind of similar to how we thought about building a business in Facebook and News Feed, were if you go back to 2006 and 2007, there were a lot of people who were kind of encouraging us to just put banner ads and kind of inorganic content into the experience. And what we decided was that over the long term, the ads and monetization were performed better if there was an organic interaction between people using the product and businesses. So instead of focusing on ads first, what we did was build Pages. And we made that free so as many businesses as possible could get into the network. And we built Insights to make the businesses knew how they were driving business when they use Pages for free and can post them to News Feed. And on top of that whole ecosystem, we then had the opportunity to build what has turned into a News Feed business that we're really proud of, right, that we think is driving a lot of value and good content for people who are using the platform and helping a lot of businesses find customers and sell their products and grow overall.  Messaging, I think is going to be pretty similar, right now, where right now, some people in WhatsApp use the service in order to message businesses. Messenger is, I think, more people to people today. We're working on a lot of different things that make it so that people can get down from interacting with businesses. We launched some of them at . We have a number of things that we're working on across Messenger and WhatsApp. But the long term that is that by enabling people to have good organic interactions with businesses, that was the key message multiplier on the value of the monetization down the world when we work on that they've been focused on that in a bigger way. So we've asked for some patience on this to do this correctly, and the the game plan would be more similar to what you did in Facebook with News Feed."

And so I think we're leading and I think we have a lot more to do. If you look at even in the United States, which is advanced market, I think it's something like 35% of SMBs don't have a web presence of any kind. a great majority of this do have a Facebook Page. And that's because setting up a web far as complicated and expensive. You can't just start a web page. But it this easier and free to start the Facebook Page, and so you see broad adoption. We also made a lot of things that they couldn't do and other platforms available on us. So over 1 million SMBs posted a video on Facebook, which is pretty amazing because I doubt 1 million SMBs have ever run a video or TV ads. That's because can shoot on mobile device. You can upload it. can do it for free, or you can pay us for the add. And so I think our tools are the simplest, but I think we still need to do better.

This was a good quarter for us. We've continued to make good progress in the growth of our community with 1.49 billion people now using Facebook each month and more than 1.3 billion people using Facebook on mobile. We've also continued to make games and engagement. More than 968 million people worldwide now use Facebook daily, and 65% of our monthly actives are daily actives.  Several products in the Facebook app are reaching global scale, too, now with more than 450 million people using Events each month and more than 850 million people using Groups. And when it comes to time spent across Facebook, Messenger and Instagram, people are now spending more than 50 -- sorry, 46 minutes per day on average, and that doesn't include WhatsApp.
Our business performance has grown with our community. This quarter, our total revenue is more than $4 billion for the first time, and the advertising revenue grew by 43% year-over-year. These results reflect the ongoing investments and improvements we made on the quality, performance and usefulness of our services. And continuing to make progress here remains our biggest priority.
Now with that in mind, I'd like to talk about how we're working on this across our current products, our next generation of apps and our long-term innovation efforts.
Over the next few years, our main focus is on helping our existing communities and businesses reach their full potential. An important part of our strategy is continuing to deliver great experiences across all our products. This means improving the speed and reliability of our apps and building new infrastructure to support our global scale, like our new data center in Texas. Over the last 6 months, we've improved the performance of our core app, reducing crashes on iOS by more than 30% and some Android phones by more than 40%. On Messenger, people can now send messages up to 20% faster, and it's twice as fast when you start the app. These are just a few examples of how our engineering focus is delivering better experiences for everyone in our community.
Another part of delivering great experiences is helping people connect to the content they want. This quarter, we've continued to focus on improving people's experience in News Feed by making it easier to find more relevant and engaging content from friends and the entire community. Connecting people with more great video content is an important part. The video continues to be some of the richest and most engaging content for people and publishers. And since the start of the year, pages are also sharing more than 40% more videos. This quarter, we updated our News Feed ranking to help people see more the videos they care about and also began testing new options for video monetization to help our partners build their businesses. We're excited about the potential for continued work here.
The focus we've had on video also supports our efforts to connect more people around important public moments and events. From the 59 million people who generated more than 300 million interactions around the Copa America to the 26 million people who changed their profile photos for Pride or the more than 150 million people who were notified that their friends were safe after the Nepal earthquake, Facebook has clearly become the home for global conversations about things that people care about.
And when it comes to serving businesses on our platform, this quarter, we continued to focus on delivering more useful tools and resources to help them achieve their goals. Helping marketers to tell more visually engaging stories through video and carousel ads is an important focus as well as supporting small businesses. There are now more than 40 million small businesses -- small and medium-size businesses using pages on Facebook. So we have a big opportunity to create value for communities all over the world, and Sheryl is going to talk more about this in a moment.
Next, let's talk about how we're building our next generation of services, which we also expect to be important parts of our business over the next few years. With Instagram, the continued growth in the size and engagement of the community shows how this is becoming one of the best places to get a real-time snapshot of the world. For moments from the U.S. presidential campaign trail to NASA's first photos from Pluto, people are using Instagram in a lot of interesting ways. This quarter, we made some big improvements to the app, including upgrading our search and explore functionality and introducing trending content, which we expect will provide even more engaging experiences.
On Messenger, this quarter, we rolled out a number of new features, including mobile video calling, a new way to share location, and the option to sign up for Messenger without using a Facebook account. We also continue to make good progress building out the Messenger platform. We expect these improvements to continue making Messenger a more useful and engaging experience for lots of people. More than 700 million people now use Messenger, and we reached more than 1 billion downloads on Android. These milestones are a good sign that we're on the right path here.
With WhatsApp, we're pleased with our continued growth, and the team is continuing to roll out new features to serve the whole community. We continued to improve the web experience for WhatsApp as well as launching VoIP Calling to more people and on more devices.
With Search, we are continuing to build a better experience for our whole community. We recently crossed 1.5 billion searches per day, and we've now indexed more than 2 trillion posts. This is a huge set of unique experiences and perspectives. And by allowing people to unlock this knowledge, we have a huge opportunity to create value for the world in the coming years.
Finally, let's talk about our other efforts that we expect to deliver impact over the longer term. With Internet.org, we have a lot of momentum with our goal of connecting everyone in the world to the Internet. A year ago, we launched the Internet.org app for the first time in Zambia. And since then, we've made free basic Internet services available to more than 1 billion people in 17 countries. Our results show that Internet.org is working. After launching free basic services, mobile operators are seeing people adopt to mobile data 50% faster than before. And more than half the new people coming online through Internet.org choose to pay for data and access more Internet services within their first 30 days.
We recently made changes to Internet.org program for both developers and operators that will give people -- that will give more people access to even more free services. With the Internet.org platform, now it's easy for any developer to create services that integrate with Internet.org. And just this week, we announced a portal for operators that makes it easy for them to quickly launch free basic services in new countries.
We're also making progress on our efforts to connect people living in some of the most remote communities on earth. Our Connectivity Lab is working on new technologies for connecting communities that include drones, satellites and laser communication systems, and we'll be share more of our progress here very soon.
And with Oculus, we've announced that the Rift will ship to consumers in the first quarter of 2016. The team recently introduced details about the full hardware and software experience that people can expect, including our new touch controllers. Oculus is going to be the best VR experience in the world when it launches, and I'm really excited for us to begin delivering on the promise of virtual reality.
So that's how we focused our efforts over the last quarter. We're preparing for the future, but we're also working to deliver better experiences and value to our community today. And as usual, I want to thank our whole community, including our employees, our shareholders and our partners. Thanks to you, our community is getting stronger and stronger every day, and we're making progress on our mission to make the world more open and connected.
So thank you, and now here's Sheryl."
20765463,305740243,842094,"Facebook, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2015",2015-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Meta Platforms, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. We had another strong quarter and a great first half of the year. Ad revenue grew 43% year-over-year, 55% on a constant-currency basis. Mobile ad revenue grew 74% year-over-year, making it over 3/4 of total ad revenue.Our",1014,"Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. We had another strong quarter and a great first half of the year. Ad revenue grew 43% year-over-year, 55% on a constant-currency basis. Mobile ad revenue grew 74% year-over-year, making it over 3/4 of total ad revenue.
Our growth was broad-based across all marketer segments and industry verticals. Similar to Q1, we're pleased with the adoption of our ad products across all regions, and we saw strong revenue growth in North America and Asia Pacific in particular.  We're staying focused on our 3 main priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of Facebook marketers and making our ads more relevant and effective.
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. People are spending more time on their mobile devices and on Facebook apps. We continue to get more than 1 out of every 5 minutes on smartphones in the U.S., and mobile usage is driving our growth globally as well. We believe we have the best performing mobile ad product in the market, and video is making it even better. With so many consumer videos being watched on Facebook, video ads are a natural part of the News Feed experience. For marketers, video has always been a compelling format. Now Facebook enables mass reach and cross-device targeting and measurement abilities far superior to what other platforms offer.
Mobile video was a major theme at the Cannes Lions Festival last month where some of the biggest winners like Under Armour's ""I Will What I Want"" with Droga5 and Procter & Gamble's ""Like a Girl"" with Leo Burnett used mobile video in Facebook as part of their campaigns.
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products. In Q2, we announced that 40 million small and medium businesses have active Facebook pages, and this number continues to grow.
Earlier this month, I hosted SMB roundtables in Berlin and London. I got to hear first-hand how advertising on Facebook is helping SMBs sell their products, grow their businesses, hire new employees and even expand to other cities and countries. One of the business owners I met was Kelly Wright, a single mom who started selling dresses from her home. She began by shooting videos of her dresses on her mobile phone and promoting them on Facebook for just a few pounds. Using Facebook as her only marketing channel, Kelly grew her business, Krystellie fashion, to over GBP 3 million annually, and she now has 10 employees.
We're increasing our engagement to global SMB community and have now held more than 80 local booster business events around the world, meeting thousands of businesses and getting their feedback on how we can make our products work better for them.
We're also building out our leadership teams around the world. In recent weeks, we've added senior talent to our international teams, including a new head of Latin America and new regional leadership in several countries in EMEA. We also opened an office in Johannesburg, our first in Africa.
Our third priority is making our ads more relevant and effective. Better, more engaging and relevant ads are good for people and marketers, and we're working hard to improve them. We continue to innovate at a rapid pace by introducing new ad formats and new tools for marketers. This quarter, we expanded carousel ads, which show multiple images in one ad unit. We introduced dynamic product ads, which allow marketers to upload their product catalog and show the right product to the right person at the right time. We also introduced a new ad format called Lead Ads, a simpler way for people to connect with companies they're interested in hearing from.
We continue to focus on providing world-class products and tools for direct response advertisers. Booking.com, a Priceline Group company, is using Facebook-linked ads featuring Book Now button to drive reservations. In Q2, Facebook ads drove a meaningful increase in room reservations for Booking.com, helping them meet their ROI goals for the campaign. They're now expanding their use of Facebook ads across multiple markets.
We continue to make progress with ads on Instagram. In Q2, we launched Instagram ads in Brazil, Germany and Japan. We also introduced additional capabilities for marketers, including carousel ads on Instagram, which brands are using in creative ways, for example, to showcase the spring fashion collection, gradually reveal a full panorama or show different views of a location. Over the coming months, Instagram ads will be available to more advertisers with new formats, better targeting and the ability to buy online as well as through third-party planners. As we ramp Instagram ads, we remain focused on quality and relevance to ensure the best experience for people and the highest performance for marketers. And as always, our highest focus is on the consumer experience in Instagram.
Measurement is a key priority as we work to expand our share of global marketing budgets. Since we introduced conversion lift, which measures the direct impact that Facebook ads have on sales, we've seen adoption for marketers across verticals. When Acura launched the TLX, the largest launch in their history, they used Facebook video to show the TLX in scenarios that quickly captured people's attention like imitating a roller coaster. They then used our retargeting technology to show more detailed ads only to the people who watched the videos. Using conversion lift, they proved that Facebook ads directly drove vehicle sales.
To help marketers target and measure campaigns both on and off Facebook, we're continuing to build out our Ad Tech platform with Atlas LiveRail in the Audience Network. Entertainment company Live Nation knew that people browse for concert tickets on mobile devices, but they were never able to measure whether they converted into sales. Using Atlas, Live Nation was able to link their mobile ads to 66% more ticket purchases for one of their largest artists. This shows the promise of Atlas to measure cross-device conversion. We're pleased with the progress we're making in all 3 of our main priorities, and we plan to stay focused.
Now here's Dave."

We generated $4 billion in revenue and $1.3 billion in free cash flow. Strong community growth and engagement underpinned our financial performance.
In June, approximately 968 million people used Facebook on an average day, an increase of 17% compared to last year. This daily number represents 65% of the 1.49 billion people who used Facebook during the month of June. That MAU number grew by 173 million year-over-year. And by this measure, the second quarter was our strongest in terms of community growth since 2013. Mobile remains the key driver of our growth. In June, approximately 1.31 billion people accessed Facebook on mobile devices, up 23% from last year. We also saw strong growth in our next generation of services with Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp now exceeding 300 million, 700 million and 800 million MAU, respectively.
Now turning to the financials. All of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Additionally, our non-GAAP measures exclude stock-based compensation and the amortization of intangibles.
Total revenue was $4 billion, up 39% or 50% on a constant-currency basis. Ad revenue was $3.8 billion, up 43% or 55% on a constant-currency basis. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar has continued to have an unfavorable impact on our revenue. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q2 2014 levels, our total revenue this quarter would have been approximately $330 million higher.
Regionally, we saw strong North American ad revenue growth of 55% in the quarter, and APAC growth also remained strong at 48%. Europe and the Rest of the World ad revenue grew more slowly at 30% and 22%, respectively, as currency had a significant negative impact on each of those regions' year-over-year growth rates.
Mobile was the engine of our revenue growth. Mobile ad revenue in Q2 was $2.9 billion, up 74% from last year and represents 76% of our advertising revenue. Revenue from ads served on personal computers was down approximately 8%.
In Q2, the average price per ad increased 220%, while total ad impressions declined 55%. Similar to last quarter, these price volume trends were primarily driven by the redesign of our right-hand-column ads, which rolled out in the third quarter of last year. To a lesser degree, the shift of usage towards mobile, where we don't have right-hand-column ads, also contributed to the reported price-volume trends.
Total payments and other fees revenue was $215 million, down 8% compared to last year. The decline was driven by a 19% year-over-year reduction in payments revenue related to games played on personal computers, offset primarily by the addition of other revenue related to acquisitions closed in the second half of 2014.
Turning now to expenses. Our Q2 total GAAP expenses were $2.8 billion, up 82%, and non-GAAP expenses were $1.8 billion, up 57%. Similar to last quarter, stock-based compensation and amortization expenses related to the WhatsApp acquisition contributed significantly to the year-over-year growth in GAAP expenses. Non-GAAP expense growth was primarily driven by increases in headcount-related costs, cost of revenue and marketing expenses.
We ended the quarter with 10,955 employees, up 52% compared to last year. With 873 additional employees, Q2 was one of our strongest quarters in terms of hiring, and the majority of the new employees were added in R&D.
Our Q2 GAAP operating income was $1.3 billion, representing a 31% operating margin. Non-GAAP operating income was $2.2 billion, representing a 55% margin.
Our Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 44% and 36%, respectively. Q2 GAAP net income was $719 million or $0.25 per share, and non-GAAP net income was $1.4 billion or $0.50 per share.
In Q2, capital expenditures were $549 million, and we generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow. We ended the year -- sorry, we ended the quarter with $14.1 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the outlook. Let's start with revenue. Since the first quarter of 2014, we have seen year-over-year advertising revenue growth rates decline each subsequent quarter. We expect this trend to continue in Q3 and Q4 as we continue to grow off a much larger base and face currency headwinds due to the strong dollar. In addition, we expect our total payments and other fees revenues to decline on a year-over-year basis for the remainder of the year. The decline in the second half of the year should be closer to the 19% year-over-year decline we experienced in the payments business alone as we will be lapping periods in which we added other fees revenue from acquisitions closed in the second half of 2014.
Turning to expense guidance. Based on our second quarter results, we are narrowing the expense guidance range for 2015. We now expect the year-over-year growth rate for total 2015 GAAP expenses to be between 55% and 60%, narrowed from the prior range of 55% to 65%. And we expect the year-over-year growth rate for total 2015 non-GAAP expenses to be between 50% and 55%, narrowed from the prior range of 50% to 60%.
We anticipate our 2015 capital expenditures will be in the neighborhood of $2.5 billion to $3 billion, down slightly from the prior range of $2.7 billion to $3.2 billion.
We continue to expect stock-based compensation in 2015 to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.3 billion, approximately half of which is related to our prior acquisitions, most notably WhatsApp.
We expect amortization expenses in 2015 to be approximately $700 million to $800 million.
And lastly, we anticipate our Q3 and full year 2015 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be consistent with the rates in the second quarter.
We had a great first half of the year with solid revenue performance underpinned by healthy community growth across all of our services and regions. We have many exciting opportunities ahead, and we are investing in the talent and resources to capitalize on them as we seek to build long-term shareholder value.
With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions."

So at some level, I do think that the core mission and promise of helping to connect people with their friends and family is very fundamental, right? And everyone has friends and family and wants to stay connected and uses a variety of tools and ways to do that in the world today, which are often very inefficient. And the Internet offers new opportunities to make that a lot better. When you look at the specific products that -- and the work that we're doing, there's this process that we followed that -- where basically we'll look at an area of our products that people are using. So for example, going back a few years, News Feed, right, was -- it's always been, since we rolled it out, a very central part of the product. But we're looking at the stuff with increasing rigor now where we organized the company into these product groups. And each product group leader will not just look at the product as one thing but what are the key 3 or 4 or 5 use cases, which often can really be their own product lines on their own. And we go through them. We build those out to be world-class. And I think a lot of the success that we've seen has been because of some of the work that we've done a few years back at this point in products like News Feed. And I mean, that team has executed really well. But when I look forward, I'm very excited about doing the same thing for Messaging and Groups and video. There's many different use cases. You don't want to just look at these as one thing. There are a bunch of different use cases, and we want to be the best at each of them. And if you have good people leading those teams, then I think you can deliver that over time. So I think yes is the answer to your question. I mean, the mission is fundamentally deeply important to people, but that has to be coupled with good, thorough execution of each of the available opportunities."

But that's not the end of the line, right? I mean, there's always a richer way that people want to share and consume thoughts and ideas. And I think that immersive 3D content is the obvious next thing after video. So if you look at what the initial use cases are going to be around that, I think it's a lot of the stuff that you hear people are talking about. Video, I think, will be huge, so just taking that to be 3D and immersive. Gaming will be huge, and those are both areas that Facebook has been involved with. Once you start to get more of a critical mass, I think you can start to get social applications, which is what we as a company are more interested in over the long term and think have a huge amount of potential in addition to the video and gaming stuff, which I just think is going to be awesome in the next few years as well."

So a recent example, HTC, working with their agency Swift, did Instagram videos to raise awareness of their mobile device warranty program. So they targeted 18- to 34-year-olds. They did 5 short videos of these funny moments of where you're about to break their phone. And they got a 6.1 lift in awareness of what is a warranty program. I think that's not something you would think of typically as Instagram. In terms of Instagram and Facebook, we believe that marketers are looking to connect with people in a really deep way, connect with the right people. And our targeting, we think, is really strong compared to any other platform at the right time. And that really means mobile. And we see such engagement under Facebook and Instagram, along with the different targeting of ad formats. We believe we'll be able to have, and are already starting to have, relationship with marketers, which grow across both platforms. Our focus with our marketing partners is their business results. I talked about in my remarks how we're looking for conversions. We're trying to help them measure. If you do a car ad for us, how many vehicles were driven off the lot? We see what products you use within Facebook or Instagram or Facebook and Instagram as less important as the best product for the right market or at the right time to drive their business results. And we like having more abilities, more products, more apps to work with so that we can drive these business results."

We announced that we're updating the definition of CPCs. So that includes only websites and apps. But you can also buy on a cost-per-engagement basis, and that includes likes, comments and shares. It's too early to see any direct impact, but I think it's part of the innovation that you'll see from us as we continue to roll out different ways that marketers can use our tools, different ways they can pay, different results they can target. When you look at our overall growth, our growth is very broad-based. We're broad-based against all of our segments of marketers, so brand and direct response, SMBs and developers. Definitely a part of the story here is video. Our video demand is very deep. People love the format of video. It's long been used to reach people in a compelling way. And we can do targeting in a way that's really unique. So I'll share another example. Wendy's, working with their agency VML, launched their Jalapeño Fresco Spicy Chicken product, and they were trying to reach millennials and spicy food lovers. So working with us, they did 5 video ads. And on our platform, they could not just do the video format, but they could target millennials and people who like spicy food, which is very specific targeting. They got an 8-point lift in ad recall and a 4-point lift in purchase intent among their millennial target. And so what that shows is our growth is being driven by the ability of us to do this broad-based consumer media advertising but do it in a more targeted way."

So the playbook that we're going to run with Messenger and WhatsApp is kind of similar to how we thought about building a business in Facebook and News Feed where if you go back to 2006 and 2007, there were a lot of people who were kind of encouraging us to just put banner ads and kind of inorganic content into the experience. And what we decided was that over the long term, the ads and monetization would perform better if there was an organic interaction between people using the product and businesses. So instead of focusing on ads first, what we did was we built Pages. And we made that free so as many businesses as possible could get into the network. And we built Insights to make it so that businesses knew how they were driving business when they use Pages for free and could post them to News Feed. And then on top of that whole ecosystem, we then had the opportunity to build what has turned into a News Feed business that we're really proud of, right, that we think is driving a lot of value and good content for people who are using the platform and helping a lot of businesses find customers and sell their products and grow overall. Messaging, I think, is going to be pretty similar, right, where right now, some people in WhatsApp use the service in order to message businesses. Messenger is, I think, more people to people today. We're working on a lot of different things that make it so that people can get value from interacting with businesses. We launched some of them at F8. We have a number of other things that we're working on across Messenger and WhatsApp. But the long term of that [ph] is that by enabling people to have good organic interactions with businesses, that will end up being a massive multiplier on the value of the monetization down the road when we work on that and really focus on that in a bigger way. So we'd ask for some patience on this to do this correctly, and the game plan will be more similar to what we did in Facebook with News Feed."

But yes, we are investing more in general in sales and marketing over time. So you'd expect to see that line grow in line with the expense guidance that we're giving. So it's definitely an area that we'll be investing in on an ongoing basis, and I wouldn't read too much into the quarterly trend there."

In terms of the overall Ad Tech world, I think a lot is happening, and there's a lot that's going to evolve in the whole ecosystem. Our focus is on bringing people-based marketing and the effectiveness and relevance of Facebook ads off of Facebook. So we can give marketers and publishers the tools to reach people across all of their devices, and importantly for our business is connect the dots between online marketing and business outcomes. And you heard on this call me give a few examples of where we're able to connect what happens in terms of ads with real sales of real products.

Is the tool set simple enough today for SMBs to grasp? Or are there significant additions that you need to make to the tool set to accelerate the growth of SMB advertisers?"

They basically assume that you are one person on one device, and we know that's not true. They're only about 55% accurate in demographic targeting. They don't work on mobile because they're cookie-based. They don't work on multiple devices. They don't go offline to online, and they overemphasize the last click and reach. And so our focus about this is helping people really understand the results they get with ads. And you heard my Live Nation example earlier where we are able to connect Facebook ads and our platform directly to ticket sales. We never could have done that without Atlas measurement. In terms of the migration process, this is an enterprise sale. We have to work client by client. Then they have to choose us. Then they have to migrate their systems. And that's going to take time. What really matters is that when we get that migration and we are seeing it, we are able to show them the value because it makes their buying much more effective because they understand real results in a new way. In tune with SMBs, I would say 2 things. I would say that, one, our products aren't simple enough yet because they can never be simple enough for SMBs. But two, our products are probably the simplest ones out there. And so I think we're leading, and I think we have a lot more to do. If you look at even in the United States, which is a very advanced market, I think it's something like 35% of SMBs don't have a web presence of any kind. But a great majority of this do have a Facebook Page. And that's because setting up a web presence for an SMB is complicated and expensive. You can't just start a web page. But it is easier and free to start a Facebook Page, and so you see broad adoption. We also make a lot of things that they couldn't do in other platforms available on us. So over 1 million SMBs have posted a video on Facebook, which is pretty amazing because I doubt 1 million SMBs have ever run what is a video or TV ad. That's because you can shoot it on your mobile device. You can upload it. You can do that for free, or you can pay us for the ad. And so I think our tools are the simplest, but I think we still need to do better because what we hear from SMBs is simple, fast, inexpensive, showing them real return. And we're going to continue to focus on all of those things."

And I think when people think about our mobile app install ads, they often think this only applies to developers and small companies.

This was a good quarter for us. We've continued to make good progress in the growth of our community with 1.49 billion people now using Facebook each month and more than 1.3 billion people using Facebook on mobile. We've also continued to make gains in  engagement. More than 968 million people worldwide now use Facebook daily, and 65% of our monthly actives are daily actives.  Several products in the Facebook app are reaching global scale, too, now with more than 450 million people using Events each month and more than 850 million people using Groups. And when it comes to time spent across Facebook, Messenger and Instagram, people are now spending more than 50 -- sorry, 46 minutes per day on average, and that doesn't include WhatsApp.
Our business performance has grown with our community. This quarter, our total revenue is more than $4 billion for the first time, and the advertising revenue grew by 43% year-over-year. These results reflect the ongoing investments and improvements we made in the quality, performance and usefulness of our services. And continuing to make progress here remains our biggest priority.
Now with that in mind, I'd like to talk about how we're working on this across our current products, our next generation of apps and our long-term innovation efforts.
Over the next few years, our main focus is on helping our existing communities and businesses reach their full potential. An important part of our strategy is continuing to deliver great experiences across all our products. This means improving the speed and reliability of our apps and building new infrastructure to support our global scale, like our new data center in Texas. Over the last 6 months, we've improved the performance of our core app, reducing crashes on iOS by more than 30% and some Android phones by more than 40%. On Messenger, people can now send messages up to 20% faster, and it's twice as fast when you start the app. These are just a few examples of how our engineering focus is delivering better experiences for everyone in our community.
Another part of delivering great experiences is helping people connect to the content they want. This quarter, we've continued to focus on improving people's experience in News Feed by making it easier to find more relevant and engaging content from friends and the entire community. Connecting people with more great video content is an important part. The video continues to be some of the richest and most engaging content for people and publishers. And since the start of the year, pages are also sharing more than 40% more videos. This quarter, we updated our News Feed ranking to help people see more of the videos they care about and also began testing new options for video monetization to help our partners build their businesses. We're excited about the potential for continued work here.
The focus we've had on video also supports our efforts to connect more people around important public moments and events. From the 59 million people who generated more than 300 million interactions around the Copa America to the 26 million people who changed their profile photos for Pride or the more than 150 million people who were notified that their friends were safe after the Nepal earthquake, Facebook has clearly become the home for global conversations about things that people care about.
And when it comes to serving businesses on our platform, this quarter, we continued to focus on delivering more useful tools and resources to help them achieve their goals. Helping marketers to tell more visually engaging stories through video and carousel ads is an important focus as well as supporting small businesses. There are now more than 40 million small businesses -- small and medium-sized businesses using pages on Facebook. So we have a big opportunity to create value for communities all over the world, and Sheryl is going to talk more about this in a moment.
Next, let's talk about how we're building our next generation of services, which we also expect to be important parts of our business over the next few years. With Instagram, the continued growth in the size and engagement of the community shows how this is becoming one of the best places to get a real-time snapshot of the world. For moments from the U.S. presidential campaign trail to NASA's first photos from Pluto, people are using Instagram in a lot of interesting ways. This quarter, we made some big improvements to the app, including upgrading our search and explore functionality and introducing trending content, which we expect will provide even more engaging experiences.
On Messenger, this quarter, we rolled out a number of new features, including mobile video calling, a new way to share location, and the option to sign up for Messenger without using a Facebook account. We also continued to make good progress building out the Messenger platform. We expect these improvements to continue making Messenger a more useful and engaging experience for lots of people. More than 700 million people now use Messenger, and we've reached more than 1 billion downloads on Android. These milestones are a good sign that we're on the right path here.
With WhatsApp, we're pleased with our continued growth, and the team is continuing to roll out new features to serve the whole community. We continue to improve the web experience for WhatsApp as well as launching VoIP Calling to more people and on more devices.
With Search, we are continuing to build a better experience for our whole community. We recently crossed 1.5 billion searches per day, and we've now indexed more than 2 trillion posts. This is a huge set of unique experiences and perspectives. And by allowing people to unlock this knowledge, we have a huge opportunity to create value for the world in the coming years.
Finally, let's talk about our other efforts that we expect to deliver impact over the longer term. With Internet.org, we have a lot of momentum with our goal of connecting everyone in the world to the Internet. A year ago, we launched the Internet.org app for the first time in Zambia. And since then, we've made free basic Internet services available to more than 1 billion people in 17 countries. Our results show that Internet.org is working. After launching free basic services, mobile operators are seeing people adopt to mobile data 50% faster than before. And more than half the new people coming online through Internet.org choose to pay for data and access more Internet services within their first 30 days.
We recently made changes to Internet.org program for both developers and operators that will give people -- that will give more people access to even more free services. With the Internet.org platform, now it's easy for any developer to create services that integrate with Internet.org. And just this week, we announced a portal for operators that makes it easy for them to quickly launch free basic services in new countries.
We're also making progress on our efforts to connect people living in some of the most remote communities on earth. Our Connectivity Lab is working on new technologies for connecting communities that include drones, satellites and laser communication systems, and we'll be sharing more of our progress here very soon.
And with Oculus, we've announced that the Rift will ship to consumers in the first quarter of 2016. The team recently introduced details about the full hardware and software experience that people can expect, including our new touch controllers. Oculus is going to be the best VR experience in the world when it launches, and I'm really excited for us to begin delivering on the promise of virtual reality.
So that's how we focused our efforts over the last quarter. We're preparing for the future, but we're also working to deliver better experiences and value to our community today. And as usual, I want to thank our whole community, including our employees, our shareholders and our partners. Thanks to you, our community is getting stronger and stronger every day, and we're making progress on our mission to make the world more open and connected.
So thank you, and now here's Sheryl."

We had another strong quarter and a great first half of the year. Ad revenue grew 43% year-over-year, 55% on a constant-currency basis. Mobile ad revenue grew 74% year-over-year, making it over 3/4 of total ad revenue.Our",1015,"Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. We had another strong quarter and a great first half of the year. Ad revenue grew 43% year-over-year, 55% on a constant-currency basis. Mobile ad revenue grew 74% year-over-year, making it over 3/4 of total ad revenue.
Our growth was broad-based across all market segments and industry verticals. Similar to Q1, we're pleased with the adoption of our ad products across all regions, and we saw strong revenue growth in North America and Asia Pacific in particular.  We're staying focused on our 3 main priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of Facebook marketers and making our ads more relevant and effective.
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. People are spending more time on their mobile devices and on Facebook apps. We continue to get more than 1 out of every 5 minutes on smartphones in the U.S., and mobile usage is driving our growth globally as well. We believe we have the best performing mobile ad product in the market, and video is making it even better. With so many consumer videos being watched on Facebook, video ads are a natural part of the News Feed experience. For marketers, video has always been a compelling format. Now Facebook enables mass reach and cross-device targeting and measurement abilities far superior to what other platforms offer.
Mobile video was a major theme at the Cannes Lions Festival last month where some of the biggest winners like Under Armour's ""I Will What I Want"" with Droga5 and Procter & Gamble's ""Like a Girl"" with Leo Burnett used mobile video in Facebook as part of their campaigns.
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products. In Q2, we announced that 40 million small and medium businesses had active Facebook pages, and this number continues to grow.
Earlier this month, I hosted SMB roundtables in Berlin and London. I got to hear first-hand how advertising on Facebook is helping SMBs sell their products, grow their businesses, hire new employees and even expand to other cities and countries. One of the business owners I met was Kelly Wright, a single mom who started selling dresses from her home. She began by shooting videos of her dresses on her mobile phone and promoting them on Facebook for just a few pounds. Using Facebook as her only marketing channel, Kelly grew her business, Krystellie fashion, to over GBP 3 million annually, and she now has 10 employees.
We're increasing our engagement to the global SMB community and have now held more than 80 local booster business events around the world, meeting thousands of businesses and getting their feedback on how we can make our products work better for them.
We're also building out our leadership teams around the world. In recent weeks, we've added senior talent to our international teams, including a new head of Latin America and new regional leadership in several countries in EMEA. We also opened an office in Johannesburg, our first in Africa.
Our third priority is making our ads more relevant and effective. Better, more engaging and relevant ads are good for people and marketers, and we're working hard to improve them. We continue to innovate at a rapid pace by introducing new ad formats and new tools for marketers. This quarter, we expanded carousel ads, which show multiple images in one ad unit. We introduced dynamic product ads, which allow marketers to upload their product catalog and show the right product to the right person at the right time. We also introduced a new ad format called Lead Ads, a simpler way for people to connect with companies they're interested in hearing from.
We continue to focus on providing world-class products and tools for direct response advertisers. Booking.com, a Priceline Group company, is using Facebook-linked ads featuring Book Now buttons to drive reservations. In Q2, Facebook ads drove a meaningful increase in room reservations for Booking.com, helping them meet their ROI goals for the campaign. They're now expanding their use of Facebook ads across multiple markets.
We continue to make progress with ads on Instagram. In Q2, we launched Instagram ads in Brazil, Germany and Japan. We also introduced additional capabilities for marketers, including carousel ads on Instagram, which brands are using in creative ways, for example, to showcase the spring fashion collection, gradually reveal a full panorama or show different views of a location. Over the coming months, Instagram ads will be available to more advertisers with new formats, better targeting and the ability to buy online as well as through third-party planners. As we ramp Instagram ads, we remain focused on quality and relevance to ensure the best experience for people and the highest performance for marketers. And as always, our highest focus is on the consumer experience in Instagram.
Measurement is a key priority as we work to expand our share of global marketing budgets. Since we introduced conversion lift, which measures the direct impact that Facebook ads have on sales, we've seen adoption for marketers across verticals. When Acura launched the TLX, the largest launch in their history, they used Facebook video to show the TLX in scenarios that quickly captured people's attention like imitating a roller coaster. They then used our retargeting technology to show more detailed ads only to the people who watched the videos. Using conversion lift, they proved that Facebook ads directly drove vehicle sales.
To help marketers target and measure campaigns both on and off Facebook, we're continuing to build out our Ad Tech platform with Atlas LiveRail in the Audience Network. Entertainment company Live Nation knew that people browse for concert tickets on mobile devices, but they were never able to measure whether they converted into sales. Using Atlas, Live Nation was able to link their mobile ads to 66% more ticket purchases for one of their largest artists. This shows the promise of Atlas to measure cross-device conversion. We're pleased with the progress we're making in all 3 of our main priorities, and we plan to stay focused.
Now here's Dave."

We generated $4 billion in revenue and $1.3 billion in free cash flow. Strong community growth and engagement underpinned our financial performance.
In June, approximately 968 million people used Facebook on an average day, an increase of 17% compared to last year. This daily number represents 65% of the 1.49 billion people who used Facebook during the month of June. That MAU number grew by 173 million year-over-year. And by this measure, the second quarter was our strongest in terms of community growth since 2013. Mobile remains the key driver of our growth. In June, approximately 1.31 billion people accessed Facebook on mobile devices, up 23% from last year. We also saw strong growth in our next generation of services with Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp now exceeding 300 million, 700 million and 800 million MAU, respectively.
Now turning to the financials. All of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Additionally, our non-GAAP measures exclude stock-based compensation and the amortization of intangibles.
Total revenue was $4 billion, up 39% or 50% on a constant-currency basis. Ad revenue was $3.8 billion, up 43% or 55% on a constant-currency basis. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar has continued to have an unfavorable impact on our revenue. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q2 2014 levels, our total revenue this quarter would have been approximately $330 million higher.
Regionally, we saw strong North American ad revenue growth of 55% in the quarter, and APAC growth also remained strong at 48%. Europe and the Rest of the World ad revenue grew more slowly at 30% and 22%, respectively, as currency had a significant negative impact on each of those regions' year-over-year growth rates.
Mobile was the engine of our revenue growth. Mobile ad revenue in Q2 was $2.9 billion, up 74% from last year and represents 76% of our advertising revenue. Revenue from ads served on personal computers was down approximately 8%.
In Q2, the average price per ad increased 220%, while total ad impressions declined 55%. Similar to last quarter, these price volume trends were primarily driven by the redesign of our right-hand-column ads, which rolled out in the third quarter of last year. To a lesser degree, the shift of usage towards mobile, where we don't have right-hand-column ads, also contributed to the reported price-volume trends.
Total payments and other fees revenue was $215 million, down 8% compared to last year. The decline was driven by a 19% year-over-year reduction in payments revenue related to games played on personal computers, offset primarily by the addition of other revenue related to acquisitions closed in the second half of 2014.
Turning now to expenses. Our Q2 total GAAP expenses were $2.8 billion, up 82%, and non-GAAP expenses were $1.8 billion, up 57%. Similar to last quarter, stock-based compensation and amortization expenses related to the WhatsApp acquisition contributed significantly to the year-over-year growth in GAAP expenses. Non-GAAP expense growth was primarily driven by increases in headcount-related costs, cost of revenue and marketing expenses.
We ended the quarter with 10,955 employees, up 52% compared to last year. With 873 additional employees, Q2 was one of our strongest quarters in terms of hiring, and the majority of the new employees were added in R&D.
Our Q2 GAAP operating income was $1.3 billion, representing a 31% operating margin. Non-GAAP operating income was $2.2 billion, representing a 55% margin.
Our Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 44% and 36%, respectively. Q2 GAAP net income was $719 million or $0.25 per share, and non-GAAP net income was $1.4 billion or $0.50 per share.
In Q2, capital expenditures were $549 million, and we generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow. We ended the year -- sorry, we ended the quarter with $14.1 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the outlook. Let's start with revenue. Since the first quarter of 2014, we have seen year-over-year advertising revenue growth rates decline each subsequent quarter. We expect this trend to continue in Q3 and Q4 as we continue to grow off a much larger base and face currency headwinds due to the strong dollar. In addition, we expect our total payments and other fees revenues to decline on a year-over-year basis for the remainder of the year. The decline in the second half of the year should be closer to the 19% year-over-year decline we experienced in the payments business alone as we will be lapping periods in which we added other fees revenue from acquisitions closed in the second half of 2014.
Turning to expense guidance. Based on our second quarter results, we are narrowing the expense guidance range for 2015. We now expect the year-over-year growth rate for total 2015 GAAP expenses to be between 55% and 60%, narrowed from the prior range of 55% to 65%. And we expect the year-over-year growth rate for total 2015 non-GAAP expenses to be between 50% and 55%, narrowed from the prior range of 50% to 60%.
We anticipate our 2015 capital expenditures will be in the neighborhood of $2.5 billion to $3 billion, down slightly from the prior range of $2.7 billion to $3.2 billion.
We continue to expect stock-based compensation in 2015 to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.3 billion, approximately half of which is related to our prior acquisitions, most notably WhatsApp.
We expect amortization expenses in 2015 to be approximately $700 million to $800 million.
And lastly, we anticipate our Q3 and full year 2015 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be consistent with the rates in the second quarter.
We have had a great first half of the year with solid revenue performance underpinned by healthy community growth across all of our services and regions. We have many exciting opportunities ahead, and we are investing in the talent and resources to capitalize on them as we seek to build long-term shareholder value.

And the Internet offers new opportunities to make that a lot better. When you look at the specific products that -- and the work that we're doing, there's this process that we followed that -- where basically we'll look at an area of our products that people are using. So for example, going back a few years, News Feed, right, was -- it's always been, since we rolled it out, a very central part of the product. But we're looking at the stuff with increasing rigor now where we organized the company into these product groups. And each product group leader will not just look at the product as one thing but what are the key 3 or 4 or 5 use cases, which often can really be their own product lines on their own. And we go through them and we build those out to be world-class. And I think a lot of the success that we've seen has been because of some of the work that we've done a few years back at this point in products like News Feed. And I mean, that team has executed really well. But when I look forward, I'm very excited about doing the same thing for Messaging and Groups and video. There's many different use cases. You don't want to just look at these as one thing. There are a bunch of different use cases, and we want to be the best at each of them. And if you have good people leading those teams, then I think you can deliver that over time. So I think yes is the answer to your question. I mean, the mission is fundamentally deeply important to people, but that has to be coupled with good, thorough execution of each of the available opportunities."

We are clearly investing for the growth of both Facebook at its core and then also the additional services that we're bringing on. So we're proud about the efficiencies that we've had. The infrastructure team has done an outstanding job in driving good efficiencies through things like the Open Compute Project, which allows us to leverage an open source strategy to lower our costs on server and other expensive hardware. So it's been a great strategy for us. But given the growth we have in the business, given the opportunity we have before us, we're very much in investment mode in terms of the infrastructure."

We are going through a period where now it's mostly visual and photos. We are entering into a period where that's going to increasingly be primarily video, and we're seeing huge growth there. But that's not the end of the line, right? I mean, there's always a richer way that people want to share and consume thoughts and ideas. And I think that immersive 3D content is the obvious next thing after video. So if you look at what the initial use cases are going to be around that, I think it's a lot of the stuff that you hear people are talking about. Video, I think, will be huge, so just taking that to be 3D and immersive. Gaming will be huge, and those are both areas that Facebook has been involved with. Once you start to get more of a critical mass, I think you can start to get social applications, which is what we as a company are more interested in over the long term and think have a huge amount of potential in addition to the video and gaming stuff, which I just think is going to be awesome in the next few years as well."

So a recent example, HTC, working with their agency Swift, did Instagram videos to raise awareness of their mobile device warranty program. So they targeted 18- to 34-year-olds. They did 5 short videos of these funny moments of where you're about to break their phone. And they got a 6.1 lift in awareness of what is a warranty program. I think that's not something you would think of typically as Instagram. In terms of Instagram and Facebook, we believe that marketers are looking to connect with people in a really deep way, connect with the right people. And our targeting, we think, is really strong compared to any other platform at the right time. And that really means mobile. And we see such engagement under Facebook and Instagram, along with the different targeting of ad formats. We believe we'll be able to have, and are already starting to have, relationships with marketers, which grow across both platforms. Our focus with our marketing partners is their business results. I talked about in my remarks how we're looking for conversions. We're trying to help them measure. If you do a car ad for us, how many vehicles were driven off the lot?

When you look at our overall growth, our growth is very broad-based. We're broad-based against all of our segments of marketers, so brand and direct response, SMBs and developers. Definitely a part of the story here is video. Our video demand is very deep. People love the format of video. It's long been used to reach people in a compelling way. And we can do targeting in a way that's really unique. So I'll share another example. Wendy's, working with their agency VML, launched their Jalapeño Fresco Spicy Chicken product, and they were trying to reach millennials and spicy food lovers. So working with us, they did 5 video ads. And on our platform, they could not just do the video format, but they could target millennials and people who like spicy food, which is very specific targeting. They got an 8-point lift in ad recall and a 4-point lift in purchase intent among their millennial target. And so what that shows is our growth is being driven by the ability of us to do this broad-based consumer media advertising but do it in a more targeted way."

And is the engagement for the Messaging apps similar, higher or lower than the average for the core Facebook app in terms of daily visits?

So the playbook that we're going to run with Messenger and WhatsApp is kind of similar to how we thought about building a business in Facebook and News Feed where if you go back to 2006 and 2007, there were a lot of people who were kind of encouraging us to just put banner ads and kind of inorganic content into the experience. And what we decided was that over the long term, the ads and monetization would perform better if there was an organic interaction between people using the product and businesses. So instead of focusing on ads first, what we did was we built Pages. And we made that free so as many businesses as possible could get into the network. And we built Insights to make it so that businesses knew how they were driving business when they used Pages for free and could post them to News Feed. And then on top of that whole ecosystem, we then had the opportunity to build what has turned into a News Feed business that we're really proud of, right, that we think is driving a lot of value and good content for people who are using the platform and helping a lot of businesses find customers and sell their products and grow overall. Messaging, I think, is going to be pretty similar, right, where right now, some people in WhatsApp use the service in order to message businesses. Messenger is, I think, more people to people today. We're working on a lot of different things that make it so that people can get value from interacting with businesses. We launched some of them at F8. We have a number of other things that we're working on across Messenger and WhatsApp. But the long term of that is that by enabling people to have good organic interactions with businesses, that will end up being a massive multiplier on the value of the monetization down the road when we work on that and really focus on that in a bigger way. So we'd ask for some patience on this to do this correctly, and the game plan will be more similar to what we did in Facebook with News Feed."

They basically assume that you are one person on one device, and we know that's not true. They're only about 55% accurate in demographic targeting. They don't work on mobile because they're cookie-based. They don't work on multiple devices. They don't go offline to online, and they overemphasize the last click and reach. And so our focus with Atlas is helping people really understand the results they get with ads. And you heard my Live Nation example earlier where we are able to connect Facebook ads and our platform directly to ticket sales. We never could have done that without Atlas measurement. In terms of the migration process, this is an enterprise sale. We have to work client by client. Then they have to choose us. Then they have to migrate their systems. And that's going to take time. What really matters is that when we get that migration and we are seeing it, we are able to show them the value because it makes their buying much more effective because they understand real results in a new way. In tune with SMBs, I would say 2 things. I would say that, one, our products aren't simple enough yet because they can never be simple enough for SMBs. But two, our products are probably the simplest ones out there. And so I think we're leading, and I think we have a lot more to do. If you look at even in the United States, which is a very advanced market, I think it's something like 35% of SMBs don't have a web presence of any kind. But a great majority of them do have a Facebook Page. And that's because setting up a web presence for an SMB is complicated and expensive. You can't just start a web page. But it is easier and free to start a Facebook Page, and so you see broad adoption. We also make a lot of things that they couldn't do in other platforms available on us. So over 1 million SMBs have posted a video on Facebook, which is pretty amazing because I doubt 1 million SMBs have ever run what is a video or TV ad. That's because you can shoot it on your mobile device. You can upload it. You can do that for free, or you can pay us for the ad. And so I think our tools are the simplest, but I think we still need to do better because what we hear from SMBs is simple, fast, inexpensive, showing them real return. And we're going to continue to focus on all of those things."

We're growing the number of advertisers and publishers, and we're continuing to see growth, and we'll continue to invest. When you think about mobile app install ads, those are an important but relatively small part of our revenue. The important thing to understand here is that they're not only used by developers, they're used by all 4 marketer segments. So for example, HBO used our video retargeting mobile app install ads on Facebook to drive downloads of HBO NOW, and Facebook is now the #1 channel driving subscribers. And I think when people think about our mobile app install ads, they often think this only applies to developers and small companies. And really, it's them as well, but it's also companies like HBO which are using those ads to drive adoption and downloads."

This was another good quarter, and we continue to grow the size and engagement of our community. 1.55 billion people now use Facebook every month, and more than 1 billion people use Facebook every day. 
On mobile, we continued to have a lot of momentum. 1.39 billion people now use Facebook on mobile devices, including more than 1 billion on Android. 50 million people use Facebook Lite, our app for people on low-bandwidth connections and one of our fastest-growing interfaces. This is a great sign for how our mobile strategy continues to make progress across markets, devices and platforms. 
When it comes to our business, we're also pleased with our results.  This quarter, total revenue reached $4.5 billion, and advertising revenue grew by 45% from a year ago. We've already accomplished a lot this year, and these results show how we're getting stronger as a community and as a business. 
But we want to serve the entire global community, not just the people who are on Facebook today. Connecting everyone is one of the fundamental challenges of our time. And to achieve this, we need to continue innovating faster and investing for the long term. That means continuing to invest in our core product and services as well as technologies and strategies that allow us to achieve a truly global reach over time.
Let's talk about how we're doing this, and let's start with how we're improving our core products to better serve our existing communities and businesses. This quarter, we introduced some big updates on Facebook to give people more options for expressing themselves. We began rolling out an improved mobile profile design, including the ability to add a video instead of just a photo. 
We also started testing reactions, a new version of the Like button to provides more ways of expressing love, awe, sympathy. We think this is going to provide a much more engaging experience.
Another way we're working to improve people's experiences on Facebook is by having them to share many different types of contexts with different Groups of people they care about. One example is our progress with Groups on Facebook. More than 925 million people now use Groups each month. In some countries, more than half of the population is participating.
For -- from a news organization in Chicago to aid workers dealing with the refugee crisis in Europe, we've seen many inspiring examples of people using Groups to collaborate. 
Video is another area where we continue to make progress. On average, there are now more than 8 billion daily video views on Facebook and more than 500 million people who are watching daily. To offer even more engaging video experiences, we added live video to our apps for public figures. And we also support interactive 360 videos in News Feed. We've also rolled out new video tools for Pages and began testing a dedicated video section on Facebook.  Over the next few years, Facebook is going to be some of the most engaging content online. And by continuing to innovate here, we have a chance to build the best place to watch and share videos. 
When it comes to serving businesses, we continued to create a lot of value. We now have more than 2.5 million active advertisers on Facebook and more than 45 million small and medium-sized businesses actively using Facebook pages. This quarter, we continued to focus on helping marketers achieve results while using our ad products, including video and carousel ads as well as on Instagram. And as usual, Sheryl can talk more about this in a moment.
Now let's talk about how we're working to develop about our next generation of apps and services. For Instagram, this is a busy quarter. The community celebrated its 5-year anniversary and reached a new milestone of 400 million monthly actives. More than 80 million photos are now shown on Instagram every day, and the pace of adoption among public figures, organization to people around the world continues to grow really well.  When President Obama visited Alaska in September, we used Instagram to document his trip, and this is a great example of how Instagram is changing the way that people see the world. 
With our efforts in messaging, were all so making progress at building WhatsApp and Messenger, both integrated platforms of global scale.  Last quarter, WhatsApp reached 900 million active monthly actives and continues to be on a path to reach 1 billion people and beyond. 
Messenger has over 700 million monthly actives, and we continue to focus on improving the core messaging experience. A good sign of our progress is the more than 9.5 billion photos now sent monthly on Messenger. We're also building many different tools that offer useful experiences to people beyond just sharing traditional messaging. One example is M, a digital system introduced this quarter that over time will use AI to help people complete tasks.
Finally, let's talk about some of our longer-term efforts in innovation to help connect the world. With Internet.org, we have a lot of momentum. We've now rolled out free basic Internet services to people in 29 countries and overall brought more than 15 million people online. As we rolled out the program, we've made a number of improvements based on feedback from communities and partners, including opening up our platform for free basic services to all developers who want to build.
Meanwhile, our work on new technologies to connect people in the most remote regions continues to make progress. This quarter, we revealed our first aircraft designed to beam Internet into communities down from the sky. And we also announced a partnership to bring Internet to large parts of sub-Saharan Africa using a satellite, which is launching next year.
And with Oculus, we're in a great position to begin delivering a new generation of shared immersive experiences. We plan to ship the headset early next year. And , our mobile product with Samsung, is going to have its first consumer release this holiday season, retailing for $99. We also announced new partnerships with Mindcraft, Netflix and Twitch and many other content partners.
Virtual reality has the potential to be the next computing platform that changes all of our lives. It's important also to realize that this is going to grow slowly, like computers and mobile phones when they first arrived. So we're committed to Oculus and virtual reality for the long term.
So that's how we've continued to make progress on our strategy this quarter. The results we've achieved show that our investments are creating a lot of value for our community around the world. I just want to thank the entire Facebook community, our employees, our partners and our shareholders for helping us to continue moving forward.  We've done a lot, but there's always more to do. And now we're going to had enough to Sheryl."

Ad revenue grew 45% year-over-year or 57% on a constant-currency basis. Mobile ad revenue was $3.4 billion and grew 73% year-over-year. Mobile now makes up 78% of our total advertising revenue. 
Our business grew across all regions and marketer segments. Like last quarter, we saw especially strong growth in our North America and Asia Pacific regions. Overall, we're really pleased with marketer adoption of our ad products around the world.  Our results show that we continue to make progress on our 3 priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of marketers using our ad products and making our ads more relevant and effective.
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. People have already shifted to mobile, and this shift is driving engagement on Facebook. The average American adult spends 25% of their media time on mobile, and Facebook and Instagram together continue to account for over 1 in 5 minutes in mobile in the U.S. Businesses are lagging behind consumers in making the shift to mobile, and we believe we're well positioned to help them catch up. Facebook Pages are already the mobile solutions for millions of businesses. Pages now offer better messaging capabilities, call to action buttons, and these sections enable businesses to highlight important information.
We're also capitalizing on the shift to mobile by expanding ads on Instagram. This quarter on Instagram, we introduced new ad formats and objectives, opened up our API and launched self-serve ad capabilities. Instagram ads are now available in all countries and we also Facebook ants in marketers can manage campaigns across both platforms in the same targeting. We're really pleased with the marketer demand for Instagram ads.
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products. In September in Adweek, we announced that we have over 2.5 million active advertisers on Facebook. With more than 45 million active SMB pages on Facebook, we think there's a lot of opportunity to turn even more of these businesses into marketers.
Marketers come to Facebook and Instagram because we have the best performing mobile ad products, and video is making it even better. Marketers have always loved using videos to tell stories. As marketers come, video is a naturally growing part of our mobile immersive experience. Video on Facebook gives marketers not only just mass reach, but better customers targeting and measurement that we believe is available on any other platforms. We're especially pleased with the breadth of marketers using video on Facebook from brands to direct response to SMBs. Over 1.5 million small businesses posted video, which includes organic video posts on video ads on Facebook in the month of September alone.
Video ads complement TV ads. According to a recent study with Nielsen Research, marketers using Facebook ads with TV ads have a higher reach, ad recall and likability. To share one example, GMC used videos and other ads on Facebook to extend the reach of TV brand campaign highlighting their premium trucks and SUVs. The Facebook campaign drove a 13-point lift in ad ads recall and a 6-point lift in brand favorability. 
We recently introduced target rating point, TRP buying, so that marketers can plan, buy and measure video ads on Facebook the same way they do on TV. We're pleased with the feedback we're receiving on this from marketers and agencies.
Our third priority is making our ads more relevant and effective. We know relevant ads are more engaging for people and therefore drive better results for businesses. Product like dynamic product and help improve effectiveness to marketers. Ads show multiple images and now videos and drive 30% to 50% lower cost per conversion than single image linked ads. Dynamic product ads, which allow marketers to upload their product catalogs, are driving ROI comparable to search. For example, uses DPA to retarget travelers based on their travel search habits, and they are now scaling globally across the portfolio of brandies. e-commerce company uses DBA to remarket over 38 million products in over 13 countries, have the same high ROI and continuing to invest.
On the measurement side, conversion helping clients to see business results from their campaign. This that showed ads to people eligible for device upgrades. Using conversion lift, they are able to attribute a 4% lift in in-store sales through the Facebook campaign.
Finally, we are continuing to invest in ad tech across in the audience network. This quarter, we expanded the ad formats published audience network mobile apps. On LiveRail this quarter, we began testing age and gender targeting. LiveRail can deliver over 90% accuracy on age and gender segments across both top mobile apps and mobile apps versus the nontarget rate of only 31% to 55% when not using LiveRail's technology.
I want to take a moment to thank our clients around the world for their continued partnership and congratulate our global Facebook teams for great execution. Looking forward, we're going to stay present on our priorities to continue to build a solid foundation for our long-term business.
Now here's Dave."

Echoing Mark and Sheryl's comments, Q3 was another strong quarter 4 Facebook. We generated $4.5 billion in revenues and over $1.4 billion in free cash flow. 
Growth in engagement of our community again provided a great platform for our strong financial performance this quarter. In September, we reached a new milestone with over 1 billion people using Facebook on an average day, an increase of 17% compared to last year. This daily number represents 65% of the 1.55 billion people who used Facebook during the month of September.
Mobile continued to drive our growth. In September, approximately 1.39 billion people access Facebook on mobile devices, up 23% from last year. Additionally, our next generation of services continued to grow with Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp now exceeding 400 million, 700 million and 900 million monthly actives respectively.
Now turning to the financials. All of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Additionally, our non-GAAP measures excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles.
Total revenue was $4.5 billion, up 41% or 51% on a constant-currency basis. Ad revenue was $4.3 billion, up 45% or 57% on a constant-currency basis. The strengthening of the U.S. Dollar continued to have an unfavorable impact on our revenue in Q3. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q3 2014 levels, our total revenue would have been approximately $340 million higher.
Regionally, U.S. and Canada and Asia Pacific were our strongest markets, producing ad revenue growth of 56% and 48% respectively. Europe and rest of world grew more slowly at 33% and 29% respectively, impacted by our currency exposure in both of those regions.
As Sheryl mentioned, mobile continued to drive our revenue growth. Mobile ad revenue was $3.4 billion, up 73% from last year, representing 78% of our advertising revenues. Revenue from ads served on personal computers was down approximately 8%.
We have been very pleased with the sustained high growth of mobile advertising revenue. There are a number of important factors contributing to that growth both from the supply and demand side. The drivers of year-over-year mobile revenue growth fell into 3 main categories. First, as Sheryl covered, we have continued to have success driving strong advertiser demand. Second, we've grown the number of people using Facebook and the time that they spend with us. And third, the growth in advertiser demand and add quality has enabled us to increase ad loads over time.  As we have grown mobile advertising, we have remained very pleased with overall engagement levels, user satisfaction with News Feed and overall quality of the ads themselves.
Turning now to our overall price volume metrics. In Q3, the average price per ad increased 61%, while total ad impressions declined 10% on a year-over-year basis. As I've indicated on prior calls, the changes in our reported price volume metrics have been driven recently by the change of right-hand column ads and the shift to mobile. These factors will have a less significant impact on the reported price volume metrics going forward now that a full year has elapsed since the redesign of right-hand column ads and now that mobile impressions have grown to become the majority of impressions.  In fact, the quarter-over-quarter trends already point to that. In Q3, total ad impressions increased 7% sequentially, and average price per ad increased 5%.
Total payments and other fees revenue was $202 million, down 18% compared to last year. The decline was expected and was driven by a reduction in payments revenue related to games played on personal computers.
Turning now to expenses. Our Q3 total GAAP expenses were $3 billion, up 68%, and non-GAAP expenses were $2.1 billion, up 51%. Similar to last quarter, stock-based compensation and amortization expenses related to the WhatsApp acquisition contributed significantly to the year-over-year growth in GAAP expenses. Non-GAAP expenses were driven by increases in headcount-related costs, cost of revenue and marketing expenses.
We ended Q3 with nearly 12,000 employees, up 44% compared to last year. We added over 1,000 employees to Facebook in the quarter, and we are pleased with the continued strength of our recruiting efforts. 
Our Q3 GAAP operating income was approximately $1.5 billion, representing a 32% operating margin. Our non-GAAP operating income was $2.4 billion, representing a 54% margin.
Our Q3 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 37% and 32% respectively. Our Q3 GAAP net income was $896 million or $0.31 per share, and our non-GAAP net income was $1.6 billion or $0.57 per share.
In Q3, capital expenditures were $780 million as we continued to invest in servers, network infrastructure and the build-out of data centers and other facilities to support the rapid growth of the business. We generated $1.4 billion of free cash flow and ended the quarter with over $15.8 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the revenue outlook. We remain focused on growing the number of people who use our services, increasing advertiser demand and improving the quality and relevance of our ads. Across these dimensions, we continue to see healthy growth opportunities ahead for Facebook and Instagram. Given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the past year, we will continue to face currency headwinds next quarter particularly in Europe and Latin America.  In addition, we expect our total payments and other fees revenues to decline sequentially from Q3 to Q4, similar to the trends that we have experienced over the last couple of quarters.
Now turning to the expense outlook. We expect the year-over-year growth rate for total full year 2015 GAAP expenses to be approximately 55% and for total full year non-GAAP expenses to be approximately 50%.
We anticipate our 2015 capital expenditures will be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. We continue to expect our 2015 stock-based compensation to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.2 billion, approximately half of which is related to our prior acquisitions, most notably WhatsApp. We expect amortization expenses for the full year 2015 to be approximately $700 million to $800 million. And lastly, we anticipate our Q4 and full year 2015 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be several percentage points above their respective Q3 rates.
In summary, Q3 was another strong quarter for Facebook. We are pleased with the growth and engagement of our community and the momentum in our business, which together support our ability to continue investing to build our next generation of services and execute on our mission of connecting the world.
With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions."

So the first thing that I want to stress here is that these kind of new platforms take a long time to develop. So we've said often that we think that virtual reality and augmented reality can be the next big computing platform. But just to put that in perspective and compare that to the development of previews computing platforms like phones and computers, I mean the first smartphones came out in 2003. And in the first year, I think BlackBerry and Palm Treo where the initial smartphones that came out. I think each sold in the hundreds of thousands of units. So to kind of give a sense of the time frame that we're thinking about this and how we expect this to develop, that's kind of how we're thinking about that. In terms of the actual content, at first, we think gaming is going to be the most obvious market. There around, I think, more than 200 million, almost 250 million people who have either an Xbox or PlayStation or a Wii. And we think that, that audience is going through the type of people are going to be very excited about the type of experiences initially that you can have the virtual reality. An advantage of that is also that some of those can be single-player experiences that don't require a big network effect are a lot of people having the technology or large install base. Once we start getting a bit further along with that, then the next thing that we think is going to be huge is video and immersive experiences, both things that people can create like the social content that they share on Facebook today and more professional and premium content both short form and longer form. But we'll start to see some experimentation with that, they're already in some very good content. But until there are millions of units out in the market, I don't expect that to be a big industry for folks to be investing in huge amounts in 2016. Then when they're starting to be more units, just like any other major computing platform before that, what you kind of expect is that a large portion of what people do and it will be communication and social behavior. And that's where Facebook really has the DNA and experience to build the best experiences. And we're investing in trying to figure out what that's going to look like, and that's ultimately a lot of what we're extremely excited about for a number of years down the world."

So now we have self-service ads rolled out. We rolled out in all countries where we offer Facebook as. We have the ad formats for Instagram but were able to do more business objectives. All of which can use the same targeting as we have on Facebook and all of which are increasingly tapping into our measurement capabilities. On ad load, we have a lot of experience rolling out ads into fee-based products, and we monitor it very closely and we're going to continue to monitor really carefully. We're also excited about how they work together. Just to share one example, American Express working with digital, rolled out carousel ads on Instagram that targeted travel-related interest groups for people who are 18 years and older. retargeted those same people on Facebook. And what they created was a really visual journey using both the format of Instagram and the format of Facebook and combining the 2 platforms that they're targeting. We think we're at the very beginning of what's possible when we combine these 2."

Some clients are comfortable in Instagram and bringing a new budget to bear. Some clients are shifting some of their Facebook budget. For us in the medium to long run, we believe that we are not competing between Facebook and Instagram. We are competing with other forms of media. And if you want the most eyeballs and we think the highest ROI over time, we think that will benefit Facebook and Instagram. And for us, what we really want is people to experiment and learn and get to experience Instagram as they have on Facebook so that we can make the case improved ROI and then we believe if you look at the consumer metrics of where people are spending their time, we will be able to gain share compared to almost anything else you can buy out there."

But the vast majority of the content that's consumed on Facebook, just talking about video right now, is people through feed. They discover something interesting that they weren't necessarily looking for previously. That's very powerful because that's a behavior that there isn't really anywhere else to do at scale on the Internet today and in a great way. And then people watch it there or they put market to watch later. But if you're talking about watching in line with the feed, that's not the place we're you're necessarily going to see a TV show and then watch an hour-long clip right there. So what we're actually seeing is that a lot of the best, at least from my perspective, TV shows that -- we see folks like Jimmy Fallon breaking up their show into clips that they can now share to be consumed over social media and on the Internet in 3- to 5- or 7 -- minute segments, which are more what people want when browsing their News Feed. So I do think over time, we will get to more different types of content and we'll build products that so that. current market of trying to help people share and experience how the shorter form clips is massive. We are nowhere near as serving that as well as we want to. So I actually think in a lot of ways the more interesting question is not, in the near term, what we going to do to develop ways to consume long-form content, but what traditional media and content producers have traditionally produced short- and long-form content are going to do to chunk this stuff up better, so that way it can be more easily consumed by this big community online."

So India is a unique country where there are 1.25 billion people. More than 1 billion of them are not on the Internet. So it is the country in the world that benefit the most from connectivity. And there's a lot of research that we've seen and reports that third-party have put out that showed that when you connect a place like India, it makes a very big difference socially and for the economy there. And given a lot of us here, everyone we know is on the Internet and we can kind of think of the Internet as an entertainment and basic communication. But if you don't have access to a good school, then getting basic Internet access could be your best educational information. Or if you don't have access to a good doctor, then getting access to the Internet could be the only way that you can learn about how to avoid certain diseases, or how to raise your kids and help them avoid certain diseases and find jobs and a lot of stuff. So what we find through the research is that for every 10 people who get connected to the Internet, just a little less than or right around one person gets lifted out of poverty and one new job integrated. So we're very focused on this. It's a huge priority for the Indian government. And anything we can do to help there, we'll -- we think it's very good for the world. And we're invested in that, and we're happy to support. So in Internet.org in India now, they are already more than 1 million people who are -- who now have access to the Internet, who didn't otherwise because of our efforts. So we're proud of that, but obviously that's still very early on. We're only working with one operator currently in part of the country. So there's a lot of room to expand that. And that's just a big opportunity for the Internet overall and for India over the next decade, and we hope to play a role on that.
On China, that is a more complex situation. Obviously, you can't have a mission of wanting to connect everyone in the world and leave out the biggest country. So over the long term, that is a situation that we will need to try to figure out a way for them. For now, the thing that I would kind of leave you with this that people think that Facebook isn't in China at all, and that's actually not true. Our consumer service isn't active there, but it actually is already one of the biggest advertising markets that we have. Because there are a lot of really big and important Chinese companies who sell a lot of products to people outside of China, and they use Facebook as one of their primary tools in a lot of cases to spread information about what they're doing and grow their customer base. So we're happy to do whatever we can to help develop the economies in both of those countries, and they're both long-term efforts for us."

So I can talk to the multiapp question first. So we view the social space as almost as a matrix, but you can think about a 2-dimensional kind of grid where there's one axis -- the richness of the content that people want to share, and the other axis is the size of the audience or intimacy of how people want to share. So on the first axis you get everything ranging from text to links to photos and videos, immersive 360 videos and virtual reality content and kind of this progression. And on the others axis, you got everything ranging from one-on-one messaging to small group communication to communicating with all your friends at once the big interest Groups are completely public. And what we believe is that you can intersect at any point on that, right? And there will be something interesting to build, right? So a small group product for sharing video, that's like that's going to be a thing. And one-on-one product for sharing text or calling, that's clearly a thing. But a public sharing and consumption product for video, that's a thing. And what we've tried to do is basically figure out the areas that we think are open and are not currently served by the set of products that the industry has built and figure out a way to offer those. So one of the big opportunities that I'm really excited about right now is I think that this a pretty big opening between very private messaging, kind of the one-on-one messaging products like Messenger and WhatsApp, and products like Facebook where you share with all your friends at once or Instagram and in between there, what you're seeing is a huge growth of private groups. And Groups remains one of the I think least talked about products on Facebook. But as I just said earlier, we have more than 900 million people are using that every month. I mean, it's a huge thing, and it's a big area that we can develop going forward. So we experiment with all these things in terms of some of them make sense to naturally have inside the Facebook app because you're using the same set of friends and network and connections. Some of them get clear value by being separate. Like Messenger, for example, where we can make sure that everyone has a push notifications turned on, which is extremely important for a messaging app. But overall, this just a lot of stuff and the space, and the amount that people want to share and communicate is conquest. And that's I think partially why we're seeing the growth that you're seeing with some of the growth products."

And that's because I think we solve a really big problem for SMBs, which is how are they going to reach customers. In the United States, which is usually the most advanced market, 35% of small businesses have no web presence at all. And building a mobile presence is even harder than a web presence because most people don't use mobile web. And mobile apps are expensive to build and hard to get people to use, especially if you're a small business. That's why there are 45 million SMB pages on Facebook. These are people who are using Facebook and this free product to create an online and increasingly a mobile presence. And then our job is to make sure that free product works for them and then over time, bring them into our paid products. We have 2.5 million advertisers, and over 80% of them started on Pages and started with the simplified ad products. And that's what we've done over time, and we'll continue to do that.

And we can give them opportunities to do things they otherwise couldn't do, such as what I said in my transcript before, 1.5 million SMBs posting videos in 1 month alone. 1.5 million SMBs have not posted or created video on any other platform.

But it's important to keep in mind that there are a few different reasons why people share content on Facebook, and that's just one of the use cases, right? So there are a lot of people who are just sharing content socially, whether they want to get the message out, that may not be business motivated. There are a lot of folks who are business motivated, but who primarily post content in order to promote something or gain distribution for something. And that, you can get value without some kind of rev share. And that's why the video system is growing quickly even before we rolled out the revenue share. And now the third class of content, which I think is going to be important and increasingly important over, time is the one that you basically want essentially trade the content for money, and that is one where you need the rev share to unlock that.

So they invested in carousel ads and only showed them when their stores were closed. And they turned a $35,000 investment in carousel ads into $2 million in sales, which happened precisely when they wanted to happen.

The guiding principle for us on this is that we want to give the most voice to the most people. And the idea is that there are all these different barriers that any given person has being able to share and express everything that they want. From technical barriers, like it's really hard to communicate with someone if you're not in the Internet and they're far away. To product barriers, it's hard to share videos to put a good product for sharing videos. To legal barriers, like it's hard to share content that your government says is illegal for you to share. And at the end of the day, there's also policy. And you're in a community and we have community standards for how we think people should communicate in order to be safe, right? Because even if you have all of the Internet connectivity and the products and the legal framework that you need, if we don't feel safe saying what you want to express, then you're probably not going to share it, right? And we see a lot of that online, and that's a big issue. Everything from bullying to terrorism, there are lots of reasons why people might otherwise have the tools to share what they would want but feel kind of silent. And that isn't giving the most voice to the most people. So we feel our responsibility to have policies for the community is limit things which are going to create just an overwhelmingly uncomfortable environment for people that is going to to silence other people's speech in order to make sure that over the long term, we are enabling the most people to be able to express as much as possible as they can. And that's the philosophy that we have."

And all of these products and all of the underlying targeting, like Custom Audiences, are designed to help people meet different objectives. And we're trying to be really clear on that. If you're trying to move a brand objective, if you want a new favorability or brand sentiment, we can do that.

So on search, we already have one very big use case, which is people basically using our search engine to look up pages and people who are on Facebook. And that by itself is already one of the biggest search engines in the world. The next big use case that we've really been working on for a couple of years now and I think is going to -- is starting to roll out and is growing quickly is people finding content on Facebook. So that's trending as people finding posts that their friends or others have posted on News Feed that they saw, but then might want to go check out later. And I think this is going to be a very important part of the video experience as well. Because what one half is push, going to News Feed and not asking for content, which is coming across and discovering it. And then the other half is pull, right, and going to some experience where you're asking for some type of content. And getting to a point where we can do that very well is just going to ad a whole new dimension to the services. So that's something I remain very excited about. In some ways, it's taken a little bit longer than I have expected to get to a point where it's growing quickly. The people and page lookup part is doing very well. The post part has taken a bit longer, but I'm very excited about that going forward. In terms of news, I mean, the biggest issue with news today in Facebook is that it is the slowest part of experience, right? I mean, if you go the load the video and it loads quickly, we made it autoplay to load even quicker. You tap a photo, expect it to expand immediately. But you tap on a link and often, it can take 10 seconds to load. And if you're on the 2G connection somewhere in the developing world, it could take 30 seconds to load. So the big initiative that we have here, which I'm really excited about, is the instant articles. And the big thing that that does is it lets publishers basically put the content on our servers ahead of time. And that way when people tap on it, it loads extemporaneously. And it can be a much more immersive experience. And we've already found some the initial expense that event that the engagement is positive and were starting to roll that out more broadly. So I think that that's going to be a really big deal for our improving the experience of reading this on Facebook, and it's something that we've been working on for a while and I'm very excited about. So yes, I would expect that we will see an expansion of sharing and consumption of all the different types of things that you asked about, news, video, search and the different experiences there. And these are some of the big areas that we're investing in. And they're our long-term investments and they're big investments and we're going to keep on pushing on them. But I think that's where we need to do to serve our community well and ultimately connect all to the world. So thank you, guys."

This was another good quarter, and we continue to grow the size and engagement of our community. 1.55 billion people now use Facebook every month, and more than 1 billion people use Facebook every day. 
On mobile, we continue to have a lot of momentum. 1.39 billion people now use Facebook on mobile devices, including more than 1 billion on Android. 50 million people also use Facebook Lite, our app for people on low bandwidth connections and one of our fastest-growing interfaces. This is a great sign for how our mobile strategy continues to make progress across markets, devices and platforms. 
When it comes to our business, we're also pleased with our results. This quarter, total revenue reached $4.5 billion and advertising revenue grew by 45% from a year ago. We've already accomplished a lot this year, and these results show how we're getting stronger as a community and as a business. 
But we want to serve the entire global community, not just the people who are on Facebook today. Connecting everyone is one of the fundamental challenges of our time, and to achieve this, we need to continue innovating faster and investing for the long term. That means continuing to invest in our core products and services as well as technologies and strategies that allow us to achieve a truly global reach over time. 
Let's talk about how we're doing this, and let's start with how we're improving our core products to better serve our existing communities and businesses. This quarter, we introduced some big updates on Facebook to give people more options for expressing themselves. We began rolling out an improved mobile profile design, including the ability to add a profile video instead of just a photo. 
We also started testing reactions, a new version of the Like button that provides more ways for expressing love, awe and sympathy. We think this is going to provide a much more engaging experience.
Another way we're working to improve people's experiences on Facebook is by helping them to share many different types of content with different groups of people they care about. One example is our progress with Groups on Facebook. More than 925 million people now use Groups each month, and in some countries, more than half of the population is participating.
For -- from a youth organization in Chicago to aid workers dealing with the refugee crisis in Europe, we've seen many inspiring examples of people using Groups to collaborate. 
Video is another area where we continue to make progress. On average, there are now more than 8 billion daily video views on Facebook and more than 500 million people who are watching daily. To offer even more engaging video experiences, we added live video to our Mentions app for public figures, and we now support interactive 360 videos in News Feed. We've also rolled out new video tools for Pages and begun testing a dedicated video section on Facebook. 
Over the next few years, video is going to be some of the most engaging content online. And by continuing to innovate here, we have a chance to build the best place to watch and share videos. 
When it comes to serving businesses, we continue to create a lot of value. We now have more than 2.5 million active advertisers on Facebook and more than 45 million small- and medium-sized businesses actively using Facebook Pages. This quarter, we continued to focus on helping marketers achieve results while using our ad products, including video and carousel ads, as well as on Instagram. And as usual, Sheryl can talk more about this in a moment.
Now let's talk about how we're working to develop our next generation of apps and services. For Instagram, this is a busy quarter. The community celebrated its 5-year anniversary and reached a new milestone of 400 million monthly actives. More than 80 million photos are now shown on Instagram every day, and the pace of adoption among public figures, organizations and people around the world continues to grow really well.  When President Obama visited Alaska in September, he used Instagram to document his trip. And this is a great example of how Instagram is changing the way that people see the world. 
With our efforts in messaging, we're all so making progress at building WhatsApp and Messenger, both integrated platforms of global scale. Last quarter, WhatsApp reached 900 million monthly actives and continues to be on a path to reach 1 billion people and beyond. 
Messenger has over 700 million monthly actives, and we continue to focus on improving the core messaging experience. A good sign of our progress is the more-than-9.5 billion photos now sent monthly on Messenger. We're also building many different tools that can offer useful experiences to people beyond just your traditional messaging. One example is M, a digital assistant we introduced this quarter that, over time, will use AI to help people complete tasks.
Finally, let's talk about some of our longer-term efforts in innovation to help connect the world. With Internet.org, we have a lot of momentum. We've now rolled out free basic Internet services to people in 29 countries and, overall, brought more than 15 million people online. As we've rolled out the program, we've made a number of improvements based on feedback from communities and partners, including opening up our platform for free basic services to all developers who want to build. 
Meanwhile, our work on new technologies to connect people in the most remote regions continues to make progress. This quarter, we revealed Aquila, our first aircraft designed to beam Internet into communities down from the sky. And we also announced a partnership to bring Internet to large parts of sub-Saharan Africa using a satellite, which is launching next year. And with Oculus, we're in a great position to begin delivering a new generation of shared, immersive experiences. We plan to ship the Rift headset early next year. And Gear VR, our mobile product with Samsung, is going to have its first consumer release this holiday season, retailing for $99. And we also announced new partnerships with Minecraft, Netflix and Twitch and many other content partners. Virtual reality has the potential to be the next computing platform that changes all of our lives. It's important also to recognize that this is going to grow slowly, like computers and mobile phones when they first arrived. So we're committed to Oculus and virtual reality for the long term.
So that's how we've continued to make progress on our strategy this quarter. The results we've achieved show that our investments are creating a lot of value for our community and the world. I just want to thank the entire Facebook community, our employees, our partners and our shareholders for helping us to continue moving forward. We've done a lot, but there's always more to do. 
And now I'm going to hand it off to Sheryl."

Ad revenue grew 45% year-over-year or 57% on a constant-currency basis. Mobile ad revenue was $3.4 billion and grew 73% year-over-year. Mobile now makes up 78% of our total advertising revenue. 
Our business grew across all regions and marketer segments. Like last quarter, we saw especially strong growth in our North America and Asia Pacific regions. Overall, we're really pleased with marketer adoption of our ad products around the world.  
Our results show that we continue to make progress on our 3 priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of marketers using our ad products and making our ads more relevant and effective.
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. People have already shifted to mobile, and this shift is driving engagement on Facebook. The average American adult spends 25% of their media time on mobile, and Facebook and Instagram together continue to account for over 1 in 5 minutes on mobile in the U.S. Businesses are lagging behind consumers in making this shift to mobile, and we believe we're well positioned to help them catch up. Facebook Pages are already the mobile solution for millions of businesses. Pages now offer better messaging capabilities, call-to-action buttons, and news sections that enable businesses to highlight important information.
We're also capitalizing on the shift to mobile by expanding ads on Instagram. This quarter, on Instagram, we introduced new ad formats and objectives, opened up our API and launched self-serve ad capabilities. Instagram ads are now available in all countries where we offer Facebook ads, and marketers can manage campaigns across both platforms with the same targeting. We're really pleased with the marketer demand for Instagram ads.
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products. In September, at Adweek, we announced that we have over 2.5 million active advertisers on Facebook. With more than 45 million active SMB Pages on Facebook, we think there's a lot of opportunity to turn even more of these businesses into marketers.
Marketers come to Facebook and Instagram because we have the best performing mobile ad products, and video is making it even better. Marketers have always loved using videos to tell stories. As Mark discussed, video is a natural and growing part of our mobile News Feed experience. Video on Facebook gives marketers not just mass reach but better cross-device targeting and measurement than, we believe, is available on any other platforms. We're especially pleased with the breadth of marketers using video on Facebook, from brands to direct response to SMBs. Over 1.5 million small businesses posted video, which includes organic video posts and video ads, on Facebook in the month of September alone.
Video ads complement TV ads. According to a recent study with Nielsen Research, marketers using Facebook ads with TV ads have higher reach, ad recall, brand linkage and likability. To share one example, GMC used video and other ads on Facebook to extend the reach of their TV brand campaign highlighting their premium trucks and SUVs. The Facebook campaign drove a 13-point lift in ad recall and a 6-point lift in brand favorability. 
We recently introduced Target Rating Point, TRP Buying, so that marketers can plan, buy and measure video ads on Facebook the same way they do on TV. We're pleased with the feedback we're receiving on this from marketers and agencies.
Our third priority is making our ads more relevant and effective. We know relevant ads are more engaging for people, and therefore, drive better results for businesses. Products like carousel ads and dynamic product ads help improve effectiveness for marketers. Carousel ads show multiple images, and now videos, and drive 30% to 50% lower cost per conversion than single-image link ads. Dynamic product ads, which allow marketers to upload their product catalogs, are driving ROI comparable to search. For example, Marriott uses DPA to retarget travelers based on their travel search habits, and they are now scaling globally across their portfolio of brands. LatAm [ph] e-commerce company MercadoLibre uses DPA to remarket over 38 million products in over 13 countries. Both are seeing high ROI and continuing to invest.
On the measurement side, conversion lift is helping clients see the real business results from their campaigns. This mobile [ph] of Sprint brand showed ads to people eligible for device upgrades. Using conversion lift, they were able to attribute a 4% lift in in-store sales through their Facebook campaign. 
Finally, we're continuing to invest in ad tech across outlets LiveRail and the Audience Network. This quarter, we expanded the ad formats publishers in the Audience Network can add to their mobile apps. On LiveRail, this quarter, we began testing age and gender targeting. LiveRail can now deliver over 90% accuracy on age and gender segments across desktop, mobile web and mobile apps versus the nontarget rate of only 31% to 55% when not using LiveRail technology.
I'd like to take a moment to thank our clients around the world for their continued partnership and congratulate our global Facebook teams on great executions. Looking forward, we're going to stay focused on our priorities to continue to build a solid foundation for our long-term business.
Now here's Dave."

Growth and engagement of our community again pr",1097,"Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. 
Echoing Mark and Sheryl's comments, Q3 was another strong quarter for Facebook. We generated $4.5 billion in revenue and over $1.4 billion in free cash flow. 
Growth and engagement of our community again provided a great platform for our strong financial performance this quarter. In September, we reached a new milestone, with over 1 billion people using Facebook on an average day, an increase of 17% compared to last year. This daily number represents 65% of the 1.55 billion people who used Facebook during the month of September.
Mobile continued to drive our growth. In September, approximately 1.39 billion people accessed Facebook on mobile devices, up 23% from last year. Additionally, our next generation of services continued to grow, with Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp now exceeding 400 million, 700 million and 900 million monthly actives, respectively.
Now turning to the financials. All of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Additionally, our non-GAAP measures exclude stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles.
Total revenue was $4.5 billion, up 41% or 51% on a constant-currency basis. Ad revenue was $4.3 billion, up 45% or 57% on a constant-currency basis. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar continued to have an unfavorable impact on our revenue in Q3. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q3 2014 levels, our total revenue would have been approximately $340 million higher.
Regionally, U.S. and Canada and Asia Pacific were our strongest markets, producing ad revenue growth of 56% and 48%, respectively. Europe and rest of world grew more slowly at 33% and 29%, respectively, impacted by our currency exposure in both of those regions.
As Sheryl mentioned, mobile continued to drive our revenue growth. Mobile ad revenue was $3.4 billion, up 73% from last year, representing 78% of our advertising revenue. Revenue from ads served on personal computers was down approximately 8%.
We have been very pleased with the sustained high growth of mobile advertising revenue. There are a number of important factors contributing to that growth, both from the supply and demand side. The drivers of year-over-year mobile revenue growth fell into 3 main categories: First, as Sheryl covered, we have continued to have success driving strong advertiser demand; second, we've grown both the number of people using Facebook and the time that they spend with us; and third, the growth in advertiser demand and ad quality has enabled us to increase ad loads over time.  As we have grown mobile advertising, we have remained very pleased with overall engagement levels, user satisfaction with News Feed and the overall quality of the ads themselves.
Turning now to our overall price volume metrics. In Q3, the average price per ad increased 61%, while total ad impressions declined 10% on a year-over-year basis. As I've indicated on prior calls, the changes in our reported price volume metrics have been driven recently by the change in the number of right-hand column ads and the shift to mobile. These factors will have a less significant impact on the reported price volume metrics going forward now that a full year has elapsed since the redesign of right-hand column ads and now that mobile impressions have grown to become the majority of impressions. In fact, the quarter-over-quarter trends already point to that. In Q3, total ad impressions increased 7% sequentially and average price per ad increased 5%.
Total payments and other fees revenue was $202 million, down 18% compared to last year. The decline was expected and was driven by a reduction in payments revenue related to games played on personal computers.
Turning now to expenses. Our Q3 total GAAP expenses were $3 billion, up 68%, and non-GAAP expenses were $2.1 billion, up 51%. Similar to last quarter, stock-based compensation and amortization expenses related to the WhatsApp acquisition contributed significantly to the year-over-year growth in GAAP expenses. Non-GAAP expenses were driven by increases in headcount-related costs, cost of revenue and marketing expenses.
We ended Q3 with nearly 12,000 employees, up 44% compared to last year. We added over 1,000 employees to Facebook in the quarter, and we are pleased with the continued strength in our recruiting efforts. 
Our Q3 GAAP operating income was approximately $1.5 billion, representing a 32% operating margin. Our non-GAAP operating income was $2.4 billion, representing a 54% margin.
Our Q3 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 37% and 32%, respectively. Our Q3 GAAP net income was $896 million or $0.31 per share, and our non-GAAP net income was $1.6 billion or $0.57 per share.
In Q3, capital expenditures were $780 million as we continued to invest in servers, network infrastructure and the buildout of data centers and other facilities to support the rapid growth of the business. We generated $1.4 billion of free cash flow and ended the quarter with over $15.8 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the revenue outlook. We remain focused on growing the number of people who use our services, increasing advertiser demand and improving the quality and relevance of our ads. Across these dimensions, we continue to see healthy growth opportunities ahead for Facebook and Instagram. Given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the past year, we will continue to face currency headwinds next quarter, particularly in Europe and Latin America.  In addition, we expect our total payments and other fees revenues to decline sequentially from Q3 to Q4, similar to the trends that we have experienced over the last couple of quarters.
Now turning to the expense outlook. We expect the year-over-year growth rate for total full year 2015 GAAP expenses to be approximately 55% and for total full year non-GAAP expenses to be approximately 50%.
We anticipate our 2015 capital expenditures will be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. We continue to expect our 2015 stock-based compensation to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.2 billion, approximately half of which is related to our prior acquisitions, most notably WhatsApp. We expect amortization expenses for the full year 2015 to be approximately $700 million to $800 million. And lastly, we anticipate our Q4 and full year 2015 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be several percentage points above their respective Q3 rates.
In summary, Q3 was another strong quarter for Facebook. We are pleased with the growth and engagement of our community and the momentum in our business, which, together, support our ability to continue investing to build our next generation of services and execute on our mission of connecting the world.

And what's the role Facebook's going to have to play in maybe seeding some of the content and entertainment side of VR? And then, for Sheryl, any color you can give us on Instagram?

So the first thing that I want to stress here is that these kind of new platforms take a long time to develop. So we've said often that we think that virtual reality and augmented reality could be the next big computing platform. But just to put that in perspective and compare it to the development of previous computing platforms like phones and computers, I mean, the first smartphones came out in 2003. And in the first year, I think, BlackBerry and Palm Treo were the initial smartphones that came out. I think that they each sold in the hundreds of thousands of units. So just to kind of give a sense of the time frame that we're thinking about this and how we expect this to develop, that's kind of how we're thinking about that. The -- in terms of the actual content, first, we think gaming is going to be the most obvious market. There are around, I think, more than 200 million, almost 250 million people who have either an Xbox, a PlayStation or a Wii, and we think that, that audience is going to be the type of people who are going to be very excited about the type of experiences, initially, that you can have with virtual reality. And the advantage of that is also that some of those can be single-player experiences. They don't require a big network effect are a lot of people having the technology or a large installed base. Once we start getting a bit further along with that, then, the next thing that we think is going to be huge is video and immersive experiences, both things that people can create, like the social content that they share on Facebook today, and more professional and premium content, both short form and longer form. But we'll start to see some experimentation with that. There already is some very good content. But until there are millions of units out in the market, I don't expect that to be a big industry, for folks to be investing a huge amount in 2016. Then, when they're starting to get to be more units, just like every other major computing platform before that, what we kind of expect is that a large portion of what people do in it will be communication and social behavior. And that's where Facebook really has the DNA and experience to build the best experiences, and we're investing in trying to figure out what that's going to look like, and that's ultimately a lot of what we're extremely excited about for a number of years down the road."

And what we bring to this is a common ad infrastructure. So Instagram ads, now that we've rolled out ads, we have this past quarter, and gotten to a really good product offering, combine to create a format of Instagram which is very visually compelling and has a lot of engagement from people with the back-end infrastructure and marketer base that Facebook has. So now we have self-service ads rolled out. We've rolled it out in all countries where we offer Facebook ads. We have new ad formats for Instagram. We're able to do more business objectives. All of which can use the same targeting as we have on Facebook, and all of which are increasingly tapping into our measuring capabilities. On ad load, we have a lot of experience rolling out ads into fee-based products, and we monitor it very carefully, and we're going to continue to monitor really carefully. We're also excited about how they work together. Just to share one example, American Express working with Digita [ph] rolled out carousel ads on Instagram that targeted travel-related interest groups for people who are 18 years and older. They then retargeted those same people on Facebook. And what they created was a really visual journey, using both the format that is Instagram, the format that is Facebook, and combining the 2 platforms that they're targeting. We think we're at the very beginning of what's possible when we combine these 2."

For us, in the medium to long run, we believe that we're not competing between Facebook and Instagram. We are competing with other forms of media. And if you want the most eyeballs and, we think, the highest ROI, over time, we think that will benefit Facebook and Instagram. And so for us, what we really want is people to experiment and learn and get to experience Instagram as they have on Facebook, so that we can make the case and prove the ROI, and then, we believe, if you look at the consumer metrics of where people were spending their time, we will be able to gain share compared to almost anything else you can buy out there."

They discover something interesting that they weren't necessarily looking for previously. That's very powerful, because that's a behavior that there isn't really anywhere else to do at scale on the Internet today in a great way. And then, people watch it there or they bookmark it to watch later. But if you're talking about watching in line in Feed, that's not the place where you're necessarily going to see a TV show and then watch an hour-long clip right there. So what we're actually seeing is that a lot of the best -- or at least, from my perspective, TV shows that -- we see folks like Jimmy Fallon breaking up their show into clips that they can now share to be consumed over social media and on the Internet in 3- to 5- or 7-minute segments, which are more what people want when browsing their News Feed. So I do think, over time, we will get to more different types of content and we'll build products that serve that. The current market of trying to help people share and experience all these shorter-form clips is massive. We are nowhere near serving that as well as we want to. So I actually think, in a lot of ways, though, the more interesting question is not, in the near term, what we're going to do to develop ways to consume long-form content, but what traditional media and content producers who have traditionally produced short -- long-form content are going to do to chunk their stuff up better, so that way, it can be more easily consumed by this big community online."

So India is a unique country, where there are 1.25 billion people. More than 1 billion of them are not on the Internet. So it is the country in the world that benefits the most from connectivity. And there's a lot of research that we've seen and reports that third parties have put out that show that when you connect a place like India, it makes a very big difference socially and for the economy there. I mean, a lot of us here, everyone we know is on the Internet, and we kind of think about the Internet as an entertainment and basic communication. But if you don't have access to a good school, then getting basic Internet access could be your best educational information. Or I mean, if you don't have access to a good doctor, then getting access to the Internet could be the only way that you can learn about how to avoid certain diseases or how to raise your kids and help them avoid certain diseases and find jobs and a lot of stuff. So what we find through the research is that for every 10 people who get connected to the Internet, just a little less than or right around 1 person gets lifted out of poverty and 1 new job gets created. So we're very focused on this. It's a huge priority for the Indian government. And anything that we can do to help there, we'll -- we think is very good for the world, and we're invested in that and we're happy to support. So in Internet.org in India now, there are already more than 1 million people who are -- who now have access to the Internet, who didn't otherwise, because of our efforts. So we're proud of that, but obviously, that's still very early on. We're only working with one operator currently and part of the country. So there's a lot of room to expand that. And that's just a big opportunity for the Internet overall and for India over the next decade, and we hope to play a role in that. On China, that is a more complex situation. Obviously, you can't have a mission of wanting to connect everyone in the world and leave out the biggest country. So over the long term, that is a situation that we will need to try to figure out a way forward on. For now, the thing that I would kind of leave you with is that people think that Facebook isn't in China at all, and that's actually not true. Our consumer service isn't active there, but it actually is already one of the biggest advertising markets that we have. Because there are a lot of really big and important Chinese companies who sell a lot of products to people outside of China, and they use Facebook as one of their primary tools, in a lot of cases, to spread information about what they're doing and grow their customer base. So we're happy to do whatever we can to help develop the economies in both of those countries, and they're both long-term efforts for us."

So I can talk to the multi-app question first. So we view the social space as almost as a matrix. You can think about it as a 2-dimensional kind of grid where there's one axis is all -- the richness of the content that people want to share, then the other axis is the size of the audience or intimacy of how people want to share. So on the first axis, you get everything ranging from text to links to photos and videos, immersive 360 videos and virtual reality content and kind of this progression. And on the others axis, you've got everything ranging from one-to-one messaging to small group communication to communicating with all your friends at once to big interest groups that are completely public. And what we believe is that you can intersect at any point on that, right? So and there will be something interesting to build, right? So a small group product for sharing video. That's like -- that's going to be a thing. A one-on-one product for sharing text or calling, that's clearly a thing, right? A public sharing and consumption product for video, that's a thing. And what we've tried to do is basically figure out the areas that we think are open and are not currently served by the set of products that the industry has built and figure out a way to offer those. So one of the big opportunities that I'm really excited about right now is, I think that there's a pretty big opening between very private messaging, kind of the one-on-one messaging products like Messenger and WhatsApp, and products like Facebook, where you share with all your friends at once or Instagram, and in between there, what we're seeing is this huge growth of private groups, right? And Groups remains one of the, I think, least talked about products on Facebook, but I just said earlier that we have -- more than 900 million people are using that every month. I mean, it's a huge thing, and it's a big area that we can develop going forward. So we experiment with all these things in terms of some of them make sense to naturally have inside the Facebook app because you're using the same set of friends and network and connections. Some of them get clear value by being separate, like Messenger, for example, where we can make sure that everyone has their push notifications turned on, which is extremely important for a messaging app. But overall, there's just a lot of stuff in this space, and the amount that people want to share and communicate is endless. And that's, I think, partially why we're seeing the growth that we are with so many of these products."

In the United States, which is usually the most advanced market, 35% of small businesses have no web presence at all. And building a mobile presence is even harder than a web presence because most people don't use the mobile web and mobile apps are expensive to build and hard to get people to use, especially if you're a small business. That's why there are 45 million SMB Pages on Facebook. These are people who are using Facebook and this free product to create online and, increasingly, a mobile presence. And then, our job is to make sure that free product works for them, and then, over time, bring them into our paid products. We have 2.5 million advertisers, and over 80% of them started on Pages and then started with simplified ad products, and that's what we've done over time, and we'll continue to do that. And what you see is that it's as easy for them to use it as profile, and we can give them opportunities to do things they otherwise couldn't do, such as, what I said in my transcript before, 1.5 million SMBs posting videos in 1 month alone. 1.5 million SMBs have not posted or created video on any other platform, but with us, it's cheap, it's very easy to use, and that gives us a way to continue to work with SMBs and increasingly grow our business with them."

So between January 1 and October 7 of this year, over 68 million people on Facebook in the U.S. made over 1 billion interactions about the campaign alone, and every candidate -- and every member of Congress is on Facebook now. In terms of the revenue impact, no one vertical drives our business. We have a very large and diversified business. But we think we offer something pretty compelling, which is the reach of Facebook with their unique targeting. So on Facebook, you can target an ad by district, by interest. Ben Carson ran 240 different ads targeted at different audiences. And so we're starting to see candidates use our platform to communicate, to advertise and to share."

So the follow-up question that I would have is, how do you think you could best partner with the media providers and convince them the merits of bringing their valuable, in some cases expensive, content into the Facebook world, particularly at a time in media when they're really trying hard to guard their own existing ecosystems? And then, a question for Sheryl. I wonder if you could just touch on the relative growth of branded advertising versus direct response ads. You mentioned Total Ratings Point Buying. Can you help us think about the mix of branded versus DR? And for you, do you think that TRP Buying in video is going to shift your ad mix more towards branded over time?"

So you're definitely right that there's a certain class of content which is only going to come onto Facebook if there's a good way to compensate the content owners for that. And we've recently rolled out the business model for this, which is for premium content. We'll give a revenue share on a portion of the views to the content owners. And we've got good feedback so far on that. We're working with a small set of partners to start, and we'll roll it out beyond that as that keeps on going. But it's important to keep in mind that there are a few different reasons why people share content on Facebook, and that's just one of the use cases, right? So the -- there are a lot of people who are just sharing content socially, right, because they want to get a message out that may not be business motivated. There are a lot of folks who are business motivated, but who primarily post content in order to promote something or gain distribution for something. And that -- you can get value without some kind of rev share, and that's why the video system has grown so quickly even before we rolled out a revenue share. And now the third class of content, which, I think, is going to be important and increasingly important over time, is the one that you basically want to essentially trade the content for money, and that is one where you need the rev share to unlock that. But we're getting good feedback on that upfront. So we're looking forward to seeing how that trends."

We're seeing strong growth in brands, and we because -- we believe that's because we're delivering on the promise of personalized marketing and scale. So we've worked hard on things that will help brand purchasers feel comfortable on the platform and measure their ROI. So that's where TRP Buying comes in, allowing people who usually buy TV ads to plan, buy, measure Facebook ads the same way, enables apples-to-apples comparison that, we believe, is very strong for RROI. We've also worked on brand awareness optimization, mobile pulling to measure campaign effectiveness, and we're working client by client. Our other segments are growing as well. We're working hard in the direct response area, rolling out things like carousel ads and dynamic product ads. And one thing that's worth understanding is that all of these different marketer segments often work together. So to share one  example, IKEA wanted to boost their online sales when their stores were closed. So in Norway, most retailers are closed Saturday to Sunday night. So they invested in carousel ads and only showed them when their stores were closed. And they turned a $35,000 investment in carousel ads into $2 million in sales, which happened precisely when they wanted to happen. That's a direct response ad buy because it's very specific carousel ads product. But it's also in the brand price for them as they strengthen their brand and get people to interact with them as they want them to."

The guiding principle for us on this is that we want to give the most voice to the most people. And the idea is that there are all these different barriers that any given person has to being able to share and express everything that they want. From technical barriers, right, it's really hard to communicate with someone if you're not on the Internet and they're far away; to product barriers, it's hard to share videos if we don't have a good product for sharing videos; to legal barriers, right, it's hard to share content that your government says is illegal for you to share. And at the end of the day, there's also policy. You're in a community, and we have community standards for how we think people should communicate in order to be safe, right? Because even if you have all of the Internet connectivity and the products and the legal framework that you need, if you don't feel safe saying what you want to express, then you're probably not going to share it, right? And we see a lot of that online, and that's a pretty big issue, right? From -- everything from bullying to terrorism, there are lots of reasons why people might otherwise have the tools to share what they would want but feel kind of silenced. And that isn't giving the most voice to the most people. So we feel a responsibility to have policies for the community which limit hate speech and limit things which are going to create just an overwhelmingly uncomfortable environment for people that is going to silence other people's speech in order to make sure that, over the long term, we are enabling the most people to be able to express as much as possible as they can. And that's the philosophy that we have."

So on search, we already have one very big use case, which is people basically using our search engine to look up Pages and people who are on Facebook. And that, by itself, is already one of the biggest search engines in the world. The next big use",552,"Sure. So on search, we already have one very big use case, which is people basically using our search engine to look up Pages and people who are on Facebook. And that, by itself, is already one of the biggest search engines in the world. The next big use case that we've really been working on for a couple of years now and, I think, is going to -- is starting to roll out and is growing quickly is people finding contents on Facebook. So that's trending. It's people finding posts that their friends or others had posted on News Feed that they saw, but then, might want to go check out later. And I think this is going to be a very important part of the video experience as well, because 1/2 is push, right, going to News Feed and not asking for content, but just coming across and discovering it. And then, the other half is pull, right, and going through some experience where you're asking for some type of content. And getting to a point where we can do that very well is just going to add a whole new dimension to the service. So that's something I remain very excited about. In some ways, it's taken a little bit longer than I had expected to get to a point where it's growing quickly. The people and Page lookup part is doing very well. The post part has taken a bit longer, but I'm very excited about that going forward. In terms of news, I mean, the biggest issue with news today in Facebook is that it is the slowest part of the experience, right? I mean, you go to load a video and it loads quickly. We made it autoplay to load even quicker. You tap on a photo, you expect it to expand immediately. But you tap on a link, and often, it can take 10 seconds to load. And if you're on a 2G connection somewhere in the developing world, it could take 30 seconds to load. So the big initiative that we have here, which I'm really excited about, is instant articles. And the big thing that, that does is just it lets publishers basically put the content on our servers ahead of time, and that way, when people tap on it, it loads instantaneously. And it can be a much more immersive experience. And we've already found from the initial experiments that we have done that the engagement is positive, and we're starting to roll that out more broadly. So I think that, that's going to be a really big deal for improving the experience of reading news  on Facebook. And it's something that we've been working on for a while and I'm very excited about. So yes, I would expect that we will see an expansion of sharing and consumption of all the different types of things that you asked about, news, video, search and the different experiences there, and these are some of the big areas that we're investing in. And they're long-term investments, and they're big investments, and we're going to keep on pushing on them. But I think that's what we need to do to serve our community well and, ultimately, connect everyone in the world. So thank you, guys."

This was another good quarter, and we continued to grow the size and engagement of our community. 1.55 billion people now use Facebook every month, and more than 1 billion people use Facebook every day. 
On mobile, we continue to have a lot of momentum. 1.39 billion people now use Facebook on mobile devices, including more than 1 billion on Android. 50 million people also use Facebook Lite, our app for people on low bandwidth connections and one of our fastest-growing interfaces. This is a great sign for how our mobile strategy continues to make progress across markets, devices and platforms. 
When it comes to our business, we're also pleased with our results. This quarter, total revenue reached $4.5 billion and advertising revenue grew by 45% from a year ago. We've already accomplished a lot this year, and these results show how we're getting stronger as a community and as a business. 
But we want to serve the entire global community, not just the people who are on Facebook today. Connecting everyone is one of the fundamental challenges of our time, and to achieve this, we need to continue innovating faster and investing for the long term. That means continuing to invest in our core products and services as well as technologies and strategies that allow us to achieve a truly global reach over time. 
Let's talk about how we're doing this, and let's start with how we're improving our core products to better serve our existing communities and businesses. This quarter, we introduced some big updates on Facebook to give people more options for expressing themselves. We began rolling out an improved mobile profile design, including the ability to add a profile video instead of just a photo. 
We also started testing reactions, a new version of the Like button that provides more ways for expressing love, awe and sympathy. We think this is going to provide a much more engaging experience.
Another way we're working to improve people's experiences on Facebook is by helping them to share many different types of content with different groups of people they care about. One example is our progress with Groups on Facebook. More than 925 million people now use Groups each month, and in some countries, more than half of the population is participating.
For -- from a youth organization in Chicago to aid workers dealing with the refugee crisis in Europe, we've seen many inspiring examples of people using Groups to collaborate. 
Video is another area where we continue to make progress. On average, there are now more than 8 billion daily video views on Facebook and more than 500 million people who are watching daily. To offer even more engaging video experiences, we've added live video to our Mentions app for public figures, and we now support interactive 360 videos in News Feed. We've also rolled out new video tools for Pages and begun testing a dedicated video section on Facebook. 
Over the next few years, video is going to be some of the most engaging content online. And by continuing to innovate here, we have a chance to build the best place to watch and share videos. 
When it comes to serving businesses, we continue to create a lot of value. We now have more than 2.5 million active advertisers on Facebook and more than 45 million small- and medium-sized businesses actively using Facebook Pages. This quarter, we continued to focus on helping marketers achieve results while using our ad products, including video and carousel ads, as well as on Instagram. And as usual, Sheryl can talk more about this in a moment.
Now let's talk about how we're working to develop our next generation of apps and services. For Instagram, this was a busy quarter. The community celebrated its 5-year anniversary and reached a new milestone of 400 million monthly actives. More than 80 million photos are now shared on Instagram every day, and the pace of adoption among public figures, organizations and people around the world continues to grow really well.  When President Obama visited Alaska in September, he used Instagram to document his trip. And this is a great example of how Instagram is changing the way that people see the world. 
With our efforts in messaging, we're all so making progress at building WhatsApp and Messenger, both integrate platforms of global scale. Last quarter, WhatsApp reached 900 million monthly actives and continues to be on a path to reach 1 billion people and beyond. 
Messenger has over 700 million monthly actives, and we continue to focus on improving the core messaging experience. A good sign of our progress is the more-than-9.5 billion photos now sent monthly on Messenger. We're also building many different tools that can offer useful experiences to people beyond just your traditional messaging. One example is M, a digital assistant we introduced this quarter that, over time, will use AI to help people complete tasks.
Finally, let's talk about some of our longer-term efforts in innovation to help connect the world. With Internet.org, we have a lot of momentum. We've now rolled out free basic Internet services to people in 29 countries and, overall, brought more than 15 million people online. As we've rolled out the program, we've made a number of improvements based on feedback from communities and partners, including opening up our platform for free basic services to all developers who want to build. 
Meanwhile, our work on new technologies to connect people in the most remote regions continues to make progress. This quarter, we revealed Aquila, our first aircraft designed to beam Internet into communities down from the sky. And we also announced a partnership to bring Internet to large parts of sub-Saharan Africa using a satellite, which is launching next year. And with Oculus, we're in a great position to begin delivering a new generation of shared, immersive experiences. We plan to ship the Rift headset early next year. And Gear VR, our mobile product with Samsung, is going to have its first consumer release this holiday season, retailing for $99. And we also announced new partnerships with Minecraft, Netflix and Twitch and many other content partners. Virtual reality has the potential to be the next computing platform that changes all of our lives. It's important also to recognize that this is going to grow slowly, like computers and mobile phones when they first arrived. So we're committed to Oculus and virtual reality for the long term.
So that's how we've continued to make progress on our strategy this quarter. The results we've achieved show that our investments are creating a lot of value for our community and the world. I just want to thank the entire Facebook community, our employees, our partners and our shareholders for helping us to continue moving forward. We've done a lot, but there's always more to do. 
And now I'm going to hand it off to Sheryl."

We had an excellent third quarter. Results were strong across the board. Ad revenue grew 45% year-over-year or 57% on a constant-currency basis.

Ad revenue grew 45% year-over-year or 57% on a constant-currency basis. Mobile ad revenue was $3.4 billion and grew 73% year-over-year. Mobile now makes up 78% of our total advertising revenue. 
Our business grew across all regions and marketer segments. Like last quarter, we saw especially strong growth in our North America and Asia Pacific regions. Overall, we're really pleased with marketer adoption of our ad products around the world.  
Our results show that we continue to make progress on our 3 priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of marketers using our ad products and making our ads more relevant and effective.
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. People have already shifted to mobile, and this shift is driving engagement on Facebook. The average American adult spends 25% of their media time on mobile, and Facebook and Instagram together continue to account for over 1 in 5 minutes on mobile in the U.S. Businesses are lagging behind consumers in making this shift to mobile, and we believe we're well positioned to help them catch up. Facebook Pages are already the mobile solution for millions of businesses. Pages now offer better messaging capabilities, call-to-action buttons, and new sections that enable businesses to highlight important information.
          We're also capitalizing on the shift to mobile by expanding ads on Instagram. This quarter, on Instagram, we introduced new ad formats and objectives, opened up our API and launched self-serve ad capabilities. Instagram ads are now available in all countries where we offer Facebook ads, and marketers can manage campaigns across both platforms with the same targeting. We're really pleased with the marketer demand for Instagram ads.
          Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products. In September, at Adweek, we announced that we have over 2.5 million active advertisers on Facebook. With more than 45 million active SMB Pages on Facebook, we think there's a lot of opportunity to turn even more of these businesses into marketers.
          Marketers come to Facebook and Instagram because we have the best performing mobile ad products, and video is making them even better. Marketers have always loved using videos to tell stories. As Mark discussed, video is a natural and growing part of our mobile News Feed experience. Video on Facebook gives marketers not just mass reach but better cross-device targeting and measurement than, we believe, is available on any other platform. We're especially pleased with the breadth of marketers using video on Facebook, from brands to direct response to SMBs. Over 1.5 million small businesses posted video, which includes organic video posts and video ads, on Facebook in the month of September alone.
          Video ads complement TV ads. According to a recent study with Nielsen Research, marketers using Facebook ads with TV ads have [ph] higher reach, ad recall, brand linkage and likability. To share one example, GMC used video and other ads on Facebook to extend the reach of their TV brand campaign highlighting their premium trucks and SUVs. The Facebook campaign drove a 13-point lift in ad recall and a 6-point lift in brand favorability. 
We recently introduced Target Rating Point, TRP Buying, so that marketers can plan, buy and measure video ads on Facebook the same way they do on TV. We're pleased with the feedback we're receiving on this from marketers and agencies.
          Our third priority is making our ads more relevant and effective. We know relevant ads are more engaging for people, and therefore, drive better results for businesses. Products like carousel ads and dynamic product ads help improve effectiveness for marketers. Carousel ads show multiple images, and now videos, and drive 30% to 50% lower cost per conversion than single-image link ads. Dynamic product ads, which allow marketers to upload their product catalogs, are driving ROI comparable to search. For example, Marriott uses DPA to retarget travelers based on their travel search habits, and they are now scaling globally across their portfolio of brands. LatAm [ph] e-commerce company MercadoLibre uses DPA to remarket over 38 million products in over 13 countries. Both are seeing high ROI and continuing to invest.
          On the measurement side, conversion lift is helping clients see the real business results from their campaigns. This mobile [ph] of Sprint brands showed ads to people eligible for device upgrades. Using conversion lift, they were able to attribute a 4% lift in in-store sales through their Facebook campaign. 
Finally, we're continuing to invest in ad tech across outlets LiveRail and the Audience Network. This quarter, we expanded the ad formats publishers in the Audience Network can add to their mobile apps. On LiveRail, this quarter, we began testing age and gender targeting. LiveRail can now deliver over 90% accuracy on age and gender segments across desktop, mobile web and mobile apps versus the nontarget rate of only 31% to 55% when not using LiveRail technology.
          I want to take a moment to thank our clients around the world for their continued partnership and congratulate our global Facebook teams on great execution. Looking forward, we're going to stay focused on our priorities to continue to build a solid foundation for our long-term business.
          Now here's Dave."

Echoing Mark and Sheryl's comments, Q3 was another strong quarter for Facebook. We generated $4.5 billion in revenue and over $1.4 billion in free cash flow. 
Growth and engagement of our community again provided a great platform for our strong financial performance this quarter. In September, we reached a new milestone, with over 1 billion people using Facebook on an average day, an increase of 17% compared to last year. This daily number represents 65% of the 1.55 billion people who used Facebook during the month of September.
          Mobile continued to drive our growth. In September, approximately 1.39 billion people accessed Facebook on mobile devices, up 23% from last year. Additionally, our next generation of services continued to grow, with Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp now exceeding 400 million, 700 million and 900 million monthly actives, respectively.
Now turning to the financials. All of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Additionally, our non-GAAP measures exclude stock-based compensation and the amortization of intangibles.
Total revenue was $4.5 billion, up 41% or 51% on a constant-currency basis. Ad revenue was $4.3 billion, up 45% or 57% on a constant-currency basis. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar continued to have an unfavorable impact on our revenue in Q3. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q3 2014 levels, our total revenue would have been approximately $340 million higher.
Regionally, U.S. and Canada and Asia Pacific were our strongest markets, producing ad revenue growth of 56% and 48%, respectively. Europe and rest of world grew more slowly at 33% and 29%, respectively, impacted by our currency exposure in both of those regions.
As Sheryl mentioned, mobile continued to drive our revenue growth. Mobile ad revenue was $3.4 billion, up 73% from last year, representing 78% of our advertising revenue. Revenue from ads served on personal computers was down approximately 8%.
We have been very pleased with the sustained high growth of mobile advertising revenue. There are a number of important factors contributing to that growth, both from the supply and demand side. The drivers of year-over-year mobile revenue growth fell into 3 main categories: First, as Sheryl covered, we have continued to have success driving strong advertiser demand; second, we've grown both the number of people using Facebook and the time that they spend with us; and third, the growth in advertiser demand and ad quality has enabled us to increase ad load over time.  As we have grown mobile advertising, we have remained very pleased with overall engagement levels, user satisfaction with News Feed and the overall quality of the ads themselves.
Turning now to our overall price volume metrics. In Q3, the average price per ad increased 61%, while total ad impressions declined 10% on a year-over-year basis. As I've indicated on prior calls, the changes in our reported price volume metrics have been driven recently by the change in the number of right-hand column ads and the shift to mobile. These factors will have a less significant impact on the reported price volume metrics going forward now that a full year has elapsed since the redesign of right-hand column ads and now that mobile impressions have grown to become the majority of impressions. In fact, the quarter-over-quarter trends already point to that. In Q3, total ad impressions increased 7% sequentially and average price per ad increased 5%.
Total payments and other fees revenue was $202 million, down 18% compared to last year. The decline was expected and was driven by a reduction in payments revenue related to games played on personal computers.
Turning now to expenses. Our Q3 total GAAP expenses were $3 billion, up 68%, and non-GAAP expenses were $2.1 billion, up 51%. Similar to last quarter, stock-based compensation and amortization expenses related to the WhatsApp acquisition contributed significantly to the year-over-year growth in GAAP expenses. Non-GAAP expenses were driven by increases in headcount-related costs, cost of revenue and marketing expenses.
We ended Q3 with nearly 12,000 employees, up 44% compared to last year. We added over 1,000 employees to Facebook in the quarter, and we are pleased with the continued strength in our recruiting efforts. 
Our Q3 GAAP operating income was approximately $1.5 billion, representing a 32% operating margin. Our non-GAAP operating income was $2.4 billion, representing a 54% margin.
Our Q3 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 37% and 32%, respectively. Our Q3 GAAP net income was $896 million or $0.31 per share, and our non-GAAP net income was $1.6 billion or $0.57 per share.
In Q3, capital expenditures were $780 million as we continued to invest in servers, network infrastructure and the buildout of data centers and other facilities to support the rapid growth of the business. We generated $1.4 billion of free cash flow and ended the quarter with over $15.8 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the revenue outlook. We remain focused on growing the number of people who use our services, increasing advertiser demand and improving the quality and relevance of our ads. Across these dimensions, we continue to see healthy growth opportunities ahead for Facebook and Instagram. Given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the past year, we will continue to face currency headwinds next quarter, particularly in Europe and Latin America.  In addition, we expect our total payments and other fees revenues to decline sequentially from Q3 to Q4, similar to the trend that we have experienced over the last couple of quarters.
Now turning to the expense outlook. We expect the year-over-year growth rate for total full year 2015 GAAP expenses to be approximately 55% and for total full year non-GAAP expenses to be approximately 50%.
We anticipate our 2015 capital expenditures will be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. We continue to expect our 2015 stock-based compensation to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.2 billion, approximately half of which is related to our prior acquisitions, most notably WhatsApp. We expect amortization expenses for the full year 2015 to be approximately $700 million to $800 million. And lastly, we anticipate our Q4 and full year 2015 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be several percentage points above their respective Q3 rates.
In summary, Q3 was another strong quarter for Facebook. We are pleased with the growth and engagement of our community and the momentum in our business, which, together, support our ability to continue investing to build our next generation of services and execute on our mission of connecting the world.
With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions."

So the first thing that I want to stress here is that these kind of new platforms take a long time to develop. So we've said often that we think that virtual reality and augmented reality could be the next big computing platform. But just to put that in perspective and compare it to the development of previous computing platforms like phones and computers, I mean, the first smartphones came out in 2003. And in the first year, I think, BlackBerry and Palm Treo were the initial smartphones that came out. I think that they each sold in the hundreds of thousands of units. So just to kind of give a sense of the time frame that we're thinking about this and how we expect this to develop, that's kind of how we're thinking about that. The -- in terms of the actual content, first, we think gaming is going to be the most obvious market. There are around, I think, more than 200 million, almost 250 million people who have either an Xbox, a PlayStation or a Wii, and we think that, that audience is going to be the type of people who are going to be very excited about the type of experiences, initially, that you can have with virtual reality. And the advantage of that is also that some of those can be single-player experiences. They don't require a big network effect are a lot of people having the technology or a large installed base. Once we start getting a bit further along with that, then, the next thing that we think is going to be huge is video and immersive experiences, both things that people can create, like the social content that they share on Facebook today, and more professional and premium content, both short form and longer form. But we'll start to see some experimentation with that. And there already is some very good content. But until there are millions of units out in the market, I don't expect that to be a big industry, for folks to be investing a huge amount in, in 2016. Then, when they're starting to get to be more units, just like every other major computing platform before that, what we kind of expect is that a large portion of what people do in it will be communication and social behavior. And that's where Facebook really has the DNA and experience to build the best experiences, and we're investing in trying to figure out what that's going to look like, and that's ultimately a lot of what we're extremely excited about for a number of years down the road."

And what we bring to this is a common ad infrastructure. So Instagram ads, now that we've rolled out as we have this past quarter, and gotten to a really good product offering, combine the creative format of Instagram which is very visually compelling and has a lot of engagement from people with the back-end infrastructure and marketer base that Facebook has. So now we have self-service ads rolled out. We've rolled it out in all countries where we offer Facebook ads. We have new ad formats for Instagram. We're able to do more business objectives. All of which can use the same targeting as we have on Facebook, and all of which are increasingly tapping into our measurment capabilities. On ad load, we have a lot of experience rolling out ads into fee-based products, and we monitor it very carefully, and we're going to continue to monitor really carefully. We're also excited about how they work together. Just to share one example, American Express, working with Digitas, rolled out carousel ads on Instagram that targeted travel-related interest groups for people who are 18 years and older. They then retargeted those same people on Facebook. And what they created was a really visual journey, using both the format that is Instagram, the format that is Facebook, and combining the 2 platforms that they're targeting. We think we're at the very beginning of what's possible when we combine these 2."

Some clients are comfortable with Instagram and bringing a new budget to bear. Some clients are shifting some of their Facebook budget. For us, in the medium to long run, we believe that we're not competing between Facebook and Instagram. We are competing with other forms of media. And if you want the most eyeballs and, we think, the highest ROI, over time, we think that will benefit Facebook and Instagram. And so for us, what we really want is people to experiment and learn and get to experience Instagram as they have on Facebook, so that we can make the case and prove the ROI, and then, we believe, if you look at the consumer metrics of where people were spending their time, we will be able to gain share compared to almost anything else you can buy out there."

They discover something interesting that they weren't necessarily looking for previously. That's very powerful, because that's a behavior that there isn't really anywhere else to do at scale on the Internet today in a great way. And then, people watch it there or they bookmark it to watch later. But if you're talking about watching in line in Feed, that's not the place where you're necessarily going to see a TV show and then watch an hour-long clip right there. So what we're actually seeing is that a lot of the best -- or at least, from my perspective, TV shows that -- we see folks like Jimmy Fallon breaking up their show into clips that they can now share to be consumed over social media and on the Internet in 3- to 5- or 7-minute segments, which are more of what people want when browsing through News Feed. So I do think, over time, we will get to more different types of content and we'll build products that serve that. The current market of trying to help people share and experience all these shorter-form clips is massive. We are nowhere near serving that as well as we want to. So I actually think, in a lot of ways, though, the more interesting question is not, in the near term, what we're going to do to develop ways to consume long-form content, but what traditional media and content producers who have traditionally produced short -- long-form content are going to do to chunk their stuff up better, so that way, it can be more easily consumed by this big community online."

So India is a unique country, where there are 1.25 billion people. More than 1 billion of them are not on the Internet. So it is the country in the world that benefits the most from connectivity. And there's a lot of research that we've seen and reports that third parties have put out that show that when you connect a place like India, it makes a very big difference socially and for the economy there. I mean, a lot of us here, everyone we know is on the Internet, and we kind of think about the Internet as entertainment and basic communication. But if you don't have access to a good school, then getting basic Internet access could be your best educational information. Or if you don't have access to a good doctor, then getting access to the Internet could be the only way that you can learn about how to avoid certain diseases or how to raise your kids and help them avoid certain diseases and find jobs and a lot of stuff. So what we find through the research is that for every 10 people who get connected to the Internet, just a little less than or right around 1 person gets lifted out of poverty and 1 new job gets created. So we're very focused on this. It's a huge priority for the Indian government. And anything that we can do to help there, we'll -- we think is very good for the world, and we're invested in that and we're happy to support. So in Internet.org in India now, there are already more than 1 million people who are -- who now have access to the Internet, who didn't otherwise, because of our efforts. So we're proud of that, but obviously, that's still very early on. We're only working with one operator currently and part of the country. So there's a lot of room to expand that. And that's just a big opportunity for the Internet overall and for India over the next decade, and we hope to play a role in that. On China, that is a more complex situation. Obviously, you can't have a mission of wanting to connect everyone in the world and leave out the biggest country. So over the long term, that is a situation that we will need to try to figure out a way forward on. For now, the thing that I would kind of leave you with is that people think that Facebook isn't in China at all, and that's actually not true. Our consumer service isn't active there, but it actually is already one of the biggest advertising markets that we have. Because there are a lot of really big and important Chinese companies who sell a lot of products to people outside of China, and they use Facebook as one of their primary tools, in a lot of cases, to spread information about what they're doing and grow their customer base. So we're happy to do whatever we can to help develop the economies in both of those countries, and they're both long-term efforts for us."

So I can talk to the multi-app question first. So we view the social space as almost as a matrix. You can think about it as a 2-dimensional kind of grid where there's one axis is all -- the richness of the content that people want to share, then the other axis is the size of the audience or intimacy of how people want to share. So on the first axis, you get everything ranging from text to links to photos and videos, to immersive 360 videos and virtual reality content and kind of this progression. And on the others axis, you've got everything ranging from one-to-one messaging to small group communication to communicating with all your friends at once to big interest groups that are completely public. And what we believe is that you can intersect at any point on that, right? So and there will be something interesting to build, right? So a small group product for sharing video. That's like -- that's going to be a thing. A one-on-one product for sharing text or calling, that's clearly a thing, right? A public sharing and consumption product for video, that's a thing. And what we've tried to do is basically figure out the areas that we think are open and are not currently served by the set of products that the industry has built and figure out a way to offer those. So one of the big opportunities that I'm really excited about right now is, I think that there's a pretty big opening between very private messaging, kind of the one-on-one messaging products like Messenger and WhatsApp, and products like Facebook, where you share with all your friends at once or Instagram, and in between there, what we're seeing is this huge growth of private groups, right? And Groups remains one of the, I think, least talked about products on Facebook, but I just said earlier that we have -- more than 900 million people are using that every month. I mean, it's a huge thing, and it's a big area that we can develop going forward. So we experiment with all these things in terms of some of them make sense to naturally have inside the Facebook app because you're using the same set of friends and network and connections. Some of them get clear value by being separate, like Messenger, for example, where we can make sure that everyone has their push notifications turned on, which is extremely important for a messaging app. But overall, there's just a lot of stuff in this space, and the amount that people want to share and communicate is boundless. And that's, I think, partially why we're seeing the growth that we are with so many of these products."

In the United States, which is usually the most advanced market, 35% of small businesses have no web presence at all. And building a mobile presence is even harder than a web presence because most people don't use the mobile web and mobile apps are expensive to build and hard to get people to use, especially if you're a small business. That's why there are 45 million SMB Pages on Facebook. These are people who are using Facebook and this free product to create an online and, increasingly, a mobile presence. And then, our job is to make sure that free product works for them, and then, over time, bring them into our paid products. We have 2.5 million advertisers, and over 80% of them started on Pages and then started with simplified ad products, and that's what we've done over time, and we'll continue to do that. And what you see is that it's as easy for them to use it as profile, and we can give them opportunities to do things they otherwise couldn't do. So to what I said in my transcript before, 1.5 million SMBs posting videos in 1 month alone. 1.5 million SMBs have not posted or created video on any other platform, but with us, it's cheap, it's very easy to use, and that gives us a way to continue to work with SMBs and increasingly grow our business with them."

So you're definitely right that there's a certain class of content which is only going to come onto Facebook if there's a good way to compensate the content owners for that. And we've recently rolled out the business model for this, which is, for premium content, we'll give a revenue share on a portion of the views to the content owners. And we've got good feedback so far on that. We're working with a small set of partners to start, and we'll roll it out beyond that as that keeps on going. But it's important to keep in mind that there are a few different reasons why people share content on Facebook, and that's just one of the use cases, right? So the -- there are a lot of people who are just sharing content socially, right, because they want to get a message out, that may not be business motivated. There are a lot of folks who are business motivated, but who primarily post content in order to promote something or gain distribution for something. And that -- you can gain value without some kind of rev share, and that's why the video ecosystem has grown so quickly even before we rolled out a revenue share. And now the third class of content, which, I think, is going to be important and increasingly important over time, is the one that you basically want to essentially trade the content for money, and that is one where you need the rev share to unlock that. But we're getting good feedback on that upfront. So we're looking forward to seeing how that trends."

We've also worked on brand awareness optimization, mobile polling to measure campaign effectiveness, and we're working client by client. Our other segments are growing as well. We're working hard in the direct response area, rolling out things like carousel ads and dynamic product ads. And one thing that's worth understanding is that all of these different marketer segments often work together. So to share one example, IKEA wanted to boost their online sales when their stores were closed. So in Norway, most retailers are closed Saturday to Sunday night. So they invested in carousel ads and only showed them when their stores were closed. And they turned a $35,000 investment in carousel ads into $2 million in sales, which happened precisely when they wanted to happen. That's a direct response ad buy because it's a very specific carousel ads product. But it's also a brand play for them as they strengthen their brand and get people to interact with them as they want them to."

And we'll continue to be focusing on a number of initiatives, public content and just sharing with your friends. So there's lots that we are working on, on engagement to continue to drive time spent. On WhatsApp, I don't think there's a particular magical number with 1 billion users. The focus, really, for our messaging products is to continue to drive user growth and continue to build great products that are fast, useful, engaging and fun. And on that front, they're both doing great. Messenger has over 700 million users and WhatsApp obviously has over 900 million users. So the business focus -- the business side is not the main focus right now, but we believe there are going to be opportunities as we further scale those properties."

The guiding principle for us on this is that we want to give the most voice to the most people. And the idea is that there are all these different barriers that any given person has to being able to share and express everything that they want. From technical barriers, right, it's really hard to communicate with someone if you're not on the Internet and they're far away; to product barriers, it's hard to share videos if we don't have a good product for sharing videos; to legal barriers, right, it's hard to share content that your government says is illegal for you to share. And at the end of the day, there's also policy. You're in a community, and we have community standards for how we think people should communicate in order to be safe, right? Because even if you have all of the Internet connectivity and the products and the legal framework that you need, if you don't feel safe saying what you want to express, then you're probably not going to share it, right? And we see a lot of that online, and that's a pretty big issue, right? From -- everything from bullying to terrorism, there are lots of reasons why people might otherwise have the tools to share what they would want but feel kind of silenced. And that isn't giving the most voice to the most people. So we feel a responsibility to have policies for our community which limit hate speech and limit things which are going to create just an overwhelmingly uncomfortable environment for people that is going to silence other people's speech in order to make sure that, over the long term, we are enabling the most people to be able to express as much as possible as they can. And that's the philosophy that we have."

If they do, we ask them why they're X-ing out the ad. And we just continue to monitor the metrics. We're pleased with what's happened with quality on our platform overall. And a lot of the product innovations and investments I've been talking about on this call feed into quality. So the carousel ads, they're not just that they're showing multiple products. It's that they're showing products that are more specifically directed at the person. And so a lot of the underlying things we do to build our ad systems don't just feed into revenue, they feed into quality. And that's important because, over the long run, our quality today is our revenue tomorrow."

So on search, we already have one very big use case, which is people basically using our search engine to look up Pages and people who are on Facebook. And that, by itself, is already one of the biggest search engines in the world. The next big use case that we've really been working on for a couple of years now and, I think, is going to -- is starting to roll out and is growing quickly is people finding content on Facebook. So that's trending. It's people finding posts that their friends or others had posted on News Feed that they saw, but then, might want to go check out later. And I think this is going to be a very important part of the video experience as well, because 1/2 is push, right, going to News Feed and not asking for content, but just coming across and discovering it. And then, the other half is pull, right, and going to some experience where you're asking for some type of content. And getting to a point where we can do that very well is just going to add a whole new dimension to the service. So that's something I remain very excited about. In some ways, it's taken a little bit longer than I had expected to get to a point where it's growing quickly. The people and Page lookup part is doing very well. The Post part has taken a bit longer, but I'm very excited about that going forward. In terms of news, I mean, the biggest issue with news today in Facebook is that it is the slowest part of the experience, right? I mean, you go to load a video and it loads quickly. We made it autoplay to load even quicker. You tap on a photo, you expect it to expand immediately. But you tap on a link, and often, it can take 10 seconds to load. And if you're on a 2G connection somewhere in the developing world, it could take 30 seconds to load. So the big initiative that we have here, which I'm really excited about, is instant articles. And the big thing that, that does is just it lets publishers basically put the content on our servers ahead of time, and that way, when people tap on it, it loads instantaneously. And it can be a much more immersive experience. And we've already found from the initial experiments that we have done that the engagement is positive, and we're starting to roll that out more broadly. So I think that, that's going to be a really big deal for improving the experience of reading news on Facebook. And it's something that we've been working on for a while and I'm very excited about. So yes, I would expect that we will see an expansion of sharing and consumption of all of the different types of things that you asked about, news, video, search and the different experiences there, and these are some of the big areas that we're investing in. And they're long-term investments, and they're big investments, and we're going to keep on pushing on them. But I think that's what we need to do to serve our community well and, ultimately, connect everyone in the world. So thank you, guys."

This was another good quarter, and we continued to grow the size and engagement of our community. 1.55 billion people now use Facebook every month, and more than 1 billion people use Facebook every day. 
On mobile, we continue to have a lot of momentum. 1.39 billion people now use Facebook on mobile devices, including more than 1 billion on Android. 50 million people also use Facebook Lite, our app for people on low bandwidth connections and one of our fastest-growing interfaces. This is a great sign for how our mobile strategy continues to make progress across markets, devices and platforms. 
When it comes to our business, we're also pleased with our results. This quarter, total revenue reached $4.5 billion and advertising revenue grew by 45% from a year ago. We've already accomplished a lot this year, and these results show how we're getting stronger as a community and as a business. 
But we want to serve the entire global community, not just the people who are on Facebook today. Connecting everyone is one of the fundamental challenges of our time, and to achieve this, we need to continue innovating faster and investing for the long term. That means continuing to invest in our core products and services as well as technologies and strategies that allow us to achieve a truly global reach over time. 
Let's talk about how we're doing this, and let's start with how we're improving our core products to better serve our existing communities and businesses. This quarter, we introduced some big updates on Facebook to give people more options for expressing themselves. We began rolling out an improved mobile profile design, including the ability to add a profile video instead of just a photo. 
We also started testing reactions, a new version of the Like button that provides more ways for expressing love, awe and sympathy. We think this is going to provide a much more engaging experience.
Another way we're working to improve people's experiences on Facebook is by helping them to share many different types of content with different groups of people they care about. One example is our progress with Groups on Facebook. More than 925 million people now use Groups each month, and in some countries, more than half of the population is participating.
For -- from a youth organization in Chicago to aid workers dealing with the refugee crisis in Europe, we've seen many inspiring examples of people using Groups to collaborate. 
Video is another area where we continue to make progress. On average, there are now more than 8 billion daily video views on Facebook and more than 500 million people who are watching daily. To offer even more engaging video experiences, we've added live video to our Mentions app for public figures, and we now support interactive 360 videos in News Feed. We've also rolled out new video tools for Pages and begun testing a dedicated video section on Facebook. 
Over the next few years, video is going to be some of the most engaging content online. And by continuing to innovate here, we have a chance to build the best place to watch and share videos. 
When it comes to serving businesses, we continue to create a lot of value. We now have more than 2.5 million active advertisers on Facebook and more than 45 million small- and medium-sized businesses actively using Facebook Pages. This quarter, we continued to focus on helping marketers achieve results while using our ad products, including video and carousel ads, as well as on Instagram. And as usual, Sheryl can talk more about this in a moment.
Now let's talk about how we're working to develop our next generation of apps and services. For Instagram, this was a busy quarter. The community celebrated its 5-year anniversary and reached a new milestone of 400 million monthly actives. More than 80 million photos are now shared on Instagram every day, and the pace of adoption among public figures, organizations and people around the world continues to grow really well. When President Obama visited Alaska in September, he used Instagram to document his trip. And this is a great example of how Instagram is changing the way that people see the world. 
With our efforts in messaging, we're all so making progress at building WhatsApp and Messenger, both integrate platforms of global scale. Last quarter, WhatsApp reached 900 million monthly actives and continues to be on a path to reach 1 billion people and beyond. 
Messenger has over 700 million monthly actives, and we continue to focus on improving the core messaging experience. A good sign of our progress is the more-than-9.5 billion photos now sent monthly on Messenger. We're also building many different tools that can offer useful experiences to people beyond just your traditional messaging. One example is M, a digital assistant we introduced this quarter that, over time, will use AI to help people complete tasks.
Finally, let's talk about some of our longer-term efforts in innovation to help connect the world. With Internet.org, we have a lot of momentum. We've now rolled out free basic Internet services to people in 29 countries and, overall, brought more than 15 million people online. As we've rolled out the program, we've made a number of improvements based on feedback from communities and partners, including opening up our platform for free basic services to all developers who want to build. 
Meanwhile, our work on new technologies to connect people in the most remote regions continues to make progress. This quarter, we revealed Aquila, our first aircraft designed to beam Internet into communities down from the sky. And we also announced a partnership to bring Internet to large parts of sub-Saharan Africa using a satellite, which is launching next year. And with Oculus, we're in a great position to begin delivering a new generation of shared, immersive experiences. We plan to ship the Rift headset early next year. And Gear VR, our mobile product with Samsung, is going to have its first consumer release this holiday season, retailing for $99. And we also announced new partnerships with Minecraft, Netflix and Twitch and many other content partners. Virtual reality has the potential to be the next computing platform that changes all of our lives. It's important also to recognize that this is going to grow slowly, like computers and mobile phones when they first arrived. So we're committed to Oculus and virtual reality for the long term.
So that's how we've continued to make progress on our strategy this quarter. The results we've achieved show that our investments are creating a lot of value for our community and the world.

Ad revenue grew 45% year-over-year or 57% on a constant-currency basis. Mobile ad revenue was $3.4 billion and grew 73% year-over-year. Mobile now makes up 78% of our total advertising revenue. 
Our business grew across all regions and marketer segments. Like last quarter, we saw especially strong growth in our North America and Asia Pacific regions. Overall, we're really pleased with marketer adoption of our ad products around the world. 
Our results show that we continue to make progress on our 3 priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of marketers using our ad products and making our ads more relevant and effective.
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. People have already shifted to mobile, and this shift is driving engagement on Facebook. The average American adult spends 25% of their media time on mobile, and Facebook and Instagram together continue to account for over 1 in 5 minutes on mobile in the U.S. Businesses are lagging behind consumers in making this shift to mobile, and we believe we're well positioned to help them catch up. Facebook Pages are already the mobile solution for millions of businesses. Pages now offer better messaging capabilities, call-to-action buttons, and new sections that enable businesses to highlight important information.
We're also capitalizing on the shift to mobile by expanding ads on Instagram. This quarter, on Instagram, we introduced new ad formats and objectives, opened up our API and launched self-serve ad capabilities. Instagram ads are now available in all countries where we offer Facebook ads, and marketers can manage campaigns across both platforms with the same targeting. We're really pleased with the marketer demand for Instagram ads.
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products. In September, at Adweek, we announced that we have over 2.5 million active advertisers on Facebook. With more than 45 million active SMB Pages on Facebook, we think there's a lot of opportunity to turn even more of these businesses into marketers.
Marketers come to Facebook and Instagram because we have the best performing mobile ad products, and video is making them even better. Marketers have always loved using videos to tell stories. As Mark discussed, video is a natural and growing part of our mobile News Feed experience. Video on Facebook gives marketers not just mass reach but better cross-device targeting and measurement than, we believe, is available on any other platform. We're especially pleased with the breadth of marketers using video on Facebook, from brands to direct response to SMBs. Over 1.5 million small businesses posted video, which includes organic video posts and video ads, on Facebook in the month of September alone.
Video ads complement TV ads. According to a recent study with Nielsen Research, marketers using Facebook ads with TV ads have [ph] higher reach, ad recall, brand linkage and likability. To share one example, GMC used video and other ads on Facebook to extend the reach of their TV brand campaign highlighting their premium trucks and SUVs. The Facebook campaign drove a 13-point lift in ad recall and a 6-point lift in brand favorability. 
We recently introduced Target Rating Point, TRP Buying, so that marketers can plan, buy and measure video ads on Facebook the same way they do on TV. We're pleased with the feedback we're receiving on this from marketers and agencies.
Our third priority is making our ads more relevant and effective. We know relevant ads are more engaging for people, and therefore, drive better results for businesses. Products like carousel ads and dynamic product ads help improve effectiveness for marketers. Carousel ads show multiple images, and now videos, and drive 30% to 50% lower cost per conversion than single-image link ads. Dynamic product ads, which allow marketers to upload their product catalogs, are driving ROI comparable to search. For example, Marriott uses DPA to retarget travelers based on their travel search habits, and they are now scaling globally across their portfolio of brands. LatAm [ph] e-commerce company MercadoLibre uses DPA to remarket over 38 million products in over 13 countries. Both are seeing high ROI and continuing to invest.
On the measurement side, conversion lift is helping clients see the real business results from their campaigns. This mobile [ph] of Sprint brands showed ads to people eligible for device upgrades. Using conversion lift, they were able to attribute a 4% lift in in-store sales through their Facebook campaign. 
Finally, we're continuing to invest in ad tech across outlets LiveRail and the Audience Network. This quarter, we expanded the ad formats publishers in the Audience Network can add to their mobile apps. On LiveRail, this quarter, we began testing age and gender targeting. LiveRail can now deliver over 90% accuracy on age and gender segments across desktop, mobile web and mobile apps versus the nontarget rate of only 31% to 55% when not using LiveRail technology.
I want to take a moment to thank our clients around the world for their continued partnership and congratulate our global Facebook teams on great execution. Looking forward, we're going to stay focused on our priorities to continue to build a solid foundation for our long-term business.
Now here's Dave."

Echoing Mark and Sheryl's comments, Q3 was another strong quarter for Facebook. We generated $4.5 billion in revenue and over $1.4 billion in free cash flow. 
Growth and engagement of our community again provided a great platform for our strong financial performance this quarter. In September, we reached a new milestone, with over 1 billion people using Facebook on an average day, an increase of 17% compared to last year. This daily number represents 65% of the 1.55 billion people who used Facebook during the month of September.
Mobile continued to drive our growth. In September, approximately 1.39 billion people accessed Facebook on mobile devices, up 23% from last year. Additionally, our next generation of services continued to grow, with Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp now exceeding 400 million, 700 million and 900 million monthly actives, respectively.
Now turning to the financials. All of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Additionally, our non-GAAP measures exclude stock-based compensation and the amortization of intangibles.
Total revenue was $4.5 billion, up 41% or 51% on a constant-currency basis. Ad revenue was $4.3 billion, up 45% or 57% on a constant-currency basis. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar continued to have an unfavorable impact on our revenue in Q3. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q3 2014 levels, our total revenue would have been approximately $340 million higher.
Regionally, U.S. and Canada and Asia Pacific were our strongest markets, producing ad revenue growth of 56% and 48%, respectively. Europe and rest of world grew more slowly at 33% and 29%, respectively, impacted by our currency exposure in both of those regions.
As Sheryl mentioned, mobile continued to drive our revenue growth. Mobile ad revenue was $3.4 billion, up 73% from last year, representing 78% of our advertising revenue. Revenue from ads served on personal computers was down approximately 8%.
We have been very pleased with the sustained high growth of mobile advertising revenue. There are a number of important factors contributing to that growth, both from the supply and demand side. The drivers of year-over-year mobile revenue growth fell into 3 main categories: First, as Sheryl covered, we have continued to have success driving strong advertiser demand; second, we've grown both the number of people using Facebook and the time that they spend with us; and third, the growth in advertiser demand and ad quality has enabled us to increase ad load over time. As we have grown mobile advertising, we have remained very pleased with overall engagement levels, user satisfaction with News Feed and the overall quality of the ads themselves.
Turning now to our overall price volume metrics. In Q3, the average price per ad increased 61%, while total ad impressions declined 10% on a year-over-year basis. As I've indicated on prior calls, the changes in our reported price volume metrics have been driven recently by the change in the number of right-hand column ads and the shift to mobile. These factors will have a less significant impact on the reported price volume metrics going forward now that a full year has elapsed since the redesign of right-hand column ads and now that mobile impressions have grown to become the majority of impressions. In fact, the quarter-over-quarter trends already point to that. In Q3, total ad impressions increased 7% sequentially and average price per ad increased 5%.
Total payments and other fees revenue was $202 million, down 18% compared to last year. The decline was expected and was driven by a reduction in payments revenue related to games played on personal computers.
Turning now to expenses. Our Q3 total GAAP expenses were $3 billion, up 68%, and non-GAAP expenses were $2.1 billion, up 51%. Similar to last quarter, stock-based compensation and amortization expenses related to the WhatsApp acquisition contributed significantly to the year-over-year growth in GAAP expenses. Non-GAAP expenses were driven by increases in headcount-related costs, cost of revenue and marketing expenses.
We ended Q3 with nearly 12,000 employees, up 44% compared to last year. We added over 1,000 employees to Facebook in the quarter, and we are pleased with the continued strength in our recruiting efforts. 
Our Q3 GAAP operating income was approximately $1.5 billion, representing a 32% operating margin. Our non-GAAP operating income was $2.4 billion, representing a 54% margin.
Our Q3 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 37% and 32%, respectively. Our Q3 GAAP net income was $896 million or $0.31 per share, and our non-GAAP net income was $1.6 billion or $0.57 per share.
In Q3, capital expenditures were $780 million as we continued to invest in servers, network infrastructure and the buildout of data centers and other facilities to support the rapid growth of the business. We generated $1.4 billion of free cash flow and ended the quarter with over $15.8 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the revenue outlook. We remain focused on growing the number of people who use our services, increasing advertiser demand and improving the quality and relevance of our ads. Across these dimensions, we continue to see healthy growth opportunities ahead for Facebook and Instagram. Given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the past year, we will continue to face currency headwinds next quarter, particularly in Europe and Latin America. In addition, we expect our total payments and other fees revenues to decline sequentially from Q3 to Q4, similar to the trend that we have experienced over the last couple of quarters.
Now turning to the expense outlook. We expect the year-over-year growth rate for total full year 2015 GAAP expenses to be approximately 55% and for total full year non-GAAP expenses to be approximately 50%.
We anticipate our 2015 capital expenditures will be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. We continue to expect our 2015 stock-based compensation to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.2 billion, approximately half of which is related to our prior acquisitions, most notably WhatsApp. We expect amortization expenses for the full year 2015 to be approximately $700 million to $800 million. And lastly, we anticipate our Q4 and full year 2015 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be several percentage points above their respective Q3 rates.
In summary, Q3 was another strong quarter for Facebook. We are pleased with the growth and engagement of our community and the momentum in our business, which, together, support our ability to continue investing to build our next generation of services and execute on our mission of connecting the world.

So the first thing that I want to stress here is that these kind of new platforms take a long time to develop. So we've said often that we think that virtual reality and augmented reality could be the next big computing platform. But just to put that in perspective and compare it to the development of previous computing platforms like phones and computers, I mean, the first smartphones came out in 2003. And in the first year, I think, BlackBerry and Palm Treo were the initial smartphones that came out. I think that they each sold in the hundreds of thousands of units. So just to kind of give a sense of the time frame that we're thinking about this and how we expect this to develop, that's kind of how we're thinking about that. The -- in terms of the actual content, first, we think gaming is going to be the most obvious market. There are around, I think, more than 200 million, almost 250 million people who have either an Xbox, a PlayStation or a Wii, and we think that, that audience is going to be the type of people who are going to be very excited about the type of experiences, initially, that you can have with virtual reality. And the advantage of that is also that some of those can be single-player experiences. They don't require a big network effect are a lot of people having the technology or a large installed base. Once we start getting a bit further along with that, then, the next thing that we think is going to be huge is video and immersive experiences, both things that people can create, like the social content that they share on Facebook today, and more professional and premium content, both short form and longer form. But we'll start to see some experimentation with that. And there already is some very good content. But until there are millions of units out in the market, I don't expect that to be a big industry, for folks to be investing a huge amount in, in 2016. Then, when they're starting to get to be more units, just like every other major computing platform before that, what we kind of expect is that a large portion of what people do in it will be communication and social behavior. And that's where Facebook really has the DNA and experience to build the best experiences, and we're investing in trying to figure out what that's going to look like, and that's ultimately a lot of what we're extremely excited about for a number of years down the road."

And what we bring to this is a common ad infrastructure. So Instagram ads, now that we've rolled out as we have this past quarter, and gotten to a really good product offering, combine the creative format of Instagram which is very visually compelling and has a lot of engagement from people with the back-end infrastructure and marketer base that Facebook has. So now we have self-service ads rolled out. We've rolled it out in all countries where we offer Facebook ads. We have new ad formats for Instagram. We're able to do more business objectives. All of which can use the same targeting as we have on Facebook, and all of which are increasingly tapping into our measurement capabilities. On ad load, we have a lot of experience rolling out ads into fee-based products, and we monitor it very carefully, and we're going to continue to monitor really carefully. We're also excited about how they work together. Just to share one example, American Express, working with Digitas, rolled out carousel ads on Instagram that targeted travel-related interest groups for people who are 18 years and older. They then retargeted those same people on Facebook. And what they created was a really visual journey, using both the format that is Instagram, the format that is Facebook, and combining the 2 platforms that they're targeting. We think we're at the very beginning of what's possible when we combine these 2."

And if you want the most eyeballs and, we think, the highest ROI, over time, we think that will benefit Facebook and Instagram. And so for us, what we really want is people to experiment and learn and get to experience Instagram as they have on Facebook, so that we can make the case and prove the ROI, and then, we believe, if you look at the consumer metrics of where people were spending their time, we will be able to gain share compared to almost anything else you can buy out there."

They discover something interesting that they weren't necessarily looking for previously. That's very powerful, because that's a behavior that there isn't really anywhere else to do at scale on the Internet today in a great way. And then, people watch it there or they bookmark it to watch later. But if you're talking about watching in line in Feed, that's not the place where you're necessarily going to see a TV show and then watch an hour-long clip right there. So what we're actually seeing is that a lot of the best -- or at least, from my perspective, TV shows that -- we see folks like Jimmy Fallon breaking up their show into clips that they can now share to be consumed over social media and on the Internet in 3- to 5- or 7-minute segments, which are more of what people want when browsing through News Feed. So I do think, over time, we will get to more different types of content and we'll build products that serve that. The current market of trying to help people share and experience all these shorter-form clips is massive. We are nowhere near serving that as well as we want to. So I actually think, in a lot of ways, though, the more interesting question is not, in the near term, what we're going to do to develop ways to consume long-form content, but what traditional media and content producers who have traditionally produced short -- long-form content are going to do to chunk their stuff up better, so that way, it can be more easily consumed by this big community online."

So India is a unique country, where there are 1.25 billion people. More than 1 billion of them are not on the Internet. So it is the country in the world that benefits the most from connectivity. And there's a lot of research that we've seen and reports that third parties have put out that show that when you connect a place like India, it makes a very big difference socially and for the economy there. I mean, a lot of us here, everyone we know is on the Internet, and we kind of think about the Internet as entertainment and basic communication. But if you don't have access to a good school, then getting basic Internet access could be your best educational information. Or if you don't have access to a good doctor, then getting access to the Internet could be the only way that you can learn about how to avoid certain diseases or how to raise your kids and help them avoid certain diseases and find jobs and a lot of stuff. So what we find through the research is that for every 10 people who get connected to the Internet, just a little less than or right around 1 person gets lifted out of poverty and 1 new job gets created. So we're very focused on this. It's a huge priority for the Indian government. And anything that we can do to help there, we'll -- we think is very good for the world, and we're invested in that and we're happy to support. So in Internet.org in India now, there are already more than 1 million people who are -- who now have access to the Internet, who didn't otherwise, because of our efforts. So we're proud of that, but obviously, that's still very early on. We're only working with one operator currently and part of the country. So there's a lot of room to expand that. And that's just a big opportunity for the Internet overall and for India over the next decade, and we hope to play a role in that. On China, that is a more complex situation. Obviously, you can't have a mission of wanting to connect everyone in the world and leave out the biggest country. So over the long term, that is a situation that we will need to try to figure out a way forward on. For now, the thing that I would kind of leave you with is that people think that Facebook isn't in China at all, and that's actually not true. Our consumer service isn't active there, but it actually is already one of the biggest advertising markets that we have. Because there are a lot of really big and important Chinese companies who sell a lot of products to people outside of China, and they use Facebook as one of their primary tools, in a lot of cases, to spread information about what they're doing and grow their customer base. So we're happy to do whatever we can to help develop the economies in both of those countries, and they're both long-term efforts for us."

So I can talk to the multi-app question first. So we view the social space as almost as a matrix. You can think about it as a 2-dimensional kind of grid where there's one axis is all -- the richness of the content that people want to share, then the other axis is the size of the audience or intimacy of how people want to share. So on the first axis, you get everything ranging from text to links to photos and videos, to immersive 360 videos and virtual reality content and kind of this progression. And on the others axis, you've got everything ranging from one-to-one messaging to small group communication to communicating with all your friends at once to big interest groups that are completely public. And what we believe is that you can intersect at any point on that, right? So and there will be something interesting to build, right? So a small group product for sharing video. That's like -- that's going to be a thing. A one-on-one product for sharing text or calling, that's clearly a thing, right? A public sharing and consumption product for video, that's a thing. And what we've tried to do is basically figure out the areas that we think are open and are not currently served by the set of products that the industry has built and figure out a way to offer those. So one of the big opportunities that I'm really excited about right now is, I think that there's a pretty big opening between very private messaging, kind of the one-on-one messaging products like Messenger and WhatsApp, and products like Facebook, where you share with all your friends at once or Instagram, and in between there, what we're seeing is this huge growth of private groups, right? And Groups remains one of the, I think, least talked about products on Facebook, but I just said earlier that we have -- more than 900 million people are using that every month. I mean, it's a huge thing, and it's a big area that we can develop going forward. So we experiment with all these things in terms of some of them make sense to naturally have inside the Facebook app because you're using the same set of friends and network and connections. Some of them get clear value by being separate, like Messenger, for example, where we can make sure that everyone has their push notifications turned on, which is extremely important for a messaging app. But overall, there's just a lot of stuff in this space, and the amount that people want to share and communicate is boundless. And that's, I think, partially why we're seeing the growth that we are with so many of these products."

In the United States, which is usually the most advanced market, 35% of small businesses have no web presence at all. And building a mobile presence is even harder than a web presence because most people don't use the mobile web and mobile apps are expensive to build and hard to get people to use, especially if you're a small business. That's why there are 45 million SMB Pages on Facebook. These are people who are using Facebook and this free product to create an online and, increasingly, a mobile presence. And then, our job is to make sure that free product works for them, and then, over time, bring them into our paid products. We have 2.5 million advertisers, and over 80% of them started on Pages and then started with simplified ad products, and that's what we've done over time, and we'll continue to do that. And what you see is that it's as easy for them to use it as profile, and we can give them opportunities to do things they otherwise couldn't do. So to what I said in my transcript before, 1.5 million SMBs posting videos in 1 month alone. 1.5 million SMBs have not posted or created video on any other platform, but with us, it's cheap, it's very easy to use, and that gives us a way to continue to work with SMBs and increasingly grow our business with them."

So between January 1 and October 7 of this year, over 68 million people on Facebook in the U.S. made over 1 billion interactions about the campaign alone, and every candidate -- and every member of Congress is on Facebook now. In terms of the revenue impact, no one vertical drives our business. We have a very large and diversified business. But we think we offer something pretty compelling, which is the reach of Facebook with very unique targeting. So on Facebook, you can target an ad by district, by interest. Ben Carson ran 240 different ads targeted at different audiences. And so we're starting to see candidates use our platform to communicate, to advertise and to share."

So the follow-up question that I would have is, how do you think you could best partner with the media providers and convince them the merits of bringing their valuable, in some cases expensive, content into the Facebook world, particularly at a time in media when they're really trying hard to guard their own existing ecosystems? And then, a question for Sheryl. I wondered if you could just touch on the relative growth of branded advertising versus direct response ads. You mentioned Total Ratings Point Buying. Can you help us think about the mix of branded versus DR? And for you, do you think that TRP Buying in video is going to shift your ad mix more towards branded over time?"

So you're definitely right that there's a certain class of content which is only going to come onto Facebook if there's a good way to compensate the content owners for that. And we've recently rolled out the business model for this, which is, for premium content, we'll give a revenue share on a portion of the views to the content owners. And we've got good feedback so far on that. We're working with a small set of partners to start, and we'll roll it out beyond that as that keeps on going. But it's important to keep in mind that there are a few different reasons why people share content on Facebook, and that's just one of the use cases, right? So the -- there are a lot of people who are just sharing content socially, right, because they want to get a message out, that may not be business motivated. There are a lot of folks who are business motivated, but who primarily post content in order to promote something or gain distribution for something. And that -- you can gain value without some kind of rev share, and that's why the video ecosystem has grown so quickly even before we rolled out a revenue share. And now the third class of content, which, I think, is going to be important and increasingly important over time, is the one that you basically want to essentially trade the content for money, and that is one where you need the rev share to unlock that. But we're getting good feedback on that upfront. So we're looking forward to seeing how that trends."

So we've worked hard on things that will help brand purchasers feel comfortable on the platform and measure their ROI. So that's where TRP Buying comes in, allowing people who usually buy TV ads to plan, buy, measure Facebook ads the same way, enables an apples-to-apples comparison that we believe is very strong for RROI. We've also worked on brand awareness optimization, mobile polling to measure campaign effectiveness, and we're working client by client. Our other segments are growing as well. We're working hard in the direct response area, rolling out things like carousel ads and dynamic product ads. And one thing that's worth understanding is that all of these different marketer segments often work together. So to share one example, IKEA wanted to boost their online sales when their stores were closed. So in Norway, most retailers are closed Saturday to Sunday night. So they invested in carousel ads and only showed them when their stores were closed. And they turned a $35,000 investment in carousel ads into $2 million in sales, which happened precisely when they wanted to happen. That's a direct response ad buy because it's a very specific carousel ads product. But it's also a brand play for them as they strengthen their brand and get people to interact with them as they want them to."

The guiding principle for us on this is that we want to give the most voice to the most people. And the idea is that there are all these different barriers that any given person has to being able to share and express everything that they want. From technical barriers, right, it's really hard to communicate with someone if you're not on the Internet and they're far away; to product barriers, it's hard to share videos if we don't have a good product for sharing videos; to legal barriers, right, it's hard to share content that your government says is illegal for you to share. And at the end of the day, there's also policy. You're in a community, and we have community standards for how we think people should communicate in order to be safe, right? Because even if you have all of the Internet connectivity and the products and the legal framework that you need, if you don't feel safe saying what you want to express, then you're probably not going to share it, right? And we see a lot of that online, and that's a pretty big issue, right? From -- everything from bullying to terrorism, there are lots of reasons why people might otherwise have the tools to share what they would want but feel kind of silenced. And that isn't giving the most voice to the most people. So we feel a responsibility to have policies for our community which limit hate speech and limit things which are going to create just an overwhelmingly uncomfortable environment for people that is going to silence other people's speech in order to make sure that, over the long term, we are enabling the most people to be able to express as much as possible as they can.

If you're trying to sell a direct product, then you want to use DPA ads. And all of these products and all of the underlying targeting, like Custom Audiences, are designed to help people meet different objectives. And we're trying to be really clear on that. If you're trying to move a brand objective, if you want to move favorability or brand sentiment, we can do that. And that's often a video ad or one of our branded ads, or you optimize for brand awareness. If you're trying to sell a product, you might want to use carousel ads or dynamic product ads. And the targeting, that is Custom Audiences, underlies all of our product offerings. So our goal is to have lots of different things we can do for our marketers and measure them really deeply all the way through to business results. So..."

So on search, we already have one very big use case, which is people basically using our search engine to look up Pages and people who are on Facebook.

So on search, we already have one very big use case, which is people basically using our search engine to look up Pages and people who are on Facebook. And that, by itself, is already one of the biggest search engines in the world. The next big use case that we've really been working on for a couple of years now and, I think, is going to -- is starting to roll out and is growing quickly is people finding content on Facebook. So that's trending. It's people finding posts that their friends or others had posted on News Feed that they saw, but then, might want to go check out later. And I think this is going to be a very important part of the video experience as well, because 1/2 is push, right, going to News Feed and not asking for content, but just coming across and discovering it. And then, the other half is pull, right, and going to some experience where you're asking for some type of content. And getting to a point where we can do that very well is just going to add a whole new dimension to the service. So that's something I remain very excited about. In some ways, it's taken a little bit longer than I had expected to get to a point where it's growing quickly. The people and Page lookup part is doing very well. The Post part has taken a bit longer, but I'm very excited about that going forward. In terms of news, I mean, the biggest issue with news today in Facebook is that it is the slowest part of the experience, right? I mean, you go to load a video and it loads quickly. We made it autoplay to load even quicker. You tap on a photo, you expect it to expand immediately. But you tap on a link, and often, it can take 10 seconds to load. And if you're on a 2G connection somewhere in the developing world, it could take 30 seconds to load. So the big initiative that we have here, which I'm really excited about, is instant articles. And the big thing that, that does is just it lets publishers basically put the content on our servers ahead of time, and that way, when people tap on it, it loads instantaneously. And it can be a much more immersive experience. And we've already found from the initial experiments that we have done that the engagement is positive, and we're starting to roll that out more broadly. So I think that, that's going to be a really big deal for improving the experience of reading news on Facebook. And it's something that we've been working on for a while and I'm very excited about. So yes, I would expect that we will see an expansion of sharing and consumption of all of the different types of things that you asked about, news, video, search and the different experiences there, and these are some of the big areas that we're investing in. And they're long-term investments, and they're big investments, and we're going to keep on pushing on them. But I think that's what we need to do to serve our community well and, ultimately, connect everyone in the world. So thank you, guys."
