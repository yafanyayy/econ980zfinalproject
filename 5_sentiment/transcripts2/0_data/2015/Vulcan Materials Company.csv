I'm Tom Hill, President and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan. Joining me today is John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. A slide presentation will accompany this webcast. It will be posted on the company's website at the conclusion of this earnings call.
Before we begin, the actual results and projections, I refer you to Slide 2 of our presentation regarding forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Descriptions of these are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K. 
In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measurements. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of this presentation.
Before we get into details today, I'd like to speak to you about some things that are immensely important to me and our management team. We executed well in 2014, particularly in the fourth quarter and I'm proud of our people and the job they did and we are focused on the future. When I think about the job our people will need to do in 2015, 3 words come to mind: Momentum, execution and discipline. 
Momentum. We're seeing accelerated momentum in demand throughout our markets. Demand in the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations despite our California business being waterlogged, and recall that we are comparing against a strong fourth quarter in 2013. There is accelerating pricing momentum in many of our markets and we are going to reap the benefits of that momentum. The momentum that we've seen thus far, will carry forward through 2015 and likely well beyond. We are going to take every advantage of it.
Execution. Our team, throughout the company, are executing very well. We were pleased with the results detailed in today's press release and these outcomes directly reflect the great efforts of our people at all levels of the business. In particular, I'm proud of how our local businesses have continued to convert incremental revenues into incremental gross profit. We are servicing our customers well and helping them grow while operating our business safely and efficiently. Despite only modest gains in pricing so far, our people are making the most of this initial phase of recovery. They have set the stage for even stronger performance ahead. My personal focus in 2015 and the focus of our management teams will be on pricing improvements, margin expansion, smart uses of capital and safety.
Discipline. We are very well aware that now is the time for continued to discipline, not congratulations or complacency. Our people will continue to show great discipline in the delivery of quality products and services to our customers safely and efficiently, and we will emphasize continued discipline in how we deploy capital and in how we pursue price and margin improvement. We will be highly focused in 2015 on accelerating gains and pricing for our core aggregates business, so we earn a fair and full return from significant investments that we have made in our business. We have made progress. We are not where we need to be. It is also paramount that we continue our disciplined performance and operational excellence and cost control. We will remain extremely disciplined in our use of capital, deploying it to further build on our strategic base of world-class assets while improving our balance sheet and our return on shareholders capital. 
The momentum, execution and discipline that were hallmarks of 2014 will be our watch words as we build an ever stronger business in 2015.
Now let's move onto the rest of the call. You will see that many of these slides line up with those used in our third quarter call. In large part because our focus on driving improved margins and fully capitalizing on the recovery of demand has not changed.
The results on Slide 4, demonstrate the quality of our fourth quarter execution and how we continue the strong conversion of incremental revenues to growth and earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $172 million, a 32% increase. We achieved these results despite a temporary rise in SAG costs as a result of business development and performance-based incentives. Our underlying profitability continue to improve significantly, further measured by margin percentage per unit profit. Earnings per share for the quarter of $0.29, including $0.02 per business development expenses and restructuring costs.
On Slide 5, you can see that our fourth quarter results continue to trend in recent quarters. Looking at full year results, you've seen a 38% gain in gross profit on 8% gain in revenues. That significant increase is due to margin discipline particularly in our core aggregates business and the positive impact on the divestiture of our lower margin concrete and cement businesses in Florida. SAG was up due to the items just mentioned. You will see later that we forecast the decline in SAG going forward. Adjusted EBIT nearly doubled for the year and adjusted EBITDA was up handsomely. For the year, adjusted earnings per share were $0.91, including the Florida divestiture and debt tender offer, earnings per share were $1.56. Now turning to our core aggregates segment.
Slide 6 tells the story of volume growth across Vulcan's footprint in 2014. This growing momentum is driven by strength in private construction activity across all end-use markets and an increasing number of large projects, along with increasing highway demand. These trends gained further momentum in the fourth quarter with shipments growing 15% in total and 12% on a same-store basis, even with the impact of bad weather in California and Georgia. 
For the full year, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Texas and Virginia saw shipments increased by more than 10% on a same-store basis. Aggregates shipments in California and North Carolina also realized solid growth. Shipments in Alabama and South Carolina were down slightly with slower recovery in construction activity in these states.
Now let's talk about how we are converting this momentum and these early gains and demand into expanding margins and profits. Last quarter, we discussed the 3 major profit drivers that we can focus on. 
As you can see on the right-hand side of Slide 7, our industry-leading gross profit per ton increased $0.66 in spite of a modest overall price improvement of $0.21 per ton. Cash gross profit per ton increased to $5.18, 11% gain over a year ago. Our local management teams are doing an outstanding job of turning demand growth into even higher levels of profitability by managing the mix of price, operating efficiencies, sales and products.
This is not a new story for us. As you can see on Slide 8, we have compounded unit profitability faster than pricing for the last 6 quarters. During the last 12 months, our freight adjusted average unit price has increased 2% or $0.25 per ton. Over that same period, our gross profit per ton has increased 18% or $0.52 per ton. Excluding our 2014 acquisitions, trailing 12-month gross profit per ton was up $0.56 or 20%. This is a higher figure than when these operations were producing twice the volume. We are completely focused on ensuring that our unit margins continue to grow.
In speaking to you last quarter about our incremental margin leverage, we discussed our best-in-class incremental flow through that we enjoy with volume growth. Slide 9 depicts incremental margin performance in our aggregate segment. As you can see, incremental gross profit margin for the fourth quarter was 79% excluding the impact of acquisitions completed during the year. 
Aggregates gross profit grew $45 million on incremental freight adjusted revenues of $57 million. Including the impact of acquisitions, the incremental margin was 65%, reduced due to acquisition accounting. Since quarterly figures can be distorted by seasonality or one-time costs, we're also presenting the same metric calculated on a trailing 12-month basis. We encourage you to focus on these numbers. 
For the trailing 12 months ending this quarter incremental gross profit margin was 66% adjusted for the same acquisitions. Aggregates gross profit increased approximately $132 million on incremental freight adjusted revenues of $201 million. Given our strategic focus on the aggregates business, our gross profit flow-through is an advantage to Vulcan as volumes continue to recover.
Slide 10 highlights our asphalt and concrete results for the fourth quarter and full year. Earnings results in each of these segments improved versus the prior year on higher sales. Asphalt gross profit for the full year improved $5 million due to higher margins and earnings from existing operations and for the acquisitions in Arizona and New Mexico. On a same-store basis, asphalt volumes increased 4% in the prior year and unit profitability increased 6% driving a same-store gross profit improvement of $3 million. 
Full year concrete gross profits were $2 million versus a loss of $25 million in the prior year. Excluding the company's divested concrete business, unit profitability improved and gross profit increased $6 million.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John for some comments on capital allocation and our outlook. John?"

The topic of capital allocation remains,",1647,"Thanks, Tom. In our last earnings release and call, we placed emphasis on capital allocation particularly with a view toward putting the recent acquisitions we made in the context of our overall approach and plans. The topic of capital allocation remains, obviously a critical area of focus for the management team. With that in mind, I'd like to now use Slide 11 to recap our actions during 2014, update you on the transactions we closed last week and highlight the goals and options we have in front of us.
As you know in early 2014, we successfully divested of our Florida area cement and ready-mix concrete operations to Argos. Given our aggregates focus strategy, Argos was a better owner of those assets than we were. As a reminder, our divested cement and concrete operations were among the most volatile and capital-intensive businesses in our portfolio. We remain very pleased with our transaction and it has positioned us very well for Florida's continued recovery and construction activity.
Also during 2014, we further strengthened both our balance sheet and our core profitability. Our ratio of total debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA has improved to approximately 3.3 versus 5.4 a year ago, and it should decline further with continued EBITDA growth in 2015. 
As Thomas noted, our core profitability as measured by the cash gross profit we generate for each ton of aggregates shipped, improved another 9% compounding prior year gains and we expect it to improve further moving forward. As I'll touch on in a minute, we expect same-store shipments to grow approximately 8% in 2015 as a recovery and construction activity progresses. We are very comfortable, very comfortable with our credit position and how it is improving toward our stated investment grade targets. 
We spent $225 million on CapEx excluding M&A during 2014. This capital deployment not only maintains our physical plant, but also improves our efficiencies and ability to meet our customers needs. We've now return to more normal levels of what we call maintenance and enhancement CapEx, and we expect this use of capital to grow more in line with shipments going forward. 
In 2014, we deployed $332 million of capital for targeted acquisitions that strengthen our asset base now and for years to come. We've made good progress with the integration of the 7 acquisitions we made during the year and we expect these operations in total to contribute approximately $50 million to our EBITDA in 2015. And as we indicated we would, we began the process of growing our dividend as we grow earnings. 
Each of these actions contributed to the current and long-term value of our company. Equally importantly, they collectively improved our flexibility and optionality moving forward. As we look to 2015 and beyond, we believe we are well positioned to sustain our capital reinvestment, our current asset base, recover and maintain investment grade credit position, we accelerate the return of capital to our shareholders and to prudently pursue attractive bolt-on acquisitions. 
To be clear, we will also consider additional asset divestitures and swaps. We believe it's important for us and for others in our industry to challenge ourselves regarding whether we are the best owner of our individual assets and operations. This logic supported our 2014 transaction with Argos and it underpins a much smaller transaction we closed in late January. 
As noted in our earnings release, we recently concluded an asset swap with Synnex, into which we've exchanged our Southern California ready-mix concrete operations for 13 asphalt plants primarily in Arizona. Under the agreement, we will continue to supply aggregates to exchange concrete operation. Given as operations and strategic focus in these markets, each party should be able to earn a higher return on the exchange assets than the prior owner. This exchange will be immediately accretive to Vulcan and its expected impact is incorporated into our 2015 projections.
Now let me turn to our outlook for 2015 before handing the call back to Tom. I'll begin on Slide 12 with an overview of our outlook for demand for aggregates in the markets we serve. The headline here is that we see another year of high single-digit demand growth as recovery toward normal levels of construction activity continues. The pattern of recoveries increasingly broad-based as we see growth in each of our primary end-use segments and in the clear majority of our geographies. And from what we can see, demand in Vulcan-served markets should continue to grow faster than the U.S. as a whole. 
We certainly cannot predict the future, but we currently anticipate a gradual recovery lasting several more years before we return to aggregates consumption levels consistent with long-term trends. As you can see on the slide, we see aggregates demand from private end uses up 14% to 18% during 2015. The growth in our fourth quarter sales to these end-users reflects the strong underlying momentum. Private growth continues to be driven by the recovery in employment and the continued recovery in single and multi family housing. 
We see demand from public end uses in our markets, up 3% to 5% during 2015. Construction momentum remains positive and stable in Vulcan markets, south and west continue to see more growth in other areas of the U.S. and that state and local tax revenues approach all-time highs and should provide the support for new public infrastructure funding. 
Our 2015 outlook for these end-use markets, although tailored to our specific mix of geographies, is not vary significantly from the consensus of external industry at. And finally of note, that we have not significantly altered our 2015 demand forecast  or account for recent declines in oil prices, status of federal highway build negotiations or shifting predictions regarding interest rates and credit availability. Certainly these factors introduce a degree of uncertainty, but at this point, we see a continuation of the momentum witnessed over the past 6 quarters. As always, we'll monitor actual local demand patterns throughout the year and respond accordingly.
I'll turn now to Slide 13 for a summary of our full year outlook. I'll be brief as we've touched on many of these items in our press release as well as earlier in this call. We are, for 2015, giving a range for adjusted EBITDA excluding the gains associated with the sale of property of between $775 million and $825 million. I'll touch now on the certain of the assumptions underpinning that EBITDA projection. 
We currently project 2015 aggregate shipments of approximately 180 [ph] million tons consistent with the demand outlook I just highlighted, as well as with the continued strong sales and customer service execution at the local level. On a same-store basis, excluding the impact of acquisitions made in 2014, we project shipments to be up 8% over the prior year. We currently expect average aggregate selling prices on a freight adjusted basis to be at 6% over the prior year. As a reminder, our pricing decisions are made locally and outcomes will vary significantly by geography and at different points in the year. 
But as Tom noted earlier in this call as well as in our prior call, we've seen the pricing environment continue to improve with the recovery in demand, and we remain intensively focused on earning a full and fair return on the investments we've made to serve our customers. We expect total gross profit for the aggregates segment to be approximately $735 million. Margins per ton should expand further as we work not only to achieve higher pricing, but also to leverage fixed cost and maintain strong production efficiencies and cost controls. 
Over the course of the full year, the flow through of incremental freight adjusted revenue to segment gross profit should remain consistent with recent trend, although as we've said, results will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. For our non-aggregate business segments, we expect gross profit of approximately $70 million in total. This projection reflects the impact of the asset swap I mentioned previously, and includes approximately $50 million of gross profit from our asphalt operations, approximately $17 million of gross profit from our concrete operations and approximately $3 million in gross profit from our calcium business. 
Please note that the actual material margins and gross profit margins from these downstream businesses can vary substantially at the local market level and throughout the year. SAG expenses excluding acquisition and divestiture-related costs and other items should be approximately $265 million in 2015. We remain very focused on leveraging SAG to revenues as volumes recover. 
We expect DD&A for 2015 to be approximately $270 million as compared to $279 million in 2014 and we currently plan to spend $250 million for maintenance and enhancement capital in 2015. Excluding our capital spending for acquisitions are significant expansion of our distribution and logistics capabilities. 
Now a couple of final notes before I hand in the call back to Tom. First, I should remind everyone that the projections I just noted are certainly subject to revision throughout the year. While we believe our visibility to demand has been improving as we get further into the early stages of recovery, there certainly remains some uncertainty in the macro environment whether due to oil prices, federal and state transportation funding decisions or other factors. That said, our focus remains on making the most of whatever recovery scenario we are presented with. 
Second, I'll note that our profit projections do not necessarily account the full production cost benefits we may realize if diesel prices were to remain at current levels throughout the year. Our production budgets are built bottom up, plant by plant, and our operators remain focused as of course they should be, on the efficiencies within their control. We'll do our best to note the impact of shifting energy costs on our business as the year unfolds. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Tom for a closing comment."

We're going to be highly focused on superior execution of the business, price improvement, lowering cost, margin growth and capital discipline. The momentum that we found so encouraging in 2014 and it was so apparent in our fourth quarter results will only continue to grow. Along with accelerating demand growth, we're going to see accelerating momentum in our ability to secure price improvements and in our ability to continue executing on our first class operational discipline, controlling and lowering cost. We fully recognize the importance of executing on price and operational discipline to give our shareholders a superior return on capital. And as I said earlier, we will continue to be extremely disciplined in our allocation of capital. 
Regardless of what the markets may do, we will stay focused on the things that we control, executing on price improvement and margin expansion. We'll also remain focused on servicing our customers so they continue to reap value from the relationships with us. Working together, we will win.

While those were at lower prices, they were very good volumes. I think the fourth quarter headline pricing, relies the pricing momentum that we're seeing across our footprint. If you kind of step back and look at pricing in the fourth quarter on a market by market basis, and we look at the markets where we're seeing higher growth or where the recovery is a little more mature, I'll read this off to you. We're seeing price increases in the fourth quarter 7.8, 6.5, increase of 5.8%, 5.7%, 4.8, 4.6. Now offsetting that in some of the markets where recovery is not as far along or where we sold some big basin job, we're seeing price increases in the fourth quarter of 2%, flat-flat, minus 1% or minus 1.4%, and that's not all bad because if you look at the margin expansion across that same footprint, we're seeing nice margin expansion in almost all of our markets, so as far as pricing going into 2015, there's a lot of -- we're confident that the conditions and the momentum is there for good price increases.

So that we can accelerate the return of capital to shareholders whether that's through dividend or other mechanisms over time, so I expect you to see us have more of our cash flow each year give back to shareholders as part of the mix.

And I think the good news is we're going to have a lot of options and we've worked hard to be in that position, but I think we'll have more options than if you will, we'll have trade-off. I think we'll be able to do again the right mix of all of the above."

A lot of this is business development-related and more than a couple of million dollars. We had some incentive comp that was really tied to our Florida divestiture and a gain in that sales as part of our system, so that's a one-time event. We have a significant land donation, another $1.5 million roughly, which ends up as an SAG cost and then down as a gain on sale of land, so that negatively affects EBITDA. We had other costs associated with the acquisitions we made, so a lot of the things that drove SAG were not repeating themselves. Yes, the core is in the comp, we'll keep an eye on as part of our overall business mix, but much of the factors driving the 8 million variance in Q4 and really the variance for the full year, had to do with one-off and nonrecurring items. On your question about assets held for sale, I believe the answer, if you look at the same part of the balance sheet I am, is that those were held -- that was the Synnex swap, and that we knew we were working in that transaction, expected to conclude it, we concluded it in January, so at the time of the balance sheet, we were holding those assets for sale.

I'm Tom Hill, President and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan. Joining me today is John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. A slide presentation will accompany this webcast. It will be posted on the company's website at the conclusion of this earnings call.
Before we begin, the actual results and projections, I refer you to Slide 2 of our presentation regarding forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Descriptions of these are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.
In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measurements. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of this presentation.
Before we get into details today, I'd like to speak to you about some things that are immensely important to me and our management team. We executed well in 2014, particularly in the fourth quarter, and I am proud of our people and the job they did, but we are focused on the future. When I think about the job our people will need to do in 2015, 3 words come to mind: Momentum, execution and discipline.
Momentum. We are seeing accelerating momentum in demand throughout our markets. Demand in the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations despite our California business being waterlogged, and recall that we are comparing against a strong fourth quarter in 2013. There is accelerating pricing momentum in many of our markets, and we are going to reap the benefits of that momentum. The momentum that we've seen thus far will carry forward through 2015 and likely well beyond, and we are going to take every advantage of it.
Execution. Our teams throughout the company are executing very well. We are pleased with the results detailed in today's press release, and these outcomes directly reflect the great efforts of our people at all levels of the business. In particular, I'm proud of how our local businesses have continued to convert incremental revenues into incremental gross profit. We are servicing our customers well and helping them grow while operating our business safely and efficiently. Despite only modest gains in pricing so far, our people are making the most of this initial phase of recovery. They have set the stage for even stronger performance ahead. My personal focus in 2015 and the focus of our management teams will be on pricing improvements, margin expansion, smart uses of capital and safety.
Discipline. We are very well aware that now is the time for continued discipline, not congratulations or complacency. Our people will continue to show great discipline in the delivery of quality products and services to our customers safely and efficiently, and we will emphasize continued discipline in how we deploy capital and in how we pursue price and margin improvement. We will be highly focused in 2015 on accelerating gains in pricing for our core aggregates business so that we earn a fair and full return on the significant investments that we have made in our business. We have made progress, but we are not where we need to be. It is also paramount that we continue our disciplined performance and operational excellence and cost control. We will remain extremely disciplined in our use of capital, deploying it to further build on our strategic base of world-class assets while improving our balance sheet and our return on shareholders' capital.
The momentum, execution and discipline that were hallmarks of 2014 will be our watch words as we build an ever stronger business in 2015.
Now let's move on to the rest of the call. You'll see that many of these slides line up with those used in our third quarter call, in large part because our focus on driving improved margins and fully capitalizing on the recovery in demand has not changed.
The results on Slide 4 demonstrate the quality of our fourth quarter execution and how we continue the strong conversion of incremental revenues into growth in earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $172 million, a 32% increase. We achieved these results despite a temporary rise in SAG cost as a result of business development and performance-based incentives. Our underlying profitability continued to improve significantly, whether measured by margin percentage or per unit profit. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.29, including $0.02 for business development expenses and restructuring cost.
On Slide 5, you can see that our fourth quarter results continue the trend in recent quarters. Looking at full year results, we have seen a 38% gain in gross profit on an 8% gain in revenues. That significant increase is due to margin discipline, particularly in our core aggregates business and the positive impact on the divestiture of our lower margin concrete and cement businesses in Florida. SAG was up due to the items just mentioned. You will see later that we forecast a decline in SAG going forward. Adjusted EBIT nearly doubled for the year and adjusted EBITDA was up handsomely. For the year, adjusted earnings per share were $0.91. Including the Florida divestiture and debt tender offer, earnings per share were $1.56. Now turning to our core aggregates segment.
Slide 6 tells the story of volume growth across Vulcan's footprint in 2014. This growing momentum is driven by strengthening private construction activity across all end-use markets and an increasing number of large projects, along with increasing highway demand. These trends gained further momentum in the fourth quarter, with shipments growing 15% in total and 12% on a same-store basis, even with the impact of bad weather in California and Georgia.
For the full year, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Texas and Virginia saw shipments increase by more than 10% on a same-store basis. Aggregate shipments in California and North Carolina also realized solid growth. Shipments in Alabama and South Carolina were down slightly, with slower recovery in construction activity in these states.
Now let's talk about how we are converting this momentum and these early gains in demand into expanding margins and profits. Last quarter, we discussed the 3 major profit drivers that we can focus on.
As you can see on the right-hand side of Slide 7, our industry-leading gross profit per ton increased $0.66 in spite of a modest overall price improvement of $0.21 per ton. Cash gross profit per ton increased to $5.18, an 11% gain over a year ago. Our local management teams are doing an outstanding job of turning demand growth into even higher levels of profitability by managing the mix of price, operating efficiencies, sales and products.
This is not a new story for us. As you can see on Slide 8, we have compounded unit profitability faster than pricing for the last 6 quarters. During the last 12 months, our freight-adjusted average unit price has increased 2% or $0.25 per ton. Over that same period, our gross profit per ton has increased 18% or $0.52 per ton. Excluding our 2014 acquisitions, trailing 12-month gross profit per ton was up $0.56 or 20%. This is a higher figure than when these operations were producing twice the volume. We are completely focused on ensuring that our unit margins continue to grow.
In speaking to you last quarter about our incremental margin leverage, we discussed our best-in-class incremental flow-through that we enjoy with volume growth. Slide 9 depicts incremental margin performance in our aggregates segment. As you can see, incremental gross profit margin for the fourth quarter was 79%, excluding the impact of acquisitions completed during the year.
Aggregates gross profit grew $45 million on an incremental freight-adjusted revenues of $57 million. Including the impact of acquisitions, the incremental margin was 65%, reduced due to acquisition accounting. Since quarterly figures can be distorted by seasonality or one-time costs, we are also presenting the same metric calculated on a trailing 12-month basis. We'd encourage you to focus on these numbers.
For the trailing 12 months ending this quarter incremental gross profit margin was 66% adjusted for the same acquisitions. Aggregates gross profit increased approximately $132 million on incremental freight-adjusted revenues of $201 million. Given our strategic focus on the aggregates business, our gross profit flow-through is an advantage to Vulcan as volumes continue to recover.
Slide 10 highlights our asphalt and concrete results for the fourth quarter and full year. Earnings results in each of these segments improved versus the prior year on higher sales. Asphalt gross profit for the full year improved $5 million due to higher margins and earnings from existing operations and from the acquisitions in Arizona and New Mexico. On a same-store basis, asphalt volumes increased 4% from the prior year and unit profitability increased 6%, driving a same-store gross profit improvement of $3 million.
Full year concrete gross profits were $2 million versus a loss of $25 million in the prior year. Excluding the company's divested concrete business, unit profitability improved and gross profit increased $6 million.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John for some comments on capital allocation and our outlook. John?"

In our last earnings release and call, we placed emphasis on capital allocation, particularly with a view toward putting the recent acquisitions we made in the context of our overall approach and plans. The topic of capital allocation remains, obviously, a critical area of focus for our management team. And with that in mind, I'd like to now use Slide 11 to recap our actions during 2014, update you on the transaction we closed last week and highlight the goals and options we have in front of us.
As you know, in early 2014, we successfully divested of our Florida area cement and ready-mix concrete operations to Argos. Given our aggregates-focused strategy, Argos was a better owner of those assets than we were. As a reminder, our divested cement and concrete operations were among the most volatile and capital-intensive businesses in our portfolio. We remain very pleased with that transaction, and it has positioned us very well for Florida's continued recovery in construction activity.
Also during 2014, we further strengthened both our balance sheet and our core profitability. Our ratio of total debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA has improved to approximately 3.3 versus 5.4 a year ago, and it should decline further with continued EBITDA growth in 2015.
As Tom has noted, our core profitability, as measured by the cash gross profit we generate for each ton of aggregate shipped, improved another 9% compounding prior year gains, and we expect it to improve further moving forward. As I'll touch on in a minute, we expect same-store shipments to grow approximately 8% in 2015, as the recovery in construction activity progresses. We are very comfortable, very comfortable with our credit position and how it is improving toward our stated investment-grade target.
We spent $225 million on CapEx, excluding M&A, during 2014. This capital deployment not only maintains our physical plant, but also improves our efficiencies and ability to meet our customers' needs. We've now returned to more normal levels of what we call maintenance and enhancement CapEx, and we expect this use of capital to grow more in line with shipments moving forward.
In 2014, we deployed $332 million of capital for targeted acquisitions that strengthen our asset base now and for years to come. We've made good progress with the integration of the 7 acquisitions we made during the year, and we expect these operations in total to contribute approximately $50 million to our EBITDA in 2015. And as we indicated we would, we began the process of growing our dividend as we grow earnings.
Each of these actions contributed to the current and long-term value of our company. Equally importantly, they collectively improved our flexibility and optionality moving forward. As we look to 2015 and beyond, we believe we are well positioned to sustain our capital reinvestment in our current asset base, to recover and maintain an investment-grade credit position, to accelerate the return of capital to our shareholders and to prudently pursue attractive bolt-on acquisitions.
To be clear, we will also consider additional asset divestitures and swaps. We believe it is important for us and for others in our industry to challenge ourselves regarding whether we are the best owner of our individual assets and operations. This logic supported our 2014 transaction with Argos, and it underpins the much smaller transaction we closed in late January.
As noted in our earnings release, we recently concluded an asset swap with CEMEX, under which we've exchanged our Southern California ready-mix concrete operations for 13 asphalt plants primarily in Arizona. Under the agreement, we will continue to supply aggregates to the exchanged concrete operations. Given its operations and strategic focus in these markets, each party should be able to earn a higher return on the exchanged assets than the prior owner. This exchange will be immediately accretive to Vulcan and its expected impact is incorporated into our 2015 projections.
Now let me turn to our outlook for 2015 before handing the call back to Tom. I'll begin on Slide 12 with an overview of our outlook for demand for aggregates in the markets we serve. The headline here is that we see another year of high single-digit demand growth as recovery toward normal levels of construction activity continues. The pattern of the recovery is increasingly broad-based as we see growth in each of our primary end-use segments and in the clear majority of our geographies. And from what we can see, demand in Vulcan-served markets should continue to grow faster than the U.S. as a whole.
We certainly cannot predict the future, but we currently anticipate a gradual recovery lasting several more years before we return to aggregates consumption levels consistent with long-term trends. As you can see on the slide, we see aggregates demand from private end uses up 14% to 18% during 2015. The growth in our fourth quarter sales to these end-users reflects the strong underlying momentum. Private growth continues to be driven by the recovery in employment and the continued recovery in single and multifamily housing.
We see demand from public end uses in our markets up 3% to 5% during 2015. Construction award momentum remains positive and stable in Vulcan markets. The south and west continue to see more growth than other areas of the U.S. And as state and local tax revenues approach all-time highs, they should provide the support for new public infrastructure funding.
Our 2015 outlook for these end-use markets, although tailored to our specific mix of geographies, does not vary significantly from the consensus of external industry observers. And finally I'll note that we have not significantly altered our 2015 demand forecast to account for recent declines in oil prices, the status of federal highway bill negotiations or shifting predictions regarding interest rates and credit availability. Certainly, these factors introduce a degree of uncertainty. But at this point, we see a continuation of the momentum witnessed over the past 6 quarters. As always, we'll monitor actual local demand patterns throughout the year and respond accordingly.
I'll turn now to Slide 13 for a summary of our full year outlook. I'll be brief as we've touched on many of these items in our press release, as well as earlier in this call. We are, for 2015, giving a range for adjusted EBITDA, excluding any gains associated with the sale of property, of between $775 million and $825 million. I'll touch now on certain of the assumptions underpinning that EBITDA projection.
We currently project 2015 aggregate shipments of approximately 180 million tons, consistent with the demand outlook I just highlighted, as well as with the continued strong sales and customer service execution at the local level. On a same-store basis, excluding the impact of acquisitions made in 2014, we project shipments to be up 8% over the prior year. We currently expect average aggregate selling prices on a freight-adjusted basis to be up 6% over the prior year. As a reminder, our pricing decisions are made locally and outcomes will vary significantly by geography and at different points in the year.
But as Tom noted earlier in this call, as well as in our prior call, we've seen the pricing environment continue to improve with the recovery in demand, and we remain intensively focused on earning a full and fair return on the investments we've made to serve our customers. We expect total gross profit for the aggregate segment to be approximately $735 million. Margins per ton should expand further as we work not only to achieve higher pricing, but also to leverage fixed cost and maintain strong production efficiencies and cost controls.
Over the course of the full year, the flow-through of incremental freight-adjusted revenue to segment gross profit should remain consistent with recent trend, although as we've said, results will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.
For our non-aggregate business segment, we expect gross profit of approximately $70 million in total. This projection reflects the impact of the asset swap I mentioned previously and includes approximately $50 million in gross profit from our asphalt operations, approximately $17 million in gross profit from our concrete operations and approximately $3 million in gross profit from our calcium business.
Please note that the actual material margins and gross profit margins from these downstream businesses can vary substantially at the local market level and throughout the year.
SAG expenses, excluding acquisition and divestiture-related costs and other items, should be approximately $265 million in 2015. We remain very focused on leveraging SAG to revenues as volumes recover.
We expect DD&A for 2015 to be approximately $270 million as compared to $279 million in 2014. And we currently plan to spend $250 million for maintenance and enhancement capital in 2015, excluding our capital spending for acquisitions or a significant expansion of our distribution and logistics capabilities.
Now a couple of final notes before handing the call back to Tom. First, I should remind everyone that the projections I just noted are certainly subject to revision throughout the year. While we believe our visibility to demand has been improving as we get further into the early stages of recovery, there certainly remains some uncertainty in the macro environment, whether due to oil prices, federal and state transportation funding decisions or other factors. That said, our focus remains on making the most of whatever recovery scenario we are presented with.
Second, I'll note that our profit projections do not necessarily account for the full production cost benefits we may realize if diesel prices were to remain at current levels throughout the year. Our production budgets are built bottom-up, plant by plant, and our operators remain focused, as of course they should be, on the efficiencies within their control. We'll do our best to note the impact of shifting energy cost on our business as the year unfolds.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Tom for a closing comment."

If you kind of step back and look at pricing in the fourth quarter on a market-by-market basis, and we look at the markets where we're seeing higher growth or the recovery is a little more mature, and I'll read these off to you. We're seeing price increases in the fourth quarter 7.8%, 6.5%, increase of 5.8%, 5.7%, 4.8%, 4.6%. Now offsetting that in some of the markets where recovery is not as far along or where we sold some big basin finds job, we've seen price increases in the fourth quarter of 2%, flat-flat, minus 1% or minus 1.4%. And that's not all bad because if you look at the margin expansion across that same footprint, we're seeing nice margin expansion in almost all of our markets.

Embedded in that is also off-road and on-road diesel and that mix changes. So trying to get a solid comparison for a diesel price is really tough. Now there may be some savings embedded in it, but as I said earlier, our focus will be on the things that we can control, which is how we buy it, and buying it as economically as we can, and then how we use it, with measuring tons per gallon. So there may be some embedded there, but that's really hard to define and take apart across our footprint. As far as other cost of concern, there's always different commodities we use always. They do have price increases in a number of those. I think we also have the operating leverage, but I think we'll turn in, continue to turn in improved pricing numbers as the year progresses. And I think our folks are really doing a good job at focusing on the key drivers of cost. Now you also got to remember, we're still operating at 60-some -- a little north of 60% of our peak volumes, so we've got a lot of room to be able to optimize our operations and our cost as volumes continue to grow."

First, we're very comfortable with our current leverage ratio -- current amount of leverage. I think what we'd highlight is, we've taken a number of actions over the years to get ourselves in a position where we can, a little bit, do all of the above. So we can reinvest in our business as we need to, in our plant and equipment, in our asset base. We can achieve and maintain an investment-grade credit rating, which matters to us, so we have access to capital at all points of the cycle, to your question on the cycle. So that we can accelerate the return of capital to shareholders, whether that's through dividend or other mechanisms over time. So I expect you to see us have more of our cash flow each year go back to shareholders as part of the mix. And so we can still pursue prudent acquisitions and have a strong return, like you've seen us do in the last year. I think we've got ourselves in a spot, to your point on dry powder, that so long as we're prudent and cognizant of the cycle, we can do all of these things. In terms of how we think about it through the cycle, let me just say now, we're still close to the trough of the cycle than anything that's normal. We think we've got several years of growth and margin expansion in front of us. And as we -- if we deliver a year, like you said Ted, per your model or your expectations, we're going to have a lot of options. And I think the good news is that we're going to have a lot of options. And we've worked hard to be in that position, but I think we'll have more options than, if you will, we'll have trade-offs. I think we'll be able to do, again, the right mix of all of the above."

So that's an example, but I think you could go through a lot of things and have an example. But that's one that's kind of outside our control, if you will, that we would think about. And again, for that reason, we didn't try and bake in some assumption that we can't control into our models."

A lot of it is business development-related, more than a couple of million dollars. We had some incentive comp that was really tied to our Florida divestiture and a gain on that sale as part of our system. So that's kind of a one-time event. We had a significant land donation, another $1.5 million roughly, which ends up as an SAG cost and then down as a gain on sale of land, so it negatively affects the EBITDA. We had other costs associated with the acquisitions we made. So a lot of the things that drove SAG were not repeating themselves. Yes, the core incentive comp, we'll keep an eye on as part of the overall business mix, but much of the factors driving the $8 million variance in Q4 and really the variance for the full year had to do with one-off or nonrecurring items. On your question about assets held for sale, I believe the answer, if you're looking at the same part of the balance sheet I am, is that those were held for -- that was the CEMEX swap. And that we knew we were working on that transaction, expected to conclude it. We concluded it in January. So at the time of the balance sheet, we were holding those assets for sale. Rough fair value associated with the asset swap for both sides was about $20 million, just to give you a sense of the size of the transaction, no cash involved."

I'm Tom Hill, President and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan. Joining me today is John McPherson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Strategy Officer. A slide presentation will accompany this webcast. It will be posted on the company's website at the conclusion of this earnings call.
Before we begin the actual results and projections, I refer you to Slide 2 of our presentation regarding forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Descriptions of these are detailed in the company's SEC reports, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.
In addition, during this call, management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measurements. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other related information in our earnings release and at the end of this presentation.
Before we get into details today, I'd like to speak to you about some things that are immensely important to me and our management team. We executed well in 2014, particularly in the fourth quarter, and I am proud of our people and the job they did, but we are focused on the future. When I think about the job our people will need to do in 2015, 3 words come to mind: momentum, execution and discipline.
Momentum. We are seeing accelerating momentum in demand throughout our markets. Demand in the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations despite our California business being waterlogged, and recall that we are comparing against a strong fourth quarter in 2013. There is accelerating pricing momentum in many of our markets, and we are going to reap the benefits of that momentum. The momentum that we've seen thus far will carry forward through 2015 and likely well beyond, and we are going to take every advantage of it.
Execution. Our teams throughout the company are executing very well. We are pleased with the results detailed in today's press release, and these outcomes directly reflect the great efforts of our people at all levels of the business. In particular, I'm proud of how our local businesses have continued to convert incremental revenues into incremental gross profit. We are servicing our customers well and helping them grow while operating our business safely and efficiently. Despite only modest gains in pricing so far, our people are making the most of this initial phase of recovery. They have set the stage for even stronger performance ahead. My personal focus in 2015 and the focus of our management teams will be on pricing improvements, margin expansion, smart uses of capital and safety.
Discipline. We are very well aware that now is the time for continued discipline, not congratulations or complacency. Our people will continue to show great discipline in the delivery of quality products and services to our customers safely and efficiently, and we will emphasize continued discipline in how we deploy capital and in how we pursue price and margin improvement. We will be highly focused in 2015 on accelerating gains in pricing for our core aggregates business so that we earn a fair and full return on the significant investments that we have made in our business. We have made progress, but we are not where we need to be. It is also paramount that we continue our disciplined performance in operational excellence and cost control. We will remain extremely disciplined in our use of capital, deploying it to further build on our strategic base of world-class assets while improving our balance sheet and our return on shareholders' capital.
The momentum, execution and discipline that were hallmarks of 2014 will be our watch words as we build an ever stronger business in 2015.
Now let's move on to the rest of the call. You'll see that many of these slides line up with those used in our third quarter call, in large part because our focus on driving improved margins and fully capitalizing on the recovery in demand has not changed.
The results on Slide 4 demonstrate the quality of our fourth quarter execution and how we continue the strong conversion of incremental revenues into growth in earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $172 million, a 32% increase. We achieved these results despite a temporary rise in SAG costs as a result of business development and performance-based incentives. Our underlying profitability continued to improve significantly, whether measured by margin percentage or per-unit profit. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.29, including $0.02 for business development expenses and restructuring cost.
On Slide 5, you can see that our fourth quarter results continue the trend in recent quarters. Looking at full year results, we have seen a 38% gain in gross profit on an 8% gain in revenues. That significant increase is due to margin discipline, particularly in our core aggregates business, and the positive impact on the divestiture of our lower-margin concrete and cement businesses in Florida. SAG was up due to the items just mentioned. You will see later that we forecast a decline in SAG going forward. Adjusted EBIT nearly doubled for the year and adjusted EBITDA was up handsomely. For the year, adjusted earnings per share were $0.91. Including the Florida divestiture and debt tender offer, earnings per share were $1.56. Now turning to our core aggregates segment.
Slide 6 tells the story of volume growth across Vulcan's footprint in 2014. This growing momentum is driven by strengthening private construction activity across all end-use markets and an increasing number of large projects, along with increasing highway demand. These trends gained further momentum in the fourth quarter, with shipments growing 15% in total and 12% on a same-store basis, even with the impact of bad weather in California and Georgia.
For the full year, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Texas and Virginia saw shipments increase by more than 10% on a same-store basis. Aggregate shipments in California and North Carolina also realized solid growth. Shipments in Alabama and South Carolina were down slightly with slower recovery in construction activity in these states.
Now let's talk about how we are converting this momentum and these early gains in demand into expanding margins and profits. Last quarter, we discussed the 3 major profit drivers that we can focus on.
As you can see on the right-hand side of Slide 7, our industry-leading gross profit per ton increased $0.66 in spite of a modest overall price improvement of $0.21 per ton. Cash gross profit per ton increased to $5.18, an 11% gain over a year ago. Our local management teams are doing an outstanding job of turning demand growth into even higher levels of profitability by managing the mix of price, operating efficiencies, sales and products.
This is not a new story for us. As you can see on Slide 8, we have compounded unit profitability faster than pricing for the last 6 quarters. During the last 12 months, our freight-adjusted average unit price has increased 2% or $0.25 per ton. Over that same period, our gross profit per ton has increased 18% or $0.52 per ton. Excluding our 2014 acquisitions, trailing 12-month gross profit per ton was up $0.56 or 20%. This is a higher figure than when these operations were producing twice the volume. We are completely focused on ensuring that our unit margins continue to grow.
In speaking to you last quarter about our incremental margin leverage, we discussed our best-in-class incremental flow-through that we enjoy with volume growth. Slide 9 depicts incremental margin performance in our aggregates segment. As you can see, incremental gross profit margin for the fourth quarter was 79%, excluding the impact of acquisitions completed during the year.
Aggregates gross profit grew $45 million on incremental freight-adjusted revenues of $57 million. Including the impact of acquisitions, the incremental margin was 65%, reduced due to acquisition accounting. Since quarterly figures can be distorted by seasonality or onetime costs, we are also presenting the same metric calculated on a trailing 12-month basis. We'd encourage you to focus on these numbers.
For the trailing 12 months ending this quarter, incremental gross profit margin was 66% adjusted for the same acquisitions. Aggregates gross profit increased approximately $132 million on incremental freight-adjusted revenues of $201 million. Given our strategic focus on the aggregates business, our gross profit flow-through is an advantage to Vulcan as volumes continue to recover.
Slide 10 highlights our asphalt and concrete results for the fourth quarter and full year. Earnings results in each of these segments improved versus the prior year on higher sales. Asphalt gross profit for the full year improved $5 million due to higher margins and earnings from existing operations and from the acquisitions in Arizona and New Mexico. On a same-store basis, asphalt volumes increased 4% from the prior year and unit profitability increased 6%, driving a same-store gross profit improvement of $3 million.
Full year concrete gross profits were $2 million versus a loss of $25 million in the prior year. Excluding the company's divested concrete business, unit profitability improved and gross profit increased $6 million.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John for some comments on capital allocation and our outlook. John?"

In our last earnings release and call, we placed emphasis on capital allocation, particularly with a view toward putting the recent acquisitions we made in the context of our overall approach and plans. The topic of capital allocation remains",1649,"Thanks, Tom. In our last earnings release and call, we placed emphasis on capital allocation, particularly with a view toward putting the recent acquisitions we made in the context of our overall approach and plans. The topic of capital allocation remains, obviously, a critical area of focus for our management team. And with that in mind, I'd like to now use Slide 11 to recap our actions during 2014, update you on the transaction we closed last week and highlight the goals and options we have in front of us.
As you know, in early 2014, we successfully divested of our Florida area cement and ready-mix concrete operations to Argos. Given our aggregates-focused strategy, Argos was a better owner of those assets than we were. As a reminder, our divested cement and concrete operations were among the most volatile and capital-intensive businesses in our portfolio. We remain very pleased with that transaction, and it has positioned us very well for Florida's continued recovery in construction activity.
Also during 2014, we further strengthened both our balance sheet and our core profitability. Our ratio of total debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA has improved to approximately 3.3 versus 5.4 a year ago, and it should decline further with continued EBITDA growth in 2015.
As Tom has noted, our core profitability, as measured by the cash gross profit we generate for each ton of aggregate shipped, improved another 9%, compounding prior year gains, and we expect it to improve further moving forward. As I'll touch on in a minute, we expect same-store shipments to grow approximately 8% in 2015, as the recovery in construction activity progresses. We are very comfortable, very comfortable with our credit position and how it is improving toward our stated investment-grade target.
We spent $225 million on CapEx, excluding M&A, during 2014. This capital deployment not only maintains our physical plant, but also improves our efficiencies and ability to meet our customers' needs. We've now returned to more normal levels of what we call maintenance and enhancement CapEx, and we expect this use of capital to grow more in line with shipments moving forward.
In 2014, we deployed $332 million of capital for targeted acquisitions that strengthen our asset base now and for years to come. We've made good progress with the integration of the 7 acquisitions we made during the year, and we expect these operations in total to contribute approximately $50 million to our EBITDA in 2015. And as we indicated we would, we began the process of growing our dividend as we grow earnings.
Each of these actions contributed to the current and long-term value of our company. Equally importantly, they collectively improved our flexibility and optionality moving forward. As we look to 2015 and beyond, we believe we are well positioned to sustain our capital reinvestment in our current asset base, to recover and maintain an investment-grade credit position, to accelerate the return of capital to our shareholders and to prudently pursue attractive bolt-on acquisitions.
To be clear, we will also consider additional asset divestitures and swaps. We believe it is important for us and for others in our industry to challenge ourselves regarding whether we are the best owner of our individual assets and operations. This logic supported our 2014 transaction with Argos, and it underpins the much smaller transaction we closed in late January.
As noted in our earnings release, we recently concluded an asset swap with CEMEX, under which we've exchanged our Southern California ready-mix concrete operations for 13 asphalt plants, primarily in Arizona. Under the agreement, we will continue to supply aggregates to the exchanged concrete operations. Given its operations and strategic focus in these markets, each party should be able to earn a higher return on the exchanged assets than the prior owner. This exchange will be immediately accretive to Vulcan, and its expected impact is incorporated into our 2015 projections.
Now let me turn to our outlook for 2015 before handing the call back to Tom. I'll begin on Slide 12 with an overview of our outlook for demand for aggregates in the markets we serve. The headline here is that we see another year of high single-digit demand growth as recovery toward normal levels of construction activity continues. The pattern of the recovery is increasingly broad-based as we see growth in each of our primary end-use segments and in the clear majority of our geographies. And from what we can see, demand in Vulcan-served markets should continue to grow faster than the U.S. as a whole.
We certainly cannot predict the future, but we currently anticipate a gradual recovery lasting several more years before we return to aggregates consumption levels consistent with long-term trends. As you can see on the slide, we see aggregates demand from private end uses up 14% to 18% during 2015. The growth in our fourth quarter sales to these end-users reflects the strong underlying momentum. Private growth continues to be driven by the recovery in employment and the continued recovery in single and multifamily housing.
We see demand from public end uses in our markets up 3% to 5% during 2015. Construction award momentum remains positive and stable in Vulcan markets. The south and west continue to see more growth than other areas of the U.S. And as state and local tax revenues approach all-time highs, they should provide the support for new public infrastructure funding.
Our 2015 outlook for these end-use markets, although tailored to our specific mix of geographies, does not vary significantly from the consensus of external industry observers. And finally I'll note that we have not significantly altered our 2015 demand forecast to account for recent declines in oil prices, the status of federal highway bill negotiations or shifting predictions regarding interest rates and credit availability. Certainly, these factors introduce a degree of uncertainty. But at this point, we see a continuation of the momentum witnessed over the past 6 quarters. As always, we'll monitor actual local demand patterns throughout the year and respond accordingly.
I'll turn now to Slide 13 for a summary of our full year outlook. I'll be brief as we've touched on many of these items in our press release, as well as earlier in this call. We are, for 2015, giving a range for adjusted EBITDA, excluding any gains associated with the sale of property, of between $775 million and $825 million. I'll touch now on certain of the assumptions underpinning that EBITDA projection.
We currently project 2015 aggregate shipments of approximately 180 million tons, consistent with the demand outlook I just highlighted as well as with the continued strong sales and customer service execution at the local level. On a same-store basis, excluding the impact of acquisitions made in 2014, we project shipments to be up 8% over the prior year. We currently expect average aggregate selling prices on a freight-adjusted basis to be up 6% over the prior year. As a reminder, our pricing decisions are made locally and outcomes will vary significantly by geography and at different points in the year.
But as Tom noted earlier in this call, as well as in our prior call, we've seen the pricing environment continue to improve with the recovery in demand, and we remain intensively focused on earning a full and fair return on the investments we've made to serve our customers. We expect total gross profit for the aggregate segment to be approximately $735 million. Margins per ton should expand further as we work not only to achieve higher pricing, but also to leverage fixed cost and maintain strong production efficiencies and cost controls.
Over the course of the full year, the flow-through of incremental freight-adjusted revenue to segment gross profit should remain consistent with recent trend, although as we've said, results will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.
For our non-aggregate business segments, we expect gross profit of approximately $70 million in total. This projection reflects the impact of the asset swap I mentioned previously and includes approximately $50 million in gross profit from our asphalt operations, approximately $17 million in gross profit from our concrete operations and approximately $3 million in gross profit from our calcium business.
Please note that the actual material margins and gross profit margins from these downstream businesses can vary substantially at the local market level and throughout the year.
SAG expenses, excluding acquisition and divestiture-related costs and other items, should be approximately $265 million in 2015. We remain very focused on leveraging SAG to revenues as volumes recover.
We expect DD&A for 2015 to be approximately $270 million as compared to $279 million in 2014. And we currently plan to spend $250 million for maintenance and enhancement capital in 2015, excluding our capital spending for acquisitions or a significant expansion of our distribution and logistics capabilities.
Now a couple of final notes before handing the call back to Tom. First, I should remind everyone that the projections I just noted are certainly subject to revision throughout the year. While we believe our visibility to demand has been improving as we get further into the early stages of recovery, there certainly remains some uncertainty in the macro environment, whether due to oil prices, federal and state transportation funding decisions or other factors. That said, our focus remains on making the most of whatever recovery scenario we are presented with.
Second, I'll note that our profit projections do not necessarily account for the full production cost benefits we may realize if diesel prices were to remain at current levels throughout the year. Our production budgets are built bottom-up, plant by plant, and our operators remain focused, as of course they should be, on the efficiencies within their control. We'll do our best to note the impact of shifting energy cost on our business as the year unfolds.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Tom for a closing comment."

Last year, we put down a solid foundation. Now we will build on it. We're going to be highly focused on superior execution of the business, price improvement, lowering cost, margin growth and capital discipline. The momentum that we found so encouraging in 2014 and that was so apparent in our fourth quarter results will only continue to grow. Along with accelerating demand growth, we're going to see accelerating momentum in our ability to secure price improvements and in our ability to continue executing on our first-class operational discipline, controlling and lowering cost. We fully recognize the importance of executing on price and operational discipline to give our shareholders a superior return on capital. And as I said earlier, we will continue to be extremely disciplined in our allocation of capital.
Regardless of what the markets may do, we will stay focused on the things that we control, executing on price improvement and margin expansion. We'll also remain focused on servicing our customers so they continue to reap value from their relationships with us. Working together, we will win. I'm excited about our company and its future, and I look forward to continuing to report to you as we keep growing and succeeding in the years ahead.

So there are a number of very large jobs across our footprint that we started in '14 and will really kick in, in '15. But there's some other pieces of that. We've got 6 TIFIA jobs that will ship in 2015, be north of 2 million tons in '15 for those jobs. So you're starting to see the TIFIA program really mature from people talking about jobs or planning jobs to actually shipping materials on them. And then we've seen a number of state highways increase their funding. In Florida, Governor Scott announced a $10 billion highway funding bill for this coming year. Texas, as I mentioned earlier, passed Prop 1, which is an additional $1.8 billion. We've gotten more funding in Virginia. Georgia got a proposal for an increase of $1 billion. So the state funding is up on top of all of that."

We have quite a long ways to go in terms of margin performance to tie it back to the kind of returns on capital we'd like to see. So not only do we have room in '15, I think we have room for a very long time. You can go -- on a gross profit basis next year, I think if you work through the math, I think north of $4 on a trailing 12-month basis is sort of within our sights. And that's on a gross profit basis. On a cash basis, you could see north of $5.25. Keep in mind that our current levels of profitability, as Tom mentioned, on a unit basis are higher than they've been at the past while we're still operating at a little more than half the volumes we produced in the past.

Now there may be some savings embedded in it, but as I said earlier, our focus will be on the things that we can control, which is how we buy it, and buying it as economically as we can, and then how we use it, with measuring tons per gallon. So there may be some embedded there, but that's really hard to define and take apart across our footprint. As far as other costs or concern, there's always different commodities we use always. They do have price increases in a number of those. I think we also have the operating leverage, but I think we'll turn in -- continue to turn in improved pricing numbers as the year progresses.

First, we're very comfortable with our current leverage ratio -- current amount of leverage. I think what we'd highlight is, we've taken a number of actions over the years to get ourselves in a position where we can, a little bit, do all of the above. So we can reinvest in our business as we need to, in our plant and equipment, in our asset base. We can achieve and maintain an investment-grade credit rating, which matters to us, so we have access to capital at all points of the cycle, to your question on the cycle; so that we can accelerate the return of capital to shareholders, whether that's through dividend or other mechanisms over time. So I expect you to see us have more of our cash flow each year go back to shareholders as part of the mix. And so we can still pursue prudent acquisitions and have a strong return, like you've seen us do in the last year. I think we've got ourselves in a spot, to your point on dry powder, that so long as we're prudent and cognizant of the cycle, we can do all of those things. In terms of how we think about it through the cycle, let me just say now, we're still closer to the trough of the cycle than anything that's normal. We think we've got several years of growth and margin expansion in front of us.

A lot of it is business development-related, more than a couple of million dollars. We had some incentive comp that was really tied to our Florida divestiture and a gain on that sale as part of our system. So that's kind of a onetime event. We had a significant land donation, another $1.5 million roughly, which ends up as an SAG cost and then down as a gain on sale of land, so it negatively affects the EBITDA. We had other costs associated with the acquisitions we made. So a lot of the things that drove SAG were not repeating themselves. Yes, the core incentive comp, we'll keep an eye on as part of the overall business mix. But much of the factors driving the $8 million variance in Q4 and really the variance for the full year had to do with one-off or nonrecurring items. On your question about assets held for sale, I believe the answer, if you're looking at the same part of the balance sheet I am, is that those were held for -- that was the CEMEX swap. And that we knew we were working on that transaction, expected to conclude it. We concluded it in January. So at the time of the balance sheet, we were holding those assets for sale. Rough fair value associated with the asset swap for both sides was about $20 million, just to give you a sense of the size of the transaction, no cash involved."

We are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter. Despite bad weather in many of our markets, we enjoyed strong earnings growth and margin expansion on higher revenues, underscoring my confidence in our full year outlook. We'",1353,"Thank you, mark. We are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter. Despite bad weather in many of our markets, we enjoyed strong earnings growth and margin expansion on higher revenues, underscoring my confidence in our full year outlook. We're excited about the continuity and accelerating demand across our markets. We're excited about increasing pricing momentum and pricing will continue to escalate throughout the year. We're also very pleased with our operating performance in the quarter. 
In spite of the difficulties posed by bad weather, our local teams did a great job driving incremental revenue to the bottom line, balancing price, volume, sales and production mix, along with operating efficiencies and leverage. The first quarter is always choppy, but we still saw healthy growth and good operating execution. 
Adjusted EBITDA was up 97%, total gross profit increased 128% and same-store shipments increased 9%. Cash gross profit per ton increased 17% with strong flow-through in aggregates gross profit 68% on incremental freight-adjusted revenue. Same-store pricing increased 4% with strong pricing momentum across most markets. With improving market conditions and our focus on profit improvements, both pricing and margins continue to expand. We are extremely well-positioned to achieve strong earnings growth in 2015 and beyond. 
Slide 3 shows the quality of our first quarter execution. It shows how we continue to convert incremental revenues into earnings growth. Total revenues, excluding freight and delivery, increased 8%, while adjusted EBITDA almost doubled to $77 million. This was due to earnings growth in aggregates and earnings improvement in each of our non-aggregates segment, while we held SAG cost flat. 
Our profitability continue to improve significantly whether measured by a margin percentage or per unit profit. We achieved these results despite the prolonged bad weather in many key markets. 
Now let's look at our aggregate shipments map on Slide 4. I'd like to color this slide. Momentum in shipments continue with strong growth in key states, such as California, Florida, Texas, Virginia, North Carolina and Illinois. Volume in Texas was up 22% or 15% on a same-store basis and North Carolina was up 29%, despite bad weather. Georgia volumes were down due to extremely bad weather by Georgia construction activity continues to heat up and Georgia is on the road to a very good run. 
Slide 5 shows the continuing volume growth across Vulcan's footprint. This momentum is driven by strengthening private construction activity and is supported by highway construction. It's occurring across all energy end-use segments. This is as a result of increasing number of large projects and growing highway demand as states ramp up their highway programs. Shipments grew 13% in total and 9% on same-store basis in the first quarter, even with the impact of bad weather in the mid-Atlantic and Southeast and in Texas. 
The growth rate in aggregates volume on a trailing 12 months same-store basis has continued to accelerate, led by strong growth in Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, Texas and Virginia. While aggregate shipments in California and Georgia also had solid growth. 
We continue to see healthy price growth and pricing momentum is accelerating. We had a number of markets with high single-digit or double-digit price increases. For example, Miami was up almost $1.50 per ton; Tampa, over $2.40; Salt Lake [ph], over $1.70; Charleston, almost $2 per ton, and the Houston market was up $2 and overall, Texas prices were up over 10%.
We did have some headwinds on both geographic and product mix with high volumes and lower price states like Arizona and Illinois. And much larger shipments of base and finds of new construction and large projects, especially in Virginia, North Carolina. Now this is not a bad thing as the volume and product splits helped our overall profitability. 
We continue to see confidence in our customers view of the market and their acceptance of price increases. There'll be a lot more to come as we have secured April price increases in a number of key markets. For example, Texas, Georgia and Alabama all secured new increases of over $1 a ton in April. Prices will escalate throughout the year as new prices -- new price increases are initiated and realized on both fixed plant work and new bid work.  The pricing momentum is what you've come to expect from our industry and from Vulcan. What we are equally excited about is our ability to take top line freight-adjusted revenue growth straight to the bottom line. 
In our last couple of calls, we've talked about the 3 profit drivers that are expanding margins and profits. On Slide 7, you can see our gross profit per ton increased 62%. So in the quarter, price was up $0.44 per ton, but gross profit was up $0.80.
Our sales and operating teams continue doing an outstanding job of turning demand growth into higher levels of profitability. They are the best in the business in managing the mix of price, operating efficiencies, volume and product. 
This story of unit margin expansion isn't a new one for us. There's a trend here, not just a quarter story. As you can see on Slide 8, looking at this over time, we've continued to come down unit profitability faster than pricing. During the last 12 months, our freight-adjusted average unit price has increased 3% or $0.30 per ton. Over that same time period, our gross profit per ton has increased 19% or $0.63 per ton. This is a higher unit profit that went in these operations were producing twice the volume. We are still in the early stages of recovery. We are very pleased with this momentum.
Demand for our products continues to accelerate and I am extremely proud the way our people are focused on unit margin growth. Slide 9 illustrates our incremental margin performance and our aggregate segment. Incremental gross profit margin for the quarter was 68%, excluding the impact of acquisitions completed in 2014. 
Aggregates gross profit grew by $31 million on incremental freight-adjusted revenues of $46 million. Including the impact of acquisitions, incremental margin was 52% as the gross margin on those revenues was impacted by acquisition accounting and seasonality. 
Since quarterly figures could be distorted by weather or onetime cost, we are also presenting the me say metric calculated on a trailing 12-month basis. The trailing 12 months to end of this quarter incremental gross profit margin was also 68%, adjusted for the same acquisition.
Aggregates gross profit increased approximately $148 million on incremental revenues of $229 million. Given our strategic focus on the aggregates business, gross profit flow-through is a big advantage to Vulcan as volumes continue to recover. 
Slide 10, we can step back and look at the big-picture, seeing a significant progress in the Aggregates segment of our business. Before the recovery began, our annualized volumes troughed at 140 million tons to the 12 months ending the second quarter of 2013. Since that time, we've added 26 million tons on an annualized basis. Nice but the still a far cry from normal demand. However, we've been able to increase segment gross profit by $216 million with unit margin increasing 35%. 
Again, our people are executing on the disciplines that grow gross profit. These results also foreshadow earnings power of our aggregates business as we return to more normal levels of demand and as pricing fundamentals begin to improve. 
Slide 11 shows our asphalt and concrete results for the quarter. Both of these businesses are improving on a same-store basis and as a result of transactions that was made to improve our portfolio.
Asphalt gross profit for the quarter was approximately $9 million, a year-over-year improvement of $4 million, driven by higher margins and earnings from existing operations. On a same-store basis, asphalt volumes increased 6% from the prior year. Unit profitability increased sharply. 
First quarter concrete gross profit was $1 million compared to a loss of $9 million in the prior year. Excluding the company's divested Florida and California concrete businesses, unit profitability improved dramatically. Gross profit increased $6 million.
Now I'll turn the call over to John for comments on capital allocation and our outlook. John?"

Capital allocation and capital efficiency, of course, remained critical areas of focus for our management team and we gear our approach towards sustained value creation for our shareholders. As it relates to the allocation of capital across our business portfolio, let me remind you that in the first quarter, we completed an asset swap with CEMEX, under which we've exchanged our Southern California concrete operations for 13 asphalt operations, primarily in Arizona. Vulcan will continue to supply aggregates to the swap concrete operations and you'll see a $5.9 million gain on this transaction included in this quarter's financials. We believe this transaction will prove valuable for both parties as each should be able to earn a higher return on the acquired assets than the prior owner.
Now let me turn from business development activities to the ongoing management of our capital structure and capital costs. As part of our February 25 Investor Day Presentation, we outlined certain actions intended to refinance near-term maturities, lower our weighted average interest expense and extend the overall duration of our debt portfolio. Slide 12 summarizes these actions, which are now substantially complete.
On March 16, we issued $400 million of 10-year notes priced at 4.5%. This issue was very well-received and the pricing reflects are now stronger and rapidly improving credit profile. Those funds, along with borrowings under an expanded revolving credit facility, have been or will be used for the refinancing of $620 million of maturities, otherwise due between now and 2018. As well as to smaller notes due in '21 and '22, for a total refinancing of approximately $640 million. 
The left-hand slide -- side of Slide 12, summarizes the relevant sources and uses of cash and the right-hand side of the slide presents the relevant accounting charges, both the $21.7 million incurred in Q1 and the $46.9 million we project to incur for Q2.
Now let me turn briefly to Slide 13 to recap the impact of these recent transactions on our overall financial strength and flexibility. Let me first remind you that we've maintained our overall level of debt at approximately $2 billion. We're quite comfortable with that level of debt at this time given our expectations for 2015 EBITDA and our strengthening outlook. Though we have improved the structuring cost of our debt portfolio, as you see on the slide, we now effectively have no maturities due before 2018 and a total of approximately $500 million due before 2020. By the end of this year, when we refinance our 2015 notes at maturity, we will [indiscernible] a modest amount of lower-cost floating-rate debt to our mix, a move which makes sense for our business. In total, our weighted average interest rate will have dropped by approximately 120 basis points to 6.5%.
We expect to achieve credit metrics consistent with investment grade benchmarks during the course of this year. And as our credit position continues to strengthen, we should have further opportunities to improve the overall structure and cost of our debt portfolio. We should also have the cash flows and the investment capacity needed to both reinvest in our business and return capital to shareholders. 
Now let me make a couple of comments about end markets and our outlook for 2015 before handing the call back to Tom. As noted earlier and as you see reflected in our Q1 results, construction activity continues to recover in Vulcan-served markets, although it remains far below long-term trend levels. As outlined in our February call, we continue to see gradually improving demand in each of the major end markets we serve. 
The Federal Highway Program receives much attention at the moment and deserve at least so. Like other observers, we expect an extension of the current legislation during which time leaders in Congress will seek agreements on funding sources for a new long-term deal your. Although several states of the big work due to the uncertainty of the federal level, we do currently do not anticipate a major disruption to our protected volumes for 2015. In fact, given our current backlogs and the patterns of new project starts in Vulcan-served states, we are meant confident in growing our shipments to public transportation and infrastructure end uses. 
Now deteriorating state of the nation's transportation infrastructure and is very real cost to the average American family become more evident with each passing month. We believe that our congressional leaders understand this fact and we're hopeful that they will find a way to at least begin to address this pressing need. 
But amidst all this frustration at the federal level, there is some encouraging news at the state and local level. And with that in mind, we did want to highlight on Slide 14, some of the positive trends we are seeing at the state level for infrastructure funding. 
In general, state and local tax revenues have grown and mirrored the overall economic recovery. The state and local tax revenues approach all-time highs levels, they provide stronger support for infrastructure funding. Additionally, many states, including several in Vulcan service area are tapping into other funding initiatives to bolster transportation and other infrastructure construction. At some basic level, this is a matter of responding to the demands of voters, servicing the requirements of growing population centers and importantly, competing with other states.
Our primary goal today is simply to note this important trend as it is one reason we remain confident that aggregates demand associated with public highway and infrastructure spending will at least continue to grow at a slow but -- at a slow but steady space for the next several years.
To just briefly highlight a couple of very recent examples, I'll point to Georgia and Texas. Georgia very recently enacted new funding for its DOT, providing approximately $900 million in additional dollars annually, indexes agree and fuel economy standards and a near doubling of the overall program. This legislation also eliminates or heavily constrains transfers or transportation revenues to other uses. This improves state level funding complements the decision of several counties in Georgia to levy an additional 1% sales tax for local road funding. This is very good news for our Georgia business.
In Texas, the State House and Senate each recently passed bills to increase transportation infrastructure investments further. Should final legislation be an enacted along these lines, annual funding would increase by a projected $2.5 billion to $3 billion. This commitment comes on the heels of Proposition 1 approved by voters in November and was directly approximately $1.8 billion in new funds to road repairs and maintenance. 
Again, these just 2 examples of the type of actions we're seeing across more and more of the states we serve. The states recognize the federal program is necessary, but not sufficient and they are moving to top new sustainable sources of revenue to protect those funds from being redirected to non-transportation usages and to invest in their future economic competitiveness.
I'd now like to review our full year outlook, which you see summarized on Slide 15. We have not come, at this time, adjusted our full year EBITDA guidance from the range presented in February. As we've noted many times, overall first quarter results do not always provide a reliable read-through for the full year. That said, the underlying volume and pricing fundamentals during the first quarter were certainly encouraging and they underscore not only the improvement -- the improvements embedded in our 2015 outlook, but also our longer-term targets. If diesel prices remain around current levels, we currently would expect to finish 2015 toward the high end of our EBITDA guidance range. 
In support of this of view and our overall sense of confidence and excitement, let me briefly walk through the assumptions underpinning our full year outlook. With respect to aggregate shipments, our 9% same-store growth in Q1 was on track with our full year outlook of up approximately 8%, despite weather deferring some shipments into leaders in the year. The gradual recovery in demand appears to continue across all end-use segments and across the vast majority of our geographies. We remain very excited about the continuing recovery in demand and its implications for our full year shipments. 
Moving now to aggregates pricing. The momentum we currently see is consistent with or trending ahead of our 6% outlook for the full year. As Tom noted, April 1 price increases appear to have held up well and we expect to see more price improvements throughout the year. We remain confident in the 6% target and we expect many of our markets to see price growth well in excess of that rate. Pricing fundamentals are strong and getting stronger in many markets. 
In terms of overall gross profit for the Aggregates segment, our local teams continue to execute very well, converting well over 60% of incremental freight-adjusted revenues into gross profit. Unit margins continue to improve and to improve faster than pricing alone would indicate.
Diesel prices, as noted, have provided a tailwind and have help to offset certain cost and current making rising demand during often wet, cold operating conditions. We remain very confident in the full year gross profit outlook for the segment. 
Our asphalt and concrete segments have also seen rising profitability, both on a same-store basis and as a result of recent acquisitions, divestitures and swap activity. These businesses remain on track to meet or exceed their full year gross profit targets, although we should note that margins in these business can be more difficult to forecast. 
And finally, SAG for the quarter remained flat to the prior year. We remain very focused on leveraging SAG expense to revenue as the recovery moves forward.
All in all, our business is enjoying strong momentum in volumes, pricing, margins and capital productivity. Our teams are executing very well, serving our customers well and focusing on what they can control. The history of any guide we're likely to hit a quarterly bump or 2 somewhere in the multiyear road to construction activity, but the underlying fundamentals remain very exciting.
With that, I will turn call back over to Tom for closing comments."

I guess the thing we headline most is that we feel very confident of the underlying momentum and the underlying momentum is obviously more consistent with our annual guidance than it would be the number you see in just the first quarter. But a few other comments. I think and just because you asked, Ted, in comparison to other numbers, let's just take Martin's number from last week, certainly, that's a very good headline number and we take it as another indication of the improving fundamentals in the markets that we serve. It's very hard for us as outsiders to make a true apples-to-apples comparison when you take into account freight impacts and geographic and product mix impacts, the impacts of the TXI acquisition and those kinds of things. But that said, I think if we step that, our best guess would that we're seeing of the very same things. As Tom noted, our pricing in Texas for the quarter was up 10-plus percent. Our overall pricing outlook for the year, frankly, is roughly in line with the Martin's new guidance even though we don't measure pricing exactly the same way. Our flow-throughs, I think, very consistent, despite the difference in headline price numbers. So when we step back from all that, I would guess or expect that we see very much the same thing. And we just reiterate, again, confidence in the full year price outlook we put out there, confidence in the trends, confidence and the ability to convert incremental shipments and pricing into gross profit and confidence in the longer-term fundamentals beyond just one quarter. What we're seeing in terms of volume, what we're seeing in terms of price, what we're seeing in terms of margin expansion all still on track."

First obviously going to continue to make their the required capital reinvestment back in our franchise. And those protected long-term health and our value as it is and they actually drive the many of the productivity benefits you see in our quarterly results quarter-after-quarter. So that, for this year, that $250 million of CapEx, that's obviously a priority. We'll continue to do that in a very, very efficient way. But we're not going to short change our core asset base. It's too valuable. Secondly, as we've noted, we're going to maintain our financials strength throughout the cycle. Event actions we've taken, that shouldn't be a significant use of cash and in the foreseeable future. But I would call it out as something we're committed to maintain. Next, on dividends, this is obviously a board level decision. But it's our expectation that our dividends would continue to grow with earnings and we think earnings could grow quite quickly during the recovery part of the cycle. But, again, that's a board decision that they will take in due course. Then we turn to largely bolt-on M&A. Really the kind you've seen us do in the last 2 to 3 years. We think that's a very good use of capital, very good returns, both on a stand-alone basis and in terms of its impact on the rest of our business. And so as we find the right assets at the right price, we'll continue to pursue those opportunities. We work through all that and we expect that over time, we'll still have some excess cash after all these other uses. And as stated, we will look to return some portion of that cash in the recovery cycle, if not most of that cash to investors. And ceramics of dividend and share repurchase, but I do say, primarily opportunistic share repurchase will be our current thinking."

We are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter. Despite bad weather in many of our markets, we enjoyed strong earnings growth and margin expansion on higher revenues, underscoring my confidence in our full year outlook. We'",1357,"Thank you, Mark. We are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter. Despite bad weather in many of our markets, we enjoyed strong earnings growth and margin expansion on higher revenues, underscoring my confidence in our full year outlook. We're excited about the continuity and accelerating demand across our markets. We're excited about increasing pricing momentum, and pricing will continue to escalate throughout the year. We're also very pleased with our operating performance in the quarter. 
In spite of the difficulties posed by bad weather, our local teams did a great job driving incremental revenue to the bottom line, balancing price, volume, sales and production mix, along with operating efficiencies and leverage. The first quarter is always choppy, but we still saw healthy growth and good operating execution. 
Adjusted EBITDA was up 97%, total gross profit increased 128%, and same-store shipments increased 9%. Cash gross profit per ton increased 17%, with strong flow-through in aggregates gross profit, 68%, on incremental freight-adjusted revenue. Same-store pricing increased 4%, with strong pricing momentum across most markets. With improving market conditions and our focus on profit improvements, both pricing and margins continue to expand. We are extremely well-positioned to achieve strong earnings growth in 2015 and beyond. 
Slide 3 shows the quality of our first quarter execution. It shows how we continue to convert incremental revenues into earnings growth. Total revenues, excluding freight and delivery, increased 8%, while adjusted EBITDA almost doubled to $77 million. This was due to strong earnings growth in aggregates and earnings improvement in each of our non-aggregates segment, while we held SAG cost flat. 
Our profitability continued to improve significantly whether measured by a margin percentage or a per unit profit. We achieved these results despite the prolonged bad weather in many key markets. 
Now let's look at our aggregate shipments map on Slide 4. I like the color of this slide. Momentum in shipments continue with strong growth in key states such as California, Florida, Texas, Virginia, North Carolina and Illinois. Volume in Texas was up 22% or 15% on a same-store basis, and North Carolina was up 29% despite bad weather. Georgia volumes were down due to extremely bad weather, but Georgia construction activity continues to heat up and Georgia is on the road to a very good run. 
Slide 5 shows the continuing volume growth across Vulcan's footprint. This momentum is driven by strengthening private construction activity and supported by highway construction. It's occurring across all end-use segments. This is as a result of the increasing number of large projects and growing highway demand as states ramp up their highway programs. Shipments grew 13% in total and 9% on a same-store basis in the first quarter even with the impact of bad weather in the Mid-Atlantic, the Southeast and in Texas. 
The growth rate in aggregates volume on a trailing 12-month same-store basis has continued to accelerate, led by strong growth in Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, Texas and Virginia, while aggregate shipments in California and Georgia also had solid growth. 
We continue to see healthy price growth, and pricing momentum is accelerating. We had a number of markets with high single-digit or double-digit price increases. For example, Miami was up almost $1.50 per ton; Tampa, over $2.40; Charlotte, over $1.70; Charleston, almost $2 per ton; and the Houston market was up $2; and overall, Texas prices were up over 10%.
We did have some headwinds on both geographic and product mix, with high volumes in lower-price states like Arizona and Illinois, and much larger shipments of base and finds on new construction and large projects, especially in Virginia, North Carolina. Now this is not a bad thing as the volume and product splits helped our overall profitability. 
We continue to see confidence in our customers' view of the market and their acceptance of price increases. There will be a lot more to come as we have secured April price increases in a number of key markets. For example, Texas, Georgia and Alabama all secured new increases of over $1 a ton in April. Prices will escalate throughout the year as new prices -- new price increases are initiated and realized on both fixed plant work and new bid work. The pricing momentum is what you have come to expect from our industry and from Vulcan. What we are equally excited about is our ability to take top line freight-adjusted revenue growth straight to the bottom line. 
In our last couple of calls, we've talked about the 3 profit drivers that are expanding margins and profits. On Slide 7, you can see our gross profit per ton increased 62%. So in the quarter, price was up $0.44 per ton, but gross profit was up $0.80.
Our sales and operating teams continue doing an outstanding job of turning demand growth into higher levels of profitability. They are the best in the business at managing the mix of price, operating efficiencies, volume and product. 
This story of unit margin expansion isn't a new one for us. There's a trend here, not just a quarter story. As you can see on Slide 8, looking at this over time, we've continued to compound unit profitability faster than pricing. During the last 12 months, our freight-adjusted average unit price has increased 3% or $0.30 per ton. Over that same time period, our gross profit per ton has increased 19% or $0.63 per ton. This is a higher unit profit than when these operations were producing twice the volume. We are still in the early stages of recovery. We are very pleased with this momentum.
Demand for our products continues to accelerate, and I am extremely proud of the way our people are focused on unit margin growth. Slide 9 illustrates our incremental margin performance in our aggregate segment. Incremental gross profit margin for the quarter was 68%, excluding the impact of acquisitions completed in 2014. 
Aggregates gross profit grew by $31 million on incremental freight-adjusted revenues of $46 million. Including the impact of acquisitions, the incremental margin was 52% as the gross margin on those revenues was impacted by acquisition accounting and seasonality. 
Since quarterly figures could be distorted by weather or onetime costs, we are also presenting the same metric calculated on a trailing 12-month basis. For the trailing 12 months that end this quarter, incremental gross profit margin was also 68%, adjusted for the same acquisition.
Aggregates gross profit increased approximately $148 million on incremental revenues of $229 million. Given our strategic focus on the aggregates business, gross profit flow-through is a big advantage to Vulcan as volumes continue to recover. 
With Slide 10, we can step back and look at the big picture, seeing the significant progress in the aggregates segment of our business. Before the recovery began, our annualized volumes troughed at 140 million tons to the 12 months ending in the second quarter of 2013. Since that time, we've added 26 million tons on an annualized basis. Nice, but still a far cry from normal demand. However, we've been able to increase segment gross profit by $216 million, with unit margin increasing 35%. 
Again, our people were executing on the disciplines that grow gross profit. These results also foreshadow the earnings power of our aggregates business as we return to more normal levels of demand and as pricing fundamentals begin to improve. 
Slide 11 shows our asphalt and concrete results for the quarter. Both of these businesses are improving on a same-store basis and as a result of transactions that we have made to improve our portfolio.
Asphalt gross profit for the quarter was approximately $9 million, a year-over-year improvement of $4 million, driven by higher margins and earnings from existing operations. On a same-store basis, asphalt volumes increased 6% from the prior year. Unit profitability increased sharply. 
First quarter concrete gross profit was $1 million compared to a loss of $9 million in the prior year. Excluding the company's divested Florida and California concrete businesses, unit profitability improved dramatically. Gross profit increased $6 million.
Now I'll turn the call over to John for comments on capital allocation and our outlook. John?"

Capital allocation and capital efficiency, of course, remained critical areas of focus for our management team, and we gear our approach towards sustained value creation for our shareholders. As it relates to the allocation of capital across our business portfolio, let me remind you that in the first quarter, we completed an asset swap with CEMEX, under which we exchanged our Southern California concrete operations for 13 asphalt operations primarily in Arizona. Vulcan will continue to supply aggregates to the swapped concrete operations, and you'll see a $5.9 million gain on this transaction included in this quarter's financials. We believe this transaction will prove valuable for both parties as each should be able to earn a higher return on the acquired assets than the prior owner.
Now let me turn from business development activities to the ongoing management of our capital structure and capital costs. As part of our February 25 Investor Day presentation, we outlined certain actions intended to refinance near-term maturities, lower our weighted average interest expense and extend the overall duration of our debt portfolio. Slide 12 summarizes these actions, which are now substantially complete.
On March 16, we issued $400 million of 10-year notes priced at 4.5%. This issue was very well-received, and the pricing reflects our now stronger and rapidly improving credit profile. Those funds, along with borrowings under an expanded revolving credit facility, have been or will be used for the refinancing of $620 million of maturities otherwise due between now and 2018 as well as to smaller notes due in '21 and '22, for a total refinancing of approximately $640 million. 
The left-hand slide of -- side of Slide 12 summarizes the relevant sources and uses of cash. And the right-hand side of the slide presents the relevant accounting charges, both the $21.7 million incurred in Q1 and the $46.9 million we project to incur for Q2.
Now let me turn briefly to Slide 13 to recap the impact of these recent transactions on our overall financial strength and flexibility. Let me first remind you that we have maintained our overall level of debt at approximately $2 billion. We're quite comfortable with that level of debt at this time given our expectations for 2015 EBITDA and our strengthening outlook. Though we have improved the structuring cost of our debt portfolio, as you see on the slide, we now effectively have no maturities due before 2018 and the total of approximately $500 million due before 2020. By the end of this year, when we refinance our 2015 notes at maturity, we will have added a modest amount of lower-cost floating rate debt to our mix, a move which makes sense for our business. In total, our weighted average interest rate will have dropped by approximately 120 basis points to 6.5%.
We expect to achieve credit metrics consistent with investment-grade benchmarks during the course of this year. And as our credit position continues to strengthen, we should have further opportunities to improve the overall structure and cost of our debt portfolio. We should also have the cash flows and the investment capacity needed to both reinvest in our business and return capital to shareholders. 
Now let me make a couple of comments about end markets and our outlook for 2015 before handing the call back to Tom. As noted earlier and as you see reflected in our Q1 results, construction activity continues to recover in Vulcan-served markets, although it remains far below long-term trend levels. As outlined in our February call, we continue to see gradually improving demand in each of the major end markets we serve. 
The Federal Highway Program receives much attention at the moment and deservedly so. Like other observers, we expect an extension of the current legislation, during which time, leaders in Congress will seek agreement on funding sources for a new long-term bill. Although several states have delayed work due to uncertainty at the federal level, we currently do not anticipate a major disruption to our projected volumes for 2015. In fact, given our current backlogs and the patterns of new project starts in Vulcan-served states, we remain confident in growing our shipments to public transportation and infrastructure end uses. 
Now the deteriorating state of the nation's transportation infrastructure and its very real cost to the average American family have become more evident with each passing month. We believe that our congressional leaders understand this fact and we're hopeful that they will find a way to at least begin to address this pressing need. 
But amidst all this frustration at the federal level, there is some encouraging news at the state and local level. And with that in mind, we did want to highlight on Slide 14 some of the positive trends we are seeing at the state level for infrastructure funding. 
In general, state and local tax revenues have grown and mirrored the overall economic recovery. As state and local tax revenues approach all-time high levels, they provide stronger support for public infrastructure funding. Additionally, many states, and including several in Vulcan's service area, are tapping into other funding initiatives to bolster transportation and other infrastructure construction. At some basic level, this is a matter of responding to the demands of voters, servicing the requirements of growing population centers and importantly, competing with other states.
Our primary goal today is simply to note this important trend as it is one reason we remain confident that aggregates demand associated with public highway and infrastructure spending will at least continue to grow at a slow but steady pace for the next several years.
To just briefly highlight a couple of very recent examples, I'll point to Georgia and Texas. Georgia very recently enacted new funding for its DOT, providing approximately $900 million in additional dollars annually, indexed to CPI and fuel economy standards and a near doubling of the overall program. This legislation also eliminates or heavily constrains transfers of transportation revenues to other uses. This improves state-level funding that complements the decision of several counties in Georgia to levy an additional 1% sales tax for local road funding. This is very good news for our Georgia business.
In Texas, the State House and Senate each recently passed bills to increase transportation infrastructure investments further. Should final legislation be enacted along these lines, annual funding would increase by a projected $2.5 billion to $3 billion. This commitment comes on the heels of Proposition 1, approved by voters in November, and which directed approximately $1.8 billion in new funds to road repairs and maintenance. 
Again, these are just 2 examples of the type of action we're seeing across more and more of the states we serve. States recognize the federal program is necessary but not sufficient, and they are moving to tap new sustainable sources of revenue to protect those funds from being redirected to non-transportation usages and to invest in their future economic competitiveness.
I'd now like to review our full year outlook, which you see summarized on Slide 15. We have not, at this time, adjusted our full year EBITDA guidance from the range presented in February. As we've noted many times, overall first quarter results do not always provide a reliable read-through for the full year. That said, the underlying volume and pricing fundamentals during the first quarter were certainly encouraging, and they underscore not only the improved -- the improvements embedded in our 2015 outlook, but also our longer-term targets. If diesel prices remain around current levels, we currently would expect to finish 2015 toward the high end of our EBITDA guidance range. 
In support of this of view and our overall sense of confidence and excitement, let me briefly walk through the assumptions underpinning our full year outlook. With respect to aggregate shipments, our 9% same-store growth in Q1 was on track with our full year outlook of up approximately 8%, despite weather deferring some shipments into later in the year. The gradual recovery in demand appears to continue across all end-use segments and across the vast majority of our geographies. We remain very excited about the continuing recovery in demand and its implications for our full year shipments. 
Moving now to aggregates pricing. The momentum we currently see is consistent with or trending ahead of our 6% outlook for the full year. As Tom noted, April 1 price increases appear to have held up well, and we expect to see more price improvement throughout the year. We remain confident in the 6% target, and we expect many of our markets to see price growth well in excess of that rate. Pricing fundamentals are strong and getting stronger in many markets. 
In terms of overall gross profit for the aggregates segment, our local teams continue to execute very well, converting well over 60% of incremental freight-adjusted revenues into gross profit. Unit margins continue to improve and to improve faster than pricing alone would indicate.
Diesel prices, as noted, have provided a tailwind and have helped offset certain costs inherent in meeting rising demand during often wet, cold operating conditions. We remain very confident in the full year gross profit outlook for the segment. 
Our asphalt and concrete segments have also seen rising profitability, both on a same-store basis and as a result of recent acquisitions, divestitures and swap activity. These businesses remain on track to meet or exceed their full year gross profit targets, although we should note that margins in these businesses can be more difficult to forecast. 
And finally, SAG for the quarter remained flat to the prior year. We remain very focused on leveraging SAG expense to revenues as the recovery moves forward.
All in all, our business is enjoying strong momentum in volumes, pricing, margins and capital productivity. Our teams are executing very well, serving our customers well and focusing on what they can control. If history is any guide, we're likely to hit a quarterly bump or 2 somewhere on the multiyear road to normal construction activity, but the underlying fundamentals remain very exciting.
With that, I will turn the call back over to Tom for closing comments."

I guess the thing we headline most is that we feel very confident of the underlying momentum, and the underlying momentum is obviously more consistent with our annual guidance than it would be the number you see in just the first quarter. But a few other comments. I think -- and just because you asked, Ted, in comparison to other numbers, and let's just take Martin's number from last week, certainly, that's a very good headline number and we take it as another indication of the improving fundamentals in many of the markets that we serve. It's very hard for us as outsiders to make a true apples-to-apples comparison when you take into account freight impacts and geographic and product mix impacts, the impacts of the TXI acquisition and those kind of things. But that said, I think if we step back, our best guess would be that we're seeing many of the very same things. As Tom noted, our pricing in Texas for the quarter was up 10-plus percent. Our overall pricing outlook for the year, frankly, is roughly in line with Martin's new guidance, even though we don't measure pricing exactly the same way. Our flow-throughs, I think, were very consistent despite the difference in headline price numbers. So when you step back from all that, I would guess or expect that we see very much the same thing. And we, just to reiterate, again, confidence in the full year price outlook we've put out there, confidence in the trends, confidence in the ability to convert incremental shipments and pricing into gross profit and confidence in the longer-term fundamentals beyond just 1 quarter. What we're seeing in terms of volumes, what we're seeing in terms of price, what we're seeing in terms of margin expansion, all still on trend."

So there's -- while overall, liquid has gone down, we've got some markets where it's not going down nearly as much as it has in others.

First, we're obviously going to continue to make the required capital reinvestments back in our franchise. And those protect the long-term health and value of our asset base, and they actually drive many of the productivity benefits you see in our quarterly results quarter-after-quarter. So that, for this year, that $250 million of CapEx, that's obviously a priority. We'll continue to do that in a very, very efficient way. But we're not going to shortchange our core asset base. It's too valuable. Secondly, as we've noted, we're going to maintain our financial strength throughout the cycle. Given the actions we've taken, that shouldn't be a significant use of cash in the foreseeable future. But I would call it out as something we're committed to maintain. Next, on dividends, this is obviously a board-level decision. But it's our expectation that our dividends will continue to grow with earnings, and we think earnings could grow quite quickly during the recovery part of the cycle. But again, that's a board decision that they will take in due course. Then we turn to largely bolt-on M&A, really of the kind you've seen us do in the last 2 or 3 years. We think that's a very good use of capital, it tends to have very good returns, both on a standalone basis and in terms of its impact on the rest of our business. And so as we find the right assets at the right price, we'll continue to pursue those opportunities. We work through all that and we expect that over time, we will still have some excess cash after all of those other uses. And as stated, we will look to return some portion of that cash in the recovery cycle, if not most of that cash, to investors and through a mix of dividend and share repurchase, but I'd say, primarily, opportunistic share repurchase will be our current thinking."

We are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter. Despite bad weather in many of our markets, we enjoyed strong earnings growth and margin expansion on higher revenues, underscoring my confidence in our full year outlook. We'",1356,"Thank you, Mark. We are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter. Despite bad weather in many of our markets, we enjoyed strong earnings growth and margin expansion on higher revenues, underscoring my confidence in our full year outlook. We're excited about the continuity and accelerating demand across our markets. We're excited about increasing pricing momentum, and pricing will continue to escalate throughout the year. We're also very pleased with our operating performance in the quarter. 
In spite of the difficulties posed by bad weather, our local teams did a great job driving incremental revenue to the bottom line, balancing price, volume, sales and production mix, along with operating efficiencies and leverage. The first quarter is always choppy, but we still saw healthy growth and good operating execution. 
Adjusted EBITDA was up 97%, total gross profit increased 128%, and same-store shipments increased 9%. Cash gross profit per ton increased 17%, with strong flow-through in aggregates gross profit, 68%, on incremental freight-adjusted revenue. Same-store pricing increased 4%, with strong pricing momentum across most markets. With improving market conditions and our focus on profit improvements, both pricing and margins continue to expand. We are extremely well-positioned to achieve strong earnings growth in 2015 and beyond. 
Slide 3 shows the quality of our first quarter execution. It shows how we continue to convert incremental revenues into earnings growth. Total revenues, excluding freight and delivery, increased 8%, while adjusted EBITDA almost doubled to $77 million. This was due to strong earnings growth in aggregates and earnings improvement in each of our non-aggregates segments, while we held SAG cost flat. 
Our profitability continued to improve significantly whether measured by a margin percentage or per-unit profit. We achieved these results despite the prolonged bad weather in many key markets. 
Now let's look at our aggregate shipments map on Slide 4. I like the color of this slide. Momentum in shipments continue, with strong growth in key states such as California, Florida, Texas, Virginia, North Carolina and Illinois. Volume in Texas was up 22% or 15% on a same-store basis, and North Carolina was up 29% despite bad weather. Georgia volumes were down due to extremely bad weather, but Georgia construction activity continues to heat up and Georgia is on the road to a very good run. 
Slide 5 shows the continuing volume growth across Vulcan's footprint. This momentum is driven by strengthening private construction activity and supported by highway construction. It's occurring across all end-use segments. This is a result of the increasing number of large projects and growing highway demand as states ramp up their highway programs. Shipments grew 13% in total and 9% on a same-store basis in the first quarter, even with the impact of bad weather in the Mid-Atlantic, the Southeast and in Texas. 
The growth rate in aggregates volume on a trailing 12-month same-store basis has continued to accelerate, led by strong growth in Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, Texas and Virginia, while aggregate shipments in California and Georgia also had solid growth. 
We continue to see healthy price growth, and pricing momentum is accelerating. We had a number of markets with high single-digit or double-digit price increases. For example, Miami was up almost $1.50 per ton; Tampa, over $2.40; Charlotte, over $1.70; Charleston, almost $2 per ton; and the Houston market was up $2; and overall, Texas prices were up over 10%.
We did have some headwinds on both geographic and product mix, with high volumes in lower-price states like Arizona and Illinois, and much larger shipments of base and finds on new construction and large projects, especially in Virginia and North Carolina. Now this is not a bad thing as the volume and product splits helped our overall profitability. 
We continue to see confidence in our customers' view of the market and their acceptance of price increases. There will be a lot more to come as we have secured April price increases in a number of key markets. For example, Texas, Georgia and Alabama all secured new increases of over $1 a ton in April. Prices will escalate throughout the year as new prices -- as new price increases are initiated and realized on both fixed plant work and new bid work. The pricing momentum is what you have come to expect from our industry and from Vulcan. What we are equally excited about is our ability to take top line freight-adjusted revenue growth straight to the bottom line. 
In our last couple of calls, we've talked about the 3 profit drivers that are expanding margins and profits. On Slide 7, you can see our gross profit per ton increased 62%. So in the quarter, price was up $0.44 per ton, but gross profit was up $0.80.
Our sales and operating teams continue doing an outstanding job of turning demand growth into higher levels of profitability. They are the best in the business at managing the mix of price, operating efficiencies, volume and product. 
This story of unit margin expansion isn't a new one for us. There's a trend here, not just a quarter story. As you can see on Slide 8, looking at this over time, we've continued to compound unit profitability faster than pricing. During the last 12 months, our freight-adjusted average unit price has increased 3% or $0.30 per ton. Over that same time period, our gross profit per ton has increased 19% or $0.63 per ton. This is a higher unit profit than when these operations were producing twice the volume. We are still in the early stages of recovery. We are very pleased with this momentum.
Demand for our products continues to accelerate, and I am extremely proud of the way our people are focused on unit margin growth. Slide 9 illustrates our incremental margin performance in our aggregate segment. Incremental gross profit margin for the quarter was 68%, excluding the impact of acquisitions completed in 2014. 
Aggregates gross profit grew by $31 million on incremental freight-adjusted revenues of $46 million. Including the impact of acquisitions, the incremental margin was 52% as the gross margin on those revenues was impacted by acquisition accounting and seasonality. 
Since quarterly figures could be distorted by weather or onetime costs, we are also presenting the same metric calculated on a trailing 12-month basis. For the trailing 12 months that ended this quarter, incremental gross profit margin was also 68%, adjusted for the same acquisition.
Aggregates gross profit increased approximately $148 million on incremental revenues of $229 million. Given our strategic focus on the aggregates business, gross profit flow-through is a big advantage to Vulcan as volumes continue to recover. 
With Slide 10, we can step back and look at the big picture, seeing the significant progress in the aggregates segment of our business. Before the recovery began, our annualized volumes troughed at 140 million tons for the 12 months ending in the second quarter of 2013. Since that time, we've added 26 million tons on an annualized basis. Nice, but still a far cry from normal demand. However, we've been able to increase segment gross profit by $216 million, with unit margins increasing 35%. 
Again, our people were executing on the disciplines that grow gross profit. These results also foreshadow the earnings power of our aggregates business as we return to more normal levels of demand and as pricing fundamentals begin to improve. 
Slide 11 shows our asphalt and concrete results for the quarter. Both of these businesses are improving on a same-store basis and as a result of transactions that we have made to improve our portfolio.
Asphalt gross profit for the quarter was approximately $9 million, a year-over-year improvement of $4 million, driven by higher margins and earnings from existing operations. On a same-store basis, asphalt volumes increased 6% from the prior year. Unit profitability increased sharply. 
First quarter concrete gross profit was $1 million compared to a loss of $9 million in the prior year. Excluding the company's divested Florida and California concrete businesses, unit profitability improved dramatically. Gross profit increased $6 million.
Now I'll turn the call over to John for comments on capital allocation and our outlook. John?"

Capital allocation and capital efficiency, of course, remained critical areas of focus for our management team, and we gear our approach towards sustained value creation for our shareholders. As it relates to the allocation of capital across our business portfolio, let me remind you that in the first quarter we completed an asset swap with CEMEX, under which we exchanged our Southern California concrete operations for 13 asphalt operations primarily in Arizona. Vulcan will continue to supply aggregates to the swapped concrete operations, and you'll see a $5.9 million gain on this transaction included in this quarter's financials. We believe this transaction will prove valuable for both parties as each should be able to earn a higher return on the acquired assets than the prior owner.
Now let me turn from business development activities to the ongoing management of our capital structure and capital costs. As part of our February 25 Investor Day presentation, we outlined certain actions intended to refinance near-term maturities, lower our weighted average interest expense and extend the overall duration of our debt portfolio. Slide 12 summarizes these actions, which are now substantially complete.
On March 16, we issued $400 million of 10-year notes priced at 4.5%. This issue was very well-received, and the pricing reflects our now stronger and rapidly improving credit profile. Those funds, along with borrowings under an expanded revolving credit facility, have been or will be used for the refinancing of $620 million of maturities otherwise due between now and 2018, as well as 2 smaller notes due in '21 and '22, for a total refinancing of approximately $640 million. 
The left-hand slide of -- side of Slide 12 summarizes the relevant sources and uses of cash. And the right-hand side of the slide presents the relevant accounting charges, both the $21.7 million incurred in Q1 and the $46.9 million we project to incur for Q2.
Now let me turn briefly to Slide 13 to recap the impact of these recent transactions on our overall financial strength and flexibility. Let me first remind you that we have maintained our overall level of debt at approximately $2 billion. We're quite comfortable with that level of debt at this time given our expectations for 2015 EBITDA and our strengthening outlook. Though we have improved the structuring cost of our debt portfolio, as you see on the slide, we now effectively have no maturities due before 2018 and a total of approximately $500 million due before 2020. By the end of this year, when we refinance our 2015 notes at maturity, we will have added a modest amount of lower-cost floating rate debt to our mix, a move which makes sense for our business. In total, our weighted average interest rate will have dropped by approximately 120 basis points to 6.5%.
We expect to achieve credit metrics consistent with investment-grade benchmarks during the course of this year. And as our credit position continues to strengthen, we should have further opportunities to improve the overall structure and costs of our debt portfolio. We should also have the cash flows and the investment capacity needed to both reinvest in our business and return capital to shareholders. 
Now let me make a couple of comments about end markets and our outlook for 2015 before handing the call back to Tom. As noted earlier and as you see reflected in our Q1 results, construction activity continues to recover in Vulcan-served markets, although it remains far below long-term trend levels. As outlined in our February call, we continue to see gradually improving demand in each of the major end markets we serve. 
The Federal Highway Program receives much attention at the moment and deservedly so. Like other observers, we expect an extension of the current legislation, during which time leaders in Congress will seek agreement on funding sources for a new long-term bill. Although several states have delayed work due to uncertainty at the federal level, we currently do not anticipate a major disruption to our projected volumes for 2015. In fact, given our current backlogs and the patterns of new project starts in Vulcan-served states, we remain confident in growing our shipments to public transportation and infrastructure end uses. 
Now the deteriorating state of the nation's transportation infrastructure and its very real cost to the average American family become more evident with each passing month. We believe that our congressional leaders understand this fact and we're hopeful that they will find a way to at least begin to address this pressing need. 
But amidst all this frustration at the federal level, there is some encouraging news at the state and local level. And with that in mind, we did want to highlight on Slide 14 some of the positive trends we are seeing at the state level for infrastructure funding. 
In general, state and local tax revenues have grown and mirrored the overall economic recovery. As state and local tax revenues approach all-time high levels, they provide stronger support for public infrastructure funding. Additionally, many states, and including several in Vulcan's service area, are tapping into other funding initiatives to bolster transportation and other infrastructure construction. At some basic level, this is a matter of responding to the demands of voters, servicing the requirements of growing population centers and, importantly, competing with other states.
Our primary goal today is simply to note this important trend as it is one reason we remain confident that aggregates demand associated with public highway and infrastructure spending will at least continue to grow at a slow but steady pace for the next several years.
To just briefly highlight a couple of very recent examples, I'll point to Georgia and Texas. Georgia very recently enacted new funding for its DOT, providing approximately $900 million in additional dollars annually, indexed to CPI and fuel economy standards, and a near doubling of the overall program. This legislation also eliminates or heavily constrains transfers of transportation revenues to other uses. This improved state-level funding complements the decision of several counties in Georgia to levy an additional 1% sales tax for local road funding. This is very good news for our Georgia business.
In Texas, the State House and Senate each recently passed bills to increase transportation infrastructure investments further. Should final legislation be enacted along these lines, annual funding would increase by a projected $2.5 billion to $3 billion. This commitment comes on the heels of Proposition 1, approved by voters in November, and which directed approximately $1.8 billion in new funds to road repairs and maintenance. 
Again, these are just 2 examples of the type of action we're seeing across more and more of the states we serve. States recognize the federal program is necessary but not sufficient, and they are moving to tap new sustainable sources of revenue to protect those funds from being redirected to non-transportation usages and to invest in their future economic competitiveness.
I'd now like to review our full year outlook, which you see summarized on Slide 15. We have not, at this time, adjusted our full year EBITDA guidance from the range presented in February. As we've noted many times, overall first quarter results do not always provide a reliable read-through for the full year. That said, the underlying volume and pricing fundamentals during the first quarter were certainly encouraging, and they underscore not only the improved -- the improvements embedded in our 2015 outlook, but also our longer-term targets. If diesel prices remain around current levels, we currently would expect to finish 2015 toward the high end of our EBITDA guidance range. 
In support of this of view and our overall sense of confidence and excitement, let me briefly walk through the assumptions underpinning our full year outlook. With respect to aggregate shipments, our 9% same-store growth in Q1 was on track with our full year outlook of up approximately 8%, despite weather deferring some shipments into later in the year. The gradual recovery in demand appears to continue across all end-use segments and across the vast majority of our geographies. We remain very excited about the continuing recovery in demand and its implications for our full year shipments. 
Moving now to aggregates pricing. The momentum we currently see is consistent with or trending ahead of our 6% outlook for the full year. As Tom noted, April 1 price increases appear to have held up well, and we expect to see more price improvement throughout the year. We remain confident in the 6% target, and we expect many of our markets to see price growth well in excess of that rate. Pricing fundamentals are strong and getting stronger in many markets. 
In terms of overall gross profit for the aggregates segment, our local teams continue to execute very well, converting well over 60% of incremental freight-adjusted revenues into gross profit. Unit margins continue to improve and to improve faster than pricing alone would indicate.
Diesel prices, as noted, have provided a tailwind and have helped offset certain costs inherent in meeting rising demand during often wet, cold operating conditions. We remain very confident in the full year gross profit outlook for the segment. 
Our asphalt and concrete segments have also seen rising profitability, both on a same-store basis and as a result of recent acquisitions, divestitures and swap activity. These businesses remain on track to meet or exceed their full year gross profit targets, although we should note that margins in these businesses can be more difficult to forecast. 
And finally, SAG for the quarter remained flat to the prior year. We remain very focused on leveraging SAG expense to revenues as the recovery moves forward.
All in all, our business is enjoying strong momentum in volumes, pricing, margins and capital productivity. Our teams are executing very well, serving our customers well and focusing on what they can control. If history is any guide, we're likely to hit a quarterly bump or 2 somewhere on the multiyear road to normal construction activity, but the underlying fundamentals remain very exciting.
With that, I will turn the call back over to Tom for closing comments."

I guess the thing we headline most is that we feel very confident of the underlying momentum, and the underlying momentum is obviously more consistent with our annual guidance than it would be the number you would see in just the first quarter. But a few other comments. I think -- and just because you asked, Ted, in comparison to other numbers, and let's just take Martin's number from last week, certainly, that's a very good headline number and we take it as another indication of the improving fundamentals in many of the markets that we serve. It's very hard for us as outsiders to make a true apples-to-apples comparison when you take into account freight impacts and geographic and product mix impacts, the impacts of the TXI acquisition and those kind of things. But that said, I think if we step back, our best guess would be that we're seeing many of the very same things. As Tom noted, our pricing in Texas for the quarter was up 10-plus percent. Our overall pricing outlook for the year, frankly, is roughly in line with Martin's new guidance, even though we don't measure pricing exactly the same way. Our flow-throughs, I think, were very consistent despite the difference in headline price numbers. So when you step back from all that, I would guess or expect that we see very much the same thing. And we, just to reiterate, again, confidence in the full year price outlook we've put out there, confidence in the trends, confidence in the ability to convert incremental shipments and pricing into gross profit and confidence in the longer-term fundamentals beyond just one quarter. What we're seeing in terms of volumes, what we're seeing in terms of price, what we're seeing in terms of margin expansion, all still on trend."

I'd also just note that despite the strong reported numbers in terms of shipment growth, we still had, by our estimate, something on the order of 400,000 tons in each of Texas, Georgia and Virginia deferred from Q1 and delayed a quarter due to weather. And a lot of that, as Tom mentioned in his pricing comments, was fixed plant business. So again, that's not abnormal for a first quarter. But given the wet days we had in those markets and given its impact and available construction days, not an insignificant impact in the quarter, both on volumes and, by extension, on pricing."

First, we're obviously going to continue to make the required capital reinvestments back in our franchise. And those protect the long-term health and value of our asset base, and they actually drive many of the productivity benefits you see in our quarterly results quarter-after-quarter. So that, for this year, that $250 million of CapEx, that's obviously a priority. We'll continue to do that in a very, very efficient way. But we're not going to shortchange our core asset base. It's too valuable. Secondly, as we've noted, we're going to maintain our financial strength throughout the cycle. Given the actions we've taken, that shouldn't be a significant use of cash in the foreseeable future. But I would call it out as something we're committed to maintain. Next, on dividends, this is obviously a board-level decision. But it's our expectation that our dividends would continue to grow with earnings, and we think earnings could grow quite quickly during the recovery part of the cycle. But again, that's a board decision that they will take in due course. Then we turn to largely bolt-on M&A, really of the kind you've seen us do in the last 2, 3 years. We think that's a very good use of capital, tends to have very good returns, both on a standalone basis and in terms of its impact on the rest of our business. And so as we find the right assets at the right price, we'll continue to pursue those opportunities. We work through all that and we expect that over time, we will still have some excess cash after all of those other uses. And as stated, we will look to return some portion of that cash in the recovery cycle, if not most of that cash, to investors and through a mix of dividend and share repurchase, but I'd say, primarily, opportunistic share repurchase will be our current thinking."

Let me begin by thanking our employees for their outstanding performance in the second quarter.

Let me begin by thanking our employees for their outstanding performance in the second quarter. As you all know, weather conditions were unusually bad during the quarter with prolonged wet weather and serious flooding impeding construction activity in many parts of the U.S. In spite of these challenges, we operated safely, served our customers well and delivered strong results. The metrics and slides we'll talk about today are largely the same as in prior quarters. We're on track to have a very good year. Our focus hasn't changed and neither has our optimism regarding continued performance improvement. Construction activity and materials demand continue to recover. Pricing momentum is accelerating, and our employees are doing a really good job converting incremental revenues into incremental profits. 
Despite the bad weather in many of our markets, we enjoyed strong earnings growth and margin expansion on higher revenues, underscoring our confidence in our full year outlook. With improving market conditions and our focus on profit improvements, both pricing and margins continue to expand. As you can see on Slide 4, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.66 per diluted share, an increase of $0.30 from the prior year. Although overall average shipments were lower than expected due to weather, we continue to see expanding gross profit margins and expanding EBITDA margins. As you can see, overall gross profit margins increased by more than 450 basis points. These strong margins were supported by robust pricing momentum. We experienced strong earnings growth in aggregates and in each of our non-aggregates segment. This was also accompanied by declining SAG cost as a percent of sales. In spite of the weather challenges, our people does an outstanding job taking incremental revenue to the bottom line. As we've noted before, our local teams across our footprint are doing a great job managing sales and production mix along with pricing. At the same time, we continue to reap the benefits of improving operating efficiencies and resulting leverage. 
Total gross profit increased 34%, and adjusted EBITDA was up 33%. Same-store shipments increased 5%, and same-store pricing increased over 6% with strong pricing momentum across most markets. Our profitability continue to improve significantly, whether measured by margin percentage or per-unit profit. 
Now let's look at the monthly trend of our aggregates shipments and the impact of weather on Slide 5. Rain in the second quarter reduced the number of available shipping days in key markets, and it certainly postponed shipments. Slide 5 shows the year-over-year change in monthly shipments. You can see the impact of rain on shipments in April and May, up only 5% and 2% on a same-store basis. In April, it was pervasive across most markets with above average rainfall in 13 of our states. In May, severe wet weather affected plant operations and construction activity in Arizona, Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. In June, with the important exceptions of Illinois and Virginia, the weather allowed for more normal days of construction activity, and shipments were robust again the momentum in demand. 
The map on Slide 6 shows a breakdown of 5% growth in aggregate shipments across the country on a same-store basis. Even with all the wet weather, the vast majority of our states experienced healthy growth. Momentum in shipments continued with solid growth in key states, same-store shipments in Florida, Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia saw shipments growth ranging from 5% to 11%. Although California volumes were down 3% due to several large projects that have been delayed until the second half of the year, our full year outlook for shipments growth in California remains unchanged, in our view and that of our customers, this is demand deferred, not lost. 
I'd like to draw your attention to Slide 7, aggregates pricing. As we discussed before, pricing growth tends to lag volume growth. We experienced in the second quarter the initial stages of this improving pricing momentum. We are pleased with a nice increase in freight-adjusted aggregates price of 6.4% in the second quarter, and we fully expect to see pricing accelerate. This is supported by the confidence within our customers' view of the markets. We had 9 major markets where price increases range from $0.60 to $1.20 and another 3 approaching the $0.50 range. In limited instances where we didn't see such robust pricing, it was a function of product mix. We experienced much larger shipments of plants on new construction and large projects, especially in Virginia and North Carolina. Growing volume in [indiscernible] for price, which improves overall profitability. Prices escalate throughout the year as new prices are initiated and as we finish older jobs. As at this point, we also expect second half price increases to exceed 8%. Pricing momentum for Vulcan will continue. We are focused on earning a good return on the significant investments that we in this industry make on behalf of our customers. 
We talk a lot about the 3 profit drivers. They are expanding our margins and profits because they're important. On Slide 8, you can see that our second quarter and trailing 12-month gross profit per ton increased 21% and 23%, respectively. So in the quarter, price was up $0.71 per ton, but gross profit margin was up $0.76 per ton. Our sales and operations teams continue to do an outstanding job, turning demand into higher profitability. Nobody in the business does a better job of managing the combination of price, operating efficiencies, volume and products. We continue to be excited about the ongoing very positive trend in unit margin expansion for Vulcan. It's not a new story. 
As you can see on Slide 9, we have now seen 8 consecutive quarters of expanding unit margin. Since our volumes begin to grow in the second half of 2013, our gross profit per ton has increased sharply, and we are now seeing the additional benefits of strong and ongoing improvement in pricing. Our unit profitability is higher than with these operations were producing twice the volume. 
In the most recent quarter, we saw an increase in repair and maintenance and labor cost. This is not surprising. Growing volumes were acquiring us to run operations longer, resulting in more repairs and wet weather negatively impacts labor efficiencies. This is something that we will be managing very carefully even as we see pricing momentum and continued margin expansion that more than offset these costs. Even though we are still in the early stages of recovery, we are very pleased with this momentum. Demand for products continues to escalate, and I'm extremely proud of the way our people are focused on unit margin growth. 
Slide 10 shows our incremental margin performance in our aggregates segment. Incremental gross profit margin for the second quarter was 74%, excluding the impact of acquisitions completed during 2014. Aggregates gross profit grew about $44 million on incremental freight-adjusted net revenues of $59 million. Including the impact of acquisitions, the incremental margin was 61% with a gross margin on those revenues impacted by acquisition accounting and weather. Since quarterly figures can be distorted by seasonality or onetime cost, we also present the same metric calculated on a trailing 12-month basis. For the trailing 12 months that ended this quarter, incremental gross profit margin was 72%, adjusted for the same acquisitions. Aggregates gross profit increased approximately $157 million on incremental revenues of $219 million. Given our strategic focus on the aggregates business, our ability to take the company to the bottom line is a big advantage to Vulcan as volumes continue to recover. With that, I will now turn the call over to John for additional comments regarding our earnings performance and outlook for the remainder of the year. John?"
312769,307286224,847855,"Vulcan Materials Company, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2015",2015-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Vulcan Materials Company","Executives","Thanks, Tom. I'll start with Slide 11, which effectively serves as the capstone to many of the metrics and trends Tom just highlighted.

I'll start with Slide 11, which effectively serves as the capstone to many of the metrics and trends Tom just highlighted. On this slide, we summarized the improvement in our aggregates segment results since the recovery and volumes began in the second half of 2013. Before the recovery began, our annualized aggregates volumes troughed [ph] at 140 million tons. That was 2 years ago. As of the quarter just ended, our trailing 12 months shipments are 170 million tons. So we've added 30 million tons of aggregates shipments on an annualized basis. This gain reflects a sustained early recovery but remains well below the shipments we'd expect under normal demand conditions. 
Now, importantly, we've been able to increase segment gross profit by just over $260 million during this 2-year period with per ton gross profit increasing more than $1 or over 40%. Certainly, a central part of our strategic and operational focus remains on sustaining these trends and fully capitalizing on the continued recovery toward normal levels of demand for the materials we provide. 
Now let me turn to Slide 12 to briefly look at our asphalt and concrete segment results for the quarter. These businesses also performed well in the quarter, especially given weather-related challenges in Texas, Virginia, Arizona and New Mexico. Our local management of these operations continues to service customers well while also effectively managing material margins. And segment results for both asphalt and concrete have benefited from recent transactions that better focus our asset portfolio. Year-to-date, the gross profit from these businesses has exceeded plan despite weather-related challenges. 
Looking at asphalt segment, you see the gross profit for the quarter was approximately $21 million, a year-over-year improvement of $12 million, driven by strong cost disciplines and margin management as well as the impact of acquired operations. On a same-store basis, asphalt volumes increased 8% from the prior year, and unit profitability increased sharply. And looking at the concrete segment, you see second quarter gross profit was approximately $5 million compared to $3 million in the prior year, as margin improvements helped offset the impact of work deferred due to weather including a record wet June in the Virginia, Maryland area where we have our largest concrete operations. 
Moving now to capital allocation. Slide 13 highlights certain second quarter actions and updates consistent with our previously communicated capital allocation priorities and capital structure goals. These priorities and goals have not changed, and we continue to work diligently against them. First, we continue to make the CapEx investments necessary to sustain the long-term value of our franchise and to meet our customers' rising requirements. Our core CapEx spending for the year remains in line with prior communications at approximately $250 million. In addition, we've committed to replace to 2 of our 3 class ships with transport product from our high-volume quarry in Mexico. The vessels being replaced have over 30 years of service each, and the advantages of our Bluewater distribution network usually merit the investment. We expect progress payments on the construction of the new ships to be approximately $36 million this year with another $85 million spread across 2016 and 2017. 
Next, we intend to maintain our financial strength and flexibility along all parts of the cycle. Consistent with this goal, we've now completed the major components of the refinancing plan outlined during our February Investor Day and discussed at length during our first quarter call. These accomplishments include extending maturities on approximately $620 million of debt, otherwise due over the next 5 years; establishing a new $750 million unsecured credit facility; and lowering our average weighted or lower -- lowering our weighted average interest rate. Our second quarter results include $45 million or $0.24 per diluted share of expense associated with this activity. In addition, we took steps in the second quarter to streamline our corporate legal entity structure. These actions improve our flexibility and reduce certain burdens. For example, significantly reducing the number of state income tax filings we prepare. We expect another outcome to be a more appropriate and efficient allocation of interest expense and overall taxable income across the states in which we operate. We currently anticipate a $3 million to $5 million reduction in the annual state tax expense or an approximately 100 basis point reduction in our overall effective tax rate for 2015. In addition, we may be able to utilize over time all or a portion of approximately $60 million in state-level NOLs, which may otherwise expire unused. Next, we continue to pursue bolt-on acquisitions. During the second quarter for example, we acquired 3 aggregates facilities and 7 ready-mix operations in Arizona and New Mexico for approximately $21 million, complementing our existing positions in these markets. The pipeline of bolt-on acquisitions opportunities remain active, but we will remain a disciplined buyer and as such, the number, size and timing of future transactions remains difficult to predict. As our performance improves, so does our capacity to return capital to shareholders. We continue to believe that we will have the ability to both reinvest for growth and return capital to shareholders as the recovery toward normal demand unfolds. 
Now let me take a couple of -- now let me make a couple of comments about end markets and our outlook for the balance of 2015 before handing the call back over to Tom for some closing remarks and Q&A. As Tom noted earlier and as you can see reflected in our Q2 results, construction activity continues to recover in Vulcan-served markets, although it remains far below long-term trend levels. Looking through the weather and the noise in Congress, we and our customers continue to see gradually improving demand in each of the major end markets we serve. Shipping rates on clear days underscore recovery demand across geographies and across the uses. With few exceptions, construction activity in our markets remains well below long-term cycle trends, but the recovery continues. That would be the main message here. 
Now to touch briefly on some of the underlying trends in private and public construction. With respect to private demand, we continue to see manufacturing and other industrial-related projects continuing the significant nonresidential construction growth. And as you probably know, housing starts, despite month-to-month volatility, continue to trend upward across most Vulcan-served markets. On the public side, large projects have driven recent strength in highway awards. State and local-level funding initiatives support continued growth in road and other infrastructure spending, particularly in the intermediate term. At the federal level, we remain optimistic that a multiyear bill may pass sometime in the fall. Tom will have more to say in this in a moment, but the need for a meaningful multiyear program is understood on both sides of the aisle and recent developments have been well covered in the press. So to the extent, we harbor moderate concerns were regarding our full year 2015 volumes relative to plan, they primarily relate back to first half weather and the capacity of our customers to complete deferred work during the remainder of the available construction season. In several of our markets, key customers find themselves 6 or more weeks behind on scheduled work and the short-term challenges and adding the capacity required to catch up. In addition, the extension into the fall of uncertainty regarding the Federal Highway Program may impact the start date and timing of shipments to certain road infrastructure projects. Again, the marginal risk we see to 2015 shipments is one of timing and potential deferral into 2016. 
Now I'll turn it briefly to Slide 15 and our outlook for the balance of the year. As noted in our earnings release, our full year EBITDA guidance range remains unchanged at $775 million to $825 million, this despite the weather-related challenges of the first half of the year. In short, we anticipate better-than-expected pricing and margin momentum to offset a potential shortfall in 2015 shipments relative to plan. The continued improvement in pricing and unit margins matches our strategic focus and does very well for long-term performance of our value of our franchise. I'll now touch on certain of the modest adjustments we've made to assumptions underlying our full year EBITDA guidance. As stated previously, please view these figures as indicative midpoints of our range of expectations. We want to give you a good feel for how we see the business performing, but we don't want to convey a false sense of position regarding each and every metric. With respect to aggregates shipments, we reduced our midpoint expectations for the year from 180 million tons to 177 million tons. This change reflects the challenges many of our customer face as they try to catch up with deferred work, the longer-than-expected ramp-ups in production in certain of our acquired operations and marginally higher uncertainty regarding start dates and shipping days for certain large projects. Our fundamental view of the continued gradual recovery in demand remains unchanged. With regard to aggregates pricing, we've raised our midpoint expectation for year-over-year growth from 6% to 7%. As Tom noted, pricing fundamentals are strong and getting stronger in many markets. We expect the rate of improvement in the second half to exceed that of the first half. At this point, we would expect these pricing trends to continue into 2016. Due to the potential shortfall in 2015 shipments volumes, we've slightly reduced our midpoint expectation for aggregate segment gross profit. We expect the rate in which incremental freight-adjusted revenues flow through to incremental gross profit to remain roughly in line with recent trailing 12 month trends. Our asphalt and concrete segments have also seen rising profitability, both on a same-store basis and as a result of recent acquisition, divestiture and swap activity. As a result, we raised our midpoint expectation for full year gross profit from these segments from $70 million to $80 million. Our expectations for SAG, DD&A and core CapEx remain largely unchanged. All in all, our businesses enjoy strong momentum in volumes, pricing, margins, and capital productivity. Our teams are executing well, serving our customers well and focused on what they could control. The underlying fundamentals of our business remain very exciting. With that, I will turn the call back over to Tom. Tom?"

We are pleased with the team's performance in the second quarter despite the challenges of extreme weather. Our markets continue to improve in each market segment and across most of our geographic footprint. This growing demand is causing price momentum to pick up robustly, which is clearly demonstrated in the second quarter results. I'm confident in our employees' ability to execute on the disciplines of operating efficiencies to drive cost control and customer service that drives value and price, all of which improve our unit profitability. We're very proud of our employees' hard work and dedication. We're also pleased for the level of activity on the Highway bill in Congress over the last 2 weeks. This culminated on July 30 and as soon as passage of a new 6-year [ph] bill to drive that. This house also last week passed a 3 month extension to map 21 to current bill. This will allow the House time to complete work on its version of the new bill. House and Senate leadership stated their intention to go to conference with the respective bills and send a new multiyear bill to the President for his signature on the poll. This gathered momentum in Congress to adjust federal Highway investments coupled with growing initiatives to improve roads in many states is very encouraging. We, along with many other transportation stakeholders, will continue to press for additional much-needed investments in America's aging infrastructure. As we look forward to the balance of 2015 and into 2016, we're excited about the accelerated momentum in demand and pricing, and the improving execution by our employees. They are finding new ways to improve this company and our profitability every day. Now, if the operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to respond to your questions."

Georgia, very, very healthy. And actually, Georgia got hit a little bit with weather, but that demand just pushed back. And every time the sun comes out in Georgia, we're shipping very strongly.

Let me begin by thanking our employees for their outstanding performance in the second quarter. As you all know, weather conditions were unusually bad during the quarter with prolonged wet weather and serious flooding impeding construction activity in many parts of the U.S. In spite of these challenges, we operated safely, served our customers well and delivered strong results. The metrics and slides we'll talk about today are largely the same as in prior quarters. We're on track to have a very good year. Our focus hasn't changed and neither has our optimism regarding continued performance improvement. Construction activity and materials demand continue to recover. Pricing momentum is accelerating, and our employees are doing a really good job converting incremental revenues into incremental profits.
Despite the bad weather in many of our markets, we enjoyed strong earnings growth and margin expansion on higher revenues, underscoring our confidence in our full year outlook. With improving market conditions and our focus on profit improvements, both pricing and margins continue to expand. As you can see on Slide 4, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.66 per diluted share, an increase of $0.30 from the prior year. Although overall average shipments were lower than expected due to weather, we continue to see expanding gross profit margins and expanding EBITDA margins. As you can see, overall gross profit margins increased by more than 450 basis points. These strong margins were supported by robust pricing momentum. We experienced strong earnings growth in aggregates and in each of our non-aggregates segment. This was also accompanied by declining SAG cost as a percent of sales. In spite of the weather challenges, our people did an outstanding job taking incremental revenue to the bottom line. As we noted before, our local teams across our footprint are doing a great job managing sales and production mix along with pricing. At the same time, we continue to reap the benefits of improving operating efficiencies and resulting leverage.
Total gross profit increased 34%, and adjusted EBITDA was up 33%. Same-store shipments increased 5% and same-store pricing increased over 6%, with strong pricing momentum across most markets. Our profitability continue to improve significantly, whether measured by margin percentage or per-unit profit.
Now let's look at the monthly trend of our aggregates shipments and the impact of weather on Slide 5. Rain in the second quarter reduced the number of available shipping days in key markets, and it certainly postponed shipments. Slide 5 shows the year-over-year change in monthly shipments. You can see the impact of rain on shipments in April and May, up only 5% and 2% on a same-store basis. In April, it was pervasive across most markets with above average rainfall in 13 of our states. In May, severe wet weather affected plant operations and construction activity in Arizona, Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. In June, with the important exceptions of Illinois and Virginia, the weather allowed for more normal days of construction activity, and shipments were robust revealing again the momentum in demand.
The map on Slide 6 shows a breakdown of 5% growth in aggregates shipments across the country on a same-store basis. Even with all the wet weather, the vast majority of our states experienced healthy growth. Momentum in shipments continued with solid growth in key states. Same-store shipments in Florida, Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia saw shipments growth ranging from 5% to 11%. Although California volumes were down 3% due to several large projects that have been delayed until the second half of the year, our full year outlook for shipments growth in California remains unchanged, and our view and that of our customers, this is demand deferred, not lost.
I'd like to draw your attention to Slide 7, aggregates pricing. As we discussed before, pricing growth tends to lag volume growth. We experienced in the second quarter the initial stages of this improving pricing momentum. We are pleased with a nice increase in freight-adjusted aggregates price of 6.4% in the second quarter, and we fully expect to see pricing accelerate. This is supported by the confidence we see in our customers' view of the markets. We had 9 major markets where price increases range from $0.60 to $1.20 and another 3 approaching the $0.50 range. In limited instances where we didn't see such robust pricing, it was a function of product mix. We experienced much larger shipments of base and fines on new construction and large projects, especially in Virginia and North Carolina. Growing volume in base and fines may detract from price but improves overall profitability. Prices will escalate throughout the year as new prices are initiated and as we finish older jobs. At this point, we also expect second half price increases to exceed 8%. Pricing momentum for Vulcan will continue. We are focused on earning a good return on the significant investments that we in this industry make on behalf of our customers.
We talk a lot about the 3 profit drivers that are expanding our margins and profits because they're important. On Slide 8, you can see that our second quarter and trailing 12-month gross profit per ton increased 21% and 23%, respectively. So in the quarter, price was up $0.71 per ton, but gross profit margin was up $0.76 per ton. Our sales and operations teams continue to do an outstanding job turning demand into higher profitability. Nobody in the business does a better job of managing the combination of price, operating efficiencies, volume and products. We continue to be excited about the ongoing very positive trend in unit margin expansion for Vulcan. It's not a new story.
As you can see on Slide 9, we have now seen 8 consecutive quarters of expanding unit margin. Since our volumes began to grow in the second half of 2013, our gross profit per ton has increased sharply, and we are now seeing the additional benefits of strong and ongoing improvement in pricing. Our unit profitability is higher than when these operations were producing twice the volume.
In the most recent quarter, we saw an increase in repair and maintenance and labor cost. This is not surprising. Growing volumes are requiring us to run operations longer, resulting in more repairs, and wet weather negatively impacts labor efficiencies. This is something that we will be managing very carefully even as we see pricing momentum and continued unit margin expansion that more than offsets these costs. Even though we are still in the early stages of recovery, we are very pleased with this momentum. Demand for our products continues to escalate, and I'm extremely proud of the way our people are focused on unit margin growth.
Slide 10 shows our incremental margin performance in our aggregates segment. Incremental gross profit margin for the second quarter was 74%, excluding the impact of acquisitions completed during 2014. Aggregates gross profit grew by $44 million on incremental freight-adjusted revenues of $59 million. Including the impact of acquisitions, the incremental margin was 61%, with the gross margin on those revenues impacted by acquisition accounting and weather. Since quarterly figures can be distorted by seasonality or onetime cost, we also present the same metric calculated on a trailing 12-month basis. For the trailing 12 months that ended this quarter, incremental gross profit margin was 72%, adjusted for the same acquisitions. Aggregates gross profit increased approximately $157 million on incremental revenues of $219 million. Given our strategic focus on the aggregates business, our ability to take that revenue to the bottom line is a big advantage to Vulcan as volumes continue to recover. With that, I will now turn the call over to John for additional comments regarding our earnings performance and outlook for the remainder of the year. John?"
312769,307286224,848187,"Vulcan Materials Company, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2015",2015-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Vulcan Materials Company","Executives","Thanks, Tom. I'll start with Slide 11, which effectively serves as the capstone to many of the metrics and trends Tom just highlighted.

I'll start with Slide 11, which effectively serves as the capstone to many of the metrics and trends Tom just highlighted. On this slide, we summarized the improvement in our aggregates segment results since the recovery and volumes began in the second half of 2013. Before the recovery began, our annualized aggregates volumes troughed at 140 million tons. That was 2 years ago. As of the quarter just ended, our trailing 12-month shipments are 170 million tons. So we've added 30 million tons of aggregates shipments on an annualized basis. This gain reflects a sustained early recovery but remains well below the shipments we'd expect under normal demand conditions.
Now importantly, we've been able to increase segment gross profit by just over $260 million during this 2-year period, with per ton gross profit increasing more than $1 or over 40%. Certainly, a central part of our strategic and operational focus remains on sustaining these trends and fully capitalizing on the continued recovery toward normal levels of demand for the materials we provide.
Now let me turn to Slide 12 to briefly look at our asphalt and concrete segment results for the quarter. These businesses also performed well in the quarter, especially given weather-related challenges in Texas, Virginia, Arizona and New Mexico. Our local management of these operations continues to service customers well while also effectively managing material margins. And segment results for both asphalt and concrete have benefited from recent transactions that better focus our asset portfolio. Year-to-date, the gross profit from these businesses has exceeded plan despite weather-related challenges.
Looking at the asphalt segment, you see the gross profit for the quarter was approximately $21 million, a year-over-year improvement of $12 million, driven by strong cost disciplines and margin management as well as the impact of acquired operations. On a same-store basis, asphalt volumes increased 8% from the prior year and unit profitability increased sharply. And looking at the concrete segment, you see second quarter gross profit was approximately $5 million compared to $3 million in the prior year, as margin improvements helped offset the impact of work deferred due to weather including a record wet June in the Virginia, Maryland area where we have our largest concrete operations.
Moving now to capital allocation. Slide 13 highlights certain second quarter actions and updates consistent with our previously communicated capital allocation priorities and capital structure goals. These priorities and goals have not changed, and we continue to work diligently against them. First, we continue to make the CapEx investments necessary to sustain the long-term value of our franchise and to meet our customers' rising requirements. Our core CapEx spending for the year remains in line with prior communications at approximately $250 million. In addition, we've committed to replace to 2 of our 3 Panamax-class ships which transport product from our high-volume quarry in Mexico. The vessels being replaced have over 30 years of service each, and the advantages of our bluewater distribution network usually merit the investment. We expect progress payments on the construction of the new ships to be approximately $36 million this year, with another $85 million spread across 2016 and 2017.
Next, we intend to maintain our financial strength and flexibility at all parts of the cycle. Consistent with this goal, we've now completed the major components of the refinancing plan outlined during our February Investor Day and discussed at length during our first quarter call. These accomplishments include extending maturities on approximately $620 million of debt, otherwise due over the next 5 years; establishing a new $750 million unsecured credit facility; and lowering our average weighted or lower -- lowering our weighted average interest rate. Our second quarter results include $45 million or $0.24 per diluted share of expense associated with this activity. In addition, we took steps in the second quarter to streamline our corporate legal entity structure. These actions improve our flexibility and reduce certain administrative burdens, for example, significantly reducing the number of state income tax filings we prepare. We expect another outcome to be a more appropriate and efficient allocation of interest expense and overall taxable income across the states in which we operate. We currently anticipate a $3 million to $5 million reduction in the annual state tax expense or an approximately 100 basis point reduction in our overall effective tax rate for 2015. In addition, we may be able to utilize over time all or a portion of approximately $60 million in state-level NOLs, which may otherwise have expired unused. Next, we continue to pursue bolt-on acquisitions. During the second quarter, for example, we acquired 3 aggregates facilities and 7 ready-mix operations in Arizona and New Mexico for approximately $21 million, complementing our existing positions in those markets. The pipeline of bolt-on acquisitions opportunities remains active, but we will remain a disciplined buyer and, as such, the number, size and timing of future transactions remains difficult to predict. As our performance improves, so does our capacity to return capital to shareholders. We continue to believe that we will have the ability to both reinvest for growth and return capital to shareholders as the recovery to a normal demand unfolds.
Now let me take a couple of -- now let me make a couple of comments about end markets and then our outlook for the balance of 2015 before handing the call back to Tom for some closing remarks and Q&A. As Tom noted earlier and as you can see reflected in our Q2 results, construction activity continues to recover in Vulcan-served markets, although it remains far below long-term trend levels. Looking through the weather and the noise in Congress, we and our customers continue to see gradually improving demand in each of the major end markets we serve. Shipping rates on clear days underscore recovery demand across geographies and across end users. With few exceptions, construction activity in our markets remains well below long-term true cycle trends, but the recovery continues. That would be the main message here.
Now to touch briefly on some of the underlying trends in private and public construction. With respect to private demand, we continue to see manufacturing and other industrial-related projects contributing to significant nonresidential construction growth. And as you probably know, housing starts, despite month-to-month volatility, continue to trend upward across most Vulcan-served markets. On the public side, large projects have driven recent strength in highway awards. State and local-level funding initiatives support continued growth in road and other infrastructure spending, particularly in the intermediate term. At the federal level, we remain optimistic that a multiyear bill may pass sometime in the fall. Tom will have more to say on this in a moment, but the need for a meaningful multiyear program is understood on both sides of the aisle, and recent developments have been well covered in the press. So to the extent we harbor modest concerns were regarding our full year 2015 volumes relative to plan, they primarily relate back to first half weather and the capacity of our customers to complete deferred work during the remainder of the available construction season. In several of our markets, key customers find themselves 6 or more weeks behind on scheduled work, and they short term challenges in adding the capacity required to catch up. In addition, the extension into the fall of uncertainty regarding the Federal Highway Program may impact the start date and timing of shipments to certain road infrastructure projects. Again, the marginal risk we see to 2015 shipments is one of timing and potential deferral into 2016.
Now I'll turn it briefly to Slide 15 and our outlook for the balance of the year. As noted in our earnings release, our full year EBITDA guidance range remains unchanged at $775 million to $825 million, this despite the weather-related challenges of the first half of the year. In short, we anticipate better-than-expected pricing and margin momentum to offset a potential shortfall in 2015 shipments relative to plan. The continued improvement in pricing and unit margins matches our strategic focus and bodes very well for the longer-term performance and value of our franchise. I'll now touch on certain of the modest adjustments we've made to assumptions underlying our full year EBITDA guidance. As stated previously, please view these figures as indicative midpoints of our range of expectations. We want to give you a good feel for how we see the business performing, but we don't want to convey a false sense of precision regarding each and every metric. With respect to aggregates shipments, we reduced our midpoint expectations for the year from 180 million tons to 177 million tons. This change reflects the challenges many of our customer face as they try to catch up with deferred work, the longer-than-expected ramp-ups in production at certain of our acquired operations and marginally higher uncertainty regarding start dates and shipping pace for certain large projects. Our fundamental view of a continued gradual recovery in demand remains unchanged. With regard to aggregates pricing, we've raised our midpoint expectation for year-on-year growth from 6% to 7%. As Tom noted, pricing fundamentals are strong and getting stronger in many markets. We expect the rate of improvement in the second half to exceed that of the first half. At this point, we would expect these pricing trends to continue into 2016. Due to potential shortfall in 2015 shipments volumes, we slightly reduced our midpoint expectation for aggregates segment gross profit. We expect the rate in which incremental freight-adjusted revenues flow through to incremental gross profit to remain roughly in line with recent trailing 12-month trends. Our asphalt and concrete segments have also seen rising profitability, both on a same-store basis and as a result of recent acquisition, divestiture and swap activity. As a result, we raised our midpoint expectation for full year gross profit from these segments from $70 million to $80 million. Our expectations for SAG, DD&A and core CapEx remain largely unchanged. All in all, our businesses enjoy strong momentum in volumes, pricing, margins and capital productivity. Our teams are executing well, serving our customers well and focusing on what they could control. The underlying fundamentals of our business remain very exciting. With that, I will turn the call back over to Tom. Tom?"

We are pleased with our team's performance in the second quarter despite the challenges of extreme weather. Our markets continue to improve in each market segment and across most of our geographic footprint. This growing demand is causing price momentum to pick up robustly, which is clearly demonstrated in the second quarter results. I am confident in our employees' ability to execute on the disciplined operating efficiencies to drive cost control and customer service that drives value and price, all of which improve our unit profitability. We are very proud of our employees' hard work and dedication. We are also pleased with the level of activity on the Highway bill in Congress over the last 2 weeks. This culminated on July 30 and as soon as passage of a new 6-year bill to drive that. The Senate house, also last week, passed a 3-month extension to MAP-21, the current bill. This will allow the House time to complete work on its version of the new bill. House and Senate leadership stated their intention to go to conference with their respective bills and sending new multiyear bill to the President for his signature on the poll. This gathered momentum in Congress to address federal highway investments coupled with growing initiatives to improve roads in many states is very encouraging. We, along with many other transportation stakeholders, will continue to press for additional much-needed investments in America's aging infrastructure. As we look forward to the balance of 2015 and into 2016, we're excited about the accelerated momentum in demand and pricing, and the improving execution by our employees. They are finding new ways to improve this company and our profitability every day. Now if the operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to respond to your questions."

Georgia, very, very healthy. And actually, Georgia got hit a little bit with weather, but that demand just pushed back. And every time the sun comes out in Georgia, we're shipping very strongly. So overall, everything is -- the vast majority of the markets are going well. If there is a spot that was a little behind the rest of the country, I'd say it was Alabama, Mississippi, that area.

We had some very large sales of base and fines which, as we say, is a good thing. We like that. It actually improves our profitability. We are seeing robust price increases in most of our markets. I'd give you a little flavor on that. If you look at South Carolina, Arizona, Alabama, we saw price increases from $0.40 to $0.50 in the second quarter. In the middle of the country, which would be Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas and Illinois, we saw price increases in the $0.60 to $0.75 per ton range. And then, we saw -- in a few markets we saw, some very marked price jumps in the $0.80 -- $0.80 to $1.20 a ton range in California, Florida, Georgia and Texas. But overall, our -- it's still a local business, and our local teams are working hard to make sure we deliver value and quality and service to our customers.

So weather affected labor also, affected the rest of our operating efficiencies and tons per gallon of fuel and electrical power. We're also beginning to run our plants with increased demand. We're starting to run our plants a little harder and longer. When you start to do this, you start to find a few weak spots in the fixed equipment. We also took the opportunity in the second quarter when we were down to do repairs, so R&M costs was up. But if you look at it from a longer-term view, our year-to-date cost is down about $0.10. On a same-store basis, it's down $0.16. Trailing 12 months, it's down $0.22. But the disciplines in operating efficiencies and operating cost is something that everybody focuses on every day. It's something you just got to stay on top of or it will get away. So I think our people are very focused on the things they control and the efficiencies in those operations. So the tailwind, I guess, I saw -- or excuse me, headwind that I saw in the quarter was really one of cost, and it was a mix of R&M and weather-related inefficiencies."

At the same time, we've got a number of states, which have already substantially increased their funding, and we have a number of very key states to us, including California, which are looking at the way you recognize that they have to increase their funding and are taking steps towards that. So overall, with the steps that the Senate's taking and the Congress -- the House is taking, we're pleased with it, we've got high hopes for it, we think we've got a lot of momentum.

Let me begin by thanking our employees for their outstanding performance in the second quarter. As you all know, weather conditions were unusually bad during the quarter with prolonged wet we",1311,"Thank you, Mark, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Let me begin by thanking our employees for their outstanding performance in the second quarter. As you all know, weather conditions were unusually bad during the quarter with prolonged wet weather and serious flooding impeding construction activity in many parts of the U.S. In spite of these challenges, we operated safely, served our customers well and delivered strong results. The metrics and slides we'll talk about today are largely the same as in prior quarters. We're on track to have a very good year. Our focus hasn't changed and neither has our optimism regarding continued performance improvement. Construction activity and materials demand continue to recover. Pricing momentum is accelerating, and our employees are doing a really good job converting incremental revenues into incremental profits.
Despite the bad weather in many of our markets, we enjoyed strong earnings growth and margin expansion on higher revenues, underscoring our confidence in our full year outlook. With improving market conditions and our focus on profit improvements, both pricing and margins continue to expand. As you can see on Slide 4, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.66 per diluted share, an increase of $0.30 from the prior year. Although overall average shipments were lower than expected due to weather, we continue to see expanding gross profit margins and expanding EBITDA margins. As you can see, overall gross profit margins increased by more than 450 basis points. These strong margins were supported by robust pricing momentum. We experienced strong earnings growth in aggregates and in each of our non-aggregates segment. This was also accompanied by declining SAGs cost as a percent of sales. In spite of the weather challenges, our people did an outstanding job taking incremental revenue to the bottom line. As we noted before, our local teams across our footprint are doing a great job managing sales and production mix along with pricing. At the same time, we continue to reap the benefits of improving operating efficiencies and resulting leverage.
Total gross profit increased 34%, and adjusted EBITDA was up 33%. Same-store shipments increased 5% and same-store pricing increased over 6%, with strong pricing momentum across most markets. Our profitability continued to improve significantly, whether measured by margin percentage or per-unit profit.
Now let's look at the monthly trend of our aggregates shipments and the impact of weather on Slide 5. Rain in the second quarter reduced the number of available shipping days in key markets, and it certainly postponed shipments. Slide 5 shows the year-over-year change in monthly shipments. You can see the impact of rain on shipments in April and May, up only 5% and 2% on a same-store basis. In April, it was pervasive across most markets with above average rainfall in 13 of our states. In May, severe wet weather affected plant operations and construction activity in Arizona, Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. In June, with the important exceptions of Illinois and Virginia, the weather allowed for more normal days of construction activity, and shipments were robust revealing again the momentum in demand.
The map on Slide 6 shows a breakdown of 5% growth in aggregates shipments across the country on a same-store basis. Even with all the wet weather, the vast majority of our states experienced healthy growth. Momentum in shipments continued with solid growth in key states. Same-store shipments in Florida, Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia saw shipments growth ranging from 5% to 11%. Although California volumes were down 3% due to several large projects that have been delayed until the second half of the year, our full year outlook for shipments growth in California remains unchanged, and our view and that of our customers, this is demand deferred, not lost.
I'd like to draw your attention to Slide 7, aggregates pricing. As we discussed before, pricing growth tends to lag volume growth. We experienced in the second quarter the initial stages of this improving pricing momentum. We are pleased with a nice increase in freight-adjusted aggregates price of 6.4% in the second quarter, and we fully expect to see pricing accelerate. This is supported by the confidence we see in our customers' view of the markets. We had 9 major markets where price increases range from $0.60 to $1.20 and another 3 approaching the $0.50 range. In limited instances where we didn't see such robust pricing, it was a function of product mix. We experienced much larger shipments of base and fines on new construction and large projects, especially in Virginia and North Carolina. Growing volume in base and fines may detract from price but improves overall profitability. Prices will escalate throughout the year as new prices are initiated and as we finish older jobs. At this point, we also expect second half price increases to exceed 8%. Pricing momentum for Vulcan will continue. We are focused on earning a good return on significant investments that we in this industry make on behalf of our customers.
We talk a lot about the 3 profit drivers that are expanding our margins and profits because they're important. On Slide 8, you can see that our second quarter and trailing 12-month gross profit per ton increased 21% and 23%, respectively. So in the quarter, price was up $0.71 per ton, but gross profit margin was up $0.76 per ton. Our sales and operations teams continue to do an outstanding job turning demand into higher profitability. Nobody in the business does a better job of managing the combination of price, operating efficiencies, volume and products. 
We continue to be excited about the ongoing very positive trend in unit margin expansion for Vulcan. It's not a new story. As you can see on Slide 9, we have now seen 8 consecutive quarters of expanding unit margin. Since our volumes began to grow in the second half of 2013, our gross profit per ton has increased sharply, and we are now seeing the additional benefits of strong and ongoing improvement in pricing. Our unit profitability is higher than when these operations were producing twice the volume.
In the most recent quarter, we saw an increase in repair and maintenance and labor cost. This is not surprising. Growing volumes are requiring us to run operations longer resulting in more repairs, and wet weather negatively impacts labor efficiencies. This is something that we will be managing very carefully even as we see pricing momentum and continued unit margin expansion that more than offsets these costs. Even though we are still in the early stages of recovery, we are very pleased with this momentum. Demand for our products continues to escalate, and I'm extremely proud of the way our people are focused on unit margin growth.
Slide 10 shows our incremental margin performance in our aggregates segment. Incremental gross profit margin for the second quarter was 74%, excluding the impact of acquisitions completed during 2014. Aggregates gross profit grew by $44 million on incremental freight-adjusted revenues of $59 million. Including the impact of acquisitions, the incremental margin was 61%, with the gross margin on those revenues impacted by acquisition accounting and weather. Since quarterly figures can be distorted by seasonality or onetime costs, we also present the same metric calculated on a trailing 12-month basis. For the trailing 12 months that ended this quarter, incremental gross profit margin was 72%, adjusted for the same acquisitions. Aggregates gross profit increased approximately $157 million on incremental revenues of $219 million. Given our strategic focus on the aggregates business, our ability to take that revenue to the bottom line is a big advantage to Vulcan as volumes continue to recover. With that, I will now turn the call over to John for additional comments regarding our earnings performance and outlook for the remainder of the year. John?"
312769,307286224,848456,"Vulcan Materials Company, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2015",2015-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Vulcan Materials Company","Executives","Thanks, Tom. I'll start with Slide 11, which effectively serves as a capstone to many of the metrics and trends Tom just highlighted. On this slide, we summarized the improvement in our aggregates segment results since the recovery and volumes began in th",1706,"Thanks, Tom. I'll start with Slide 11, which effectively serves as a capstone to many of the metrics and trends Tom just highlighted. On this slide, we summarized the improvement in our aggregates segment results since the recovery and volumes began in the second half of 2013. Before the recovery began, our annualized aggregates volumes troughed at 140 million tons. That was 2 years ago. As of the quarter just ended, our trailing 12-month shipments are 170 million tons. So we've added 30 million tons of aggregates shipments on an annualized basis. This gain reflects a sustained early recovery but remains well below the shipments we'd expect under normal demand conditions.
Now importantly, we've been able to increase segment gross profit by just over $260 million during this 2-year period, with per ton gross profit increasing more than $1 or over 40%. Certainly, a central part of our strategic and operational focus remains on sustaining these trends and fully capitalizing on the continued recovery toward normal levels of demand for the materials we provide.
Now let me turn to Slide 12 to briefly look at our Asphalt and Concrete segment results for the quarter. These businesses also performed well in the quarter, especially given weather-related challenges in Texas, Virginia, Arizona and New Mexico. Our local management of these operations continues to service customers well while also effectively managing material margins. And segment results for both Asphalt and Concrete have benefited from recent transactions that better focus our asset portfolio. Year-to-date, the gross profit from these businesses has exceeded plans despite weather-related challenges.
Looking at the Asphalt segment, you see the gross profit for the quarter was approximately $21 million, a year-over-year improvement of $12 million, driven by strong cost disciplines and margin management as well as the impact of acquired operations. On a same-store basis, Asphalt volumes increased 8% from the prior year and unit profitability increased sharply. And looking at the Concrete segment, you see second quarter gross profit was approximately $5 million compared to $3 million in the prior year, as margin improvements helped offset the impact of work deferred due to weather including a record wet June in the Virginia, Maryland area where we have our largest Concrete operations.
Moving now to capital allocation. Slide 13 highlights certain second quarter actions and updates consistent with our previously communicated capital allocation priorities and capital structure goals. These priorities and goals have not changed, and we continue to work diligently against them. First, we continue to make the CapEx investments necessary to sustain the long-term value of our franchise and to meet our customers' rising requirements. Our core CapEx spending for the year remains in line with prior communications at approximately $250 million. In addition, we've committed to replace 2 of our 3 Panamax-class ships, which transport product from our high-volume quarry in Mexico. The vessels being replaced have over 30 years of service each, and the advantages of our bluewater distribution network easily merit the investment. We expect progress payments on the construction of the new ships to be approximately $36 million this year, with another $85 million spread across 2016 and 2017.
Next, we intend to maintain our financial strength and flexibility at all parts of the cycle. Consistent with this goal, we've now completed the major components of the refinancing plan outlined during our February Investor Day and discussed at length during our first quarter call. These accomplishments include extending maturities on approximately $620 million of debt, otherwise due over the next 5 years; establishing a new $750 million unsecured credit facility; and lowering our average weighted or lower -- lowering our weighted average interest rate. Our second quarter results include $45 million or $0.24 per diluted share of expense associated with this activity. 
In addition, we took steps in the second quarter to streamline our corporate legal entity structure. These actions improve our flexibility and reduce certain administrative burdens, for example, significantly reducing the number of state income tax filings we prepare. We expect another outcome to be a more appropriate and efficient allocation of interest expense and overall taxable income across the states in which we operate. We currently anticipate a $3 million to $5 million reduction in the annual state tax expense or an approximately 100 basis point reduction in our overall effective tax rate for 2015. In addition, we may be able to utilize over time all or a portion of approximately $60 million in state-level NOLs, which may otherwise have expired unused. Next, we continue to pursue bolt-on acquisitions. During the second quarter, for example, we acquired 3 aggregates facilities and 7 ready-mix operations in Arizona and New Mexico for approximately $21 million, complementing our existing positions in those markets. The pipeline of bolt-on acquisition opportunities remains active, but we will remain a disciplined buyer and, as such, the number, size and timing of future transactions remains difficult to predict. As our performance improves, so does our capacity to return capital to shareholders. We continue to believe that we will have the ability to both reinvest for growth and return capital to shareholders as the recovery to a normal demand unfolds.
Now let me take a couple of -- now let me make a couple of comments about end markets and then our outlook for the balance of 2015 before handing the call back to Tom for some closing remarks and Q&A. As Tom noted earlier and as you can see reflected in our Q2 results, construction activity continues to recover in Vulcan-served markets, although it remains far below long-term trend levels. Looking through the weather and the noise in Congress, we and our customers continue to see gradually improving demand in each of the major end markets we serve. Shipping rates on clear days underscore recovery demand across geographies and across end users. With few exceptions, construction activity in our markets remains well below long-term true cycle trends, but the recovery continues. That would be the main message here.
Now to touch briefly on some of the underlying trends in private and public construction. With respect to private demand, we continue to see manufacturing and other industrial-related projects contributing to significant nonresidential construction growth. And as you probably know, housing starts, despite month-to-month volatility, continue to trend upward across most Vulcan-served markets. On the public side, large projects have driven recent strength in highway awards. State and local-level funding initiatives support continued growth in road and other infrastructure spending, particularly in the intermediate term. At the federal level, we remain optimistic that a multiyear bill may pass sometime in the fall. Tom will have more to say on this in a moment, but the need for a meaningful multiyear program is understood on both sides of the aisle, and recent developments have been well covered in the press. So to the extent we harbor modest concerns regarding our full year 2015 volumes relative to plan, they primarily relate back to first half weather and the capacity of our customers to complete deferred work during the remainder of the available construction season. In several of our markets, key customers find themselves 6 or more weeks behind on scheduled work, and they face short-term challenges in adding capacity required to catch up. In addition, the extension into the fall of uncertainty regarding the Federal Highway Program may impact the start date and timing of shipments to certain road infrastructure projects. Again, the marginal risk we see to 2015 shipments is one of timing and potential deferral into 2016.
Now I'll turn briefly to Slide 15 and our outlook for the balance of the year. As noted in our earnings release, our full year EBITDA guidance range remains unchanged at $775 million to $825 million, this despite the weather-related challenges of the first half of the year. In short, we anticipate better-than-expected pricing and margin momentum to offset a potential shortfall in 2015 shipments relative to plan. The continued improvement in pricing and unit margins matches our strategic focus and bodes very well for the longer-term performance and value of our franchise. 
I'll now touch on certain of the modest adjustments we've made to assumptions underlying our full year EBITDA guidance. As stated previously, please view these figures as indicative midpoints of our range of expectations. We want to give you a good feel for how we see the business performing, but we don't want to convey a false sense of precision regarding each and every metric. With respect to aggregates shipments, we reduced our midpoint expectations for the year from 180 million tons to 177 million tons. This change reflects the challenges many of our customers face as they try to catch up with deferred work, the longer-than-expected ramp-ups in production at certain of our acquired operations and marginally higher uncertainty regarding start dates and shipping pace for certain large projects. Our fundamental view of a continued gradual recovery in demand remains unchanged. With regard to aggregates pricing, we've raised our midpoint expectation for year-on-year growth from 6% to 7%. As Tom noted, pricing fundamentals are strong and getting stronger in many markets. We expect the rate of improvement in the second half to exceed that of the first half. At this point, we would expect these pricing trends to continue into 2016. Due to potential shortfall in 2015 shipments volumes, we slightly reduced our midpoint expectation for aggregates segment gross profit. We expect the rate in which incremental freight-adjusted revenues flow through to incremental gross profit to remain roughly in line with recent trailing 12-month trends. Our Asphalt and Concrete segments have also seen rising profitability, both on a same-store basis and as a result of recent acquisition, divestiture and swap activity. As a result, we raised our midpoint expectation for full year gross profit from these segments from $70 million to $80 million. Our expectations for SAG, DD&A and core CapEx remain largely unchanged. All in all, our businesses enjoy strong momentum in volumes, pricing, margins and capital productivity. Our teams are executing well, serving our customers well and focusing on what they can control. The underlying fundamentals of our business remain very exciting. With that, I will turn the call back over to Tom. Tom?"

We are pleased with our team's performance in the second quarter despite the challenges of extreme weather. Our markets continue to improve in each market segment and across most of our geographic footprint. This growing demand is causing pricing momentum to pick up robustly, which is clearly demonstrated in the second quarter results. I am confident in our employees' ability to execute on the disciplined operating efficiencies to drive cost control and customer service that drives value and price, all of which improve our year profitability. We are very proud of our employees' hard work and dedication. We are also pleased with the level of activity on the Highway bill in Congress over the last 2 weeks. This culminated on July 30 and as soon [ph] as passage of a new 6-year bill to drive that. The Senate house, also last week, passed a 3-month extension to MAP-21, the current bill. This will allow the House time to complete work on its version of the new bill. House and Senate leadership have stated their intention to go to conference with their respective bills and sending new multiyear bill to the President for his signature in the fall. This gathered momentum in Congress to address federal highway investments coupled with growing initiatives to improve roads in many states is very encouraging. We, along with many other transportation stakeholders, will continue to press for additional much-needed investments in America's aging infrastructure. As we look forward to the balance of 2015 and into 2016, we're excited about the accelerated momentum in demand and pricing, and the improving execution by our employees. They are finding new ways to improve this company and our profitability every day. Now if the operator will give the required instructions, we'll be happy to respond to your questions."

Even with the impact of weather, we saw same-store shipments volume up 8% in Texas. Florida continues to be extremely healthy. I think we were up some-11% in Florida for the quarter. Georgia, very, very healthy. And actually, Georgia got hit a little bit with weather, but that demand’s just pushed back. And every time the sun comes out in Georgia, we're shipping very strongly. So overall, everything is -- the vast majority of the markets are going well. If there is a spot that was a little behind the rest of the country, I'd say it was Alabama, Mississippi, that area. As I stated, California, while the second quarter was a little slow because we had some jobs pushed back, and it may be a little bit behind the rest of the country, overall, its demand growth is steady."

The labor piece, weather causes inefficiencies in a stone operation, actually, in ready-mix and asphalt also. So weather affected labor, also affected the rest of our operating efficiencies and tons per gallon of fuel and electrical power. We're also beginning to run our plants with increased demand. We're starting to run our plants a little harder and longer. When you start to do this, you start to find a few weak spots in the fixed equipment. We also took the opportunity in the second quarter when we were down to do repairs, so R&M costs was up. But if you look at it from a longer-term view, our year-to-date cost is down about $0.10. On a same-store basis, it's down $0.16. Trailing 12 months, it's down $0.22. But the disciplines in operating efficiencies and operating cost is something that everybody focuses on every day. It's something you just got to stay on top of or it will get away. So I think our people are very focused on the things they control and the efficiencies in those operations.

At Vulcan, we posted another strong quarter and we remain on track to have a very good year. Our solid performance, continued revenue growth and margin expansion are a direct result of the great efforts of our people. Today, you're going to hear about steady recovery, solid price improvement and about our sharp focus on the things we can control. Now, we won't be giving guidance for 2016 in today's call but as we began our planning cycle for next year, our fundamental trajectory remains intact. We continue to experience a gradual steady recovery in demand and shipments. Although the details of course vary from market to market, we also continue to see positive pricing climate with appropriate increases either announced or plan for next year. We remain well positioned to convert incremental revenues into incremental gross profit at an impressive clip. We are excited about the opportunities ahead. Our people know that they must remain highly focused on margin improvement and continue to drive ongoing improvements in our business. We're focused on capitalizing on our momentum. Our people are engaged and entrepreneurial and they are sharing best practices across the organization. They know that they are a power to serve our customers and keep making our company more profitable and better in every way. We, also, all of us remain highly focused on safe operations, protecting the health and safety of our employees at all times. 
Now to company specifics. The recovery in construction activity continue across most of our markets. As we will show you, the metrics are certainly, trending in the right direction. While demand is recovering gradually to more normal levels, we have enjoyed sustained margin expansion and we continue to grow our profitability in a disciplined manner. As construction activity and materials demand continue to pick up, we are also seeing improving confidence in pricing. Now, we've had some cost increases during the last 2 quarters. Even though some of this is expected given volume growth, we are very focused on continually improving our operating performance. These efforts begin to pay off in September when we saw marked improvement in our costs. We are going to stay very focused on this. Our employees are doing a really good job, turning incremental revenues into incremental profits. And let me add, we see these trends continuing. We are heading into 2016 with the win in our back. That said, we are totally focused on finishing this year strong. 
Now let's talk about the third quarter. Demand continue to recover gradually in the quarter. Our results demonstrated the earnings leverage in our business model. With improving market conditions and our focus on profit improvements, both pricing and margins continue to expand. As you can see on Slide 4, a 19% increase in total revenues converted to a 39% increase in gross profit. This also drove a 47% increase in adjusted EBIT and a 31% increase in adjusted EBITDA. Our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 82%. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.95 per diluted share, an increase of $0.41 from the prior year. Gross profit margins increased by 490 basis points and were supported by pricing momentum. We enjoyed strong earnings growth in aggregates, as well as in our asphalt and concrete segments. We continue to manage and leverage SAG. SAG cost did increase in absolute terms. Here, onetime items offset lower headcount related costs. What's important is as a percent of sales, SAG is trending towards 8% for the year, down about 1% from the prior year. All in all, I'm very pleased with our people's performance. You know whether measured by margin percentage or per unit profit, our profitably continue to improve very significantly. 
Now let's take a look at our shipments across the U.S. The map on Slide 5 shows a breakdown of our growth in shipments of aggregates on a same-store basis across the country. In the quarter, we saw solid demand growth even though many customers face bottlenecks impeding shipments. It's important to recognize what a good job our local teams are doing working with our customers to meet rising demand effectively and efficiently. Momentum continue with solid growth in key states. Shipments in Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Texas and Louisiana, each grew by 10% or more. In contrast, majority of our markets which were up, Illinois was down about 10%. This was due to significant large project work completed in 2014. Now at the same time, California saw healthy growth in the third quarter as major projects kicked off after being delayed in the first half of the year. 
I'd like to turn your attention to Slide 6 which shows our year-over-year growth in shipments. As you can see, this is a very similar pattern to the last slide with solid year-to-date growth in aggregate shipments of 10% in total or 7% on a same-store basis. Both our East and West Coast markets continue to enjoy healthy growth as did Texas. Shipments in the Gulf Coast markets were also strong with the exception of the Central Gulf Coast region. 
Turn to Slide 7. You can see that our pricing continues to strengthen and for the quarter, it improved in line with our expectations of 8% over the prior year's quarter. In a number of markets, we saw year-over-year freight adjusted price improvements in excess of 10%. This increases were fairly broad-based and occurred across all product types. And in more than half of our markets, we've had price increases ranging from $0.60 to $1.20 per ton. For the quarter, we didn't see this level of price increases in Virginia, South Carolina and Arizona because we had much larger shipments of base material refines on new construction and large projects. As discussed before, volume and basin finds can attract from price but improves overall profitability. Let me emphasize the fact that pricing momentum will continue for us. There are 3 primary reasons that the pricing climate should remain positive: 1, customer confidence continues to improve; 2, increasing demand builds backlog; and third, construction related businesses are increasingly focused on earning adequate returns. Effective pricing performance remains a key focus for our management teams across our footprint. We are focused on delivering value to customers while earning a good return on the significant investments that we make on their behalf. This ties directly to providing excellent service to our customers, the right product, the right quality, the right time and being paid the right price for superior service and value. 
Now we've talked a lot on past calls about the 3 profit drivers that are expanding our margins and profits. That's because it's important. As a reminder, the 3 profit drivers are sales and production mix, price and operating efficiencies. We call these the 3 circles. As you can see on Slide 8, our third quarter and trailing 12 month gross profit per ton increased 23% and 25%, respectively. So in the quarter, on a same-store basis, price was up $0.86 per ton and gross profit margin was up $0.90 per ton. Our sales and operations people are doing a superior job turning demand growth into higher profitability. Our local teams continue to do an outstanding job managing the combination of price, operating efficiencies, volume and product mix. This is something we will stay focused on every day. With respect to the 3 circles, we've talked about the positive pricing environment and we've talked about new construction improving the impact of product mix on profitability. Regarding the third circle, operating efficiencies and leverage. We continue to emphasize production planning and operating efficiencies across the business. Despite improvements in unit profitability and same-store cost, we are seeing some areas of rising cost. As I mentioned, I'm not satisfied with this and neither are our people. Still, we're seeing some cost rise. About 2/3 of these increases resulted from geographic mix and fringe benefits, also outside our control. In addition, during the last 2 quarters, we have begun to see a trend of rising repair maintenance and labor cost in some areas. Even though this isn't surprising, we are not going to accept that. Growing volumes are requiring us to run operations longer, resulting in more repairs and higher than budgeted spending across our supplies. And labor cost in some areas were up in the first 8 months of the year. We saw cost go up, we focused on them and we realized improvements in September. We will continue manage these costs very carefully. 
Let's turn to Slide 9. Our employees can be very proud of this chart. It clearly shows that are people are highly focused on continuous improvement and quality of earnings. We're excited by the ongoing very positive trend in unit margin expansion. We have now seen 9 consecutive quarters of expanding unit margin and will continue to post improvements. Since our volumes begin to grow in the second half of 2013, our gross profit per ton has increased sharply. We are now seeing the additional benefits of strong and ongoing improvement in pricing. Our unit profitability is higher than when these operations were producing twice the volume. Again, I would expect this trend to continue into 2016. 
Slide 10 shows on our incremental margin performance in the aggregate segment. This underpins the margin improvement you saw on the previous slide. Our incremental gross profit margin for the third quarter was 72%, excluding the impact of acquisitions completed during 2014. Aggregate's gross profit grew by $60 million on incremental freight adjusted revenues of $83 million. Including the impact of acquisitions, the incremental margin was 65% with a gross margin on those revenues impacted mainly by higher cost at acquired operations as we bring them up to our standards, and by higher cost for repair maintenance. Now since quarterly figures can be distorted by seasonality or onetime cost, we also present the same metric on a trailing 12 month basis. For this time period, incremental gross profit margin was 73%. Aggregates' growth profit increased approximately $177 million or incremental revenues of $242 million, adjusted for the same acquisitions. On a trailing 12 month basis, the flow through rate was consistently exceeded the company's stated goal of 60% since volumes begin to recover in the second half of 2013. Given our strategic focus on the aggregates business, our ability to take that revenue to the bottom line is a big advantage for Vulcan as volumes continued to recover. With that, I'll turn the call over to John for additional comments on our earnings performance and outlook for the remainder of the year. John?"

[Audio Gap]
Sorry, thanks, Tom. I'll begin with Slide 11 and as we last quarter, use it to recap many of the trend Tom just reviewed. On this slide, we highlight the improve profitability of our aggregates segment, both in total gross profit dollars and on a per ton basis since the recovery in volumes began in the second half of 2013. On the left-hand side of the chart, you see that for the trailing 12 months just ended, we shipped 175 million tons, 35 million tons more than for the trailing 12 months ending in the second quarter of 2013 just before the recovery began. Now looking to the right-hand side of the chart, you see that aggregates segment gross profit for the 12 months just ended was $682 million or $324 million ahead of the 12 months before the recovery began. So on $35 million of incremental aggregates tons shipped so far in the recovery, we've delivered $324 million in incremental segment gross profit. Gross profit per ton has increased $1.35 or 53%. And a 25% increase in shipments has been converted into a 90% increase in segment gross profit. These facts we believe illustrate the impact of the continuous compounding performance improvements you heard Tom reference and that in many ways characterized our current aggregates centric strategy and execution focus. 
Now turning to Slide 12 which shows the solid performance of our asphalt and concrete businesses for the third quarter. Segment gross profit and unit profitability in each of these segments increased significantly versus the prior year and year-to-date, the gross profit from these businesses has exceeded plan. Asphalt gross profit for the quarter was $30 million, a year-over-year improvement of $15 million, driven by improving same-store volumes, strong cost disciplines and margin management, as well as the impact of acquired operations. As a reminder, our acquisition this fall activities has added 19 asphalt plants to our store portfolio since the second half of last year. On a same-store basis, asphalt volumes grew 20%, in part due to work deferred from the first half of the year and asphalt gross profit grew $11 million. Vulcan is some of the 5 largest producers of asphalt in the country and these operations complement our aggregates operations very well. Third quarter concrete gross profit was approximately $10 million compared to $5 million in the prior quarter and the prior year. Margins in this business segment have benefited from divestitures and other actions to focus our portfolio. The operations we have divested lost $2 million at the gross profit line in the prior year quarter. On a same-store basis, concrete volumes were flat versus the prior year and gross profit improved by $3 million. 
I'll now wrap up with Slide 13 and a recap of our full year 2015 outlook before handing the call back to Tom for some closing remarks. In short, our outlook for the full year remains largely consistent with that, presented in our second quarter call, and we are reaffirming our expectations for full-year adjusted EBITDA in the range of $775 million to $825 million. As usual, we note that weather patterns can impact results of the fourth quarter significantly, particularly if they shorten the total construction season. But, and as you've seen earlier in this call, the business is performing well and it is performing as expected. Now taking through a few of the individual drivers. We currently expect full-year volumes of approximately 177 million tons, up 9% year-on-year in total and 7% on a same-store basis. As noted earlier, we see the gradual recovery in demand continuing across most of our markets. However, capacity constraints at various points in the construction chain. For example, the availability of steel construction labor in certain markets have made it difficult for many of our customers to catch up fully on work deferred due to rain in the first half of the year. On the continued uncertainty regarding highway legislation has begun to impact timing of certain road projects on the margin. With respect to pricing, we expect the currently positive environment to persist and we currently expect to finish 2015 with a year-on-year increase in average freight adjusted selling prices of approximately 7%. As we've indicated, pressing momentum in the second half of the year has been stronger than in the first half of the year. Our asphalt and concrete segments have performed ahead of plan, both on a same-store basis and as a result of moves we made to strengthen our portfolio. These segments should generate full-year gross profit of approximately $95 million but again, please note that fourth quarter weather patterns can significantly impact actual results. SAG remains roughly in line with plan and declining as a percent of sales. Importantly, direct salary and wage cost for SAG headcount have remained flat this year and we do not expect the rise of pension and other postretirement benefit cost that we've had this year to reoccur next year. Core capital spending excluding dollars committed to the purchase of new ships to service our Yucatán quarry remains in line with plan. As noted in our earnings release, we may elect to pull some spending forward from 2016 in order to capitalize on certain procurement opportunities. As has been our practice, we plan to issue guidance for our 2016 year during our February earnings call. And certainly, a number of things can change between now and then, including federal highway legislation which Tom will touch on in a moment. But as we sit here in early November, we see volume and pricing trends similar to those we've seen year-to-date continuing to the fourth quarter and in the next year. And we of course remain intently focused on converting that top line revenue growth into cash flow and earnings growth to the very best of our ability. As Tom said at the beginning of the call, our basic trajectory remains intact. Tom, back to you."

We'll get fair value for the major investments we make in this business. I can tell you it's all about creating value for our customers and our companies. 
Now before I conclude, I'd like to say a few things about the Highway Bill. I reported last call about the significant progress in Washington towards the new bill. The Senate, with great leadership did its job when it passed the new six-year bill to drive act on July 30. The House transportation and infrastructure committee marked up its version of the Highway Bill 2 weeks ago. Congressional leaders believe it may be possible to conference the 2 bills and pass the final Highway Bill before the end of November. We are encouraged by the progress that is occurring in Congress to address America's infrastructure challenges. We have been very engaged in efforts to encourage Congress to step up to this challenge, a new multiyear Highway bill will be a step in the right direction and our nation's leaders will need to take additional steps in the years to come. This is important for our country, our industry and for Vulcan. 
In closing, I truly appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Looking forward, to the rest of 2015 and into 2016, I want you to know that we are very energized and engaged. We are focused on the fundamentals, on finding new ways to grow our company and its profitability every day.

In our view, still doing quite well but a bit further along. And on the other end, as Thomas mentioned before, we have our Mississippi, Alabama, Illinois, kind of our middle of the country markets that really haven't gotten much momentum yet in terms of the recovery moving along. But everything else is making pretty good progress. The facts and circumstances vary by market but everything else is making pretty good progress. The 1 issue that we do continue to see in some markets and it will inform all of our plants for 2016 when we get there is just the pace at which this growing demand and recovery demand really gets turn into aggregate shipments and again, in some markets that's a function of large project timing and how quickly do you DoTs can get their raised level of funding out the door into new projects, so we'll monitor that closely. And in other markets, that's a function of these,  if you will, bottlenecks in the construction supply chain that we referenced were availability of crews or equipment or develops land or skilled trade labor, those can really be the terminus of how quickly we grow.

So it's that confidence and the price of environment is so key, and as we talked about a lot, it's a very printable trends as that volume continues to trend up, pricing will follow it. So as we say earlier, it's the campaign of pricing in those compounding improvements over time. But going into the fourth quarter and into '16, what I can tell you is that pricing environment is very healthy."

When I say that, last year, if they got delayed, they just put it off for the next week or you tell the weather guy right. Whereas this year, we're seeing contractors work on Saturdays and Sundays. We're seeing a lot more sense of urgency of getting these jobs done which is very good news for us because that means they have backlogs now that they going to get this work done so they can get off to the other work which really signals from a macro perspective that this will work out there and we will continue to see the steady growth."

At Vulcan, we posted another strong quarter and we remain on track to have a very good year. Our solid performance, continued revenue growth and margin expansion are a direct result of the great efforts of our people. Today, you're going to hear about steady recovery, solid price improvement and about our sharp focus on the things we can control. Now, we won't be giving guidance for 2016 in today's call but as we begin our planning cycle for next year, our fundamental trajectory remains intact. We continue to experience a gradual, steady recovery in demand and shipments. Although the details, of course, vary from market to market, we also continue to see a positive pricing climate with appropriate increases, either announced or planned for next year. We remain well positioned to convert incremental revenues into incremental gross profit at an impressive clip. We are excited about the opportunities ahead. Our people know that they must remain highly focused on margin improvement and continue to drive ongoing improvements in our business. We're focused on capitalizing on our momentum. Our people are engaged and entrepreneurial, and they are sharing best practices across the organization. They know that they are a power to serve our customers and keep making our company more profitable and better in every way. We also, all of us, remain highly focused on safe operations, protecting the health and safety of our employees at all times. 
Now to company specifics. The recovery in construction activity continued across most of our markets. As we will show you, the metrics are certainly trending in the right direction. While demand is recovering gradually to more normal levels, we have enjoyed sustained margin expansion and we continue to grow our profitability in a disciplined manner. As construction activity and materials demand continue to pick up, we are also seeing improving confidence in pricing. Now, we've had some cost increases during the last 2 quarters. Even though some of this is expected given volume growth, we are very focused on continually improving our operating performance. These efforts began to pay off in September when we saw marked improvements in our costs. We are going to stay very focused on this. Our employees are doing a really good job, turning incremental revenues into incremental profits. And let me add, we see these trends continuing. We are heading into 2016 with the wind at our back. That said, we are totally focused on finishing this year strong. 
Now let's talk about the third quarter. Demand continued to recover gradually in the quarter. Our results demonstrated the earnings leverage in our business model. With improving market conditions and our focus on profit improvements, both pricing and margins continued to expand. As you can see on Slide 4, a 19% increase in total revenues converted to a 39% increase in gross profit. This also drove a 47% increase in adjusted EBIT and a 31% increase in adjusted EBITDA. Our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 82%. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.95 per diluted share, an increase of $0.41 from the prior year. Gross profit margins increased by 490 basis points and were supported by pricing momentum. We enjoyed strong earnings growth in aggregates, as well as in our asphalt and concrete segments. We continue to manage and leverage SAG. SAG costs did increase in absolute terms. Here, onetime items offset lower headcount-related costs. What's important is as a percent of sales, SAG is trending towards 8% for the year, down about 1% from the prior year. All in all, I'm very pleased with our people's performance. Whether measured by margin percentage or per-unit profit, our profitably continued to improve very significantly. 
Now let's take a look at our shipments across the U.S. The map on Slide 5 shows a breakdown of our growth in shipments of aggregates on a same-store basis across the country. In the quarter, we saw solid demand growth even though many customers faced bottlenecks impeding shipments. It's important to recognize what a good job our local teams are doing working with our customers to meet rising demand effectively and efficiently. Momentum continued with solid growth in key states. Shipments in Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Texas and Louisiana, each grew by 10% or more. In contrast to majority of our markets which were up, Illinois was down about 10%. This was due to significant large project work completed in 2014. Now at the same time, California saw healthy growth in the third quarter as major projects kicked off after being delayed in the first half of the year. 
I'd like to turn your attention to Slide 6 which shows our year-over-year growth in shipments. As you can see, this is a very similar pattern to the last slide with solid year-to-date growth in aggregate shipments of 10% in total or 7% on a same-store basis. Both our East and West Coast markets continued to enjoy healthy growth as did Texas. Shipments in the Gulf Coast markets were also strong, with the exception of the Central Gulf Coast region. 
Turning to Slide 7. You can see that our pricing continues to strengthen and for the quarter, it improved in line with our expectations of 8% over the prior year's quarter. In a number of markets, we saw year-over-year freight-adjusted price improvements in excess of 10%. These increases were fairly broad-based and occurred across all product types. And in more than half of our markets, we had price increases ranging from $0.60 to $1.20 per ton. For the quarter, we didn't see this level of price increases in Virginia, South Carolina and Arizona because we had much larger shipments of base material and fines on new construction in large projects. As discussed before, volume in base and fines can attract from price but it improves overall profitability. Let me emphasize the fact that pricing momentum will continue for us. There are 3 primary reasons that the pricing climate should remain positive: one, customer confidence continues to improve; two, increasing demand builds backlogs; and third, construction-related businesses are increasingly focused on earning adequate returns. Effective pricing performance remains a key focus for our management teams across our footprint. We are focused on delivering value to customers, while earning a good return on the significant investments that we make on their behalf. This ties directly to providing excellent service to our customers, the right product, the right quality, the right time and being paid the right price for superior service and value. 
Now we've talked a lot on past calls about the 3 profit drivers that are expanding our margins and profits. That's because it's important. As a reminder, the 3 profit drivers are sales and production mix, price and operating efficiencies. We call these the 3 circles. As you can see on Slide 8, our third quarter and trailing 12-month gross profit per ton increased 23% and 25%, respectively. So in the quarter, on a same-store basis, price was up $0.86 per ton and gross profit margin was up $0.90 per ton. Our sales and operations people are doing a superior job turning demand growth into higher profitability. Our local teams continue to do an outstanding job managing the combination of price, operating efficiencies, volume and product mix. This is something we will stay focused on every day. With respect to the 3 circles, we've talked about the positive pricing environment and we've talked about new construction improving the impact of product mix on profitability. Regarding the third circle, operating efficiencies and leverage. We continue to emphasize production planning and operating efficiencies across the business. Despite improvements in unit profitability and same-store costs, we are seeing some areas of rising costs. As I mentioned, I'm not satisfied with this and neither are our people. Still, we're seeing some cost rise. About 2/3 of these increases resulted from geographic mix and fringe benefits, often outside our control. In addition, during the last 2 quarters, we have begun to see a trend of rising repair maintenance and labor cost in some areas. Even though this isn't surprising, we are not going to accept it. Growing volumes are requiring us to run our operations longer, resulting in more repairs and higher-than-budgeted spending on parts and supplies. And labor cost in some areas were up in the first 8 months of the year. We saw cost go up, we focused on them and we realized improvements in September. We will continue to manage these costs very carefully. 
Let's turn to Slide 9. Our employees can be very proud of this chart. It clearly shows that our people are highly focused on continuous improvement and quality of earnings. We're excited about the ongoing, very positive trend in unit margin expansion. We have now seen 9 consecutive quarters of expanding unit margin and will continue to post improvements. Since our volumes begin to grow in the second half of 2013, our gross profit per ton has increased sharply. We are now seeing the additional benefits of strong and ongoing improvement in pricing. Our unit profitability is higher than when these operations were producing twice the volume. Again, I would expect this trend to continue into 2016. 
Slide 10 shows our incremental margin performance in the aggregate segment. This underpins the margin improvement you saw on the previous slide. Our incremental gross profit margin for the third quarter was 72%, excluding the impact of acquisitions completed during 2014. Aggregates gross profit grew by $60 million on incremental freight-adjusted revenues of $83 million. Including the impact of acquisitions, the incremental margin was 65% with a gross margin on those revenues impacted mainly by higher costs at acquired operations as we bring them up to our standards, and by higher cost for repair maintenance. Now since quarterly figures can be distorted by seasonality or onetime cost, we also present the same metric calculated on a trailing 12-month basis. For this time period, incremental gross profit margin was 73%. Aggregates gross profit increased approximately $177 million or incremental revenues of $242 million, adjusted for the same acquisitions. On a trailing 12-month basis, the flow-through rate was consistently -- has consistently exceeded the company's stated goal of 60% since volumes began to recover in the second half of 2013. Given our strategic focus on the aggregates business, our ability to take that revenue to the bottom line is a big advantage for Vulcan, as volumes continued to recover. With that, I'll turn the call over to John for additional comments on our earnings performance and outlook for the remainder of the year. John?"

[Audio Gap]
Sorry. Thanks, Tom. I'll begin with Slide 11 and as we did last quarter, use it to recap many of the trends Tom just reviewed. On this slide, we highlight the improved profitability of our aggregates segment, both in total gross profit dollars and on a per ton basis since the recovery in volumes began in the second half of 2013. On the left-hand side of the chart, you see that for the trailing 12 months just ended, we shipped 175 million tons, 35 million tons more than for the trailing 12 months ending in the second quarter of 2013, just before the recovery began. Now looking to the right-hand side of the chart, you see that aggregates segment gross profit for the 12 months just ended was $682 million or $324 million ahead of the 12 months before the recovery began. So on $35 million of incremental aggregates tons shipped so far in the recovery, we've delivered $324 million in incremental segment gross profit. Gross profit per ton has increased $1.35 or 53%. And a 25% increase in shipments has been converted into a 90% increase in segment gross profit. These facts, we believe, illustrate the impact of the continuous compounding performance improvements you heard Tom reference and that in many ways characterized our current aggregate-centric strategy and execution focus. 
Now turning to Slide 12 which shows the solid performance of our asphalt and concrete businesses for the third quarter. Segment gross profit and unit profitability in each of these segments increased significantly versus the prior year and year-to-date, the gross profit from these businesses has exceeded plan. Asphalt gross profit for the quarter was $30 million, a year-over-year improvement of $15 million, driven by improving same-store volumes, strong cost disciplines and margin management, as well as the impact of acquired operations. As a reminder, our acquisition and swap activities have added 19 asphalt plants to our portfolio since the second half of last year. On a same-store basis, asphalt volumes grew 20%, in part due to work deferred from the first half of the year, and asphalt gross profit grew $11 million. Vulcan is among the 5 largest producers of asphalt in the country and these operations complement our aggregates operations very well. Third quarter concrete gross profit was approximately $10 million compared to $5 million in the prior quarter and the prior year. Margins in this business segment have benefited from divestitures and other actions to focus our portfolio. The operations we have divested lost $2 million at the gross profit line in the prior year quarter. On a same-store basis, concrete volumes were flat versus the prior year and gross profit improved by $3 million. 
I'll now wrap up with Slide 13 and a recap of our full year 2015 outlook, before handing the call back to Tom for some closing remarks. In short, our outlook for the full year remains largely consistent with that presented in our second quarter call, and we are reaffirming our expectations for full year adjusted EBITDA in the range of $775 million to $825 million. As usual, we note that weather patterns can impact results in the fourth quarter significantly, particularly if they shorten the total construction season. But, and as you've seen earlier in this call, the business is performing well and it is performing as expected.
Now ticking through a few of the individual drivers. We currently expect full year volumes of approximately 177 million tons, up 9% year-on-year in total and 7% on a same-store basis. As noted earlier, we see the gradual recovery in demand continuing across most of our markets. However, capacity constraints at various points in the construction chain, for example, the availability of skilled construction labor in certain markets have made it difficult for many of our customers to catch up fully on work deferred due to rain in the first half of the year. And the continued uncertainty regarding federal highway legislation has begun to impact timing of certain road projects on the margin. With respect to pricing, we expect the currently positive environment to persist and we currently expect to finish 2015 with a year-on-year increase in average freight-adjusted selling prices of approximately 7%. As we'd indicated, pricing momentum in the second half of the year has been stronger than in the first half of the year. Our asphalt and concrete segments have performed ahead of plan, both on a same-store basis and as a result of moves we've made to strengthen our portfolio. These segments should generate full-year gross profit of approximately $95 million but again, please note that fourth quarter weather patterns can significantly impact actual results. SAG remains roughly in line with plan and declining as a percent of sales. Importantly, direct salary and wage cost for SAG headcount have remained flat this year and we do not expect the rise of pension and other postretirement benefit costs that we've had this year to reoccur next year. Core capital spending, excluding dollars committed to the purchase of new ships to service our Yucatán quarry, remains in line with plan. As noted in our earnings release, we may elect to pull some spending forward from 2016 in order to capitalize on certain procurement opportunities. As has been our practice, we plan to issue guidance for our 2016 year during our February earnings call. And certainly, a number of things can change between now and then, including federal highway legislation which Tom will touch on in a moment. But as we sit here in early November, we see volume and pricing trends similar to those we've seen year-to-date continuing to the fourth quarter and into next year. And we, of course, remain intently focused on converting that top line revenue growth into cash flow and earnings growth to the very best of our ability. As Tom said at the beginning of the call, our basic trajectory remains intact. Tom, back to you."

Our employees are working hard to ensure our strong performance, continue revenue growth and margin expansion. I can't say enough good things about our people.

We'll get fair value for the major investments we make in this business. I can tell you it's all about creating value for our customers and our company. 
Now before I conclude, I'd like to say a few things about the Highway bill. I reported in our last call about the significant progress in Washington towards the new bill. The Senate, with great leadership did its job when it passed a new six-year bill, the Drive Act, on July 30. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee marked up its version of the highway bill 2 weeks ago. Congressional leaders believe it may be possible to conference the 2 bills and pass the final highway bill before the end of November. We are encouraged by the bipartisan progress that is occurring in Congress to address America's infrastructure challenges. We have been very engaged in efforts to encourage Congress to step up to this challenge. A new multi-year highway bill will be a step in the right direction, and our nation's leaders will need to take additional big steps in the years to come. This is important for our country, our industry and for Vulcan. 
In closing, I truly appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Looking forward, to the rest of 2015 and into 2016, I want you to know that we are very energized and engaged. We are focused on the fundamentals, on finding new ways to grow our company and its profitability every day. Now if the operator will give the required instructions, we will be happy to respond to your questions."

But everything else is making pretty good progress. The facts and circumstances vary by market but everything else is making pretty good progress. The one issue that we do continue to see in some markets, and it will inform all of our plants for 2016 when we get there is just the pace at which this growing demand and recovery demand really gets turned into And again, in some markets that's a function of large project timing and how quickly DoTs can get their raised level of funding out the door into new projects, so we'll monitor that closely.

But you've got to remember, there's going to be a lag here between whether it's the increase in state funding or the federal funding, just because they've got to be able to get the funds and then they've got to be able to set up plants in the projects of the projects have start construction. So at best, I would say it would be end of '16 but I think the Highway bill impact of that, you really see towards the '16 and '17. What is hidden in there is you will start to see states have great relief with unlocking large multi-year projects. But even if they said they're not doing it, they've got a number of them that are just hesitant to do anything until they see that bill, and that I think will flow through -- start to flow through in '16, but real impact, I believe, will be 70.

So there's a lot of dispersion based on local market factors and in a single quarter, mix of business and other things. The same is true on the volume side of the business. If the average volume is roughly 7.5, then you've got some that are up 20, 19, 13, 11, 10, 10, but you also have a couple as we highlighted that are nearly like Illinois, nearly down 10%. And so, again, any single quarter view is going to have that kind of dispersion amongst our geographic businesses. And therefore, all the more reason to make sure you also take these kind of trailing 12 months or longer-term views of the business."

At Vulcan, we posted another strong quarter and we remain on track to have a very good year. Our solid performance, continued revenue growth and margin expansion are a direct result of the great efforts of our people. Today, you're going to hear about steady recovery, solid price improvement and about our sharp focus on the things we can control. Now, we won't be giving guidance for 2016 in today's call but as we begin our planning cycle for next year, our fundamental trajectory remains intact. We continue to experience a gradual, steady recovery in demand and shipments. Although the details, of course, vary from market to market, we also continue to see a positive pricing climate with appropriate increases, either announced or planned for next year. We remain well positioned to convert incremental revenues into incremental gross profit at an impressive clip. We are excited about the opportunities ahead. Our people know that they must remain highly focused on margin improvement and continue to drive ongoing improvements in our business. We're focused on capitalizing on our momentum. Our people are engaged and entrepreneurial, and they are sharing best practices across the organization. They know that they are a power to serve our customers and keep making our company more profitable and better in every way. We also, all of us, remain highly focused on safe operations, protecting the health and safety of our employees at all times. 
Now to company specifics. The recovery in construction activity continued across most of our markets. As we will show you, the metrics are certainly trending in the right direction. While demand is recovering gradually to more normal levels, we have enjoyed sustained margin expansion and we continue to grow our profitability in a disciplined manner. As construction activity and materials demand continue to pick up, we are also seeing improving confidence in pricing. Now, we've had some cost increases during the last 2 quarters. Even though some of this is expected given volume growth, we are very focused on continually improving our operating performance. These efforts began to pay off in September when we saw marked improvements in our costs. We are going to stay very focused on this. Our employees are doing a really good job, turning incremental revenues into incremental profits. And let me add, we see these trends continuing. We are heading into 2016 with the wind at our back. That said, we are totally focused on finishing this year strong. 
Now let's talk about the third quarter. Demand continued to recover gradually in the quarter. Our results demonstrated the earnings leverage in our business model. With improving market conditions and our focus on profit improvements, both pricing and margins continued to expand. As you can see on Slide 4, a 19% increase in total revenues converted to a 39% increase in gross profit. This also drove a 47% increase in adjusted EBIT and a 31% increase in adjusted EBITDA. Our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 82%. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.95 per diluted share, an increase of $0.41 from the prior year. Gross profit margins increased by 490 basis points and were supported by pricing momentum. We enjoyed strong earnings growth in aggregates, as well as in our asphalt and concrete segments. We continue to manage and leverage SAG. SAG costs did increase in absolute terms. Here, onetime items offset lower headcount-related costs. What's important is as a percent of sales, SAG is trending towards 8% for the year, down about 1% from the prior year. All in all, I'm very pleased with our people's performance. Whether measured by margin percentage or per-unit profit, our profitably continued to improve very significantly. 
Now let's take a look at our shipments across the U.S. The map on Slide 5 shows a breakdown of our growth in shipments of aggregates on a same-store basis across the country. In the quarter, we saw solid demand growth even though many customers faced bottlenecks impeding shipments. It's important to recognize what a good job our local teams are doing working with our customers to meet rising demand effectively and efficiently. Momentum continued with solid growth in key states. Shipments in Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Texas and Louisiana, each grew by 10% or more. In contrast to the majority of our markets which were up, Illinois was down about 10%. This was due to significant large project work completed in 2014. Now at the same time, California saw healthy growth in the third quarter as major projects kicked off after being delayed in the first half of the year. 
I'd like to turn your attention to Slide 6 which shows our year-over-year growth in shipments. As you can see, this is a very similar pattern to the last slide with solid year-to-date growth in aggregate shipments of 10% in total or 7% on a same-store basis. Both our East and West Coast markets continued to enjoy healthy growth as did Texas. Shipments in the Gulf Coast markets were also strong, with the exception of the Central Gulf Coast region. 
Turning to Slide 7. You can see that our pricing continues to strengthen and for the quarter, it improved in line with our expectations of 8% over the prior year's quarter. In a number of markets, we saw year-over-year freight-adjusted price improvements in excess of 10%. These increases were fairly broad-based and occurred across all product types. And in more than half of our markets, we had price increases ranging from $0.60 to $1.20 per ton. For the quarter, we didn't see this level of price increases in Virginia, South Carolina and Arizona because we had much larger shipments of base material and fines on new construction in large projects. As discussed before, volume in base and fines can detract from price but it improves overall profitability. Let me emphasize the fact that pricing momentum will continue for us. There are 3 primary reasons that the pricing climate should remain positive: one, customer confidence continues to improve; two, increasing demand builds backlogs; and third, construction-related businesses are increasingly focused on earning adequate returns. Effective pricing performance remains a key focus for our management teams across our footprint. We are focused on delivering value to customers while earning a good return on the significant investments that we make on their behalf. This ties directly to providing excellent service to our customers, the right product, the right quality, the right time and being paid the right price for superior service and value. 
Now we've talked a lot on past calls about the 3 profit drivers that are expanding our margins and profits. That's because it's important. As a reminder, the 3 profit drivers are: sales and production mix, price and operating efficiencies. We call these the 3 circles. As you can see on Slide 8, our third quarter and trailing 12-month gross profit per ton increased 23% and 25%, respectively. So in the quarter, on a same-store basis, price was up $0.86 per ton and gross profit margin was up $0.90 per ton. Our sales and operations people are doing a superior job turning demand growth into higher profitability. Our local teams continue to do an outstanding job managing the combination of price, operating efficiencies, volume and product mix. This is something we will stay focused on every day. With respect to the 3 circles, we've talked about the positive pricing environment and we've talked about new construction improving the impact of product mix on profitability. Regarding the third circle, operating efficiencies and leverage. We continue to emphasize production planning and operating efficiencies across the business. Despite improvements in unit profitability and same-store costs, we are seeing some areas of rising costs. As I mentioned, I'm not satisfied with this and neither are our people. Still, we're seeing some cost rise. About 2/3 of these increases resulted from geographic mix and fringe benefits, often outside our control. In addition, during the last 2 quarters, we have begun to see a trend of rising repair maintenance and labor cost in some areas. Even though this isn't surprising, we are not going to accept it. Growing volumes are requiring us to run our operations longer, resulting in more repairs and higher-than-budgeted spending on parts and supplies. And labor costs in some areas were up in the first 8 months of the year. We saw cost go up, we focused on them and we realized improvements in September. We will continue to manage these costs very carefully. 
Let's turn to Slide 9. Our employees can be very proud of this chart. It clearly shows that our people are highly focused on continuous improvement and quality of earnings. We're excited about the ongoing, very positive trend in unit margin expansion. We have now seen 9 consecutive quarters of expanding unit margin and will continue to post improvements. Since our volumes began to grow in the second half of 2013, our gross profit per ton has increased sharply. We are now seeing the additional benefits of strong and ongoing improvement in pricing. Our unit profitability is higher than when these operations were producing twice the volume. Again, I would expect this trend to continue into 2016. 
Slide 10 shows our incremental margin performance in the aggregate segment. This underpins the margin improvement you saw on the previous slide. Our incremental gross profit margin for the third quarter was 72%, excluding the impact of acquisitions completed during 2014. Aggregates gross profit grew by $60 million on incremental freight-adjusted revenues of $83 million. Including the impact of acquisitions, the incremental margin was 65%, with a gross margin on those revenues impacted mainly by higher costs at acquired operations as we bring them up to our standards and by higher cost for repair maintenance. Now since quarterly figures can be distorted by seasonality or onetime cost, we also present the same metric calculated on a trailing 12-month basis. For this time period, incremental gross profit margin was 73%. Aggregates gross profit increased approximately $177 million on incremental revenues of $242 million, adjusted for the same acquisitions. On a trailing 12-month basis, the flow-through rate was consistently -- has consistently exceeded the company's stated goal of 60% since volumes began to recover in the second half of 2013. Given our strategic focus on the aggregates business, our ability to take that revenue to the bottom line is a big advantage for Vulcan, as volumes continued to recover. With that, I'll turn the call over to John for additional comments on our earnings performance and outlook for the remainder of the year. John?"

[Audio Gap]
Sorry. Thanks, Tom. I'll begin with Slide 11 and as we did last quarter, use it to recap many of the trends Tom just reviewed. On this slide, we highlight the improved profitability of our aggregates segment, both in total gross profit dollars and on a per ton basis since the recovery in volumes began in the second half of 2013. On the left-hand side of the chart, you see that for the trailing 12 months just ended, we shipped 175 million tons, 35 million tons more than for the trailing 12 months ending in the second quarter of 2013, just before the recovery began. Now looking to the right-hand side of the chart, you see that aggregates segment gross profit for the 12 months just ended was $682 million or $324 million ahead of the 12 months before the recovery began. So on $35 million of incremental aggregates tons shipped so far in the recovery, we've delivered $324 million in incremental segment gross profit. Gross profit per ton has increased $1.35 or 53% and a 25% increase in shipments has been converted into a 90% increase in segment gross profit. These facts, we believe, illustrate the impact of the continuous compounding performance improvements you heard Tom reference and that in many ways characterized our current aggregate-centric strategy and execution focus. 
Now turning to Slide 12 which shows the solid performance of our asphalt and concrete businesses for the third quarter. Segment gross profit and unit profitability in each of these segments increased significantly versus the prior year and year-to-date, the gross profit from these businesses has exceeded plan. Asphalt gross profit for the quarter was $30 million, a year-over-year improvement of $15 million, driven by improving same-store volumes, strong cost disciplines and margin management, as well as the impact of acquired operations. As a reminder, our acquisition and swap activities have added 19 asphalt plants to our portfolio since the second half of last year. On a same-store basis, asphalt volumes grew 20%, in part due to work deferred from the first half of the year, and asphalt gross profit grew $11 million. Vulcan is among the 5 largest producers of asphalt in the country and these operations complement our aggregates operations very well. Third quarter concrete gross profit was approximately $10 million compared to $5 million in the prior quarter and the prior year. Margins in this business segment have benefited from divestitures and other actions to focus our portfolio. The operations we have divested lost $2 million at the gross profit line in the prior year quarter. On a same-store basis, concrete volumes were flat versus the prior year and gross profit improved by $3 million. 
I'll now wrap up with Slide 13 and a recap of our full year 2015 outlook, before handing the call back to Tom for some closing remarks. In short, our outlook for the full year remains largely consistent with that presented in our second quarter call, and we are reaffirming our expectations for full year adjusted EBITDA in the range of $775 million to $825 million. As usual, we note that weather patterns can impact results in the fourth quarter significantly, particularly if they shorten the total construction season. But, and as you've seen earlier in this call, the business is performing well and it is performing as expected.
Now ticking through a few of the individual drivers. We currently expect full year volumes of approximately 177 million tons, up 9% year-on-year in total and 7% on a same-store basis. As noted earlier, we see the gradual recovery in demand continuing across most of our markets. However, capacity constraints at various points in the construction chain, for example, the availability of skilled construction labor in certain markets, have made it difficult for many of our customers to catch up fully on work deferred due to rain in the first half of the year. And the continued uncertainty regarding federal highway legislation has begun to impact timing of certain road projects on the margin. With respect to pricing, we expect the currently positive environment to persist and we currently expect to finish 2015 with a year-on-year increase in average freight-adjusted selling prices of approximately 7%. As we'd indicated, pricing momentum in the second half of the year has been stronger than in the first half of the year. Our asphalt and concrete segments have performed ahead of plan, both on a same-store basis and as a result of moves we've made to strengthen our portfolio. These segments should generate full-year gross profit of approximately $95 million but again, please note that fourth quarter weather patterns can significantly impact actual results. SAG remains roughly in line with plan and declining as a percent of sales. Importantly, direct salary and wage cost for SAG headcount have remained flat this year and we do not expect the rise of pension and other postretirement benefit costs that we've had this year to reoccur next year. Core capital spending, excluding dollars committed to the purchase of new ships to service our Yucatán quarry, remains in line with plan. As noted in our earnings release, we may elect to pull some spending forward from 2016 in order to capitalize on certain procurement opportunities. As has been our practice, we plan to issue guidance for our 2016 year during our February earnings call. And certainly, a number of things can change between now and then, including federal highway legislation which Tom will touch on in a moment. But as we sit here in early November, we see volume and pricing trends similar to those we've seen year-to-date continuing through the fourth quarter and into next year. And we, of course, remain intently focused on converting that top line revenue growth into cash flow and earnings growth to the very best of our ability. As Tom said at the beginning of the call, our basic trajectory remains intact. Tom, back to you."

We'll get fair value for the major investments we make in this business. I can tell you it's all about creating value for our customers and our company. 
Now before I conclude, I'd like to say a few things about the Highway bill. I reported in our last call about the significant progress in Washington towards the new bill. The Senate, with great leadership did its job when it passed a new six-year bill, the Drive Act, on July 30. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee marked up its version of the highway bill 2 weeks ago. Congressional leaders believe it may be possible to conference the 2 bills and pass the final highway bill before the end of November. We are encouraged by the bipartisan progress that is occurring in Congress to address America's infrastructure challenges. We have been very engaged in efforts to encourage Congress to step up to this challenge. A new multi-year highway bill will be a step in the right direction, and our nation's leaders will need to take additional big steps in the years to come. This is important for our country, our industry and for Vulcan. 
In closing, I truly appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials Company. Looking forward, to the rest of 2015 and into 2016, I want you to know that we are very energized and engaged.

More than half of our markets in the third quarter saw double-digit growth, a little bit of lagging as we talked about, with Alabama, Mississippi, kind of the center of the country. But overall, we continue to see healthy demand growth, whether that's across geographies or market segments. So we don't see anything that would give us cause for slowdown, whether for fourth quarter or afterwards. Now if you look at the same thing on price, we continue to see very healthy climate for price increases. That's built by customer confidence and by rising demand."

That was about 2/3 of it, which geographic mix is usually remote distribution network or higher cost markets. That will always fixes itself, so that will come back around. The fringes are one time or won't last. The other piece of that was R&M, which is natural for this time of the cycle. And then, in some areas, we had labor costs that were up in the second quarter and the third quarter. We recognized those. I think our folks did a good job of addressing those and we saw marked improvement in cost overall in September. So it's a -- what's important here is that we focus on the things that we can control.

From a geographic point of view, it's almost easier to talk about the ends of the spectrum so in terms of recovery toward normalized demand for us, on one end of the spectrum certainly we have some Texas markets, they're a bit further along in the recovery. In our view, still doing quite well but a bit further along. And on the other end, as Tom has mentioned before, we have our Mississippi, Alabama, Illinois, kind of our middle of the country markets, that really haven't gotten much momentum yet in terms of the recovery moving along. But everything else is making pretty good progress. The facts and circumstances vary by market but everything else is making pretty good progress. The one issue that we do continue to see in some markets, and it will inform all of our plans for 2016 when we get there, is just the pace at which this growing demand and recovering demand really gets turned into aggregate shipments. And again, in some markets that's a function of large project timing and how quickly DoTs can get their raised level of funding out the door into new projects, so we'll monitor that closely. And in other markets, that's a function of these,  if you will, bottlenecks in the construction supply chain that we've referenced, where availability of crews or equipment or developed land or skilled trade labor, those can really be the determinants of how quickly we grow. So net-net, we continue to see across our portfolio a steady gradual repeating recovery. This basically is on the same kind of trend we've been on for 2015."

That compares to a House bill -- the draft of the House bill, which is at 1.9% annually, so a little less. Now where we end up, our vote is for the Senate bill, obviously, or something beyond that, but who knows how that's going to turn out. While those increases are really important and we'll take all the funding we can get, more importantly our country needs it, the confidence that this gives the states to move forward with long-term projects or very large projects is really important. It also -- even if it's a six-year bill, it's only funded for 3, it locks in policy for 6 years which also builds confidence, not just for the states but for the entire construction material cycle. So you'll see, this also builds on that confidence we talk a lot about pricing momentum, because there will be funding out there which means there will be projects out there which means there will be work out there for our customers. And so that overall confidence is really important, not just for our customer base and pricing but also for the states, it will allow them to free up more work and drive demand."

So substantial room left. I'd remind people that as an entire construction complex, more and more people are appropriately focused on earning fair returns on capital and earning these kind of incremental margins is consistent with that view.

Whereas this year, we're seeing contractors work on Saturdays and Sundays, we're seeing a lot more sense of urgency of getting these jobs done, which is very good news for us because that means they have backlogs now that they've got to get this work done so they can get on to the other work, which really signals from a macro perspective that there's more work out there and we continue to see the steady growth."
