Now we will turn to our results. Overall, we had a solid Q4, very strong year. We have a good outlook for 2015 and beyond. Our total bookings revenue in Q4 was $1.16 billion, which is an all-time high and reflects 5% growth over Q4 of '13. Bookings margin in Q4 was $982 million or 85% of total bookings.
For the full year, bookings revenue was $4.25 billion, up 13% over 2013. Bookings performance drove a 19% increase in total backlog to $10.62 billion. Contract revenue backlog of $9.79 billion is 20% higher than the year ago. Support revenue backlog of $826 million is up 5%. Revenue in the quarter was $926 million, which is up 16% over Q4 of '13. The revenue composition of the Q4 was $280 million in system sales, $197 million in support and maintenance, $431 million in services and $81 million in reimbursed travel.
For the full year, revenue grew 17% over 2013 to $3.4 million.
System sales revenue reflects a 14% increase over Q4 of '13, strong growth in technology resale and good growth in software revenue. For the full year, system sales revenue grew 12% over 2013 led by software growth of 17%, which was partially offset by lower full year technology resale growth of 4%. Subscription revenue grew 12% for the year.
Q4 system sales margin dollars grew 11% over the year-ago period, and full year system sales margin dollars grew 16% over 2013, reflecting continued strong levels of higher-margin system sales components, like software and subscriptions.
Moving to services. Total services revenue was up 19% compared to Q4 of '13, and 23% for the full year, with strong growth in professional services, Managed Services and ITWorks.
Support and maintenance revenue increased 16% over Q4 of '13 and 9% for the full year. Higher growth rate in Q4 reflects the impact of the quarter having 14 weeks instead of our typical 13 weeks. Note that the revenue benefit of the extra week was minimal for professional services and system sales, as we had low Professional Services utilization during the extra week due to the holiday and system sales is mostly nonrecurring revenue.
Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 14% and Global revenue grew 34% over Q4 of '13. The higher rate of Global growth in Q4 was driven by strong software and technology resale as well as continued growth in Global Managed Services.
For the full year, domestic revenue grew 18% and Global grew 6%.
As a preview tot he annual update of our detailed business model that we'll provide at our Investment Community Meeting on April 14 at HIMSS, I'd like to provide you with the total revenue and growth by business model for the full year 2014.
Licensed software grew 17% to $453 million. Technology resale grew 4% to $273 million. Subscriptions and transaction increased 12% to $220 million. Professional services revenue grew 28% to $1.09 billion. Managed services increased 15% to $549 million. Support and maintenance was up 9% to $725 million. And reimbursed travel was $90 million, which is up 28%.
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q4 was 81.3%, which is down compared to 82.1% in Q4 of '13, reflecting the higher level of tech resale and third-party services compared to the year-ago period.
Full year gross margin of 82.2% was basically flat to 2013.
Looking at operating spending. The fourth quarter operating expenses before share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments were $524 million, which is up 17% compared to adjusted Q4 of '13 operating expenses, which also excluded a settlement charge.
For the full year, operating expenses before share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments up 18% to $1.96 billion. Adjusting the growth rate for the extra week reduces the Q4 growth rate to approximately 10% and the full year growth rate to about 16%.
Client service expenses increased 17% compared to Q4 of '13 and 19% for the full year, driven primarily by continued increase in revenue-generating associates and our services business.
Our investment and software development was up 15% compared to Q4 of '13 and up 16% for the full year, it continues to be driven by investments in our growth initiatives.
G&A expense increased 16% compared to Q4 of '13 and 13% for the full year, driven mostly by increases in personnel expense related to our strong growth and higher amortization expense related to recent acquisitions and acquired intangibles.
Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin before share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments was 24.7% in Q4. This is down 90 basis points compared to Q4 of '13 due to higher tech resale and deferred third-party services. We were also impacted by the extra week, which ended up having a slightly bigger impact on expenses than it did on some revenue elements, such as professional services incurred a full week of expenses but had low utilization due to the holiday.
As we indicated last quarter, we expect the first year of incorporating Siemens health systems into our results to bring our adjusted operating margins down to the low 20% range. We expect operating margin to return to the mid-20s by 2017 based on ongoing leverage in our core business and as you expected accretion ramps.
Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q4 were $148 million or $0.42 per diluted share. GAAP net earnings include share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on earnings of $11 million or $0.03 per diluted share. GAAP net earnings also include adjustments related to our acquisition of Siemens Health Services which had a net impact on earnings of $4 million or $0.02 per diluted share.
Adjusted net earnings were $163 million, and adjusted EPS was $0.47, which is up 20% compared to Q4 of '13. For the year, adjusted net earnings were $576 million and adjusted EPS was $1.65, which is up 17% from 2013.
The Q4 tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 30%, which is lower than our normal tax rate primarily due to reinstatement of the R&D tax credit during the quarter. In total, the lower tax rate benefited Q4 adjusted EPS by $0.02, it was about $0.01 tied to a prior period portion of the credit.
For 2015, we expect our tax rate to be in the 33% to 35% range.
Now move to our balance sheet. We ended Q4 with $1.65 billion of total cash and investments, which is up $94 million compared to Q3. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, is $130 million, down from $147 million in Q3. It was previously announced, we added $500 million of debt early this year, which will increase our balance sheet efficiency and provide ample financial flexibility lower cost. Impact on earnings from the debt be minimal, has not changed our guidance.
Total receivables ended the quarter with $673 million, which is up $56 million from Q3 driven by strong sales in the quarter.
Our DSO in Q4 was 66 days, which compares to DSO of 67 days in Q3 and 67 days in the year-ago quarter. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $223 million. Q4 capital expenditures were $76 million and capitalized software was $47 million.
Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, were $100 million for the quarter.
For the full year, operating cash flow increased 22% to $847 million. Free cash flow for the year was $393 million, with capital expenditures of $276 million and capitalized software of $178 million.
Moving to capitalized software. $47 million of capitalized software in Q4 represents 37% of $126 million of total investment in development opportunities.
Software amortization for the quarter was $28 million, resulting in net capitalization of $19 million or 15% of our total R&D investment.
2015  we expect to continue generating good free cash flow with strong expected operating cash flow growth offsetting an expected increase in capital expenditures tied to beginning construction of a new campus and capital expenditures related to our Siemens Health Services acquisition.
Now I would like to provide an update on our acquisition of Siemens Health Services, which closed last week as scheduled. Purchase price was $1.37 billion, which includes the $1.3 billion agreed upon price and $70 million in working capital adjustments. a significant amount of integration and transition preparation in the 6 months since we announced the acquisition. We still have a lot of work to do, but all of our work today has supported our positive view of health services and we are very excited to move forward as a combined company.
Now I'll go through Q1 and full year 2015 guidance. For Q1, we expect revenue between $1.05 billion and $1.1 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 37% over Q1 of '14.
For the full year, we expect revenue between $4.8 billion and $5 billion, reflecting 44% growth at the midpoint.
We expect Q1 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments to be $0.44 to $0.45 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 20% growth over Q1 '14 adjusted EPS. I'd like to point out that the consensus for Q1 adjusted EPS increased from $0.44 to $0.46 in the last 30 days, to include some significant outliers. Our guidance is based on our outlook, not consensus, but I want to point this out because Q1 consensus tend to shift a bit out of line with the rest of the year, especially when you consider Q1 will naturally conclude the least amount of accretion from health services.
For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted EPS before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments to be $2.05 to $2.15, with the midpoint reflecting 27% growth. We estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense is approximately $0.03 to $0.04 in Q1 and $0.14 to $0.16 for the full year.
Moving to bookings guidance, we expect bookings revenue in Q1 of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion, with the midpoint reflecting 21% growth over Q1 of '14.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane."

Today I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations.
I'll start with our results. Our bookings revenue in Q4 of $1.16 billion reflects 5% growth over Q4 2013, which is an all-time high. Full year booking of $4.25 billion represents 13% over 2013. IVR bookings performance was very good, especially when you consider the mix of long-term bookings of lower than it has been in the past. In Q4, long-term bookings were 24% of total bookings. This is well below our typical of 30% to 32% range. And we did have 1 ITWorks deal in the quarter, the overall lower mix of long-term contracts is a primary reason our bookings were at the lower end of our guidance range.
For the year, 30% of our contracts are long-term compared to 32% last year. As Mike will discuss, our outlook for ITWorks is very good.
Looking at overall contract size. We had strong level of contracts over $5 million and $10 million, with 33 contracts over $5 million, including 16 over $10 million. For the year, we had record levels of contracts in both categories with 112 contracts over $5 million and 63 over $10 million. New business activity was good, with 28% of our bookings coming from outside of our core Millennium install base for both the quarter and full year. This is slightly lower percent than last year which is more reflective of success in our base and lack of success outside of our base.
Looking ahead, our pipeline reflects more business opportunities that we have ever had going into a year with a notable step up problem a number of opportunities we saw in 2014. I'm also pleased with how well-positioned we are competitively in these opportunities. The result I expect 2015 to be a very good year for new business.
I believe we still have a multiyear period ahead of us, where there would be opportunities to win new footprints where the core EHR is Cerner's. Overlapping this opportunity is growing demand for Population Health solutions which continues to be fueled by trend away from fee-for-service payment models. The recent examples of this trend is HHS announcement last month they intend intent to shift from fee-for-service to value-based reimbursement more rapidly than many people expected, with the goal of having 90% of Medicare payments tied to quality or value by 2018.
I believe these trends play to Cerner strengths, as we improve our solutions that meet the present need of healthcare providers, we're also widening our differentiation in Population Health, interoperability and having the most open EHR.
Now I'll discuss a few key areas of our business, starting with Population Health. Our Population Health organization had a strong 2014, with revenue increasing more than 20% to $450 million. This was driven by sales of Enterprise Data Warehouse, analytics, clinical process optimization, HIE, Patient Portal and Healthe registries.
2014 was also a year in which we demonstrated that our Healthe Intent platform has great potential beyond our install base by establishing important new Population Health footprints outside our base. We have many more prospects in 2015. As I mentioned last quarter, we believe we will have instances where our Population Health capabilities are sold first and then lead to new EHR footprints.
Another trend that emerged in 2014 is we're already starting to see opportunities to displace niche providers of Population Health solutions that were purchased by our clients as recently as 18 to 24 months ago. One of our largest bookings in Q4 was for replacing several niche Population Health solutions at a large client. The niche providers have not taken on the significant challenges of aggregating normalizing clinical claims, the financial data across multiple systems. It is also difficult for them to match our ability to bring near real-time information into the clinicians work flow. As a result, we believe most competing offerings are using incomplete latent data sets, part of workflow which makes this level at less attractive to providers.
Moving to our Revenue Cycle business. We had a very good year that included strong growth and good progress of bringing key clients live on our Revenue Cycle solutions. For the year, our Revenue Cycle business grew more than 30% to approximately $200 million, which is a fivefold increase since 2010, reflecting our strong progress on returns on the significant ongoing R&D investments we made making in this space.
A key for our Revenue Cycle business has been getting more large clients to roll out our Revenue Cycle solutions. 2014 was a big year in this regard as we brought sites live for some of our largest clients. And our hosting reference sites us. This success contributed to another 1 of our large IDN clients purchasing a broad suite of Revenue Cycle solutions in the fourth quarter to implement across their 12 acute facilities and 85 ambulatory clinics. 
In addition to our strong current capabilities contributing to this election, a key factor was our work on next-generation Revenue Cycle solutions designed to support emerging financial models that are more aligned with Population Health.
Looking ahead, we have a very strong pipeline for Revenue Cycle that includes several of our large IDN clients. We also believe the significant experience the health services associates bring will help continue our strong momentum.
Moving to the ambulatory space, where we had a strong Q4 and year that included the following highlights: 16% revenue growth to $151 million, record bookings including 30% growth in the business office services where we continue to gain momentum, signed 11 signature displacements of our key competitors, including the 3 largest clients of 1 competitor; signed an alignment deal with an investor-owned postacute care company to do outsource billing for their providers in several markets; and we received best-in-class recognition in the 1 to 10 physician ambulatory EMR category.
We also had a great year in the small hospital market, adding more than 20 CommunityWorks clients during the year and growing bookings over 50%. we're also recognizing it by classes of category leader in the community hospital market.
Outside of the U.S. we had a very strong Q4, with revenue growth growing 34% driven by strength in the U.K., Middle East and Australia. This growth, combined with a good growth in Q3, offsets decline in the first half of the year and led to 6% full year growth. We remain well positioned for good 2015 based on the strong Global pipeline, great 2014 bookings and the complementary Global business the human health services.
I'd like to highlight an announcement from early this year that we helped the UAE Ministry of Health become the first organization in the Middle East to roll out a number portal. The online portal is a bilingual website that allows residents of Dubai and Northern Emirates to connect to communicate directly with the Ministry's healthcare providers. As we discussed in the past, population health is very much a Global opportunity and this is nice milestone and an important region that could lead to broader Population Health opportunities.
One additional Global highlight is that Cerner client Marina became the first U.S. the first non-U.S. hospital during the HIMSS enterprises award. The award recipients are HIMSS stage 6 and 7 organizations that demonstrate significant sustainable improvement of patient outcomes through the utilization of EHRs and information technology, while achieving return on investment.
Before turning the call over to Mike, I'd like to make a few comments on our recently closed acquisition of Siemens Health Services. We're very pleased to welcome the Health Services associates and clients to Cerner. a significant amount of pre-close efforts on both sides, we have hit the ground running. We just had our first joint forecast meeting this past week, just 2 days after the official close of the acquisition. These meetings reinforce my positive view about the opportunities we have as a combined organization. We have a good initial view of cross-sell opportunities and we are already in discussions with many of our new clients about providing additional Cerner solutions to meet their needs, really from replacing their EHR to adding Population Health or device connectivity capabilities. We look forward to providing you updates as we progress through the year.
With that, turn the call over to Mike."
259627,281794127,758904,"Cerner Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2015",2015-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Cerner Corporation","Executives",".Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'm going to discuss ITWorks, professional services and provide a client success highlight.I'll start with ITWorks, which had a great year including a new contract in the fourth quarter. Our new ITWorks",645,".
Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'm going to discuss ITWorks, professional services and provide a client success highlight.
I'll start with ITWorks, which had a great year including a new contract in the fourth quarter. Our new ITWorks client is Genesis Health System, based in Davenport, Iowa. Like most organizations, they have been on a journey to increase quality while reducing costs. They've been an ITWorks alignment is a good match, can improve service and allow for predictable IT spend.
The new relationship also calls for the establishment of a value alignment office, which is aimed at helping Genesis innovate and optimize care processes, ensure patients receive the best possible care, increase return on technology investments. The agreement also includes new services such as help desk operations, application services, the optimization of IT service delivery across the health system.
Financial results for ITWorks were excellent in 2014, with revenue growing over 60% to more than $300 million. We believe our offering is very compelling, because we help clients control spending while getting more done and achieving a higher level of value. The ITWorks clients are all referenceable, 100% have test Meaningful Use, 74% are at HIMSS EMR adoption level 6 or 7, which is more than 3x the 22% industry attainment level. Overall, ITWorks clients are typically mono class that's stay on their latest code, embrace new solutions and services and are strong Cerner advocates. We believe that as provider organizations face ongoing pressures, our ITWorks value proposition will continue to resonate very well. This is reflected in a very strong pipeline, and we expect 2015 to be a record year.
Now I'd like to provide some highlights on from a strong year from a professional services organization that they delivered. In 2014, our professional services revenue grew more than 25% and eclipsed the $1 billion mark, strong growth in traditional implementation revenue as well as operational management, performance improvement and other nonimplementation revenue that is creating diversity in our services business. With approximately 6,000 associates, our professional services organization is the largest healthcare IT-focused consulting business in the world. I believe our services' capabilities create a competitive advantage for competitors that rely almost entirely on third-party service because of our ability to deliver a predictable outcome at a predictable cost.
In 2014, we continued to advance our implementation methodologies, including our model system approach that starts with a fully built best practices system that allows for fine-tuning as users get hands-on experience and training. This approach has the potential to significantly reduce implementation duration and effort, which should benefit new clients transitioning to the Cerner platform.
In 2015, we are focused on first facilitating seamless migration for clients lines of health services that choose to move to Cerner; second, continuing to grow nonimplementation components of our business such as process optimization, Enterprise Resource Planning and performance improvement; and third, staffing expected increase in new footprints that Zane discussed earlier.
Now I'd like to briefly highlight a client accomplishment involving success with our Revenue Cycle solutions. Recently, Cerner client Lafayette General Hospital received a MAP award for the -- from the Healthcare Financial Management Association. MAP stands for Measure, Apply and Perform, and Lafayette General is 1 of only 3 organizations in the country recognized by HFMA for performance improvement and Revenue Cycle. Key achievement of Lafayette was decreasing net AR days from 75 days to 44 days. They were also able to reduce their levels of discharge not funnel build from nearly $20 million down to approximately $6 million. A key to their success has been their ability to leverage Cerner's clinically driven Revenue Cycle to enable staff to capture accurate and complete information at the front end, provide financial clearing capabilities and enable client data to drive coding, billing and cash collection operations.
With that, I'll turn the call over for questions."

I mean, they're kind of waiting for the close. Clients are certainly looking to see what the next step is and those conversations are ongoing. But most of the activity that you're going to see driven by in Q1 from a bookings perspective will be coming almost entirely from Cerner. I think as you look at the Revenue side, top line side, kind of can look at health services providing us between $95 million and $100 million a month on the revenue top line. So I think that's pretty good estimate, that's kind of the number we've talked about and I think that's one that our most recent work with continue to confirm. I think from that perspective, you're going to get a good view of the company for those of you are looking kind of get a little bit of historical view at least kind of the prior year when under Siemens, their 9-30 financial statements under GAAP will be issued some time in the next 60 days as one of our filings, and it will break out health services. So you'll get a little bit of a view. I'll just indicate that when you look at those numbers, top line and I think on the earnings line, they had some onetime things as they put together their GAAP statements and operations that moved up their earnings a little bit more than you'd expect. Basically, if you exclude those in their earnings would have been breakeven, which is kind of what we talked about. So that's a little kind of the color I can provide right now as far as what their impact on Q1 is going to be. And obviously, once we get them in our income statement format and have a little bit better view, we'll certainly think probably be looking to update our trend file and do different things in that space as we combine the companies, there's things like backlog that we just have different approaches on certain elements and try to parse them out between contract and support may not make sense going forward. We may have to go to a single backlog number. But our goal always is to be transparent and provide you guys what you need to make your decisions."

The fact that we have -- we do a 52-, 53-week year, so this year was a 14-week quarter which include that extra week which had more -- had the normal spend, spend but didn't have as much top line impact. I think when you look, we've always looked at the company as we should have a goal of driving down 100 bps per year growth in our margins and our operating margins. I think and that growth is going to kind of go up and down on an annual basis. But if you look back to 2010 and the last 4 years, we're probably averaged right at 100 basis points a year of growth. I think the key really for our operating margins at this point is looking at '15 because when we add in the health services rather and their much lower margins from those revenues, you're going to see a significant impact on our operating margins. As I said in my comments, we'd expect those to be down kind of in the low 20s from current 25 potentially plus percent levels. The good news is that as the accretion starts driving out as we go into the out years, that quickly gets back to current levels and begins to be able to go up at 100 basis points a year expected growth rate. So the 2014 strong, and Q4 particularly, really the margin impact was much driven by a strong hardware quarter and device resale quarter as anything. But I think it doesn't change our view of the business and the opportunities we have to get more efficiencies out. And clearly, as we add health services, bigger company, we should have more opportunities for those efficiencies."

There are things that we just see from how you operate.

And the things that we have built and the things that we will build will continue to add value. So it's a very exciting time. More risk that's borne obviously has impact on the our clients, but we view that as very positive from an IT perspective and their need for to understand the data, know the data and to impact at the Point of Care is going to be more important. So you really think about all those components as part of that future proof."

Now we will turn to our results. Overall, we had a solid Q4, a very strong year, and we have a good outlook for 2015 and beyond. Our total bookings revenue in Q4 was $1.16 billion, which is an all-time high and reflects 5% growth over Q4 of '13. Bookings margin in Q4 was $982 million or 85% of total bookings.
For the full year, bookings revenue was $4.25 billion, up 13% over 2013. Our bookings performance drove a 19% increase in total backlog to $10.62 billion.
Contract revenue backlog of $9.79 billion is 20% higher than the year ago. Support revenue backlog of $826 million is up 5%.
Revenue in the quarter was $926 million, which is up 16% over Q4 of '13. The revenue composition for Q4 was $280 million in system sales, $197 million in support and maintenance, $431 million in services and $81 million in reimbursed travel.
For the full year, revenue grew 17% over 2013 to $3.4 million (sic) [ $3.4 billion ].
System sales revenue reflects a 14% increase over Q4 of '13, with strong growth in technology resale and good growth in software revenue.
For the full year, system sales revenue grew 12% over 2013, driven by software growth of 17%, that was partially offset by lower full year technology resale growth of 4%. Subscription revenue grew 12% for the year.
Q4 system sales margin dollars grew 11% over the year-ago period, and full year system sales margin dollars grew 16% over 2013, reflecting continued strong levels of higher margin system sales components, like software and subscriptions.
Moving to services. Total services revenue was up 19% compared to Q4 of '13, and 23% for the full year, with strong growth in professional services, managed services and ITWorks.
Support and maintenance revenue increased 16% over Q4 of '13, and 9% for the full year. The higher growth rate in Q4 reflects the impact of the quarter having 14 weeks instead of our typical 13 weeks. Note that the revenue benefit of the extra week was minimal for professional services and system sales, as we had low professional services utilization during the extra week due to the holiday and system sales is mostly nonrecurring revenue.
Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 14% and Global revenue grew 34% over Q4 of '13. The higher rate of Global growth in Q4 was driven by strong software and technology resale, as well as continued growth in global managed services.
For the full year, Domestic revenue grew 18% and Global grew 6%.
As a preview to the annual update of our detailed business model that we'll provide at our Investment Community Meeting on April 14 at HIMSS, I'd like to provide you with the total revenue and growth by business model for the full year 2014.
Licensed software grew 17% to $453 million. Technology resale grew 4% to $273 million. Subscriptions and transactions increased 12% to $220 million. Professional services revenue grew 28% to $1.09 billion. Managed services increased 15% to $549 million. Support and maintenance was up 9% to $725 million. And reimbursed travel was $90 million, which is up 28%.
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q4 was 81.3%, which is down compared to 82.1% in Q4 of '13, reflecting the higher level of tech resale and third-party services compared to the year-ago period.
Full year gross margin of 82.2% was basically flat to 2013.
Looking at operating spending. Our fourth quarter operating expenses before share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments were $524 million, which is up 17% compared to adjusted Q4 of '13 operating expenses, which also excluded a settlement charge.
For the full year, operating expenses before share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments were up 18% to $1.96 billion. Adjusting the growth rate for the extra week reduces the Q4 growth rate to approximately 10% and the full year growth rate to about 16%.
Sales and client service expenses increased 17% compared to Q4 of '13 and 19% for the full year, driven primarily by a continued increase in revenue-generating associates in our services businesses.
Our investment in software development was up 15% compared to Q4 of '13 and up 16% for the full year and continues to be driven by investments in our growth initiatives.
G&A expense increased 16% compared to Q4 of '13 and 13% for the full year, driven mostly by increases in personnel expense related to our strong growth and higher amortization expense related to recent acquisitions and acquired intangibles.
Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin before share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments was 24.7% in Q4. This is down 90 basis points compared to Q4 of '13 due to higher tech resale and to third-party services. We were also impacted by the extra week, which ended up having a slightly bigger impact on expenses than it did on some revenue elements, such as professional services, where we incurred a full week of expenses but had low utilization due to the holiday.
As we indicated last quarter, we expect the first year of incorporating Siemens Health Systems (sic) [ Siemens Health Services ] into our results to bring our adjusted operating margins down to the low 20% range. We expect operating margin to return to the mid-20s by 2017 based on ongoing leverage in our core business and as you expected, accretion ramps.
Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q4 were $148 million or $0.42 per diluted share. GAAP net earnings include share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on earnings of $11 million or $0.03 per diluted share. GAAP net earnings also include adjustments related to our acquisition of Siemens Health Services which had a net impact on earnings of $4 million or $0.02 per diluted share.
Adjusted net earnings were $163 million and adjusted EPS was $0.47, which is up 20% compared to Q4 of '13. For the year, adjusted net earnings were $576 million and adjusted EPS was $1.65, which is up 17% from 2013.
The Q4 tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 30%, which is lower than our normal tax rate primarily due to reinstatement of the R&D tax credit during the quarter. In total, the lower tax rate benefited Q4 adjusted EPS by $0.02, with about $0.01 tied to the prior period portion of the credit.
For 2015, we expect our tax rate to be in the 33% to 35% range.
Now I'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q4 with $1.65 billion of total cash and investments, which is up $94 million compared to Q3. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, is $130 million, down from $147 million in Q3. As previously announced, we added $500 million of debt early this year, which will increase our balance sheet efficiency and provide ample financial flexibility at a low cost. The impact on earnings from the debt will be minimal and does not change our guidance.
Total receivables ended the quarter at $673 million, which is up $56 million from Q3, driven by strong sales in the quarter. Our DSO in Q4 was 66 days, which compares to DSO of 67 days in Q3 and 67 days in the year-ago quarter.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $223 million. Q4 capital expenditures were $76 million and capitalized software was $47 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $100 million for the quarter.
For the full year, operating cash flow increased 22% to $847 million. Free cash flow for the year was $393 million, with capital expenditures of $276 million and capitalized software of $178 million.
Moving to capitalized software. The $47 million of capitalized software in Q4 represents 37% of the $126 million of total investment in development opportunities. Software amortization for the quarter was $28 million, resulting in net capitalization of $19 million or 15% of our total R&D investment.
For 2015, we expect to continue generating good free cash flow with strong expected operating cash flow growth offsetting an expected increase in capital expenditures tied to beginning construction of a new campus and capital expenditures related to our Siemens Health Services acquisition.
Now I would like to provide an update on our acquisition of Siemens Health Services, which closed last week as scheduled. The purchase price was $1.37 billion, which includes the $1.3 billion agreed upon price and $70 million in working capital adjustments. We accomplished a significant amount of integration and transition preparation in the 6 months since we announced the acquisition. There's still a lot of work to do, but all of our work to date is supported by our positive view of Health Services, and we are very excited to move forward as a combined company.
Now I'll go through Q1 and full year 2015 guidance. For Q1, we expect revenue between $1.05 billion and $1.1 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 37% over Q1 of '14.
For the full year, we expect revenue between $4.8 billion and $5 billion, reflecting 44% growth at the midpoint.
We expect Q1 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments to be $0.44 to $0.45 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 20% growth over Q1 '14 adjusted EPS. I'd like to point out that the consensus for Q1 adjusted EPS increased from $0.44 to $0.46 in the last 30 days and appears to include some significant outliers. Our guidance is based on our outlook, not consensus, but I wanted to point this out because Q1 consensus seem to shift a bit out of line with the rest of the year, especially when you consider Q1 will naturally include the least amount of accretion from Health Services.
For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted EPS before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments to be $2.05 to $2.15, with the midpoint reflecting 27% growth. Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense is approximately $0.03 to $0.04 in Q1 and $0.14 to $0.16 for the full year.
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q1 of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion, with the midpoint reflecting 21% growth over Q1 of '14.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane."

Today, I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations.
I'll start with our results. Our bookings revenue in Q4 of $1.16 billion reflects 5% growth over Q4 2013, which was an all-time high. Full year bookings of $4.25 billion represent 13% growth over 2013. I view our bookings performance as very good, especially when you consider the mix of long-term bookings was lower than it has been in the past. In Q4, long-term bookings were 24% of total bookings. This is well below our typical of 30% to 32% range. While we did have one ITWorks deal in the quarter, the overall lower mix of long-term contracts is the primary reason our bookings were at the lower end of our guidance range.
For the year, 30% of our contracts were long term compared to 32% last year. As Mike will discuss, our outlook for ITWorks is very good.
Looking at overall contract size. We had strong level of contracts over $5 million and $10 million, with 33 contracts over $5 million, including 16 over $10 million.
For the year, we had record levels of contracts in both categories, with 112 contracts over $5 million and 63 over $10 million.
New business activity was good, with 28% of our bookings coming from outside of our core Millennium install base for both the quarter and full year. This is slightly lower percent than last year, which is more reflective of success in our base than lack of success outside of our base.
Looking ahead, our pipeline reflects more new business opportunities than we have ever had going into a year, with a notable step up from a number of opportunities we saw in 2014. I am also pleased with how well positioned we are competitively in these opportunities. As a result, I expect 2015 to be a very good year for new business.
I believe we still have a multiyear period ahead of us, where there will be opportunities to win new footprints where the core EHR isn't Cerner's. Overlapping this opportunity is growing demand for population health solutions which continues to be fueled by a trend away from fee-for-service payment models. A recent example of this trend is HHS' announcement last month that they intend intent to shift from fee-for-service to value-based reimbursement more rapidly than many people expected, with the goal of having 90% of Medicare payments tied to quality or value by 2018.
I believe these trends play to Cerner's strengths as we improve our solutions that meet the present need of health care providers, while also widening our differentiation in population health, interoperability and having the most open EHR.
Now I'll discuss a few key areas of our business, starting with population health. Our population health organization had a strong 2014, with revenue increasing more than 20% to $450 million. This was driven by sales of Enterprise Data Warehouse, analytics, clinical process optimization, HIE, Patient Portal and Healthe Registries.
2014 was also a year in which we demonstrated that our Healthe Intent platform has great potential beyond our install base by establishing important new population health footprints outside our base. We have many more prospects in 2015. As I mentioned last quarter, we believe we will have instances where our population health capabilities are sold first and then lead to new EHR footprints.
Another trend that emerged in 2014 is that we're already starting to see opportunities to displace niche providers of population health solutions that were purchased by our clients as recently as 18 to 24 months ago. One of our larger bookings in Q4 was for replacing several niche population health solutions at a large client. The niche providers have not taken on the significant challenge of aggregating and normalizing clinical claims and financial data across multiple systems. It is also difficult for them to match our ability to bring near-real-time information into the clinicians' workflow. As a result, we believe most competing offerings are using incomplete and latent datasets, and they are part of the workflow, which makes them less attractive to providers.
Moving to our revenue cycle business. We had a very good year that included strong growth and good progress at bringing key clients live on our revenue cycle solutions. For the year, our revenue cycle business grew more than 30% to approximately $200 million. This is a fivefold increase since 2010, reflecting our strong progress and returns on the significant ongoing R&D investments we made -- been making in this space.
A key for our revenue cycle business has been getting more large clients to roll out our revenue cycle solutions. 2014 was a big year in this regard as we brought sites live for some of our largest clients. And they are now hosting reference sites for us. This success contributed to another one of our large IDN clients purchasing a broad suite of revenue cycle solutions in the fourth quarter to implement across their 12 acute facilities and 85 ambulatory clinics.
In addition to our strong current capabilities contributing to this selection, a key factor was our work on next-generation revenue cycle solutions designed to support emerging financial models that are more aligned with population health.
Looking ahead, we have a very strong pipeline for revenue cycle that includes several of our large IDN clients. We also believe the significant experience the Health Services associates bring will help continue our strong momentum.
Moving to the ambulatory space, where we had a strong Q4 and year that included the following highlights: 16% revenue growth to $151 million; record bookings including 30% growth in the business office services where we continue to gain momentum; signed 11 signature displacements of our key competitors, including the 3 largest clients of one competitor; signed an alignment deal with an investor-owned post-acute care company to do outsourced billing for their providers in several markets; and we received best-in-class recognition in the 1 to 10 physician ambulatory EMR category.
We also had a great year in the small hospital market, adding more than 20 CommunityWorks clients during the year and growing bookings over 50%. We were also recognized again by KLAS as a category leader in the community hospital market.
Outside of the U.S., we had a very strong Q4, with revenue growth growing 34%, driven by strength in the U.K., Middle East and Australia. This growth, combined with the good growth in Q3, offsets decline in the first half of the year and led to 6% full year growth. We remain well positioned for a good 2015 based on the strong global pipeline, great 2014 bookings and the complementary global business of Siemens Health Services.
I'd like to highlight an announcement from early this year that we helped the UAE Ministry of Health become the first organization in the Middle East to roll out a member portal. The online portal is a bilingual website that allows residents of Dubai and Northern Emirates to connect -- to communicate directly with the Ministry's health care providers. As we've discussed in the past, population health is very much a global opportunity, and this is a nice milestone in an important region that could lead to broader population health opportunities.
One additional global highlight is that Cerner client Marina Salud became the first U.S. -- I'm sorry, the first non-U.S. hospital to earn the HIMSS Davies Enterprise Award. Davies Award recipients are HIMSS stage 6 and 7 organizations that demonstrate significant, sustainable improvement of patient outcomes through the utilization of EHRs and information technology, while achieving return on investment.
Before turning the call over to Mike, I'd like to make a few comments on our recently closed acquisition of Siemens Health Services. We're very pleased to welcome the Health Services associates and clients to Cerner. Thanks to a significant amount of pre-close efforts on both sides, we have hit the ground running. We just had our first joint forecast meeting this past week, just 2 days after the official close of the acquisition. These meetings reinforce my positive view about the opportunities we have as a combined organization. We have a good initial view of cross-sell opportunities, and we are already in discussions with many of our new clients about providing additional Cerner solutions to meet their needs, ranging from replacing their EHR, to adding population health or device connectivity capabilities. We look forward to providing you updates as we progress through the year.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

Our new ITWorks",653,".
Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'm going to discuss ITWorks, professional services and provide a client success highlight.
I'll start with ITWorks, which had a great year, including a new contract in the fourth quarter. Our new ITWorks client is Genesis Health System based in Davenport, Iowa. Like most organizations, they have been on a journey to increase quality while reducing costs. They viewed an ITWorks alignment as a good match and can improve service and allow for predictable IT spend.
The new relationship also calls for the establishment of a value alignment office, which is aimed at helping Genesis innovate and optimize care processes, ensure patients receive the best possible care and increase return on technology investments. The agreement also includes new services such as help desk operations, application services and optimization of IT service delivery across their health system.
Financial results for ITWorks were excellent in 2014, with revenue growing over 60% to more than $300 million. We believe our offering is very compelling because we help clients control spending while getting more done and achieving a higher level of value. Our ITWorks clients are all referenceable. 100% have tested for Meaningful Use and 74% are at HIMSS EMR adoption Level 6 or 7, which is more than 3x the 22% industry attainment level. Overall, ITWorks clients are typically model clients that stay on our latest code, embrace new solutions and services and are strong Cerner advocates. We believe that as provider organizations face ongoing pressures, our ITWorks value proposition will continue to resonate very well. This is reflected in a very strong pipeline, and we expect 2015 to be a record year.
Now I'd like to provide some highlights on -- from a strong year from our professional services organization that they delivered. In 2014, our professional services revenue grew more than 25% and eclipsed the $1 billion mark, with strong growth in traditional implementation revenue, as well as operational management, performance improvement and other non-implementation revenue that is creating diversity in our services business. With approximately 6,000 associates, our professional services organization is the largest health care IT-focused consulting business in the world. I believe our services capabilities create a competitive advantage over competitors that rely almost entirely on third-party service because of our ability to deliver a predictable outcome at a predictable cost.
In 2014, we continued to advance our implementation methodologies, including our model system approach that starts with a fully built best practices system that allows for fine-tuning as users get hands-on experience and training. This approach has the potential to significantly reduce implementation duration and effort, which should benefit new clients transitioning to a Cerner platform.
In 2015, we are focused on first facilitating seamless migration for clients of Health Services that choose to move to Cerner; second, continuing to grow non-implementation components of our business such as process optimization, enterprise resource planning and performance improvement; and third, staffing the expected increase in new footprints that Zane discussed earlier.
Now I'd like to briefly highlight a client accomplishment involving success with our revenue cycle solutions. Recently, Cerner client Lafayette General Hospital received a MAP Award for the -- from the Healthcare Financial Management Association. MAP stands for Measure, Apply and Perform, and Lafayette General is one of only 3 organizations in the country recognized by HFMA for performance improvement in revenue cycle. The key achievement of Lafayette was decreasing net AR days from 75 days to 44 days. They were also able to reduce their levels of discharge not final billed from nearly $20 million down to approximately $6 million. A key to their success has been their ability to leverage Cerner's clinically driven revenue cycle to enable staff to capture accurate and complete information at the front end, provide financial clearance capabilities and enable client data to drive coding, billing and cash collection operations.
With that, I'll turn the call over for questions."

That was really impressive that both their teams and our teams were able to have a pretty decent forecast format and a dive onto their opportunities. They're not going to have much contribution to bookings in their first quarter. I mean, they're kind of waiting for the close. Clients are certainly looking to see what the next step is, and those conversations are ongoing. But most of the activity that you're going to see driven by -- in Q1 from a bookings perspective will be coming almost entirely from Cerner. I think as you look at the revenue side, top line side, kind of can look at Health Services providing us between $95 million and $100 million a month on the revenue top line. So I think that's pretty good estimate. That's kind of the number we've talked about. And I think that's one that our most recent work with continue to confirm. I think from that perspective, you're going to get a good view of the company. For those of you that are looking to kind of get a little bit of the historical view, at least kind of the prior year of when under Siemens, their 9/30 financial statements under GAAP will be issued some time in the next 60 days as one of our filings, and it will break out Health Services. So you'll get a little bit of a view. I would just indicate that when you look at those numbers, top line will look about right. And I think on the earnings line, they had some onetime things as they put together their GAAP statements and operations that moved up their earnings a little bit more than you'd expect. Basically, if you exclude those, their earnings would have been breakeven, which is kind of what we talked about. So that's a little kind of the color I can provide right now as far as what their impact on Q1 is going to be. And obviously, once we get them in our income statement format and have a little bit better view, we'll certainly, I think, probably be looking to update our trend file and do different things in that space. As we combine the companies, there's things like backlog that we just have different approaches on certain elements. And trying to parse them out between contract and support may not make sense going forward. We may have to go to a single backlog number.

As I said in my comments, we'd expect those to be down kind of in the low 20s from current 25-potentially-plus percent levels. The good news is that as the accretion starts driving out as we go into the out years, that, that quickly gets back to current levels and begins to be able to go up at 100 basis points a year expected growth rate. So the 2014 strong, and Q4 particularly, really the margin impact was as much driven by a strong hardware quarter and device resale quarter if anything. But I think it doesn't change our view of the business and the opportunities we have to get more efficiencies out. And clearly, as we add Health Services, a bigger company, we should have more opportunities for those efficiencies."

Some of their activity has been extending contracts, so adding years to existing relationships, which is great when we come in because there's a lot of long-term agreements that are in place. If you looked at any particular period where they had a bunch of those, you would come up with a big bookings number. And so that would be -- I don't know that, that's going to be that helpful. I think as you look going forward, are they going to have the same book-to-bill level? We don't know. I don't expect that. At this point, I don't know that I can -- given that in Q1 which is the bookings number we can really talk about, it's going to be so low that it's not really worth doing the math to figure out their book-to-bill. We should be able to give you a more better sense of what their bookings level is going to be as we go forward and get a better sense of kind of what we think on a quarterly basis they'll be able to do.

At the end of the day, it's not a comprehensive platform for managing population health, and I think what the future is, is a true platform-based population health strategy. And I've talked before about kind of 1.0 buyers in this space versus 2.0 buyers. And what I mean by that, people that have actually been assumed -- taking risk, see the need for a system-based approach that's an enterprisewide-based approach that thinks across the continuum side of this. As it relates to integrated services, I think there are some compelling offerings. I think there'll be some -- I think you'll see additional solutions and services for companies that do provide both technology and service moving forward.

Now we will turn to our results. Overall, we had a solid Q4, a very strong year, and we have a good outlook for 2015 and beyond. Our total bookings revenue in Q4 was $1.16 billion, which is an all-time high and reflects 5% growth over Q4 of '13. Bookings margin in Q4 was $982 million or 85% of total bookings.
For the full year, bookings revenue was $4.25 billion, up 13% over 2013. Our bookings performance drove a 19% increase in total backlog to $10.62 billion.
Contract revenue backlog of $9.79 billion is 20% higher than the year ago. Support revenue backlog of $826 million is up 5%.
Revenue in the quarter was $926 million, which is up 16% over Q4 of '13. The revenue composition for Q4 was $280 million in system sales, $197 million in support and maintenance, $431 million in services and $81 million in reimbursed travel.
For the full year, revenue grew 17% over 2013 to $3.4 million (sic) [ $3.4 billion ].
System sales revenue reflects a 14% increase over Q4 of '13, with strong growth in technology resale and good growth in software revenue.
For the full year, system sales revenue grew 12% over 2013, driven by software growth of 17%, that was partially offset by lower full year technology resale growth of 4%. Subscription revenue grew 12% for the year.
Q4 system sales margin dollars grew 11% over the year-ago period, and full year system sales margin dollars grew 16% over 2013, reflecting continued strong levels of higher margin system sales components, like software and subscriptions.
Moving to services. Total services revenue was up 19% compared to Q4 of '13, and 23% for the full year, with strong growth in professional services, managed services and ITWorks.
Support and maintenance revenue increased 16% over Q4 of '13, and 9% for the full year. The higher growth rate in Q4 reflects the impact of the quarter having 14 weeks instead of our typical 13 weeks. Note that the revenue benefit of the extra week was minimal for professional services and system sales, as we had low professional services utilization during the extra week due to the holiday and system sales is mostly nonrecurring revenue.
Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 14% and Global revenue grew 34% over Q4 of '13. The higher rate of Global growth in Q4 was driven by strong software and technology resale, as well as continued growth in global managed services.
For the full year, Domestic revenue grew 18% and Global grew 6%.
As a preview to the annual update of our detailed business model that we'll provide at our Investment Community Meeting on April 14 at HIMSS, I'd like to provide you with the total revenue and growth by business model for the full year 2014.
Licensed software grew 17% to $453 million. Technology resale grew 4% to $273 million. Subscriptions and transactions increased 12% to $220 million. Professional services revenue grew 28% to $1.09 billion. Managed services increased 15% to $549 million. Support and maintenance was up 9% to $725 million. And reimbursed travel was $90 million, which is up 28%.
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q4 was 81.3%, which is down compared to 82.1% in Q4 of '13, reflecting the higher level of tech resale and third-party services compared to the year-ago period.
Full year gross margin of 82.2% was basically flat to 2013.
Looking at operating spending. Our fourth quarter operating expenses before share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments were $524 million, which is up 17% compared to adjusted Q4 of '13 operating expenses, which also excluded a settlement charge.
For the full year, operating expenses before share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments were up 18% to $1.96 billion. Adjusting the growth rate for the extra week reduces the Q4 growth rate to approximately 10% and the full year growth rate to about 16%.
Sales and client service expenses increased 17% compared to Q4 of '13 and 19% for the full year, driven primarily by a continued increase in revenue-generating associates in our services businesses.
Our investment in software development was up 15% compared to Q4 of '13 and up 16% for the full year and continues to be driven by investments in our growth initiatives.
G&A expense increased 16% compared to Q4 of '13 and 13% for the full year, driven mostly by increases in personnel expense related to our strong growth and higher amortization expense related to recent acquisitions and acquired intangibles.
Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin before share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments was 24.7% in Q4. This is down 90 basis points compared to Q4 of '13 due to higher tech resale and to third-party services. We were also impacted by the extra week, which ended up having a slightly bigger impact on expenses than it did on some revenue elements, such as professional services, where we incurred a full week of expenses but had low utilization due to the holiday.
As we indicated last quarter, we expect the first year of incorporating Siemens Health Systems (sic) [ Siemens Health Services ] into our results to bring our adjusted operating margins down to the low 20% range. We expect operating margin to return to the mid-20s by 2017 based on ongoing leverage in our core business and as you expected, accretion ramps.
Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q4 were $148 million or $0.42 per diluted share. GAAP net earnings include share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on earnings of $11 million or $0.03 per diluted share. GAAP net earnings also include adjustments related to our acquisition of Siemens Health Services which had a net impact on earnings of $4 million or $0.02 per diluted share.
Adjusted net earnings were $163 million and adjusted EPS was $0.47, which is up 20% compared to Q4 of '13. For the year, adjusted net earnings were $576 million and adjusted EPS was $1.65, which is up 17% from 2013.
The Q4 tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 30%, which is lower than our normal tax rate primarily due to reinstatement of the R&D tax credit during the quarter. In total, the lower tax rate benefited Q4 adjusted EPS by $0.02, with about $0.01 tied to the prior period portion of the credit.
For 2015, we expect our tax rate to be in the 33% to 35% range.
Now I'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q4 with $1.65 billion of total cash and investments, which is up $94 million compared to Q3. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, is $130 million, down from $147 million in Q3. As previously announced, we added $500 million of debt early this year, which will increase our balance sheet efficiency and provide ample financial flexibility at a low cost. The impact on earnings from the debt will be minimal and does not change our guidance.
Total receivables ended the quarter at $673 million, which is up $56 million from Q3, driven by strong sales in the quarter. Our DSO in Q4 was 66 days, which compares to DSO of 67 days in Q3 and 67 days in the year-ago quarter.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $223 million. Q4 capital expenditures were $76 million and capitalized software was $47 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $100 million for the quarter.
For the full year, operating cash flow increased 22% to $847 million. Free cash flow for the year was $393 million, with capital expenditures of $276 million and capitalized software of $178 million.
Moving to capitalized software. The $47 million of capitalized software in Q4 represents 37% of the $126 million of total investment in development opportunities. Software amortization for the quarter was $28 million, resulting in net capitalization of $19 million or 15% of our total R&D investment.
For 2015, we expect to continue generating good free cash flow with strong expected operating cash flow growth offsetting an expected increase in capital expenditures tied to beginning construction of a new campus and capital expenditures related to our Siemens Health Services acquisition.
Now I would like to provide an update on our acquisition of Siemens Health Services, which closed last week as scheduled. The purchase price was $1.37 billion, which includes the $1.3 billion agreed upon price and $70 million in working capital adjustments. We accomplished a significant amount of integration and transition preparation in the 6 months since we announced the acquisition. There's still a lot of work to do, but all of our work to date is supported by our positive view of Health Services, and we are very excited to move forward as a combined company.
Now I'll go through Q1 and full year 2015 guidance. For Q1, we expect revenue between $1.05 billion and $1.1 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 37% over Q1 of '14.
For the full year, we expect revenue between $4.8 billion and $5 billion, reflecting 44% growth at the midpoint.
We expect Q1 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments to be $0.44 to $0.45 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 20% growth over Q1 '14 adjusted EPS. I'd like to point out that the consensus for Q1 adjusted EPS increased from $0.44 to $0.46 in the last 30 days and appears to include some significant outliers. Our guidance is based on our outlook, not consensus, but I wanted to point this out because Q1 consensus seemed to shift a bit out of line with the rest of the year, especially when you consider Q1 will naturally include the least amount of accretion from Health Services.
For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted EPS before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments to be $2.05 to $2.15, with the midpoint reflecting 27% growth. Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense is approximately $0.03 to $0.04 in Q1 and $0.14 to $0.16 for the full year.
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q1 of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion, with the midpoint reflecting 21% growth over Q1 of '14.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane."

Today, I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations.
I'll start with our results. Our bookings revenue in Q4 of $1.16 billion reflects 5% growth over Q4 2013, which was an all-time high. Full year bookings of $4.25 billion represent 13% growth over 2013. I view our bookings performance as very good, especially when you consider the mix of long-term bookings was lower than it has been in the past. In Q4, long-term bookings were 24% of total bookings. This is well below our typical 30% to 32% range. While we did have one ITWorks deal in the quarter, the overall lower mix of long-term contracts is the primary reason our bookings were at the lower end of our guidance range.
For the year, 30% of our contracts were long term compared to 32% last year. As Mike will discuss, our outlook for ITWorks is very good.
Looking at overall contract size. We had strong level of contracts over $5 million and $10 million, with 33 contracts over $5 million, including 16 over $10 million.
For the year, we had record levels of contracts in both categories, with 112 contracts over $5 million and 63 over $10 million.
New business activity was good, with 28% of our bookings coming from outside of our core Millennium install base for both the quarter and full year. This is slightly lower percent than last year, which is more reflective of success in our base than lack of success outside of our base.
Looking ahead, our pipeline reflects more new business opportunities than we have ever had going into a year, with a notable step up from a number of opportunities we saw in 2014. I am also pleased with how well positioned we are competitively in these opportunities. As a result, I expect 2015 to be a very good year for new business.
I believe we still have a multiyear period ahead of us, where there will be opportunities to win new footprints where the core EHR isn't Cerner's. Overlapping this opportunity is growing demand for population health solutions which continues to be fueled by a trend away from fee-for-service payment models. A recent example of this trend is HHS' announcement last month that they intend intent to shift from fee-for-service to value-based reimbursement more rapidly than many people expected, with the goal of having 90% of Medicare payments tied to quality or value by 2018.
I believe these trends play to Cerner's strengths as we improve our solutions that meet the present need of health care providers, while also widening our differentiation in population health, interoperability and having the most open EHR.
Now I'll discuss a few key areas of our business, starting with population health. Our population health organization had a strong 2014, with revenue increasing more than 20% to $450 million. This was driven by sales of Enterprise Data Warehouse, analytics, clinical process optimization, HIE, Patient Portal and Healthe Registries.
2014 was also a year in which we demonstrated that our Healthe Intent platform has great potential beyond our install base by establishing important new population health footprints outside our base. We have many more prospects in 2015. As I mentioned last quarter, we believe we will have instances where our population health capabilities are sold first and then lead to new EHR footprints.
Another trend that emerged in 2014 is that we're already starting to see opportunities to displace niche providers of population health solutions that were purchased by our clients as recently as 18 to 24 months ago. One of our larger bookings in Q4 was for replacing several niche population health solutions at a large client. The niche providers have not taken on the significant challenge of aggregating and normalizing clinical claims and financial data across multiple systems. It is also difficult for them to match our ability to bring near-real-time information into the clinicians' workflow. As a result, we believe most competing offerings are using incomplete and latent datasets, and they aren't part of the workflow, which makes them less attractive to providers.
Moving to our revenue cycle business. We had a very good year that included strong growth and good progress at bringing key clients live on our revenue cycle solutions. For the year, our revenue cycle business grew more than 30% to approximately $200 million. This is a fivefold increase since 2010, reflecting our strong progress and returns on the significant ongoing R&D investments we made -- been making in this space.
A key for our revenue cycle business has been getting more large clients to roll out our revenue cycle solutions. 2014 was a big year in this regard as we brought sites live for some of our largest clients. And they are now hosting reference sites for us. This success contributed to another one of our large IDN clients purchasing a broad suite of revenue cycle solutions in the fourth quarter to implement across their 12 acute facilities and 85 ambulatory clinics.
In addition to our strong current capabilities contributing to this selection, a key factor was our work on next-generation revenue cycle solutions designed to support emerging financial models that are more aligned with population health.
Looking ahead, we have a very strong pipeline for revenue cycle that includes several of our large IDN clients. We also believe the significant experience the Health Services associates bring will help continue our strong momentum.
Moving to the ambulatory space, where we had a strong Q4 and year that included the following highlights: 16% revenue growth to $151 million; record bookings including 30% growth in the business office services where we continue to gain momentum; signed 11 signature displacements of our key competitors, including the 3 largest clients of one competitor; signed an alignment deal with an investor-owned post-acute care company to do outsourced billing for their providers in several markets; and we received best-in-class recognition in the 1 to 10 physician ambulatory EMR category.
We also had a great year in the small hospital market, adding more than 20 CommunityWorks clients during the year and growing bookings over 50%. We were also recognized again by KLAS as a category leader in the community hospital market.
Outside of the U.S., we had a very strong Q4, with revenue growth growing 34%, driven by strength in the U.K., Middle East and Australia. This growth, combined with the good growth in Q3, offsets decline in the first half of the year and led to 6% full year growth. We remain well positioned for a good 2015 based on the strong global pipeline, great 2014 bookings and the complementary global business of Siemens Health Services.
I'd like to highlight an announcement from early this year that we helped the UAE Ministry of Health become the first organization in the Middle East to roll out a member portal. The online portal is a bilingual website that allows residents of Dubai and Northern Emirates to connect -- to communicate directly with the Ministry's health care providers. As we've discussed in the past, population health is very much a global opportunity, and this is a nice milestone in an important region that could lead to broader population health opportunities.
One additional global highlight is that Cerner client Marina Salud became the first U.S. -- I'm sorry, the first non-U.S. hospital to earn the HIMSS Davies Enterprise Award. Davies Award recipients are HIMSS stage 6 and 7 organizations that demonstrate significant, sustainable improvement of patient outcomes through the utilization of EHRs and information technology, while achieving return on investment.
Before turning the call over to Mike, I'd like to make a few comments on our recently closed acquisition of Siemens Health Services. We're very pleased to welcome the Health Services associates and clients to Cerner. Thanks to a significant amount of pre-close efforts on both sides, we have hit the ground running. We just had our first joint forecast meeting this past week, just 2 days after the official close of the acquisition. These meetings reinforce my positive view about the opportunities we have as a combined organization. We have a good initial view of cross-sell opportunities, and we are already in discussions with many of our new clients about providing additional Cerner solutions to meet their needs, ranging from replacing their EHR, to adding population health or device connectivity capabilities. We look forward to providing you updates as we progress through the year.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

Today, I'm going to discuss ITWorks, professional services and provide a client success highlight.I'll start with ITWorks, which had a great year, including a new contract in the fourth quarter. Our new ITWorks",653,".
Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'm going to discuss ITWorks, professional services and provide a client success highlight.
I'll start with ITWorks, which had a great year, including a new contract in the fourth quarter. Our new ITWorks client is Genesis Health System based in Davenport, Iowa. Like most organizations, they have been on a journey to increase quality while reducing costs. They viewed an ITWorks alignment as a good match and can improve service and allow for predictable IT spend.
The new relationship also calls for the establishment of a value alignment office, which is aimed at helping Genesis innovate and optimize care processes, ensure patients receive the best possible care and increase return on technology investments. The agreement also includes new services such as help desk operations, application services and optimization of IT service delivery across their health system.
Financial results for ITWorks were excellent in 2014, with revenue growing over 60% to more than $300 million. We believe our offering is very compelling because we help clients control spending while getting more done and achieving a higher level of value. Our ITWorks clients are all referenceable. 100% have tested for Meaningful Use and 74% are at HIMSS EMR adoption Level 6 or 7, which is more than 3x the 22% industry attainment level. Overall, ITWorks clients are typically model clients that stay on our latest code, embrace new solutions and services and are strong Cerner advocates. We believe that as provider organizations face ongoing pressures, our ITWorks value proposition will continue to resonate very well. This is reflected in a very strong pipeline, and we expect 2015 to be a record year.
Now I'd like to provide some highlights on -- from a strong year from our professional services organization that they delivered. In 2014, our professional services revenue grew more than 25% and eclipsed the $1 billion mark, with strong growth in traditional implementation revenue, as well as operational management, performance improvement and other non-implementation revenue that is creating diversity in our services business. With approximately 6,000 associates, our professional services organization is the largest health care IT-focused consulting business in the world. I believe our services capabilities create a competitive advantage over competitors that rely almost entirely on third-party service because of our ability to deliver a predictable outcome at a predictable cost.
In 2014, we continued to advance our implementation methodologies, including our model system approach that starts with a fully built best practices system that allows for fine-tuning as users get hands-on experience and training. This approach has the potential to significantly reduce implementation duration and effort, which should benefit new clients transitioning to a Cerner platform.
In 2015, we are focused on first facilitating seamless migrations for clients of Health Services that choose to move to Cerner; second, continuing to grow non-implementation components of our business such as process optimization, enterprise resource planning and performance improvement; and third, staffing the expected increase in new footprints that Zane discussed earlier.
Now I'd like to briefly highlight a client accomplishment involving success with our revenue cycle solutions. Recently, Cerner client Lafayette General Hospital received a MAP Award for the -- from the Healthcare Financial Management Association. MAP stands for Measure, Apply and Perform, and Lafayette General is one of only 3 organizations in the country recognized by HFMA for performance improvement in revenue cycle. The key achievement of Lafayette was decreasing net AR days from 75 days to 44 days. They were also able to reduce their levels of discharge not final billed from nearly $20 million down to approximately $6 million. A key to their success has been their ability to leverage Cerner's clinically driven revenue cycle to enable staff to capture accurate and complete information at the front end, provide financial clearance capabilities and enable client data to drive coding, billing and cash collection operations.
With that, I'll turn the call over for questions."

That was really impressive that both their teams and our teams were able to have a pretty decent forecast format and a dive onto their opportunities. They're not going to have much contribution to bookings in their first quarter. I mean, they're kind of waiting for the close. Clients are certainly looking to see what the next step is, and those conversations are ongoing. But most of the activity that you're going to see driven by -- in Q1 from a bookings perspective will be coming almost entirely from Cerner. I think as you look at the revenue side, top line side, kind of can look at Health Services providing us between $95 million and $100 million a month on the revenue top line. So I think that's pretty good estimate. That's kind of the number we've talked about. And I think that's one that our most recent work with continue to confirm. I think from that perspective, you're going to get a good view of the company. For those of you that are looking to kind of get a little bit of the historical view, at least kind of the prior year of when under Siemens, their 9/30 financial statements under GAAP will be issued some time in the next 60 days as one of our filings, and it will break out Health Services. So you'll get a little bit of a view. I would just indicate that when you look at those numbers, top line will look about right. And I think on the earnings line, they had some onetime things as they put together their GAAP statements and operations that moved up their earnings a little bit more than you'd expect. Basically, if you exclude those, their earnings would have been breakeven, which is kind of what we talked about. So that's a little kind of the color I can provide right now as far as what their impact on Q1 is going to be. And obviously, once we get them in our income statement format and have a little bit better view, we'll certainly, I think, probably be looking to update our trend file and do different things in that space. As we combine the companies, there's things like backlog that we just have different approaches on certain elements. And trying to parse them out between contract and support may not make sense going forward. We may have to go to a single backlog number.

The fact that we had  -- we do a 52-, 53-week year, so this year was a 14-week quarter which included that extra week which had more -- had the normal spend, all the spend, but didn't have as much top line impact. I think when you look, we've always looked at the company as, we should have a goal of driving down 100 bps per year growth in our margins and our operating margins. I think -- and that growth is going to kind of go up and down on an annual basis. But if you look back to 2010 and the last 4 years, we'll probably average right at 100 basis points a year of growth. I think the key really for our operating margins at this point is looking at '15 because when we add in the Health Services revenues and their much lower margins from those revenues, you're going to see a significant impact on our operating margins. As I said in my comments, we'd expect those to be down kind of in the low 20s from current 25-potentially-plus percent levels. The good news is that as the accretion starts driving out as we go into the out years, that, that quickly gets back to current levels and begins to be able to go up at our 100 basis points a year expected growth rate. So the 2014 strong, and Q4 particularly, really the margin impact was as much driven by a strong hardware quarter and device resale quarter if anything. But I think it doesn't change our view of the business and the opportunities we have to get more efficiencies out.

So the registries, the access to data, so you're going to have to be able to think about your data in different ways. And he who has the data wins in the future game. And following that data is going to be really incredibly important, so having an open and interoperable solution is a very important element.

It's actually -- you're going to need all of Cerner to be successful moving forward. And the things that we have built and the things that we will build will continue to add value.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll lead off today with the review of the numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with the results highlights and marketplace observations. Mike Nill, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer will discuss operations. Neal Patterson, our Chairman and CEO, will join us for the Q&A. Now I will turn to our results.
Overall, while revenue was below our expectations, we had a solid quarter, highlighted by very strong bookings and our outlook remains positive. Our bookings revenue in Q1 was $1.2 billion. This is an all-time high, reflects 32% growth over Q1 of '14, driven by strong growth in traditional Cerner bookings with minimal bookings contribution from Health Services.
The revenue backlog ended the quarter at $13 billion, which is up from $9.2 billion a year ago, reflects the strong bookings in Q1 and the inclusion of backlog from Health Services.
Revenue in the quarter was $996 million, which is up 27% over Q1 of '14. Total revenue for Cerner was approximately $820 million with the remaining $176 million attributable to Health Services. The total is approximately $50 million below our guidance range, with the shortfall roughly equally split between Cerner and Health Services. On the Cerner side, the higher percentage of the record bookings that came from long-term contracts and the lower percentage of items generated for revenue. Additionally, services in reimbursed travel was lower-than-expected. On the Health Services side, part of the shortfall was due to the $12.5 million adjustment to earnings for deferred revenue not being reflected in revenue, as we had assumed in our guidance. However, since we decided not to report a non-GAAP revenue metric, the top line guidance was off by that amount. It's different than Health Services and will continue and is factored into our new full year revenue guidance, along with slightly lower run rate in the total revenue that reflects the Q1 shortfall. It is important to note that our Q1 adjusted earnings results were not impacted by the lower revenue and our annual guidance for adjusted earnings remains the same.
The revenue composition for Q1 was $259 million in system sales, $229 million in support and maintenance, $490 million in services and $18 million in reimbursed travel.
System sales revenues reflect a 26% increase over Q1 of '14 with the growth mainly driven by an increase in subscriptions, which is where the addition of Health Services had the biggest impact. Q1 system sales margin dollars grew 19% over the year-ago period. System sales margin percent of 64.7 is down from 68.5% in Q1 of '14 and up from 63.6% in Q4 of '14. The declining year-over-year reflects lower tech resale margins.
Moving to services. Total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 28% compared to Q1 of '14, saw the growth in Cerner services augmented by the addition of Health Services.
Maintenance revenue increased 31% over Q1 of '14, reflecting solid growth in core support and maintenance and the addition of Health Services. 
Looking to revenue by geographic segment, domestic revenue increased 25% over year ago quarter to $871 million and Global revenue grew 44% to $126 million. The bulk of the growth rates augmented by the addition of Health Services.
Health Services has a slightly higher mix of Global revenue than Cerner's historical levels. The addition of Health Services had a bigger impact on Global revenue. Our existing Purchasing Global business also had a strong performance.
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q1 was 83.1%, which is down slightly compared to 83.5% in Q1 of '14, reflecting the lower technology resale margins, slightly lower gross margin from Health Services.
Looking at operating spending. Our first quarter operating expenses before share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments were $591 million, which is up 28% compared to adjusted Q1 '14 operating expenses. Since we have already integrated many components of Health Services, we don't have an exact breakout of operating expense between Cerner and Health Services. We estimate that Cerner's operating expenses grew in the mid-single-digit range and the rest of the growth is the addition of Health Services.
Total year-over-year growth for each expense category was 23% for sales and client service, 41% for software development and 33% for G&A.
Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin before share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments were 23.7% in Q1. This is down 90 basis points compared to Q1 of '14, reflecting the incorporation of Health Services. 
We achieved our earnings on lower revenue this quarter, the operating margin percent with Health Services incorporated into our results is higher than we originally projected. This is largely due to lower core Cerner expense growth offsetting the lower core revenue growth. We expect higher core Cerner revenue growth for the rest of the year but still expect the full year to be below original projection. This is expected to continue being offset by lower expense growth. So we will expect to drive the same level of earnings through a combination of lower revenue and unchanged earnings, leading to a higher core operating margin percent. In total, this means we expect a combined operating margin only go down approximately 100 to 150 basis points for the year versus an original expectation we will go down over 200 basis points with the addition of Health Services.
Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q1 were $111 million or $0.32 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $157 million and adjusted EPS was $0.45, which is up 22% compared to Q1 of '14. Adjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share exclude share-based compensation expense, which reduced first quarter 2015 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $11 million and $0.03, respectively. Adjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share also reflect adjustments related to the acquisition of Health Services, including amortization of intangibles, which reduced net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $10 million and $0.03, respectively; deferred revenue adjustment, which reduced net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $8 million and $0.02, respectively; and other acquisition-related adjustments, which reduced net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $17 million and $0.05, respectively.
The Q1 tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 33.6%, which is in line with our expected effective tax rate. For the remainder of 2015, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the 33% to 34% range. 
Now I'd like to preview our nonrecurring expense we expect to incur in Q2. We recently offered a voluntary separation plan or VSP to eligible associates. Generally, the VSP was made available to U.S. associates minimum level of combined age and tenure. The VSP was offered to both Cerner and Health Services associates and the percent accepting had been roughly equal across both groups. For some positions, such as executive officers certain critical roles, excluded from being eligible for business continuity purposes. Associates who elected to participate in the VSP will receive financial benefits commensurate with their tenure and position along with vacation payout and medical benefits. Process is electing to participate in the VSP is later this month. Based on levels of acceptance, we currently estimate a net of tax charge of approximately $35 million in Q2 for the VSP and related costs. This completely voluntary program will have a small impact on the total headcount as the eligible associates who accepted the offer only represent about 2% of total associates. While a portion of these positions will be back filled, we believe we will be able to fill many of the positions with existing associates, which should create efficiencies in the future, also creating career growth opportunities for our associates.
Now move to our balance sheet. We ended Q1 with $889 million of total cash and investments, which is down $763 million from $1.65 billion in Q4, mainly driven by a $1.37 billion purchase of Siemens Health Services, partially offset by $500 million of debt that we issued earlier this year and adding to cash and investments. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, was $626 million, up from $130 million in Q4 due to the new debt.
Total receivables at the end of the quarter was $941 million which is up $268 million from Q4 driven by strong sales in the quarter. The DSO in Q1 was 79 days, which compares to DSO of 66 days in Q4 and 66 days in the year-ago quarter. The increase was driven by higher Accounts Receivable which is largely due to adding Health Services and the lower revenue this quarter. We expect DSO to be closer to historical level in future quarters.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $214 million. Q1 capital expenditures were $82 million, capitalized software was $63 million. 
Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $69 million for the quarter.
Moving to capitalized software. The $63 million of capitalized software in Q1 represents 39% of the $161 million of total investment in development activities. Software amortization for the quarter was $29 million, resulting in net capitalization of $34 million or 21% of our total R&D investment. We still expect to continue generating solid free cash flow this year, with operating cash flow growth partially offsetting an expected increase in capital expenditures tied to beginning construction of a new campus and capital expenditures related to our Health Services business. But the cash flow impact of the VSP will primarily impact Q2 and reduce overall free cash flow for the year.
Now I'll go to Q2 and full year 2015 guidance. For Q2, we expect revenue between $1.175 billion and $1.225 billion, the midpoint reflecting growth of 41% over Q2 of '14. For the full year, we expect revenue between $4.65 billion and $4.8 billion. This is lower than our prior guidance due to the lower revenue in Q1 and the expectation for about $1 billion of Health Services revenue for the year instead of our previous expectation of $1.1 billion, which is largely due to the deferred revenue adjustment not impacting the revenue line. This is still 39% growth at the midpoint, reflecting expectation for higher growth in Q1 from core Cerner for the rest of the year.
The low revenue is not expected to impact our earnings in Q2 or for the year. For Q2 we expect adjusted earnings before share based compensation and acquisition related adjustments of $0.51 to $0.52 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 29% growth over Q2 '14 adjusted EPS. For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustment to be $2.07 to $2.15, which is up from a previous range of $2.05 to $2.15, reflects 28% growth at the midpoint. Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense is approximately $0.03 to $0.04 in Q2 and $0.14 to $0.15 for the full year.
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q2 of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, the midpoint reflecting 16% growth over Q2 of '14. We expect our strong Q1 bookings and Q2 outlook to contribute to better core top line growth as we move through the year. Keep in mind, Q4 has a tough comparable due to the extra week in Q4 '14.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane."

Bookings this q",1270,"Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. I'll start with our results.
Bookings revenue in Q1 of $1.2 billion reflects very strong growth, up 32% over Q1 2014. Bookings this quarter included a high level of large contracts, with 24 contracts over $5 million, including 19 over $10 million. We also had strong contribution from long-term bookings, with an ITWorks contract and an expansion of existing RevWorks relationship. This lead to long-term bookings making up 37% of the total, which is approximately 5% higher than normal. Even adjusting out the higher term long-term bookings contribution, our bookings were very strong and bookings would still be at the high-end of our guidance.
As Marc discussed, our strong bookings didn't convert to higher revenues this quarter but it does position us for higher future growth. A highlight of the quarter was strong competitiveness, which resulted in 34% of our bookings coming from outside our core Millennium install base. As I have discussed during our investment community at HIMMS, our pipeline is very strong and we are well-positioned for new business this year and beyond.
I believe we still have a multiyear period ahead of us where there will be opportunities to win new footprints as organizations look to replace legacy systems and align with a strategic supplier. There's also a meaningful opportunity to expand our footprints within our client base as many of our large clients still have several non-Cerner facilities and are looking to consolidate on a single system. The ongoing acquisition activity in the marketplace plays to our advantage as well because it is being led by our clients. We are already off to a good start with migrating Health Services clients to Millennium and this activity is bringing along sales of other solutions, which is Population Health and ambulatory. My view of our opportunities was reinforced at HIMMS where we interacted more than $5 billion of pipeline, including many new EMR replacement opportunities.
In addition to strong new business activity, the dominant themes at HIMMS align very well with Cerner's strengths. Our complete vision and strong capabilities in Population Health, coupled with our commitment to interoperability and an open EMR, were clearly on display and well-received.
Regarding interoperability, we were pleased with the level of progress that was on display during the conference, most notably CommonWell member expansion to over 70% of the acute EMR market being represented.
Now I'll briefly discuss a few key areas of our business, starting with Population Health. Our Population Health organization had a strong start to the year. We continue to have success with selling Population Health solutions to clients ranging from small hospitals to IDNs, counties and states. Population Health solutions are now part of most new EMR contracts, as I mentioned, have been added to migration contracts for Health Services clients converting to Millennium. Overall, I believe our differentiation in Population Health is becoming clear. We are quickly separating ourselves from other offerings with our ability to aggregate and normalize clinical, financial and claims data across multiple systems and bring near real time information into the workflow.
Another key differentiator is results. Our early adopter client such as Advocate Health Care are getting value out of the system and are vocal about the fact that they view Healthe Intent as a platform that improves their ability to operate in an environment in which they are taking on more risk.
Moving to our Revenue Cycle business. We had a good first quarter and have a strong outlook for the year. Revenue Cycle continues to be an important component of EMR replacement opportunities and the strength of our integrated Revenue Cycle offering is contributing to our success at gaining new footprints. We're also continuing to increase penetration of our Revenue Cycle solutions in our client base in both acute and ambulatory venues as our client to move to a single platform. We are still early in this opportunity, I expect many more of our large clients to move to our Revenue Cycle solutions now that we have more proof points among our large clients.
On the RevWorks services side of our business, we expanded our leadership with an existing RevWorks client based on success we've had so far. I am pleased with how we have executed on our initial RevWorks relationships and we are achieving results I believe will be compelling to other prospects. For example, Adventist Health Northern California region has achieved a $27 million increase in revenue, a 21% decrease in AR days and all of their sites are over 100% of the cash targets. These types of results reflect the strength of both our Revenue Cycle solutions and our RevWorks services offerings and create compelling reasons for new prospects to consider our Revenue Cycle solutions and services.
Moving to the ambulatory market, where we had a strong Q1. Noteworthy activity in Q1 included continued displacements of key competitors, including the displacement of ambulatory solutions of our primary competitor at 29 ambulatory facilities; a strong start at selling ambulatory solutions into the Health Services base, including stand-alone sales and being included as part of acute-care migrations to Millennium and continued strength in our ambulatory business office services.
Regarding business office services, I'd like to highlight that business because I think success there is not widely known. We currently have ambulatory business office services clients across 45 specialties in 39 states. Our clients range from single physician practices up to the large IDNs where we have RevWorks relationship that include ambulatory business office services. As we have gained traction in this space, we are identifying more opportunities to displace a cloud competitor's business office services by proving our offering is more effective. For example, we're able to show in many cases our business office services are more than 20% less than our competitor's cloud offering, primarily because they acquired maintain staff approximately 3x our offering requires. In addition, many of these larger and more sophisticated clients are facing several challenges with our competitor solution, which is having 50% to 60% of the claims requiring manual intervention because they don't fit the cloud configuration. I believe that we will keep doing well in this business office services space as we continue to gain positive proof points with our clients and as awareness broadens about the true cost and challenges associated with our cloud competitor.
Outside the U.S. we had a strong Q1. Total revenue growth was 44% consisting of strong organic growth and the addition of Health Services. Strong performance in the U.K. was a big driver of our organic growth as we continue to have success gaining new footprints and expanding relationships with clients as they transition out of the National Programme. One of the reasons we continue to do well in the market is that our clients are getting value out of these solutions. A great example of this was documented when health and social care information Center they benefit deep dive of the Cerner Millennium implementation at Barts Health Trust, which is the largest hospital trust in England. In this review, they concluded Barts as achieving significant clinical and operational benefits in areas where Cerner Millennium isn't sold. This and other proof points as we have in the U.K. market position us very well relative to our less established competitors. We remain optimistic about our ability to get good contributions from Global for the rest of the decade, and this opportunity is enhanced by the complementary global business at Health Services.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

Today, I'm going to discuss ITWorks and provide some comments on our initial go lives with Intermountain Healthcare.
I'll start with ITWorks. In the first quarter, we established a new ITWorks relationship and also those expanded an existing ITWorks relationship. Our new ITWorks client is a 410-bed community hospital with 29 ambulatory locations. Similar to many of our ITWorks clients, taking over IT operations is only part of the new contract. For example, as Zane discussed, we're displacing our primary competitor in the ambulatory facilities. We will also be doing an optimization project for the client's Millennium system at the hospital and implement a Population Health and Revenue Cycle solutions. Amendment all system employees as CEO of our client highlighted the strategic nature of the ITWorks engagement by saying, ""we believe it's the best approach to ensure we meet our long-term strategic objectives of our organization while continuing to provide the highest level of care to our patients in an era of incredibly fast-moving changes in healthcare, information technology and increasing regulatory requirements."" As I indicated on our last call, our ITWorks pipeline is strong, as many provider organizations face pressure to control cost, improve quality and keep up with regulatory requirements. In Q1, our results are a good start and I expect continued success throughout the year.
Now I'd like to make a few comments on our initial go lives at 2 Intermountain healthcare hospitals and 24 clinics. The go lives occurred just 15 months after we signed the contract, which is extremely fast when you consider the majority of projects of similar scope take more than 2x as long. When fully deployed, project I Centura will be a 22 hospitals in more than 180 clinics, will include nearly 80 solutions across EHR, practice management and Revenue Cycle and the system will have over 320 role profiles, 354 clinical workflow models and 372 financial workflow models. This is the first Cerner project to make use of our new agile development methodology, a model that represents the departure from the industry-standard waterfall implementation approach. The a model physicians and other end users participate in the system build and design, never go more than 6 weeks with an opportunity to see, use and give feedback on the system prior to go-live. This approach has been a big success, and we believe there are benefits that will extend beyond the go-live. It has the potential to support elements of a learning health system, something that has been elusive in healthcare.
Another key element of this project is incorporation of Intermountain's Care Process Models and clinical process guidelines, which has helped these clinicians to achieve high-quality care and lower overall cost for many years. Before I Centura, these were mostly paper documents. Now they are all part of the digital workflows that are used every day.
In summary, we believe our work with Intermountain, combined with the work we are doing with other strategic client partners is resulting in new generation of systems. We are leading the transition in the industry away from systems that are simply transactional or use of the purposes of meeting regulatory requirements. We're creating intelligent systems designed to meet the complex needs of providers across the spectrum of healthcare, coordinating care at anytime, anyplace. These intelligence to inform decisions at the high standards and connecting all of the individuals they serve seamlessly into that process.

Usually, reimbursed travel is the number that I pay very little attention to other than managing it from an expense standpoint because it's 0 revenue or 0 margin.

Since '08, '09, that's been fairly light, starting to see that rebound, starting to see more interest within Continental Europe. I think certainly bringing Siemens in the fold has solidified us as a very credible and key choice in the European markets. And there are still countrywide procurements that are ongoing as we speak that we have a much better positioning for because of that acquisition.

When we guided revenue prior to the quarter, I would have put that $12.5 million in my revenue number that I guided to results that we presented don't have it in the revenue number if they had it as a separate line adjusting net earnings. So it still has the same impact on earnings. There's no change. But from a presentation standpoint, revenue that we talked about today is $12.5 million less than what I thought it would have been when we did our guidance. So that's..."

Sean, it is different than it was in a Meaningful Use era where the timelines were really forced by the sound not related to that Meaningful Use thesis.

The level of activity is unprecedented, but the close rate does have some variability as we move forward. There are compelling elements as people look to the future. They know that they have to have a contemporary solution set. And so the more at risk dollars that they have around readmissions and so the more that their revenue is at risk, so as they look forward, they have a number of mandates from the government and from the payer side around their risk elements. And so they need to go move forward. It's a matter of how much pain will they allow themselves to be inflicted upon before they move to a more contemporary system. So that really is the key driver of the close rate of that.

Neal Patterson, our Chairman and CEO, will join us for Q&A. Now I will turn to our results.
Overall, while revenue was below our expectations, we had a solid quarter, highlighted by very strong bookings, and our outlook remains positive. Our bookings revenue in Q1 was $1.2 billion. This is an all-time high and reflects 32% growth over Q1 of '14, driven by strong growth in traditional Cerner bookings, with minimal bookings contribution from Health Services.
The revenue backlog ended the quarter at $13 billion, which is up from $9.2 billion a year ago, and reflects the strong bookings in Q1 and the inclusion of backlog from Health Services.
Revenue in the quarter was $996 million, which is up 27% over Q1 of '14. Total revenue for Cerner was approximately $820 million, with the remaining $176 million attributable to Health Services. The total is approximately $50 million below our guidance range, with the shortfall roughly equally split between Cerner and Health Services. On the Cerner side, the higher percentage of the record bookings that came from long-term contracts and the lower percentage divided the generated in-quarter revenue. Additionally, services in reimbursed travel was lower-than-expected. On the Health Services side, part of the shortfall was due to the $12.5 million adjustment to earnings for deferred revenue not being reflected in revenue, as we had assumed in our guidance. However, since we decided not to report a non-GAAP revenue metric, the top line guidance was off by that amount. It's difference in Health Services will continue and is factored into our new full year revenue guidance, along with a slightly lower run rate in the total revenue that reflects the Q1 shortfall. It is important to note that our Q1 adjusted earnings results were not impacted by the lower revenue, and our annual guidance for adjusted earnings remains the same.
The revenue composition for Q1 was $259 million in system sales, $229 million in support and maintenance, $490 million in services and $18 million in reimbursed travel.
System sales revenues reflected 26% increase over Q1 of '14, with the growth mainly driven by an increase in subscriptions, which is where the addition of Health Services had the biggest impact. Q1 system sales margin dollars grew 19% over the year-ago period. System sales margin percent of 64.7% is down from 68.5% in Q1 of '14 and up from 63.6% in Q4 of '14. The decline in year-over-year reflects lower tech resale margins.
Moving to services. Total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 28% compared to Q1 of '14, saw the growth in Cerner services augmented by the addition of Health Services.
Deferred maintenance revenue increased 31% over Q1 of '14, reflecting solid growth in core support and maintenance and the addition of Health Services. 
Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 25% over the year-ago quarter to $871 million and Global revenue grew 44% to $126 million, with both of the growth rates augmented by the addition of Health Services. 
Health Services had a slightly higher mix of Global revenue than Cerner's historical levels. The addition of Health Services had a bigger impact on Global revenue. Our existing Global business has also had a strong performance.
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q1 was 83.1%, which is down slightly compared to 83.5% in Q1 of '14, reflecting the lower technology resale margins, with slightly lower gross margin from Health Services.
Looking at operating spending. Our first quarter operating expenses before share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments were $591 million, which is up 28% compared to adjusted Q1 '14 operating expenses. Since we have already integrated many components of Health Services, we don't have an exact breakout of operating expense between Cerner and Health Services. We estimate that Cerner operating expenses grew in the mid-single-digit range and the rest of the growth is the addition of Health Services.
Total year-over-year growth for each expense category was 23% for sales and client service, 41% for software development and 33% for G&A.
Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin before share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments was 23.7% in Q1. This is down 90 basis points compared to Q1 of '14, reflecting the incorporation of Health Services.
Given we achieved our earnings on lower revenue this quarter, the operating margin percent with Health Services incorporated into our results is higher than we originally projected. This is largely due to lower core Cerner expense growth, offsetting the lower core revenue growth. We expect higher core Cerner revenue growth for the rest of the year but still expect the full year to be below original projections. This is expected to continue being offset by lower expense growth, so we will expect to drive the same level of earnings through a combination of lower revenue and unchanged earnings, leading to a higher core operating margin percent. In total, this means we expect our combined operating margin to only go down approximately 100 to 150 basis points for the year versus an original expectation that it would go down over 200 basis points for the addition of Health Services.
Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q1 were $111 million or $0.32 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $157 million and adjusted EPS was $0.45, which is up 22% compared to Q1 of '14. Adjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share exclude share-based compensation expense, which reduced first quarter 2015 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $11 million and $0.03, respectively. Adjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share also reflect adjustments related to the acquisition of Health Services, including amortization of intangibles, which reduced net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $10 million and $0.03, respectively; deferred revenue adjustment, which reduced net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $8 million and $0.02, respectively; and other acquisition-related adjustments, which reduced net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $17 million and $0.05, respectively.
The Q1 tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 33.6%, which is in line with our expected effective tax rate. For the remainder of 2015, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the 33% to 34% range. 
Now I'd like to preview the nonrecurring expense we expect to incur in Q2. We recently offered a voluntary separation plan, or VSP, to eligible associates. Generally, the VSP was made available to U.S. associates who meet the minimum level of combined age and tenure. The VSP was offered to both Cerner and Health Services associates and the percent accepting has been roughly equal across both groups. For some positions, such as executive officers and certain critical roles were excluded from being eligible for business continuity purposes. Associates who elected to participate in the VSP will receive financial benefits commensurate with their tenure and position, along with vacation payout and medical benefits. The acceptance period for associates electing to participate in the VSP ends later this month. Based on levels of acceptance, we currently estimate a net of tax charge of approximately $35 million in Q2 for the VSP and related costs. This completely voluntary program will have a small impact on our total headcount as the eligible associates that accepted the offer only represent about 2% of total associates. While a portion of these positions will be back filled, we believe we will be able to fill many of the positions with existing associates, which should create efficiencies in the future, also creating career growth opportunities for our associates.
Now move to our balance sheet. We ended Q1 with $889 million of total cash and investments, which is down $763 million from $1.65 billion in Q4, mainly driven by a $1.37 billion purchase of Siemens Health Services, partially offset by $500 million of debt that we issued earlier this year and added to cash and investments. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, is $626 million, up from $130 million in Q4 due to the new debt.
Total receivables at the end of the quarter was $941 million, which is up $268 million from Q4 driven by strong sales in the quarter. The DSO in Q1 was 79 days, which compares to DSO of 66 days in Q4 and 66 days in the year-ago quarter. The increase was driven by higher accounts receivable, which is largely due to adding Health Services and the lower revenue this quarter. We expect DSO to be closer to historical level in future quarters.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $214 million. Q1 capital expenditures were $82 million, capitalized software was $63 million. 
Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $69 million for the quarter.
Moving to capitalized software. The $63 million of capitalized software in Q1 represents 39% of the $161 million of total investment in development activities. Software amortization for the quarter was $29 million, resulting in net capitalization of $34 million or 21% of our total R&D investment. We still expect to continue generating solid free cash flow this year, with operating cash flow growth partially offsetting an expected increase in capital expenditures tied to beginning construction of a new campus and capital expenditures related to our Health Services business. Also, the cash flow impact of the VSP will primarily impact Q2 and reduce overall free cash flow for the year.
Now I'll go to Q2 and full year 2015 guidance. For Q2, we expect revenue between $1.175 billion and $1.225 billion, the midpoint reflecting growth of 41% over Q2 of '14. For the full year, we expect revenue between $4.65 billion and $4.8 billion. This is lower than our prior guidance due to the lower revenue in Q1 and expectation for about $1 billion of Health Services revenue for the year instead of our previous expectation of $1.1 billion, which is largely due to the deferred revenue adjustment not impacting the revenue line. This is still 39% growth at the midpoint and reflecting expectation for higher growth in Q1 from core Cerner for the rest of the year.
The low revenue is not expected to impact our earnings in Q2 or for the year. For Q2, we expect adjusted earnings before share based compensation and acquisition related adjustments of $0.51 to $0.52 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 29% growth over Q2 '14 adjusted EPS. For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustment to be $2.07 to $2.15, which is up from our previous range of $2.05 to $2.15, reflects 28% growth at the midpoint. Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense is approximately $0.03 to $0.04 in Q2 and $0.14 to $0.15 for the full year.
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q2 of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, the midpoint reflecting 16% growth over Q2 of '14. We expect our strong Q1 bookings and Q2 outlook to contribute to better core top line growth as we move through the year. Keep in mind, Q4 has a tough comparable due to the extra week in Q4 '14.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane."

Bookings this quarter included a high level of large contracts, with 24 contracts over $5 million, including 19 over $10 million. We also had a strong contribution from long-term bookings, with an ITWorks contract and an expansion of existing RevWorks relationship. This led to long-term bookings making up 37% of the total, which is approximately 5% higher than normal. Even adjusting out the higher-term long-term bookings contribution, our bookings were very strong and bookings would still be at the high end of our guidance.
As Marc discussed, our strong bookings didn't convert to high revenue this quarter, but it does position us for higher future growth. A highlight of the quarter was strong competitiveness, which resulted in 34% of our bookings coming from outside our core Millennium installed base. As I discussed during our investment community meeting at HIMSS, our pipeline is very strong and we are well positioned for new business this year and beyond.
I believe we still have a multiyear period ahead of us, where there will be opportunities to win new footprints as organizations look to replace legacy systems and align with a strategic supplier. There's also a meaningful opportunity to expand our footprints within our client base as many of our large clients still have several non-Cerner facilities and are looking to consolidate on a single system. The ongoing acquisition activity in the marketplace plays to our advantage as well because it is being led by our clients. We are already off to a good start with migrating Health Services clients to Millennium, and this activity is bringing along sales with other solutions, such as Population Health and Ambulatory. My view of our opportunities was reinforced at HIMSS where we interacted more than $5 billion of pipeline, including many new EMR replacement opportunities.
In addition to strong new business activity, the dominant themes at HIMSS align very well with Cerner's strengths. Our complete vision and strong capabilities in Population Health, coupled with our commitment to interoperability and an open EMR were clearly on display and well received.
Regarding interoperability, we were pleased with the level of progress that was on display during the conference, most notably CommonWell member expansion to over 70% of the acute EMR market being represented.
Now I'll briefly discuss a few key areas of our business, starting with Population Health. Our Population Health organization had a strong start to the year. We continue to have success with selling Population Health solutions to clients ranging from small hospitals to IDNs, counties and states. Population Health solutions are now part of most new EMR contracts, and as I mentioned, have been added to migration contracts for Health Services clients converting to Millennium. Overall, I believe our differentiation in Population Health is becoming clear. We are quickly separating ourselves from other offerings with our ability to aggregate and normalize clinical, financial and claims data across multiple systems and bring near real-time information into the workflow.
Another key differentiator is results. Our early adopter clients, such as Advocate Health Care, are getting value out of the system and are vocal about the fact that they view Healthe Intent as a platform that improves their ability to operate in an environment in which they are taking on more risk.
Moving to our Revenue Cycle business. We had a good first quarter and have a strong outlook for the year. Revenue Cycle continues to be an important component of EMR replacement opportunities, and the strength of our integrated Revenue Cycle offering is contributing to our success at gaining new footprints. We're also continuing to increase penetration of our Revenue Cycle solutions in our client base in both acute and ambulatory venues as clients look to move to a single platform. We are still early in this opportunity, and I expect many more of our large clients to move to our Revenue Cycle solutions now that we have more proof points among our large clients.
On the RevWorks services side of our business, we expanded our relationship with an existing RevWorks client based on success we've had so far. I am pleased with how we have executed on our initial RevWorks relationships and we are achieving results that I believe will be compelling to other prospects. For example, Adventist Health Northern California region has achieved a $27 million increase in revenue, a 21% decrease in AR days and all of their sites are over 100% of the cash targets. These types of results reflect the strength of both our Revenue Cycle solutions and our RevWorks services offerings and create compelling reasons for new prospects to consider our Revenue Cycle solutions and services.
Moving to the Ambulatory market, where we had a strong Q1. Noteworthy activity in Q1 included continued displacements of key competitors, including the displacement of ambulatory solutions of our primary competitor at 29 ambulatory facilities; a strong start at selling ambulatory solutions into the Health Services base, including stand-alone sales and being included as part of acute-care migrations to Millennium; and continued strength in our ambulatory business office services.
Regarding business office services, I'd like to highlight that business because I think success there is not widely known. We currently have ambulatory business office services clients across 45 specialties in 39 states. Our clients range from single physician practices, up to the large IDNs where we have RevWorks relationships that include ambulatory business office services. As we have gained traction in this space, we are identifying more opportunities to displace a cloud competitor's business office services by proving our offering is more effective. For example, we are able to show, in many cases, our business office services are more than 20% less than our competitor's cloud offering, primarily because they require the client to maintain a staff approximately 3x our offering requires. In addition, many of these larger and more sophisticated clients are facing several challenges with our competitor's solutions, which is having 50% to 60% of the claims requiring manual intervention because they don't fit the cloud configuration. I believe that we will keep doing well in this business office services space as we continue to gain positive proof points with our clients and as awareness broadens about the true cost and challenges associated with our cloud competitor.
Outside the U.S. we had a strong Q1. Total revenue growth was 44%, consisting of strong organic growth and the addition of Health Services. Strong performance in the U.K. was a big driver of our organic growth as we continue to have success gaining new footprints and expanding relationships with clients as they transition out of the national program. One of the reasons we continue to do well in the market is that our clients are getting value out of the solutions. A great example of this was documented when the Health and Social Care Information Center did a benefits deep dive of the Cerner Millennium implementation at Barts Health NHS Trust, which is the largest hospital trust in England. In this review, they concluded Barts as achieving significant clinical and operational benefits in areas where Cerner Millennium isn't sold. This and other proof points as we have in the U.K. market position us very well relative to our less established competitors. Broadly, we remain optimistic about our ability to get good contributions from Global for the rest of the decade, and this opportunity is enhanced by the complementary global business at Health Services.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

Today, I'm going to discuss ITWorks and provide some comments on our initial go-lives with Intermountain Healthcare.
I'll start with ITWorks. In the first quarter, we established a new ITWorks relationship and also expanded an existing ITWorks relationship. Our new ITWorks client is a 410-bed community hospital with 29 ambulatory locations. Similar to many of our ITWorks clients, taking over IT operations is only part of the new contract. For example, as Zane discussed, we'll be displacing our primary competitor in the ambulatory facilities. We will also be doing an optimization project for the clients' Millennium system at the hospital and implement a Population Health and Revenue Cycle solutions. A memo to all system employees, a CEO of our client highlighted the strategic nature of the ITWorks engagement by saying, ""we believe it's the best approach to ensure we meet our long-term strategic objectives of our organization, while continuing to provide the highest level of care to our patients in an era of incredibly fast-moving changes in healthcare, information technology and increasing regulatory requirements."" As indicated on our last call, our ITWorks pipeline is strong, as many provider organizations face pressure to control cost, improve quality and keep up with regulatory requirements. In Q1, our results are a good start and I expect continued success throughout the year.
Now I'd like to make a few comments on our initial go-lives at 2 Intermountain Healthcare hospitals and 24 clinics. The go-lives occurred just 15 months after we signed the contract, which is extremely fast when you consider the majority of projects of similar scope take more than 2x as long. When fully deployed, project iCentra will be at 22 hospitals and more than 180 clinics. It will include nearly 80 solutions across EHR, practice management and Revenue Cycle and the system will have over 320 role profiles, 354 clinical workflow models and 372 financial workflow models. This is the first Cerner project to make use of our new agile development methodology, a model that represents the departure from the industry-standard waterfall implementation approach. In the agile model, physicians and other end users participate in the system build and design, never go more than 6 weeks within an opportunity to see, use and give feedback on the system prior to go-live. This approach has been a big success, and we believe there are benefits that will extend beyond the go-live. It has the potential to support elements of a learning health system, something that has been elusive in healthcare.
Another key element of this project is the incorporation of Intermountain's Care Process Models and clinical process guidelines, which have helped these clinicians to achieve high-quality care and lower overall cost for many years. Before iCentra, these were mostly paper documents. Now they are all part of the digital workflows that are used every day.
In summary, we believe our work with Intermountain, combined with the work we are doing with other strategic client partners, is resulting in a new generation of systems. We are leading the transition in the industry away from systems that are simply transactional or used for the purposes of meeting regulatory requirements. We're creating intelligent systems design to meet the complex needs of providers across the spectrum of healthcare, coordinating care at any time, any place, with intelligence to inform decisions at the high standards and connecting all of the individuals they serve seamlessly into that process.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to questions."

The other piece was services and travel was lower. Some of the services related to just contract signing timeframes and project start dates were a little bit later than we expected, so we didn't start turning that revenue spigot on as early in the quarter as we felt we would, and that also impact the reimbursed travel. Usually, reimbursed travel is the number that I pay very little attention to other than managing it from an expense standpoint because it's 0 revenue or 0 margin. But that one was actually significantly lower than we would have projected as we came into the quarter. So I don't know, there was no real surprises. And as we look out for the rest of the year, Q2 through Q4, we get back on track for the most part, then, I think delivering more according to what we're planning and forecasting."

I think certainly, bringing Siemens in the fold has solidified us as a very credible and key choice in the European markets. And there are still countrywide procurements that are ongoing as we speak that we have a much better positioning for because of that acquisition. But I think we still see a lot of opportunity, globally.

The level of activity is unprecedented, but the close rate does have some variability as we move forward. There are compelling elements as people look to the future. They know that they have to have a contemporary solution set. And so the more at-risk dollars that they have around readmissions and so the more that their revenue is at risk, so as they look forward, they have a number of mandates from the government and from the payer side around their risk elements. And so they need to go move forward. It's a matter of how much pain can the -- will they allow themselves to be inflicted upon before they move to a more contemporary system. So that really is the key driver of the close rate of that.

Neal Patterson, our Chairman and CEO, will join us for Q&A. Now I will turn to our results.
Overall, while revenue was below our expectations, we had a solid quarter, highlighted by very strong bookings, and our outlook remains positive. Our bookings revenue in Q1 was $1.2 billion. This is an all-time high and reflects 32% growth over Q1 of '14, driven by strong growth in traditional Cerner bookings, with minimal bookings contribution from Health Services.
The revenue backlog ended the quarter at $13 billion, which is up from $9.2 billion a year ago, and reflects the strong bookings in Q1 and the inclusion of backlog from Health Services.
Revenue in the quarter was $996 million, which is up 27% over Q1 of '14. Total revenue for Cerner was approximately $820 million, with the remaining $176 million attributable to Health Services. The total is approximately $50 million below our guidance range, with the shortfall roughly equally split between Cerner and Health Services. On the Cerner side, the higher percentage of the record bookings that came from long-term contracts and the lower percentage divided [ph] generated in-quarter revenue. Additionally, services in reimbursed travel was lower-than-expected. On the Health Services side, part of the shortfall was due to the $12.5 million adjustment to earnings for deferred revenue not being reflected in revenue, as we had assumed in our guidance. However, since we decided not to report a non-GAAP revenue metric, the top line guidance was off by that amount. Its difference in Health Services will continue and is factored into our new full year revenue guidance, along with a slightly lower run rate in the total revenue that reflects the Q1 shortfall. It is important to note that our Q1 adjusted earnings results were not impacted by the lower revenue, and our annual guidance for adjusted earnings remains the same.
The revenue composition for Q1 was $259 million in system sales, $229 million in support and maintenance, $490 million in services and $18 million in reimbursed travel.
System sales revenues reflected 26% increase over Q1 of '14, with the growth mainly driven by an increase in subscriptions, which is where the addition of Health Services had the biggest impact. Q1 system sales margin dollars grew 19% over the year-ago period. System sales margin percent of 64.7% is down from 68.5% in Q1 of '14 and up from 63.6% in Q4 of '14. The decline in year-over-year reflects lower tech resale margins.
Moving to services. Total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 28% compared to Q1 of '14, saw the growth in Cerner services augmented by the addition of Health Services.
Deferred maintenance revenue increased 31% over Q1 of '14, reflecting solid growth in core support and maintenance and the addition of Health Services. 
Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 25% over the year-ago quarter to $871 million and Global revenue grew 44% to $126 million, with both of the growth rates augmented by the addition of Health Services. 
Health Services had a slightly higher mix of Global revenue than Cerner's historical levels. The addition of Health Services had a bigger impact on Global revenue. Our existing Global business also had a strong performance.
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q1 was 83.1%, which is down slightly compared to 83.5% in Q1 of '14, reflecting the lower technology resale margins, with slightly lower gross margin from Health Services.
Looking at operating spending. Our first quarter operating expenses before share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments were $591 million, which is up 28% compared to adjusted Q1 '14 operating expenses. Since we have already integrated many components of Health Services, we don't have an exact breakout of operating expense between Cerner and Health Services. We estimate that Cerner operating expenses grew in the mid-single-digit range and the rest of the growth is the addition of Health Services.
Total year-over-year growth for each expense category was 23% for sales and client service, 41% for software development and 33% for G&A.
Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin before share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related adjustments was 23.7% in Q1. This is down 90 basis points compared to Q1 of '14, reflecting the incorporation of Health Services.
Given we achieved our earnings on lower revenue this quarter, the operating margin percent with Health Services incorporated into our results is higher than we originally projected. This is largely due to lower core Cerner expense growth, offsetting the lower core revenue growth. We expect higher core Cerner revenue growth for the rest of the year but still expect the full year to be below original projections. This is expected to continue being offset by lower expense growth, so we will expect to drive the same level of earnings through a combination of lower revenue and unchanged earnings, leading to a higher core operating margin percent. In total, this means we expect our combined operating margin to only go down approximately 100 to 150 basis points for the year versus an original expectation that it would go down over 200 basis points for the addition of Health Services.
Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q1 were $111 million or $0.32 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $157 million and adjusted EPS was $0.45, which is up 22% compared to Q1 of '14. Adjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share exclude share-based compensation expense, which reduced first quarter 2015 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $11 million and $0.03, respectively. Adjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share also reflect adjustments related to the acquisition of Health Services, including amortization of intangibles, which reduced net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $10 million and $0.03, respectively; deferred revenue adjustment, which reduced net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $8 million and $0.02, respectively; and other acquisition-related adjustments, which reduced net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $17 million and $0.05, respectively.
The Q1 tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 33.6%, which is in line with our expected effective tax rate. For the remainder of 2015, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the 33% to 34% range. 
Now I'd like to preview a nonrecurring expense we expect to incur in Q2. We recently offered a voluntary separation plan, or VSP, to eligible associates. Generally, the VSP was made available to U.S. associates who meet the minimum level of combined age and tenure. The VSP was offered to both Cerner and Health Services associates and the percent accepting has been roughly equal across both groups. For some positions, such as executive officers and certain critical roles were excluded from being eligible for business continuity purposes. Associates who elected to participate in the VSP will receive financial benefits commensurate with their tenure and position, along with vacation payout and medical benefits. The acceptance period for associates electing to participate in the VSP ends later this month. Based on levels of acceptance, we currently estimate a net of tax charge of approximately $35 million in Q2 for the VSP and related costs. This completely voluntary program will have a small impact on our total headcount as the eligible associates that accepted the offer only represent about 2% of total associates. While a portion of these positions will be back filled, we believe we will be able to fill many of the positions with existing associates, which should create efficiencies in the future, also creating career growth opportunities for our associates.
Now move to our balance sheet. We ended Q1 with $889 million of total cash and investments, which is down $763 million from $1.65 billion in Q4, mainly driven by a $1.37 billion purchase of Siemens Health Services, partially offset by $500 million of debt that we issued earlier this year and added to cash and investments. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, is $626 million, up from $130 million in Q4 due to the new debt.
Total receivables at the end of the quarter was $941 million, which is up $268 million from Q4 driven by strong sales in the quarter. The DSO in Q1 was 79 days, which compares to DSO of 66 days in Q4 and 66 days in the year-ago quarter. The increase was driven by higher accounts receivable, which is largely due to adding Health Services and the lower revenue this quarter. We expect DSO to be closer to historical levels in future quarters.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $214 million. Q1 capital expenditures were $82 million, capitalized software was $63 million. 
Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $69 million for the quarter.
Moving to capitalized software. The $63 million of capitalized software in Q1 represents 39% of the $161 million of total investment in development activities. Software amortization for the quarter was $29 million, resulting in net capitalization of $34 million or 21% of our total R&D investment. We still expect to continue generating solid free cash flow this year, with operating cash flow growth partially offsetting an expected increase in capital expenditures tied to beginning construction of a new campus and capital expenditures related to our Health Services business. Also, the cash flow impact of the VSP will primarily impact Q2 and reduce overall free cash flow for the year.
Now I'll go to Q2 and full year 2015 guidance. For Q2, we expect revenue between $1.175 billion and $1.225 billion, the midpoint reflecting growth of 41% over Q2 of '14. For the full year, we expect revenue between $4.65 billion and $4.8 billion. This is lower than our prior guidance due to the lower revenue in Q1 and expectation for about $1 billion of Health Services revenue for the year instead of our previous expectation of $1.1 billion, which is largely due to the deferred revenue adjustment not impacting the revenue line. This is still 39% growth at the midpoint and reflects an expectation for higher growth in Q1 from core Cerner for the rest of the year.
The lower revenue is not expected to impact our earnings in Q2 or for the year. For Q2, we expect adjusted earnings before share based compensation and acquisition related adjustments of $0.51 to $0.52 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 29% growth over Q2 '14 adjusted EPS. For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments to be $2.07 to $2.15, which is up from our previous range of $2.05 to $2.15, reflects 28% growth at the midpoint. Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense is approximately $0.03 to $0.04 in Q2 and $0.14 to $0.15 for the full year.
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q2 of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, the midpoint reflecting 16% growth over Q2 of '14. We expect our strong Q1 bookings and Q2 outlook to contribute to better core top line growth as we move through the year. Keep in mind, Q4 has a tough comparable due to the extra week in Q4 '14.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane."

Bookings this q",1284,"Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. I'll start with our results.
Bookings revenue in Q1 of $1.2 billion reflects very strong growth, up 32% over Q1 2014. Bookings this quarter included a high level of large contracts, with 24 contracts over $5 million, including 19 over $10 million. We also had a strong contribution from long-term bookings, with an ITWorks contract and an expansion of existing RevWorks relationship. This led to long-term bookings making up 37% of the total, which is approximately 5% higher than normal. Even adjusting out the higher-term long-term bookings contribution, our bookings were very strong and bookings would still be at the high end of our guidance.
As Marc discussed, our strong bookings didn't convert to higher revenue this quarter, but it does position us for higher future growth. A highlight of the quarter was strong competitiveness, which resulted in 34% of our bookings coming from outside our core Millennium installed base. As I discussed during our investment community meeting at HIMSS, our pipeline is very strong and we are well positioned for new business this year and beyond.
I believe we still have a multiyear period ahead of us, where there will be opportunities to win new footprints as organizations look to replace legacy systems and align with a strategic supplier. There's also a meaningful opportunity to expand our footprints within our client base as many of our large clients still have several non-Cerner facilities and are looking to consolidate on a single system. The ongoing acquisition activity in the marketplace plays to our advantage as well because it is being led by our clients. We are already off to a good start with migrating Health Services clients to Millennium, and this activity is bringing along sales with other solutions, such as Population Health and Ambulatory. My view of our opportunities was reinforced at HIMSS where we interact with more than $5 billion of pipeline, including many new EMR replacement opportunities.
In addition to strong new business activity, the dominant themes at HIMSS align very well with Cerner's strengths. Our complete vision and strong capabilities in Population Health, coupled with our commitment to interoperability and an open EMR were clearly on display and well received.
Regarding interoperability, we were pleased with the level of progress that was on display during the conference, most notably CommonWell member expansion to over 70% of the acute EMR market being represented.
Now I'll briefly discuss a few key areas of our business, starting with Population Health. Our Population Health organization had a strong start to the year. We continue to have success with selling Population Health solutions to clients ranging from small hospitals to IDNs, counties and states. Population Health solutions are now part of most new EMR contracts, and as I mentioned, have been added to migration contracts for Health Services clients converting to Millennium. Overall, I believe our differentiation in Population Health is becoming clear. We are quickly separating ourselves from other offerings with our ability to aggregate and normalize clinical, financial and claims data across multiple systems and bring near real-time information into the workflow.
Another key differentiator is results. Our early adopter clients, such as Advocate Health Care, are getting value out of the system and are vocal about the fact that they view HealtheIntent as a platform that improves their ability to operate in an environment in which they are taking on more risk.
Moving to our Revenue Cycle business. We had a good first quarter and have a strong outlook for the year. Revenue Cycle continues to be an important component of EMR replacement opportunities, and the strength of our integrated revenue cycle offering is contributing to our success at gaining new footprints. We're also continuing to increase penetration of our revenue cycle solutions in our client base in both acute and ambulatory venues as our clients look to move to a single platform. We are still early in this opportunity, and I expect many more of our large clients to move to our revenue cycle solutions now that we have more proof points among our large clients.
On the RevWorks services side of our business, we expanded our relationship with an existing RevWorks client based on success we've had so far. I am pleased with how we have executed on our initial RevWorks relationships and we are achieving results that I believe will be compelling to other prospects. For example, Adventist Health Northern California region has achieved a $27 million increase in revenue, a 21% decrease in AR days and all of their sites are over 100% of the cash targets. These types of results reflect the strength of both our revenue cycle solutions and our RevWorks services offerings and create compelling reasons for new prospects to consider our revenue cycle solutions and services.
Moving to the Ambulatory market, where we had a strong Q1. Noteworthy activity in Q1 included continued displacements of key competitors, including the displacement of ambulatory solutions of our primary competitor at 29 ambulatory facilities; a strong start at selling ambulatory solutions into the Health Services base, including stand-alone sales and being included as part of acute-care migrations to Millennium; and continued strength in our ambulatory business office services.
Regarding business office services, I'd like to highlight that business because I think success there is not widely known. We currently have ambulatory business office services clients across 45 specialties in 39 states. Our clients range from single physician practices, up to large IDNs where we have RevWorks relationships that include ambulatory business office services. As we have gained traction in this space, we are identifying more opportunities to displace a cloud competitor's business office services by proving our offering is more effective. For example, we are able to show, in many cases, our business office services are more than 20% less than our competitor's cloud offering, primarily because they require the client to maintain a staff approximately 3x our offering requires. In addition, many of these larger and more sophisticated clients are facing several challenges with our competitor's solution, which is having 50% to 60% of the claims requiring manual intervention because they don't fit the cloud configuration. I believe that we will keep doing well in this business office services space as we continue to gain positive proof points with our clients and as awareness broadens about the true cost and challenges associated with our cloud competitor.
Outside the U.S. we had a strong Q1. Total revenue growth was 44%, consisting of strong organic growth and the addition of Health Services. Strong performance in the U.K. was a big driver of our organic growth as we continue to have success gaining new footprints and expanding relationships with clients as they transition out of the national program. One of the reasons we continue to do well in the market is that our clients are getting value out of the solutions. A great example of this was documented when the Health and Social Care Information Center did a benefits deep dive of the Cerner Millennium implementation at Barts Health NHS Trust, which is the largest hospital trust in England. In this review, they concluded Barts as achieving significant clinical and operational benefits in areas where Cerner Millennium is installed. This and other proof points as we have in the U.K. market position us very well relative to our less established competitors. Broadly, we remain optimistic about our ability to get good contributions from Global for the rest of the decade, and this opportunity is enhanced by the complementary global business at Health Services.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

In the first quarter, we established a new ITWorks relationship and also",585,"Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'm going to discuss ITWorks and provide some comments on our initial go-lives with Intermountain Healthcare.
I'll start with ITWorks. In the first quarter, we established a new ITWorks relationship and also expanded an existing ITWorks relationship. Our new ITWorks client is a 410-bed community hospital with 29 ambulatory locations. Similar to many of our ITWorks clients, taking over IT operations is only part of the new contract. For example, as Zane discussed, we'll be displacing our primary competitor in the ambulatory facilities. We will also be doing an optimization project for the clients' Millennium system at the hospital and implement a population health and revenue cycle solutions. A memo to all system employees, a CEO of our client highlighted the strategic nature of the ITWorks engagement by saying, ""We believe it's the best approach to ensure we meet our long-term strategic objectives of our organization, while continuing to provide the highest level of care to our patients in an era of incredibly fast-moving changes in healthcare, information technology and increasing regulatory requirements."" As I indicated on our last call, our ITWorks pipeline is strong, as many provider organizations face pressure to control cost, improve quality and keep up with regulatory requirements. In Q1, our results are a good start and I expect continued success throughout the year.
Now I'd like to make a few comments on our initial go-lives at 2 Intermountain Healthcare hospitals and 24 clinics. The go-lives occurred just 15 months after we signed the contract, which is extremely fast when you consider the majority of projects of similar scope take more than twice as long. When fully deployed, project iCentra will be at 22 hospitals and more than 180 clinics. It will include nearly 80 solutions across EHR, practice management and revenue cycle and the system will have over 320 role profiles, 354 clinical workflow models and 372 financial workflow models. This is the first Cerner project to make use of our new agile development methodology, a model that represents the departure from the industry-standard waterfall implementation approach. In the agile model, physicians and other end users participate in the system build and design, never go more than 6 weeks within an opportunity to see, use and give feedback on the system prior to go-live. This approach has been a big success, and we believe there are benefits that will extend beyond the go-live. It has the potential to support elements of a learning health system, something that has been elusive in healthcare.
Another key element of this project is incorporation of Intermountain's Care Process Models and clinical process guidelines, which have helped these clinicians to achieve high-quality care and lower overall cost for many years. Before iCentra, these were mostly paper documents. Now they are all part of the digital workflows that are used every day.
In summary, we believe our work with Intermountain, combined with the work we are doing with other strategic client partners, is resulting in a new generation of systems. We are leading the transition in the industry away from systems that are simply transactional or used for the purposes of meeting regulatory requirements. We're creating intelligent systems design to meet the complex needs of providers across the spectrum of healthcare, coordinating care at any time, any place, with intelligence to inform decisions at the high standards and connecting all of the individuals they serve seamlessly into that process.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to questions."

Some of the services related to just contract signing timeframes and project start dates were a little bit later than we expected, so we didn't start turning that revenue spigot on as early in the quarter as we felt we would, and that also impact the reimbursed travel. Usually, reimbursed travel is the number that I pay very little attention to other than managing it from an expense standpoint because it's 0 revenue or 0 margin. But that one was actually significantly lower than we would have projected as we came into the quarter. So I don't know, there was no real surprises.

So for the remaining 3 quarters, I'm just trying to figure out, what is the assumption of the mix in terms of it coming from Health Services versus core legacy Cerner?"

So based on our number, that's kind of what we would have expected. We were below that in Q1, but we expect to get closer to that as we go through Q2 through the end of the quarter, probably high single digit to ending the year in total. So if you're looking at that for Cerner, then kind of you can do the math and just subtracting, come up with what the HS is. We look at HS delivered for this year, right about $1 billion of revenue. And so that was the number that Dave was asking about relative to -- originally we were at looking about $1.1 billion, and so there's $100 million just on the HS side for the full year. Half of that is deferred revenue being -- not being in the revenue line and half of it is just tweaking the revenue projections for the rest of the year for them."

Part of the reason we had good performance in the larger contracts is we had 3 U.K. contracts that qualified as over $10 million. So those trusts coming out and purchasing -- globally, there is a focus on healthcare and on technology, and it's really trying to match up the available resources and spending in each country, relative to being able to go procure it. Since '08 and '09, that's been fairly light, starting to see that rebound, starting to see more interest within Continental Europe. I think certainly bringing Siemens in the fold has solidified us as a very credible and key choice in the European markets. And there are still countrywide procurements that are ongoing as we speak that we have a much better positioning for because of that acquisition. But I think we still see a lot of opportunity globally. I think even if you go outside Europe and start looking at North America, I think Canada is probably as good an opportunity in the next 12 months as we've seen for quite some, time.

But the one thing that strikes me on HS is that we kind of have a strategy of running those 2 companies kind of parallel. We didn't want to distract those organizations, your organization. We're coming together a lot faster than I would've expected, and smooth transition. The client-side is almost we just had our Q2 forecast meeting a week ago and it's pretty amazing how seamless it feels that we're talking as one company, looking at all of the opportunities across both sides. I think that's one of the reasons that as we look out and try to track the numbers, we're really focusing on kind of the one big number where we've been trying to come up with artificial breakdowns between HS and Cerner, because we are getting together more quickly than I would have expected, which is actually great, given that it's being done pretty seamlessly.

And keep in mind, each of these works businesses can have different flavors, right? We can go anywhere from a full works business to maybe they only had AMS and some other support services that they've signed up for and then they sign up for the works.

The level of activity is unprecedented, but the close rate does have some variability as we move forward. There are compelling elements as people look to the future. They know that they have to have a contemporary solution set. And so the more at-risk dollars that they have around readmissions and so the more that their revenue is at risk, so as they look forward, they have a number of mandates from the government and from the payer side around their risk elements. And so they need to go move forward. It's a matter of how much pain can they -- will they allow themselves to be inflicted upon before they move to a more contemporary system. So that really is the key driver of the close rate of that.

Zane Burke, our President, will me follow me with the results highlights and marketplace observations. Mike Neal, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, will discuss operations. Neal Patterson, our Chairman and CEO, will join us for Q&A.
Now I'll turn to our results. Similar to last quarter, we delivered results that were mostly in line with our expectations with the exception of revenue. While we are disappointed that we are below our guided levels of revenue, the continued level of strong bookings and positive outlook [indiscernible] a good second half of the year.
Our bookings revenue in Q2 was $1.29 billion, which is an all-time high and reflects 20% over Q2 of '14, including record amounts of new business activity. Our revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $13.3 billion and is up $9.7 billion a year ago and reflects the strong bookings in Q2 as well as the inclusion of backlog from Health Services.
Revenue in the quarter was $1.13 billion, which is up 32% over Q2 of '14 and includes approximately $260 million of Health Services. The total is approximately $50 million below our guidance range with approximately $40 million of shortfall related to core Cerner and $10 million attributable to Health Services.
On the Cerner side, the low revenue results in low single-digit growth related to several factors. Some are in quarter dynamics, some are unique items in the prior-year period that drove 20% growth and created a tough comparable and some other items that we didn't accurately forecast.
The first factor is lower growth in services, which is primarily because of a year-over-year decrease in third-party services. Recall that in Q2 of '14, we added revenue [indiscernible] more than $20 million, which is largely related to higher third-party services and reimbursed travel. We are using less third-party services this year, and travel revenue, excluding Health Services, was down approximately 50% year-over-year. Adjusting for these 2 items bring Cerner's core growth from approximately 2% to 5%. As you know, third-party services are lower margins, and the reimbursed travel is 0 margin. So this lower revenue had lower impact on our profitability.
Another factor that has impacted our services revenue is that we limited hiring in the months leading up to and the initial months after the close of our Health Services acquisition.
Our forecasted model did not fully reflect this, we're now ramping up hiring to meet the strong demand reflected in year-to-date bookings and our forecast, which will drive stronger services revenues growth. But the impact of these additional resources as well as the impact of additional opportunities you see for the works businesses will primarily be toward the end of the year and in 2016. 
An additional factor impacting revenues and our bookings this quarter included a higher percentage from long-term contracts resulting in lower percentage of items we generated in core revenue. 
Finally, related to Health Services. The current revenue is tracking as we have forecasted, but nonrecurring revenue came in lower than expected. Although we have ongoing success with converting Health Services clients to Millennium, there's a portion of their base sitting tighter in the transition which is impacted the rate of which they make add-on purchases with things like lower margin hardware. Otherwise, everything we are tracking for Health Services is at or ahead of our expectations.
Now quickly go through the total revenue composition for Q2. Total system sales revenue was $315 million. Support and maintenance was $255 million. Services was $538 million. And reimbursed travel was $18 million.
System sales revenue reflects a 34% increase over Q2 of '14 with the growth mainly driven by an increase in subscriptions which is where the addition of Health Services has had the biggest impact as the list the growth in licensed software.
Our system sales margin percentage was 64.3% which is down slightly from 65.3% in Q2 of '14 and 64.7% in Q1. The decline was driven by lower tech resale margins.
Moving to services. Total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 30% compared to Q2 of '14 mainly driven by the addition of Health Services as well as growth in core Cerner Managed Services.
Supported maintenance revenue increased 45% over Q2 of '14, reflecting solid growth in core support and maintenance and the addition of Health Services. Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 30% over the year-ago quarter to $995 million, driven largely by the addition of Health Services. And Global revenue grew 54% to $131 million with core Global revenue being augmented by the addition of Health Services.
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q2 was 82.9%, which is up from 80.9% in Q2 of '14 with the improved margin reflecting the lower level of third-party services and reimbursed travel.
Looking at operating spending. Our second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude share based compensation expense, voluntary separation plan expense and acquisition-related adjustments were $661 million, which is up 37% compared to adjusted Q2 '14 operating expenses. This growth was primarily driven by the addition of Health Services business.
The total year-over-year growth for each expense category on a non-GAAP basis was 32% for sales and client service, 42% for software development, 51% for G&A and 3% decline in amortization as acquisition-related intangibles, which is a new expense line we added this quarter. Note that this line is $25 million on our GAAP income statement and $3 million in our non-GAAP results, since we are excluding amortization related to Health Services.
Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin before share based compensation voluntary separation expense and acquisition-related adjustments was 24.2% in Q2. This is essentially flat compared to Q2 of '14 and up 50 basis points from last quarter. 
Similar to Q1, we achieved our second quarter earnings on lower revenue resulting in a higher operating margin percent than we originally projected. We expect this dynamic to continue for the rest of the year with lower revenues being offset by lower expenses, resulting in no change to our earnings outlook and a higher operating margin percent than we originally projected. We now expect our non-GAAP operating margin for the year to be close to 2014 levels, which compares to the original expectation that we'd go down approximately 200 basis points for the addition of Health Services.
Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q2 were $115 million or $0.33 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $183 million, and adjusted EPS was $0.52, which is up 30% compared to Q2 of '14. Adjusted net earnings exclude share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on GAAP earnings of $14 million dollars or $0.04 per diluted share as well as a voluntary separation plan expense, which had a net impact on GAAP earnings of $28 million or $0.08 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings also reflect adjustments related to Cerner's acquisition of Health Services, including Health Services acquisition-related amortization, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $14 million and $0.04, respectively; other acquisition related adjustments, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $6 million and $0.01, respectively; and no acquisition related deferred revenue adjustment which is not included in GAAP net earnings but increases adjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $6 million and $0.02, respectively.
The Q2 tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 33%, which is in our expected range of 33% to 34%.
Now move to our balance sheet. We ended Q2 with $857 million of total cash and investments, which is down slightly from $889 million in Q1 due to a negative free cash flow, which I'll discuss in a minute.
The total debt including capital lease obligations was $623 million. Total receivables ended the quarter at $1 billion, which is up $63 million from Q1. Our Q2 DSO was 81 days compared to 79 days in Q1 and 66 days in the year-ago quarter. The higher DSO is primarily a function of the lower revenue in the quarter and some delayed billings for Health Services clients as we transition to our systems. As we move through the year, we expect DSO to come down as revenue increases and we had Health Services billings caught up.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $109 million, down from $214 million in Q1 due mainly to the voluntary separation plan expense and lower collections related to delayed billings.
Q2 capital expenditures were $85 million and capitalized software was $79 million.
Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, is negative $46 million for the quarter driven by a combination of lower operating cash flow and higher capital spending.
Looking ahead, we expect operating cash flow to increase in coming quarters voluntary separation of plan and acquisition-related expenses decline and we improve DSO. Some of the increased operating cash flow will be offset by capital expenditures tied to construction of our new campus and Health Services capital expenditures. We still expect free cash flow to improve initially.
Now go through Q3 and full year 2015 guidance. For Q3, we expect revenue between $1.15 billion and $1. 2 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 40% over Q3 of '14.
For the full year, we expect revenue between $4.475 billion and $4.575 billion, with the midpoint reflecting 33% growth over last year. This is lower than our prior guidance due to lower revenue in Q2 and also factors in the lower year-to-date run rate. 
As I indicated, the lower revenue is not expected to impact our earnings in Q3 -- year. For Q3, we expect adjusted EPS before share-based compensation, voluntary separation plan expense and acquisition-related adjustments to be $0.54 to $0.55 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 30% growth over Q3 '14 adjusted EPS.
For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS before share-based compensation, voluntary separation plan expense and acquisition-related adjustments to be $2.09 to $2.15, which is up from our previous range of $2.07 to $2.15 and reflects 28% growth at the midpoint.
for the impact of share-based compensation expense is approximately $0.03 to $0.04 in Q3 and $0.14 to $0.15 for the full year.
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q3 of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion, with the midpoint reflecting 27% growth over Q3 of '14.
In summary, while we were disappointed that revenue is below our guidance, we are very pleased with our bookings results and outlook. Importantly, we believe we have appropriately adjusted our revenue guidance to factor in the lower first half revenue and run rate. With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane."

Bookings this qua",1453,"Thanks, Mark. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. I'll start with our results.
Our bookings revenue in Q2 of $1.29 billion reflects strong growth of 20% over Q2 2014. Bookings this quarter included an all-time high level of large contracts, with 38 contracts over $5 million, including 23 over $10 million. We also had strong contributions from long-term bookings with a large ITWorks contract and an expansion of existing ITWorks relationship. This led to long-term bookings, making up 35% of total, which is a 2% higher than normal.
Demand highlighted the quarter was we signed a record number of new footprints in both in terms of number and dollars. This resulted in 34% of our bookings coming from outside our core Millennium install base. This success reflects our strong competitiveness and the continued large opportunity for competitive displacements. Our wins span many market segments, including IDNs, regional hospitals, children's hospitals, community hospitals, state behavioral health, ambulatory surgery centers and physician groups.
We're also continuing to sign Health Services clients to migrate to Millennium. These clients range from community hospital selecting our CommunityWorks offering to large IDNs. And we continue to see cross-sell activity for solutions like Population Health and ambulatory.
While not part of Q2, I'd like to highlight a significant win for Cerner that was announced today. We were recently selected by Baptist Health South Florida, a leading healthcare organization in the region, to implement Cerner Millennium and Healthe Intent across their 7 hospitals and over 50 outpatient facilities. Baptist Health has recognized us as a national leader in quality, safety and patient satisfaction, and they're looking to Cerner Solutions to optimize the physician experience, improve quality of care and support their efforts to improve patient experience. In addition, they expect to leverage our enterprisewide solutions and Healthe Intent platform to advance their goal to improving care coordination and reducing the cost of care. This recent win, combined with our record level of new footprints in Q2, is evidence of strong momentum we have in the marketplace.
Looking forward, we believe we can build on this momentum, and we remain bullish on new footprint opportunities. Our positive outlook is based on a very large and active pipeline, an all-time high levels of new business activity such as demos, reference calls and visits and Vision Center visits. We continue to believe we have a multiyear opportunity to expand our client base as about half the market is on the legacy system and we think will need to be replaced.
One observation about the buyer in today's market is they're very focused on the predictability of costs and transparency to total cost of ownership. And we believe this is something that plays to our strength. We believe our ability to offer fixed fee pricing on implementations because of our automation tools and implementation methodologies is a competitive differentiator. We also differentiate in our ability to provide services ranging from remote hosting to taking over an entire IT department, which can make our clients total cost much more transparent and predictable. In addition, I believe we have credibility in the industry because of our track record for delivering value. And this credibility is bolstered by our large presence in investor own systems that are known for making ROI base decisions. These clients along with many of our other large IDNs represent some of the largest Healthcare IT deployments in the industry. I think it is worth noting that our ability to deliver value on time and on budget project is a meaningful differentiator relative to our primary competitor, who has a long list of making headline spend a significant cost of deploying and maintaining their system for as a key reason for job loss, financial challenges and debt rating downgrades.
Another marketplace observation is the openness and interoperability and population of health capabilities are becoming more important. This also benefits Cerner because over the long time commitment to interoperability and open standards and our robust Healthe Intent Cloud Platform for Population Health. We continue to expand the presence of Healthe Intent across our client base, and the number of opportunities outside of our base is growing.
Moving to our Revenue Cycle business. We had a good second quarter. All of our new EMR footprints in Q2 included Revenue Cycle, which supports what would have been saying about the market looking to buy integrated systems. Revenue Cycle is an important component of almost all deals in our pipeline. In addition, we are gaining momentum in our existing install base, with several clients selecting us to replace their legacy Revenue Cycle systems in favor of an integrated system. Based on these trends and the growing pipeline for related services, I expect Revenue Cycle to continue contributing to our growth for years to come.
Moving to the ambulatory market, where we had an all-time high level of bookings in Q2. The bookings were driven by success at displacing our key competitors both by expanding our solutions to ambulatory venues of our acute-care clients and as part of new business footprints. In addition, we are continuing to have success selling ambulatory solutions into the Health Services base. Finally, we continue to gain momentum in the ambulatory business office services and expect there to be additional sites where we displace the crowd business office services offering of a certain cloud competitor because of our ability to demonstrate better service and value.
We also had a record bookings quarter in the small hospital market, driven by a combination of traditional new footprints, extensions to our health system clients and Health Services migrations.
Outside of the U.S., we had a good Q2 with total revenue growth of 54%, consisting of good organic growth in the addition of Health Services. The organic growth was primarily driven by strength in the U.K. and the Middle East.
We are also off to a good start at integrating the Global Health Services. We now have a presence in more than 30 countries and believe we are well-positioned for our Global business to be a good contributor to our growth over the next decade. 
Before turning the call over to Mike, I'd like to comment on the recent announcement on the defense healthcare management system modernization project, referred to as in. We are pleased that last week, the Department of Defense announced the decision to award a contract to. As you know the partnership for defense health includes Cerner as the core EHR supplier. We are honored, humbled and excited to be part of a team that won what we believe is the most objective and comprehensive evaluation of technology platforms and solutions ever conducted. We now have the opportunity for Cerner suite of integrated solutions to replace the DoD's legacy health IT systems in its 55 hospitals and more than 350 clinics worldwide, as well as in ships, submarines and in the theater and military operations. We are pleased to be partners with light is some Accenture and Henry Schein and a number of small business partners in making this important transition for our military health system and its 9.6 million beneficiaries. Intermountain Healthcare is also a strategic partner and is providing clinical governance of solutions and workflow.
The partnership is fully prepared to meet the staffing requirements of dim sum and our globally deployed team stands ready to support the DoD and mission. We believe this a positive development for our clients and they should have confidence that Cerner will continue to execute the meet all of our current and future commitments.
As you maybe saw in the announcement, Lighthouse was awarded the contract for $4.3 billion over 10 years consisting of a 2-year initial ordering period, 2 to 3 year option period and another 2-year option period. We're not able to comment on Cerner's portion of this but note that we do not expect this to have a material impact on bookings revenue or earnings in the near term since the project will have several phases and will start with a small initial rollout. I know many of you also saw an $11 billion figure cited in regards to contract before it was announced. As noted in DOD's press release, this estimate is now approximately $9 billion and represents the total estimated program cost over 18 years, not the value of the contract awarded.
In summary, we believe this selection by the Department of Defense reflects positively on the achievement of Cerner, our partners in all our clients. Department of Defense is already in the Cerner family as lab and we're excited to expand our relationship.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'm going to discuss ITWorks and provide an update on our relationship with the University of Missouri.
In the second quarter, we established a new ITWorks relationship and also expanded an existing ITWorks relationship. Our new ITWorks client is Catholic Health Initiatives, and this relationship was announced in July. CHI selected ITWorks to improve continuity of care across 47 hospitals and multiple clinic settings. Cerner will assume operational and administrative responsibilities for CHS' IT and facilities in multiple states that use Cerner Millennium. This will include current and future implementations, upgrades, enhancements, optimization, application and operational management and support of the system and clinical service desk support.
CHI has been a client for more than 12 years and this will tighten our alignment and support of CHI station of pioneering models to enhance patient care, safety and clinical outcomes. The alignment will help accelerate the implementation of the latest technology advances available.
The second ITWorks agreement I'd like to discuss is the expansion of our relationship with the University of Missouri Healthcare. MU has been a Cerner client since 1996, and we formed the Tiger Institute for health innovation with them in 2009. Tiger Institute has produced a number of innovations to transform the delivery of care. Examples include technology, integrating calculators into the EHR and developing a consumer-facing mental health app. This year the Tiger Institute launched open notes, a function that gives patients access to the clinical notes through the MU Healthe Patient Portal.
MU Health is also achieve multiple healthcare IT successes, including HIMMS Stage 7, being the first academic medical center to meet Meaningful Use Stage 2 and being designated Most Wired by HNA each of the past 4 years.
Going forward, the Tiger Institute will focus on redefining patient engagement through mobile healthcare, developing a Population Health strategy and network to better position MU Healthcare to lower costs while improving the health of Missourians, increased -- increasing the role of healthcare IT and academic medical research, helping transition to value-based payment model and developing a Tiger Institute value creation office to identify cost savings opportunity. University of Missouri was one of the first ITWorks clients and relationship and we are very pleased with what we've accomplished together as a demonstrates the power of close alignment with our clients.

So those clients still want to invest in the current infrastructure if they think they're going to switch to Cerner because many of them only switch to Cerner will go to our hosted methodology and they won't need these computers and the hardware that they'd normally be buying.

When you look at the results for this quarter, clearly, I think our software -- license software was one of the strongest revenue quarters we ever seen. So that obviously brings with much with the higher-margin, doesn't contribute as much to revenue growth, but it certainly contributes to earnings growth. So I think from a mix perspective, we saw that. We're continuing certainly on the EHS side, lower tech resale elements with lower margin help overall margins, help the revenue so much. But and I think just the activity around the acquisition and thoroughly reviewing not only HS spending but Cerner spending to make sure we're appropriately investing was good for the business. So I think that's overall giving us a little bit of a tailwind from this expense side. So it is a mix to some extent, but there is some real savings on the spending side that we've incurred. Part of it even is on the services business where we are just starting to ramp up hiring now to meet the 2015 bookings demand that we saw in the first half and we expect to see in the second half."

Part of it was a desire to make sure that we thoroughly had a chance to review all of the HS service resources, decide what was needed to stay in that business, what we could convert to doing Millennium work. I think probably the services business we did in address is much might have been some of the optional nonimplementation work that we often see and often get signed and executed within the quarter. But I think that was prudent as we went through. I think I would certainly take it on these as probably not having the resource element reflected as accurately in our forecasting model as I should have, so a little bit of lower revenue being a little bit lower than guidance is just on that. We've adjusted that going forward. So the rest of the year we feel very confident on the revenue guidance that we provided. But it's not -- it's getting to these new projects as much as it is some of the ancillary service activities we get. And then third party, we really like to minimize how much we use third-party services. We have a lot of Meaningful Use activity in the year-ago quarter, lots of what's going on and that's why you saw the much higher third-party and a much higher travel revenue that came through the P&L."

They want to do it with people really know how to go operate that environment. That's usually where we see the ITWorks activity occurring. Certainly, as we have more and more experience, more and more clients that we can show as examples of how that's worked, it's getting to be something that our client base is developing a higher level of interest. They want to make sure that they can get their cost manage well and that they can be certainly predictable. And ITWorks makes less of them get make their cost in the IT space highly predictable relative to running their system. So it really is although when we signed up for ITWorks, certainly follow on solutions as they switch out those ancillary as they occur. But that really once they go into ITWorks, there's follow-on business, but that's really almost not necessarily culmination of the relationship. But at that point, we are pretty sticky in their environment and switching from that is very, very difficult. And certainly, we don't give them any reason to want to switch. And certainly, the ITWorks opportunity, we see RevWorks starting to be able to follow in that same line. As we get through ICD-10, we think the desire for remaining systems to get out of the revenue collection business and outsource the revenue cycle is going to continue to build and everything actually when we look at how we grow our revenue in the future, we think those Works businesses are certainly big opportunities because each kind of ITWorks business is at least $7 million to $10 million a year of additional revenue.

Other elements are doing well. We are seeing some lower third -- lower tech resale from certainly from HS and a little bit from us, which is impacting the revenue. But the lion's share of it is related to services. Some of that is as I indicated, as we went through in more detail this quarter and reviewed our forecasting process, I think we were -- there were some something in those forecast that gave us a bigger number than it should have. And that included -- including more third-party. Because third-party is something we have a little hard time getting visibility to because it's not necessarily -- it's coming out of backlog, it's not necessarily that's coming in out of our resources, so it's a little bit of a different model. So I think services clearly missed their forecast in this period. And I think just in the quarter, there is a couple of deals that had some would have contributed some decent size revenue to the quarter for not necessarily high-margin revenue, but some revenue that didn't happen in the quarter that we would have forecasted from a revenue perspective. But at this point, I think there's nothing in the business that is causing us to miss our guidance. I think it's more of the guidance was probably higher than it should've been when we went into last quarter. We've now adjusted it. I feel very confident, as you know. And you could expect, beat this really hard since we closed the quarter and prior to that to understand it well. And I'm pretty confident that we've got good numbers out there for you going forward and pretty confident that services business bounces back as we continue to ride the momentum in '15 and to services personnel and how that pipeline of works businesses we think will contribute pretty significantly likely to the to '16 number.

I think part of the difference you talked about when you're going back to the revenue line, you're getting going back to last quarter where we  talked about the Health Services deferred revenue, it was about $100 million. So there's other elements than just services, if you're going to kind of step back for revenue discussions we've had in the last 12 months. But from a services perspective, key for us is forecasting accurately based on our backlog. It's got to be delivered in the resource we have available to go deliver that. And we did not do that effectively in Q2 as we should have. We've now gone through that forecast with a finetooth comb. So from a business perspective, it's pretty logical that with less third party, revenues not going to be there but then delivered a services from our own personnel and we are adding to that personnel line everyday, certainly with a lot of the college hires coming out of school that will hit us basically Q2, Q3. Those are the resources we need to go out and deliver the work that Zane and his team are delivering for us. So that will drive out the revenue that we've got projected. We're up against a very difficult comp relative to 2014 where we grew revenue 17%. So you got to back of your mind keep that present because when you just look at the 2 years, we still are growing revenue relatively good on average. In addition, as we roll into next year, because of what we see or what I see in the opportunities from the works businesses and as we ramp up the services opportunities from a delivery perspective, I don't -- we should still be talking about being able to deliver double-digit growth in 2016. Obviously, it's early to talk about that. We haven't given any guidance to that. But I believe it is laying out in a way that some of these works deals could be a significant tailwind for us to get that double-digit revenue growth."

But from a revenue standpoint, because of preparing for HS being very careful about over hiring, there are certain optional services elements that are not related to implementation that we didn't necessarily go after that work, it's certainly going to be there. We can at a later time but we wanted to make sure that we didn't hire a bunch of people relative to the work that's going to be able to be out there. When you look at services for me also have a little bit of an HS element that just because of the transition that they're not as efficient as we would normally have our services people be from the availability standpoint. So those are all factored into it. At this point, I think we've got the right number out there. We feel very confident in it.

So I don't have to ramp up internally my resources to be able to handle that work. For the most part, you bring in a team that is already doing that work and I have a core group of people in Cerner that can add some of that initial initiation of that client as part of their normal workflow. So that's easier from a resourcing perspective because once they come on, there are instantly workforce in place into revenue and expenses driven immediately without having to for us to do any resourcing."

I think if you look at our receivables, you'll see that there were pretty significant increase in those receivables. So I think we did a good job as we closed out Q2 of getting bills out. So you got to get the bills out before you start getting paid. So that was the key focus for us. And now that those bills are slowing, then we should start seeing the cash come in and that will impact the receivables by reducing it, which obviously will help our DSO number. As far as what is the optimum DSO number, 66 days is a pretty -- when you're selling into healthcare, which is a traditionally slow pay industry, 66 days is a pretty low number. I'm not wanting to say that, that's not the number that we should be targeting and shooting for. But we'll certainly be looking at it carefully as we go forward. And once we start getting the trend down, we should get a better view as to -- if there should be a different expectation of getting down to that.

We certainly have a rigorous process by which we examine hundreds of projects and then decide which one of them is going to get the resourcing to get the done. And a component of that is the expected economic return we think that, that's going to drive. So there is an ROI component. But I think we have -- our strategy so far has proven very effective to build it ourselves, to incorporate into the Millennium Healthe Intent platform, and that's probably more of a focus of ours than deciding based on these projects what the ROI is.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll lead off today with a review of the numbers.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with the results highlights and marketplace observations. Mike Nill, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, will discuss operations. Neal Patterson, our Chairman and CEO, will join us for Q&A.
Now I'll turn to our results. Similar to last quarter, we delivered results that were mostly in line with our expectations with the exception of revenue. While we are disappointed that we are below our guided levels of revenue, our continued level of strong bookings and positive outlook set up a good second half of the year.
Our bookings revenue in Q2 was $1.29 billion, which is an all-time high and reflects 20% growth over Q2 of '14, including record amounts of new business activity. Our revenue backlog at the end of the quarter of $13.3 billion, which is up $9.7 billion a year ago, and reflects the strong bookings in Q2 as well as the inclusion of backlog from Health Services.
Revenue in the quarter was $1.13 billion, which is up 32% over Q2 of '14 and includes approximately $260 million of Health Services. The total is approximately $50 million below our guidance range with approximately $40 million of shortfall related to core Cerner and $10 million attributable to Health Services.
On the Cerner side, the low revenue and resulting low single-digit growth is related to several factors. Some are in quarter dynamics, some are unique items in the prior-year period that drove 20% growth and created a tough comparable and some are items that we didn't accurately forecast.
The first factor is lower growth in services, which is primarily because of a year-over-year decrease in third-party services. Recall that in Q2 of '14, we added revenue over team [ph] at more than $20 million, which was largely related to higher third-party services and reimbursed travel. We are using less third-party services this year, and travel revenue, excluding Health Services, was down approximately 50% year-over-year. Just adjusting for these 2 items brings Cerner's core growth from approximately 2% to 5%. As you know, third-party services are a lower margin, and reimbursed travel is 0 margin. So this lower revenue had low impact on our profitability.
Another factor that has impacted our services revenue is that we've limited hiring in the months leading up to and the initial months after the close of our Health Services acquisition.
Our forecasted model did not fully reflect this, and we're now ramping up hiring to meet the strong demand reflected in year-to-date bookings and our forecast, which will drive stronger services revenues growth. But the impact of the additional resources as well as the impact of additional opportunities we see for the works businesses will primarily be toward the end of the year and in 2016. 
An additional factor impacting revenues and our bookings this quarter included a higher percentage from long-term contracts, resulting in a lower percentage of items that generated in-quarter revenue. 
Finally, related to Health Services. Recurring revenue is tracking as we have forecasted, but nonrecurring revenue came in lower than expected. Although we're having ongoing success with converting Health Services clients to Millennium, there is a portion of their base that sitting tight during the transition, which has impacted the rate at which they make add-on purchases for things like lower margin hardware. Otherwise, everything we are tracking for Health Services is at or ahead of our expectations.
Now I'll quickly go through the total revenue composition for Q2. Total system sales revenue was $315 million. Support and maintenance was $255 million. Services was $538 million. And reimbursed travel was $18 million.
System sales revenue reflects a 34% increase over Q2 of '14, with the growth mainly driven by an increase in subscriptions which is where the addition of Health Services has had the biggest impact as well as the growth in licensed software.
Our system sales margin percentage was 64.3% which is down slightly from 65.3% in Q2 of '14 and 64.7% in Q1. The decline was driven by lower tech resale margins.
Moving to services. Total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 30% compared to Q2 of '14, mainly driven by the addition of Health Services as well as growth in core Cerner Managed Services.
Support and maintenance revenue increased 45% over Q2 of '14, reflecting solid growth in core support and maintenance and the addition of Health Services. Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 30% over the year-ago quarter to $995 million, driven largely by the addition of Health Services. And Global revenue grew 54% to $131 million with [indiscernible] core Global revenue being augmented by the addition of Health Services.
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q2 was 82.9%, which is up from 80.9% in Q2 of '14, with the improved margin reflecting the lower level of third-party services and reimbursed travel.
Looking at operating spending. Our second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude share based compensation expense, voluntary separation plan expense and acquisition-related adjustments were $661 million, which is up 37% compared to adjusted Q2 '14 operating expenses. This growth was primarily driven by the addition of Health Services business.
The total year-over-year growth for each expense category on a non-GAAP basis was: 32% for sales and client service; 42% for software development; 51% for G&A; and a 3% decline in amortization as acquisition-related intangibles, which is a new expense line we added this quarter. Note that this line is $25 million on our GAAP income statement and $3 million in our non-GAAP results, since we are excluding amortization related to Health Services.
Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin before share based compensation voluntary separation expense and acquisition-related adjustments was 24.2% in Q2. This is essentially flat compared to Q2 of '14 and up 50 basis points from last quarter. 
Similar to Q1, we achieved our second quarter earnings on lower revenue resulting in a higher operating margin percent than we originally projected. We expect this dynamic to continue for the rest of the year, while lower revenue -- with lower revenue being offset by lower expenses, resulting in no change to our earnings outlook and a higher operating margin percent than we originally projected. We now expect our non-GAAP operating margin for the year to be close to 2014 levels, which compares to the original expectation that we'd go down approximately 200 basis points with the addition of Health Services.
Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q2 were $115 million or $0.33 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $183 million, and adjusted EPS was $0.52, which is up 30% compared to Q2 of '14. Adjusted net earnings exclude share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on GAAP earnings of $14 million dollars or $0.04 per diluted share as well as a voluntary separation plan expense, which had a net impact on GAAP earnings of $28 million or $0.08 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings also reflect adjustments related to Cerner's acquisition of Health Services, including Health Services acquisition-related amortization, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $14 million and $0.04, respectively; other acquisition related adjustments, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $6 million and $0.01, respectively; and new acquisition related deferred revenue adjustment which is not included in GAAP net earnings but increases adjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $6 million and $0.02, respectively.
The Q2 tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 33%, which is in our expected range of 33% to 34%.
Now move to our balance sheet. We ended Q2 with $857 million of total cash and investments, which is down slightly from $889 million in Q1 due to our negative free cash flow, which I'll discuss in a minute.
Our total debt, including capital lease obligations was $623 million. Total receivables ended the quarter at $1 billion, which is up $63 million from Q1. Our Q2 DSO was 81 days compared to 79 days in Q1 and 66 days in the year-ago quarter. The higher DSO is primarily a function of the lower revenue in the quarter and some delayed billings for Health Services clients as we transition to our systems. As we move through the year, we expect DSO to come down as revenue increases, and we get Health Services billings caught up.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $109 million, down from $214 million in Q1 due mainly to the voluntary separation plan expense and lower collections related to delayed billings.
Q2 capital expenditures were $85 million and capitalized software was $70 million.
Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was negative $46 million for the quarter, driven by a combination of lower operating cash flow and higher capital spending.
Looking ahead, we expect operating cash flow to increase in coming quarters as voluntary separation of plan and acquisition-related expenses decline and we improve DSO. Some of the increased operating cash flow will be offset by capital expenditures tied to construction of our new campus and Health Services capital expenditures. We still expect free cash flow to improve meaningfully.
Now I'll go through Q3 and full year 2015 guidance. For Q3, we expect revenue between $1.15 billion and $1.2 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 40% over Q3 of '14.
For the full year, we expect revenue between $4.475 billion and $4.575 billion, with the midpoint reflecting 33% growth over last year. This is lower than our prior guidance, due to lower revenue in Q2 and also factors in the lower year-to-date run rate. 
As I indicated, the lower revenue is not expected to impact our earnings in Q3 -- year. For Q3, we expect adjusted EPS before share-based compensation, voluntary separation plan expense and acquisition-related adjustments to be $0.54 to $0.55 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 30% growth over Q3 '14 adjusted EPS.
For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS before share-based compensation, voluntary separation plan expense and acquisition-related adjustments to be $2.09 to $2.15, which is up from our previous range of $2.07 to $2.15 and reflects 28% growth at the midpoint.
Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense is approximately $0.03 to $0.04 in Q3 and $0.14 to $0.15 for the full year.
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q3 of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion, with the midpoint reflecting 27% growth over Q3 of '14.
In summary, while we were disappointed that revenue was below our guidance, we are very pleased with our bookings results and outlook. Importantly, we believe we have appropriately adjusted our revenue guidance to factor in the lower first half revenue and run rate. With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane."

Bookings this qua",1467,"Thanks, Mark. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. I'll start with our results.
Our bookings revenue in Q2 of $1.29 billion reflects strong growth of 20% over Q2 2014. Bookings this quarter included an all-time high level of large contracts, with 38 contracts over $5 million, including 23 over $10 million. We also had strong contributions from long-term bookings with a large ITWorks contract and an expansion of existing ITWorks relationship. This led to long-term bookings, making up 35% of total, which is 2% higher than normal.
The main highlight of the quarter was that we signed a record number of new footprints in both -- both in terms of number and dollars. This resulted in 34% of our bookings coming from outside our core Millennium install base. This success reflects our strong competitiveness and the continued large opportunity for competitive displacements. Our wins span many market segments, including IDNs, regional hospitals, children's hospitals, community hospitals, state behavioral health, ambulatory surgery centers and physician groups.
We're also continuing to sign Health Services clients to migrate to Millennium. These clients range from community hospitals selecting our CommunityWorks offering to large IDNs. And we continue to see cross-sell activity for solutions like Population Health and ambulatory.
While not part of Q2, I'd like to highlight a significant win for Cerner that was announced today. We were recently selected by Baptist Health South Florida, a leading healthcare organization in the region, to implement Cerner Millennium and Healthe Intent across their 7 hospitals and over 50 outpatient facilities. Baptist Health is recognized as a national leader in quality, safety and patient satisfaction, and they are looking to Cerner Solutions to optimize the physician experience, improve quality of care and support their efforts to improve patient experience. In addition, they expect to leverage our enterprisewide solutions and Healthe Intent platform to advance their goal to improving care coordination and reducing the cost of care. This recent win, combined with our record level of new footprints in Q2, is evidence of the strong momentum we have in the marketplace.
Looking forward, we believe we can build on this momentum, and we remain bullish on new footprint opportunities. Our positive outlook is based on a very large and active pipeline, and all-time high levels of new business activity such as demos, reference calls and visits and Vision Center visits. We continue to believe we have a multiyear opportunity to expand our client base as about half the market is on the legacy system and we think will need to be replaced.
One observation about the buyer in today's market is they are very focused on the predictability of cost and transparency to total cost of ownership. And we believe this is something that plays to our strength. We believe our ability to offer fixed fee pricing on implementations because of our automation tools and implementation methodologies is a competitive differentiator. We also differentiate in our ability to provide services ranging from remote hosting to taking over an entire IT department, which can make our clients total cost much more transparent and predictable. In addition, I believe we have credibility in the industry because of our track record for delivering value. And this credibility is bolstered by our large presence in investor owned systems that are known for making ROI based decisions. These clients, along with many of our other large IDNs, represent some of the largest Healthcare IT deployments in the industry. I think it is worth noting that our ability to deliver value on time and on budget projects is a meaningful differentiator relative to our primary competitor, who has a long list of making headlines when a significant cost of deploying and maintaining their system is cited for -- as a key reason for job loss, financial challenges and debt rating downgrades.
Another marketplace observation is that openness, interoperability and population health capabilities are becoming more important. This also benefits Cerner because of a long time commitment to interoperability and open standards and our robust Healthe Intent Cloud Platform for Population Health. We continue to expand the presence of Healthe Intent across our client base, and the number of opportunities outside of our base is growing.
Moving to our Revenue Cycle business. We had a good second quarter. All of our new EMR footprints in Q2 included Revenue Cycle, which supports what we have been saying about the market looking to buy integrated systems. Revenue Cycle is an important component of almost all deals in our pipeline. In addition, we are gaining momentum in our existing install base, with several clients selecting us to replace their legacy Revenue Cycle systems in favor of an integrated system. Based on these trends and a growing pipeline for related services, I expect Revenue Cycle to continue contributing to our growth for years to come.
Moving to the ambulatory market, where we had an all-time high level of bookings in Q2. The bookings were driven by success at displacing our key competitors, both by expanding our solutions to ambulatory venues of our acute-care clients and as part of new business footprints. In addition, we are continuing to have success selling ambulatory solutions into the Health Services base. Finally, we continue to gain momentum in the ambulatory business office services and expect there to be additional sites where we displace the cloud business office services offering of a certain cloud competitor, because of our ability to demonstrate better service and value.
We also had a record bookings quarter in the small hospital market, driven by a combination of traditional new footprints, extensions to our health system clients and Health Services migrations.
Outside of the U.S., we had a good Q2, with total revenue growth of 54%, consisting of good organic growth and the addition of Health Services. The organic growth was primarily driven by strength in the U.K. and the Middle East.
We are also off to a good start at integrating the global components of Health Services. We now have a presence in more than 30 countries, and believe we are well-positioned for our Global business to be a good contributor to our growth over the next decade. 
Before turning the call over to Mike, I'd like to comment on the recent announcement on the Defense Healthcare Management System Modernization project, referred to as DHMSM. We are pleased that last week, the Department of Defense announced the decision to award the contract to Leidos Inc. As you know, the Leidos partnership for defense health includes Cerner as the core EHR supplier. We are honored, humbled and excited to be part of a team that won what we believe was the most objective and comprehensive evaluation of technology platforms and solutions ever conducted. We now have the opportunity for Cerner's suite of integrated solutions to replace the DOD's legacy health IT systems in its 55 hospitals and more than 350 clinics worldwide, as well as in ships, submarines and other locations in the theater of military operations. We are pleased to be partners with Leidos, Accenture, Henry Schein and a number of small business partners in making this important transition for our military health system and its 9.6 million beneficiaries. Intermountain Healthcare is also a strategic partner, and is providing clinical governance of solutions and workflow.
The partnership is fully prepared to meet the staffing requirements of DHMSM and our globally deployed team stands ready to support the DOD and DHMSM mission. We believe this a positive development for our clients and they should have confidence that Cerner will continue to execute to meet all our current and future commitments.
As many of you saw in the announcement, Leidos was awarded the contract for $4.3 billion over 10 years, consisting of a 2-year initial ordering period, 2 to 3 year option period and another 2-year option period. We are not able to comment on Cerner's portion of this, but note that we do not expect this to have a material impact on bookings revenue or earnings in the near term, since the project will have several phases and will start with a small initial rollout. I know many of you also saw an $11 billion figure cited in regards to contract before it was announced. As noted in DOD's press release, this estimate is now approximately $9 billion, and represents the total estimated program cost over 18 years, not the value of the contract awarded.
In summary, we believe this selection by the Department of Defense reflects positively on the achievements of Cerner, our partners and all our clients. The Department of Defense is already in the Cerner family as lab client, and we're excited to expand our relationship.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'm going to discuss ITWorks and provide an update on our relationship with the University of Missouri.
In the second quarter, we established a new ITWorks relationship, and also expanded an existing ITWorks relationship. Our new ITWorks client is Catholic Health Initiatives, and this relationship was announced in July. CHI selected ITWorks to improve continuity of care across 47 hospitals and multiple clinic settings. And Cerner will assume operational and administrative responsibilities for CHS' IT and its facilities in multiple states that use Cerner Millennium. This will include current and future implementations, upgrades, enhancements, optimization, application and operational management and support of the system and clinical service desk support.
CHI has been a client for more than 12 years, and this will tighten our alignment and support of CHI's vision of pioneering models to enhance patient care, safety and clinical outcomes. The charter [ph] alignment will help accelerate the implementation of the latest technology advances available.
The second ITWorks agreement I'd like to discuss is the expansion of our relationship with the University of Missouri Healthcare. MU has been a Cerner client since 1996, and we formed the Tiger Institute for health innovation with them in 2009. The Tiger Institute has produced a number of innovations to transform the delivery of care. Examples include ease of use of [ph] technology, integrating calculators into the EHR and developing a consumer-facing mental health app. This year the Tiger Institute launched open notes, a function that gives patients access to their clinical notes through the MU Healthe Patient Portal.
MU Health has also achieved multiple healthcare IT successes, including HIMMS Stage 7, being the first academic medical center to meet Meaningful Use Stage 2 and being designated Most Wired by HNA each of the past 4 years.
Going forward, the Tiger Institute will focus on redefining patient engagement through mobile healthcare, developing a Population Health strategy and network to better position MU Healthcare to lower costs while improving the health of Missourians. Increased -- increasing the role of healthcare IT and academic medical research, helping transition to value-based payment models and developing a Tiger Institute value creation office to identify cost savings opportunity. The University of Missouri was one of the first ITWorks clients and institute relationships, and we are very pleased with what we've accomplished together as it demonstrates the power of cultural alignment with our clients.
With that, I'll turn the call over to questions."

For clients that are not immediately looking to go transition to Cerner Millennium and make the switch, they are not putting in a lot of new solutions from HS into their environment. They're kind of holding pads with their hand, that's impacting some of the services that we see normally from HS. It's certainly impacting what their normal hardware and third-party sales would be. So those clients don't want to invest in the current infrastructure if they think they're going to switch to Cerner, because many of them, when they switch to Cerner, will go to our hosted methodology and they won't need these computers and the hardware that they'd normally be buying. So we expect that as people kind of decide what their timeframe for moving is that, we will see that free up and people will say I've got a 3-year window, or whatever the window is, I need to make these purchases, and we'll see that start bouncing back. But as we look at that business, the one thing that's lower is these add-on type sales into the base that surround their existing platforms.

So I think from a mix perspective, we saw that. We're continuing, certainly on the EHS side, the lower tech resale elements with lower margin help overall margins, don't help the revenue so much, but -- and I think just the activity around the acquisition and thoroughly reviewing not only HS spending but Cerner spending, to make sure we were appropriately investing, was good for the business. So I think that's overall given us a little bit of a tailwind from this expense side. So it is a mix, to some extent, but there is some real savings on the spending side that we've incurred. Part of it even is on the services business, where we're just starting to ramp up hiring now to meet the 2015 bookings demand that we saw in the first half and that we expect to see in the second half."

But I think that was prudent as we went through. I think I would certainly take it on these as probably not having the resource element reflected as accurately in our forecasting model as I should have, so a little bit of lower revenue being a little bit lower than guidance is just on that. We've adjusted that going forward. So the rest of the year we feel very confident on the revenue guidance that we provided. But it's -- it's not getting to these new projects as much as it is some of the ancillary service activities we get. And then third party, we really like to minimize how much we use third-party services.

It's really an indicator that the client has decided to go all in Cerner, and that they are going to replace every ancillary system they have. With Cerner, they want to do it as quickly as possible. They want to do it with people that really know how to go operate in that environment. That's usually where we see the ITWorks activity occurring. Certainly, as we have more and more experience, more and more clients that we can show as examples of how that's worked, it's getting to be something that our client base is developing a higher level of interest. They want to make sure that they can get their costs manage well, and that they can be certainly predictable. And ITWorks makes -- lets them get -- make their cost in the IT space highly predictable, relative to running their system. So it really is, although from when they sign up for ITWorks, there certainly is follow-on solutions as they switch out those ancillaries they occur. But really, once they go into ITWorks, there's follow-on business, but that's really almost, not necessarily culmination of the relationship, but at that point, we are pretty sticky in their environment and switching from that is very, very difficult. And certainly, we don't give them any reason to want to switch. And certainly, the ITWorks opportunity, we see RevWorks starting to be able to follow in that same line. As we get through ICD-10, we think the desire for many systems to get out of the revenue collection business and outsource the revenue cycle is going to continue to build and we think actually, when we look at how do we grow our revenue in the future, we think those Works businesses are certainly big opportunities, because each kind of ITWorks business is at least $7 million to $10 million a year of additional revenue.

Clearly, as we went into Q2 and prepared to talk to you guys last time, services is primarily the focus for us, relative from a revenue perspective. License software is doing well. Other elements are doing well. We are seeing some lower third -- lower tech resale from, certainly from HS and a little bit from us, which is impacting the revenue. But the lion's share of it is related to services. Some of that is, as I indicated, as we went through in more detail this quarter when viewed our forecasting process, I think we were -- there were some -- something in those forecasts that gave us a bigger number than it should have. And that included -- including more third-party. Because third-party is something we have a little hard time getting visibility to, because it's not necessarily -- while it's coming out of backlog, it's not necessarily something that's coming out of our resources, so it's a little bit of a different model. So I think services clearly missed their forecast in this period. And I think just in the quarter, there is a couple of deals that had some would have contributed some decent size revenue to the quarter for I mean, not necessarily high-margin revenue, but some revenue it didn't happen in the quarter that we would have forecasted from a revenue perspective. But at this point, I think there's nothing in the business that is causing us to miss our guidance. I think it's more of the guidance was probably higher than it should've been when we went into last quarter. We've now adjusted it. I feel very confident, as you know. And you could expect, beat this really hard since we closed the quarter and prior to that to understand it well. And I'm pretty confident that we've got good numbers out there for you going forward, and pretty confident that, that services business bounces back as we continue to ride the momentum in '15, continue to add to our services personnel and how that pipeline of works businesses that we think will contribute pretty significantly, likely to the to the 2 '16 revenue number. So definitely take it as my bad on the guidance variance today, but I'm not going to have that in my bag next quarter."

But as we roll forward, and we get that campus -- the first phase of the campus completed, you should see us starting to bounce back from a free cash flow perspective.

But I think the key is, relative to -- compared to the year-ago quarter when we had a bunch of third parties getting to Meaningful Use projects that we are not doing that as much, that is harder for us to forecast and we did not do a very effective job of putting into our forecast the significantly reduced number. So that's what we're probably $20 million in the year-ago quarter that we are lower than that this quarter. So that's a pretty big change relative to the total. I think part of the difference you talked about when you're going back to the revenue line, you're getting going [indiscernible] go back to last quarter where we  talked about the Health Service they deferred revenue, it was about $100 million. So there's other elements than just services, if you're going to kind of step back for revenue discussions we've had in the last 12 months. But from a services perspective, key for us is, forecasting accurately based on our backlog. It's got to be delivered and this is resource do we have available to go deliver that. And we did not do that as effectively in Q2 as we should have. We've now gone through that forecast with a fine-tooth comb. So from a business perspective, it's pretty logical that with less third parties, that revenues not going to be there. We began to deliver the services from our own personnel and we were we'll add him to that personnel line everyday, certainly we'd love the college hires, coming out of schools that will hit us basically Q2, Q3. Those are the resources we need to go out and deliver the work that Zane and his team are delivering for us. So that will drive out the revenue that we've got projected. We're up against a very difficult comp relative to 2014 where we grew revenue 17%. So you got -- back of your mind, at least keep that present because we used to just look at it the 2 years, we still are growing revenue relatively good, on average. In addition, as we roll into next year, because of what we see or at least what I see in the opportunities from the works businesses, and as we ramp up to services opportunities from a deliveries perspective, I don't -- we should still be talking about being able to deliver double-digit growth in 2016. Obviously, it's early to talk about that. We haven't given any guidance to that. But I believe it is laying out in a way that some of these works deals could be a significant tailwind for us to get that double-digit revenue growth."

We can go pick that up at a later time, but we wanted to make sure that we didn't hire a bunch of people relative to the work that's going to be able to be out there.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll lead off today with a review of the numbers.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with the results highlights and marketplace observations. Mike Nill, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, will discuss operations. Neal Patterson, our Chairman and CEO, will join us for Q&A.
Now I'll turn to our results. Similar to last quarter, we delivered results that were mostly in line with our expectations with the exception of revenue. While we are disappointed that we were below our guided levels of revenue, our continued level of strong bookings and positive outlook set up a good second half of the year.
Our bookings revenue in Q2 was $1.29 billion, which is an all-time high and reflects 20% growth over Q2 of '14, including record amounts of new business activity. Our revenue backlog end of the quarter of $13.3 billion is up $9.7 billion a year ago, and reflects the strong bookings in Q2 as well as the inclusion of backlog from Health Services.
Revenue in the quarter was $1.13 billion, which is up 32% over Q2 of '14 and includes approximately $260 million of Health Services. The total is approximately $50 million below our guidance range with approximately $40 million of shortfall related to core Cerner and $10 million attributable to Health Services.
On the Cerner side, the low revenue and resulting low single-digit growth is related to several factors. Some are in quarter dynamics, some are unique items in the prior-year period that drove 20% growth and created a tough comparable and some are items that we didn't accurately forecast.
The first factor is lower growth in services, which is primarily because of a year-over-year decrease in third-party services. Recall that in Q2 of '14, we had a revenue over-attainment of more than $20 million, which was largely related to higher third-party services and reimbursed travel. We are using less third-party services this year, and travel revenue, excluding Health Services, was down approximately 50% year-over-year. Just adjusting for these 2 items brings Cerner's core growth from approximately 2% to 5%. As you know, third-party services are a lower margin, and reimbursed travel is 0 margin. So this lower revenue had little impact on our profitability.
Another factor that has impacted our services revenue is that we've limited hiring in the months leading up to and the initial months after the close of our Health Services acquisition.
Our forecasting model did not fully reflect this, and we're now ramping up hiring to meet the strong demand reflected in year-to-date bookings and our forecast, which will drive stronger services revenues growth. But the impact of the additional resources as well as the impact of additional opportunities we see for the works businesses will primarily be toward the end of the year and in 2016. 
An additional factor impacting revenues and our bookings this quarter included a higher percentage from long-term contracts, resulting in a lower percentage of items that generated in-quarter revenue. 
Finally, relative to Health Services. Recurring revenue is tracking as we had forecasted, but nonrecurring revenue came in lower than expected. Although we're having ongoing success with converting Health Services clients to Millennium, there is a portion of their base that is sitting tight during the transition, which has impacted the rate at which they make add-on purchases for things like lower margin hardware. Otherwise, everything we are tracking for Health Services is at or ahead of our expectations.
Now I'll quickly go through the total revenue composition for Q2. Total system sales revenue was $315 million. Support and maintenance was $255 million. Services was $538 million. And reimbursed travel was $18 million.
System sales revenue reflects a 34% increase over Q2 of '14, with the growth mainly driven by an increase in subscriptions which is where the addition of Health Services has had the biggest impact as well as the growth in licensed software.
Our system sales margin percentage was 64.3% which is down slightly from 65.3% in Q2 of '14 and 64.7% in Q1. The decline was driven by lower tech resale margins.
Moving to services. Total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 30% compared to Q2 of '14, mainly driven by the addition of Health Services as well as growth in core Cerner Managed Services.
Support and maintenance revenue increased 45% over Q2 of '14, reflecting solid growth in core support and maintenance and the addition of Health Services. Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 30% over the year-ago quarter to $995 million, driven largely by the addition of Health Services. And Global revenue grew 54% to $131 million with good growth in core Global revenue being augmented by the addition of Health Services.
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q2 is 82.9%, which is up from 80.9% in Q2 of '14, with the improved margin reflecting the lower level of third-party services and reimbursed travel.
Looking at operating spending. Our second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude share based compensation expense, voluntary separation plan expense and acquisition-related adjustments, were $661 million, which is up 37% compared to adjusted Q2 '14 operating expenses. This growth was primarily driven by the addition of Health Services business.
The total year-over-year growth for each expense category on a non-GAAP basis was: 32% for sales and client service; 42% for software development; 61% for G&A; and a 3% decline in amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, which is a new expense line we added this quarter. Note that this line is $25 million on our GAAP income statement and $3 million in our non-GAAP results, since we are excluding amortization related to Health Services.
Moving to operating margins. Our operating margin before share based compensation, voluntary separation expense and acquisition-related adjustments was 24.2% in Q2. This is essentially flat compared to Q2 of '14 and up 50 basis points from last quarter. 
Similar to Q1, we achieved our second quarter earnings on lower revenue resulting in a higher operating margin percent than we originally projected. We expect this dynamic to continue for the rest of the year, while lower revenue -- with lower revenue being offset by lower expenses, resulting in no change to our earnings outlook and a higher operating margin percent than we originally projected. We now expect our non-GAAP operating margin for the year to be close to 2014 levels, which compares to an original expectation that we'd go down approximately 200 basis points with the addition of Health Services.
Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q2 were $115 million or $0.33 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $183 million, and adjusted EPS was $0.52, which is up 30% compared to Q2 of '14. Adjusted net earnings exclude share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on GAAP earnings of $14 million or $0.04 per diluted share as well as a voluntary separation plan expense, which had a net impact on GAAP earnings of $28 million or $0.08 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings also reflect adjustments related to Cerner's acquisition of Health Services, including Health Services acquisition-related amortization, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $14 million and $0.04, respectively; other acquisition related adjustments, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $6 million and $0.01, respectively; and new acquisition related deferred revenue adjustment which is not included in GAAP net earnings but increases adjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $6 million and $0.02, respectively.
The Q2 tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 33%, which is in our expected range of 33% to 34%.
Now move to our balance sheet. We ended Q2 with $857 million of total cash and investments, which is down slightly from $889 million in Q1 due to our negative free cash flow, which I'll discuss in a minute.
Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, is $623 million. Total receivables ended the quarter at $1 billion, which is up $63 million from Q1. Our Q2 DSO was 81 days compared to 79 days in Q1 and 66 days in the year-ago quarter. The higher DSO is primarily a function of the lower revenue in the quarter and some delayed billings for Health Services clients as we transition to our systems. As we move through the year, we expect DSO to come down as revenue increases, and we get Health Services billings caught up.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $109 million, down from $214 million in Q1 due mainly to the voluntary separation plan expense and lower collections related to delayed billings.
Q2 capital expenditures were $85 million and capitalized software was $70 million.
Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was negative $46 million for the quarter, driven by a combination of lower operating cash flow and higher capital spending.
Looking ahead, we expect operating cash flow to increase in coming quarters as voluntary separation of plan and acquisition-related expenses decline and we improve DSO. Some of the increased operating cash flow will be offset by capital expenditures tied to construction of our new campus and Health Services capital expenditures. We still expect free cash flow to improve meaningfully.
Now I'll go through Q3 and full year 2015 guidance. For Q3, we expect revenue between $1.15 billion and $1.2 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 40% over Q3 of '14.
For the full year, we expect revenue between $4.475 billion and $4.575 billion, with the midpoint reflecting 33% growth over last year. This is lower than our prior guidance, due to lower revenue in Q2 and also factors in the lower year-to-date run rate. 
As I indicated, the lower revenue is not expected to impact our earnings in Q3 -- year. For Q3, we expect adjusted EPS before share-based compensation, voluntary separation plan expense and acquisition-related adjustments to be $0.54 to $0.55 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 30% growth over Q3 '14 adjusted EPS.
For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS before share-based compensation, voluntary separation plan expense and acquisition-related adjustments to be $2.09 to $2.15, which is up from our previous range of $2.07 to $2.15 and reflects 28% growth at the midpoint.
Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense is approximately $0.03 to $0.04 in Q3 and $0.14 to $0.15 for the full year.
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q3 of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion, with the midpoint reflecting 27% growth over Q3 of '14.
In summary, while we were disappointed that revenue was below our guidance, we are very pleased with our bookings results and outlook. Importantly, we believe we have appropriately adjusted our revenue guidance to factor in the lower first half revenue and run rate. With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane."

Bookings this qua",1469,"Thanks, Mark. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. I'll start with our results.
Our bookings revenue in Q2 of $1.29 billion reflects strong growth of 20% over Q2 2014. Bookings this quarter included an all-time high level of large contracts, with 38 contracts over $5 million, including 23 over $10 million. We also had strong contributions from long-term bookings with a large ITWorks contract and an expansion of an existing ITWorks relationship. This led to long-term bookings, making up 35% of total, which is a few percent higher than normal.
The main highlight of the quarter was that we signed a record number of new footprints in both -- both in terms of number and dollars. This resulted in 34% of our bookings coming from outside our core Millennium install base. This success reflects our strong competitiveness and the continued large opportunity for competitive displacements. Our wins span many market segments, including IDNs, regional hospitals, children's hospitals, community hospitals, state behavioral health, ambulatory surgery centers and physician groups.
We're also continuing to sign Health Services clients to migrate to Millennium. These clients range from community hospitals selecting our CommunityWorks offering to large IDNs. And we continue to see cross-sell activity for solutions like Population Health and ambulatory.
While not part of Q2, I'd like to highlight a significant win for Cerner that was announced today. We were recently selected by Baptist Health South Florida, a leading healthcare organization in the region, to implement Cerner Millennium and Healthe Intent across their 7 hospitals and over 50 outpatient facilities. Baptist Health is recognized as a national leader in quality, safety and patient satisfaction, and they are looking to Cerner Solutions to optimize the physician experience, improve quality of care and support their efforts to improve patient experience. In addition, they expect to leverage our enterprise-wide solutions and Healthe Intent platform to advance their goal of improving care coordination and reducing the cost of care. This recent win, combined with our record level of new footprints in Q2, is evidence of strong momentum we have in the marketplace.
Looking forward, we believe we can build on this momentum, and we remain bullish on new footprint opportunities. Our positive outlook is based on a very large and active pipeline, and all-time high levels of new business activity such as demos, reference calls and visits and Vision Center visits. We continue to believe we have a multiyear opportunity to expand our client base as about half the market is on the legacy system and we think will need to be replaced.
One observation about the buyer in today's market is they are very focused on the predictability of cost and transparency to total cost of ownership. And we believe this is something that plays to our strength. We believe our ability to offer fixed fee pricing on implementations because of our automation tools and implementation methodologies is a competitive differentiator. We also differentiate in our ability to provide services ranging from remote hosting to taking over an entire IT department, which can make our clients' total cost much more transparent and predictable. In addition, I believe we have credibility in the industry because of our track record for delivering value. And this credibility is bolstered by our large presence in investor owned systems that are known for making ROI based decisions. These clients, along with many of our other large IDNs, represent some of the largest Healthcare IT deployments in the industry. I think it is worth noting that our ability to deliver value on time and on budget projects is a meaningful differentiator relative to our primary competitor, who has a long list of making headlines when the significant cost of deploying and maintaining their system is cited for -- as a key reason for job loss, financial challenges and debt rating downgrades.
Another marketplace observation is that openness, interoperability and population health capabilities are becoming more important. This also benefits Cerner because of a long time commitment to interoperability and open standards and our robust Healthe Intent Cloud Platform for Population Health. We continue to expand the presence of Healthe Intent across our client base, and the number of opportunities outside of our base is growing.
Moving to our Revenue Cycle business. We had a good second quarter. All of our new EMR footprints in Q2 included Revenue Cycle, which supports what we have been saying about the market looking to buy integrated systems. Revenue Cycle is an important component of almost all deals in our pipeline. In addition, we are gaining momentum in our existing install base, with several clients selecting us to replace their legacy Revenue Cycle systems in favor of an integrated system. Based on these trends and a growing pipeline for related services, I expect Revenue Cycle to continue contributing to our growth for years to come.
Moving to the ambulatory market, where we had an all-time high level of bookings in Q2. The bookings were driven by success at displacing our key competitors, both by expanding our solutions to the ambulatory venues of our acute-care clients and as part of new business footprints. In addition, we are continuing to have success selling ambulatory solutions into the Health Services base. Finally, we continue to gain momentum in ambulatory business office services and expect there to be additional sites where we displace the cloud business office services offering of a certain cloud competitor, because of our ability to demonstrate better service and value.
We also had a record bookings quarter in the small hospital market, driven by a combination of traditional new footprints, extensions to our health system clients and Health Services migrations.
Outside of the U.S., we had a good Q2, with total revenue growth of 54%, consisting of good organic growth and the addition of Health Services. The organic growth was primarily driven by strength in the U.K. and Middle East.
We are also off to a good start at integrating the global components of Health Services. We now have a presence in more than 30 countries, and believe we are well-positioned for our Global business to be a good contributor to our growth over the next decade. 
Before turning the call over to Mike, I'd like to comment on the recent announcement on the Defense Healthcare Management System Modernization project, referred to as DHMSM. We are pleased that last week, the Department of Defense announced the decision to award the contract to Leidos Inc. As you know, the Leidos partnership for defense health includes Cerner as the core EHR supplier. We are honored, humbled and excited to be part of a team that won what we believe was the most objective and comprehensive evaluation of technology platforms and solutions ever conducted. We now have the opportunity for Cerner's suite of integrated solutions to replace the DOD's legacy health IT systems in its 55 hospitals and more than 350 clinics worldwide, as well as in ships, submarines and other locations in the theater of military operations. We are pleased to be partners with Leidos, Accenture, Henry Schein and a number of small business partners in making this important transition for our military health system and its 9.6 million beneficiaries. Intermountain Healthcare is also a strategic partner, and is providing clinical governance of solutions and workflow.
The partnership is fully prepared to meet the staffing requirements of DHMSM and our globally deployed team stands ready to support the DOD and DHMSM mission. We believe this is a positive development for our clients and they should have confidence that Cerner will continue to execute to meet all our current and future commitments.
As many of you saw in the announcement, Leidos was awarded a contract for $4.3 billion over 10 years, consisting of a 2-year initial ordering period, 2- to 3-year option period and another 2-year option period. We are not able to comment on Cerner's portion of this, but note that we do not expect this to have a material impact on bookings revenue or earnings in the near term, since the project will have several phases and will start with a small initial rollout. I know many of you also saw an $11 billion figure cited in regards to contract before it was announced. As noted in DOD's press release, this estimate is now approximately $9 billion, and represents the total estimated program cost over 18 years, not the value of the contract awarded.
In summary, we believe this selection by the Department of Defense reflects positively on the achievements of Cerner, our partners and all our clients. The Department of Defense is already in the Cerner family as a lab client, and we're excited to expand our relationship.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'm going to discuss ITWorks and provide an update on our relationship with the University of Missouri.
In the second quarter, we established a new ITWorks relationship, and also expanded an existing ITWorks relationship. Our new ITWorks client is Catholic Health Initiatives, and this relationship was announced in July. CHI selected ITWorks to improve continuity of care across 47 hospitals and multiple clinic settings. And Cerner will assume operational and administrative responsibilities for CHS' IT and its facilities in multiple states that use Cerner Millennium. This will include current and future implementations, upgrades, enhancements, optimization, application and operational management and support of the system and clinical service desk support.
CHI has been a client for more than 12 years, and this will tighten our alignment and support of CHI's vision of pioneering models to enhance patient care, safety and clinical outcomes. The title alignment will help accelerate the implementation of the latest technology advances available.
The second ITWorks agreement I'd like to discuss is the expansion of our relationship with the University of Missouri Healthcare. MU has been a Cerner client since 1996, and we formed the Tiger Institute for health innovation with them in 2009. The Tiger Institute has produced a number of innovations to transform the delivery of care. Examples include e-visit technology, integrating calculators into the EHR and developing a consumer-facing mental health app. This year the Tiger Institute launched open notes, a function that gives patients access to their clinical notes through the MU Healthe Patient Portal.
MU Health has also achieved multiple healthcare IT successes, including HIMMS Stage 7, being the first academic medical center to meet Meaningful Use Stage 2 and being designated Most Wired by HMA each of the past 4 years.
Going forward, the Tiger Institute will focus on redefining patient engagement through mobile healthcare, developing a Population Health strategy and network to better position MU Healthcare to lower costs while improving the health of Missourians. Increased -- increasing the role of healthcare IT and academic medical research, helping transition to value-based payment models and developing a Tiger Institute value creation office to identify cost savings opportunity. The University of Missouri was one of the first ITWorks clients and institute relationships, and we are very pleased with what we've accomplished together as it demonstrates the power of cultural alignment with our clients.
With that, I'll turn the call over to questions."

For clients that are not immediately looking to go transition to Cerner Millennium and make the switch, they are not putting in a lot of new solutions from HS into their environment. They're kind of holding pat with their hand; that's impacting some of the services that we see normally from HS. It's certainly impacting what their normal hardware and third-party sales would be. So those clients don't want to invest in the current infrastructure if they think they're going to switch to Cerner, because many of them, when they switch to Cerner, will go to our hosted methodology and they won't need these computers and the hardware that they'd normally be buying. So we expect that as people kind of decide what their timeframe for moving is that, we will see that free up and people will say, ""I've got a 3-year window, or whatever the window is, I need to make these purchases,"" and we'll see that start bouncing back. But as we look at that business, the one thing that's lower is these add-on type sales into the base that surround their existing platforms. People are kind of waiting to get their go forward decisions before they continue to make those incremental investments."

So I think from a mix perspective, we saw that. We're continuing, certainly on the HS side, the lower tech resale elements with lower margin help overall margins, don't help the revenue so much, but -- and I think just the activity around the acquisition and thoroughly reviewing not only HS spending but Cerner spending, to make sure we were appropriately investing, was good for the business. So I think that's overall given us a little bit of a tailwind from the expense side. So it is a mix, to some extent, but there is some real savings on the spending side that we've incurred. Part of it even is on the services business, where we're just starting to ramp up hiring now to meet the 2015 bookings demand that we saw in the first half and that we expect to see in the second half."

Part of it was a desire to make sure that we thoroughly had a chance to review all of the HS service resources, decide what was needed to stay in that business, what we could convert to doing Millennium work. I think they probably -- the services business we didn't address as much might have been some of the optional nonimplementation work that we often see and often get signed and executed within a quarter. But I think that was prudent as we went through. I think I would certainly take it on these as probably not having the resource element reflected as accurately in our forecasting model as I should have, so a little bit of lower revenue being a little bit lower than guidance is just on that. We've adjusted that going forward. So the rest of the year we feel very confident on the revenue guidance that we provided. But it's -- it's not getting to these new projects as much as it is some of the ancillary service activities we get. And then third party, we really like to minimize how much we use third-party services. We had a lot of Meaningful Use activity in the year-ago quarter, lots of work going on and that's why you saw the much higher third-party and a much higher travel revenue that came through the P&L."

It's really an indicator that the client has decided to go all in Cerner, and that they are going to replace every ancillary system they have with Cerner, they want to do it as quickly as possible. They want to do it with people that really know how to go operate in that environment. That's usually where we see the ITWorks activity occurring. Certainly, as we have more and more experience, more and more clients that we can show as examples of how that's worked, it's getting to be something that our client base is developing a higher level of interest. They want to make sure that they can get their costs managed well, and that they can be certainly predictable. And ITWorks makes -- lets them get -- make their cost in the IT space highly predictable, relative to running their system. So it really is, although from when they sign up for ITWorks, there certainly is follow-on solutions as they switch out those ancillaries that occur. But really, once they go into ITWorks, there's follow-on business, but that's really almost, not necessarily culmination of the relationship, but at that point, we are pretty sticky in their environment and switching from that is very, very difficult. And certainly, we don't give them any reason to want to switch. And certainly, the ITWorks opportunity, we see RevWorks starting to be able to follow in that same line. As we get through ICD-10, we think the desire for many systems to get out of the revenue collection business and outsource the revenue cycle is going to continue to build and we think actually, when we look at how do we grow our revenue in the future, we think those Works businesses are certainly big opportunities, because each kind of ITWorks business is at least $7 million to $10 million a year of additional revenue.

Clearly, as we went into Q2 and prepared to talk to you guys last time, services is primarily the focus for us, relative from a revenue perspective. License software is doing well. Other elements are doing well. We are seeing some lower third -- lower tech resale from, certainly from HS and a little bit from us, which is impacting revenue. But the lion's share of it is related to services. Some of that is, as I indicated, as we went through in more detail this quarter when viewed our forecasting process, I think we were -- there were some -- something in those forecasts that gave us a bigger number than it should have. And that included -- including more third-party. Because third-party is something we have a little hard time getting visibility to, because it's not necessarily -- while it's coming out of backlog, it's not necessarily something that's coming out of our resources, so it's a little bit of a different model. So I think services clearly missed their forecast in this period. And I think just in the quarter, there is a couple of deals that had some -- that would have contributed some decent size revenue to the quarter for I mean, not necessarily high-margin revenue, but some revenue that didn't happen in the quarter that we would have forecasted from a revenue perspective. But at this point, I think there's nothing in the business that is causing us to miss our guidance. I think it's more of the guidance was probably higher than it should've been when we went into last quarter. We've now adjusted it. I feel very confident, as you know. And you could expect, beat this really hard since we closed the quarter and prior to that to understand it well. And I'm pretty confident that we've got good numbers out there for you going forward, and pretty confident that services business bounces back as we continue to ride the momentum in '15, continue to add to our services personnel and have that pipeline of works businesses that we think will contribute pretty significantly, likely to the 2 '16 revenue number. So definitely take it as my bad on the guidance variance today, but I'm not going to have that in my bag next quarter."

Steve, on the cash flow, you see us having periods where we invested capital heavily. So go back to 2012, we had 100%. We delivered free cash flow at 100% of net income. '13, we bumped up CapEx significantly, and that went down to 34%. Last year, we had less CapEx. This year we're going to have a strong CapEx. So you're kind of looking at building CapEx of, priced somewhere in the $150 million range. So it'll be pretty strong. And our other capital expenditure, including HS, will be up from last year. But as we roll forward, and we get that campus -- the first phase of the campus completed, you should see us starting to bounce back from a free cash flow perspective. We got hit pretty hard this quarter from just a working capital perspective, and that probably $100 million of working capital on the balance sheet I had just went negative relative to operating cash flow. That will reverse as we go toward plus. My expectation is we roll forward into '16 and '17, you see us getting -- working our way closer to getting to our goal of net income equaling free cash flow."

If we look at kind of from where the guidance originally came out to February to where we are now, it's almost $0.5 billion negative revision at the revenue line. Can you talk to us a little bit more about where those services, revenues lines kind of get sprinkled on the income statement? Is any of it in system sales? Is it all just a net services sub line, under support maintenance and services? And then if a lot of this is tied to third parties, I mean, that seems like a real big move, relative to the size of what we expected the income statement line there to look like for the year. I guess, can you give us some examples functionally of what's going on that's kind of push -- I mean pushing that line around in kind of in a pretty significant direction?"

But I think the key is, relative to -- compared to the year-ago quarter when we had a bunch of third parties getting to the Meaningful Use projects that we are not doing that as much, that is harder for us to forecast and we did not do a very effective job of putting into our forecast the significantly reduced number. So that's what we're probably $20 million in the year-ago quarter that we are lower than that this quarter. So that's a pretty big change relative to the total. I think part of the difference you've talked about when you're going back to the revenue line, you've got to incorporate -- go back to last quarter where we talked about the Health Services deferred revenue, it was about $100 million. So there's other elements than just services, if you're going to kind of step back for revenue discussions we've had in the last 12 months. But from a services perspective, key for us is forecasting accurately based on our backlog. It's got to be delivered and it's resource we have available to go deliver that. And we did not do that as effectively in Q2 as we should have. We've now gone through that forecast with a fine-tooth comb. So from a business perspective, it's pretty logical that with less third parties, that revenues not going to be there. We're going to deliver the services from our own personnel and then we're adding to that personnel line every day, certainly with a lot of the college hires coming out of schools that will hit us basically Q2, Q3. Those are the resources we need to go out and deliver the work that Zane and his team are delivering for us. So that will drive out the revenue that we've got projected. We're up against a very difficult comp relative to 2014 where we grew revenue 17%. So you got -- back of your mind, at least keep that as present because when we used to just look at it 2 years, we still are growing revenue relatively good, on average. In addition, as we roll into next year, because of what we see or at least what I see in the opportunities from the works businesses, and as we ramp up to services opportunities from a deliveries perspective, I don't -- we should still be talking about being able to deliver double-digit growth in 2016. Obviously, it's early to talk about that. We haven't given any guidance to that. But I believe it is laying out in a way that some of these works deals could be a significant tailwind for us to get that double-digit revenue growth."

We've seen a lot more activity in 2015, we're ramping up so when those projects get to the point where they need to be sources, we're be absolutely ready to go deliver those. But from a revenue standpoint, because of preparing for HS to get on board, being very careful about over hiring, there are certain optional services elements that are not related to implementation that we didn't necessarily go after. That work is always going to be there. We can go pick that up at a later time, but we wanted to make sure that we didn't hire a bunch of people relative to the workers that's going to be able to be out there. When you look at services, you also have a little bit of an HS element that, just because of the transition, that they're not as efficient as we would normally have our services people be from the availability standpoint.

But you got to get the bills out before you start getting paid. So that was a key focus for us. And that's -- now that those bills are flowing, that we should start seeing the cash come in, and that will impact the receivables by reducing it, which obviously will help our DSO number. As far as the -- what is the optimum DSO number, 66 days is a pretty -- when you're selling into healthcare, which is a traditionally slow pay industry, 66 days is a pretty low number. I'm not willing to say that, that's not the number that we should be targeting and shooting for. But we'll certainly be looking at it carefully as we go forward.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with the results highlights and marketplace observations. Neal Patterson, our Chairman and CEO will be available for Q&A. Now I'll turn to our results.
Similar to recent quarters, our great success in the marketplace is reflected in our record bookings, but we delivered revenues slightly below expectations. Today, we'll address the disconnect between our outstanding bookings and what remains a very strong marketplace and our near-term revenue shortfalls. While we are disappointed about delivering slightly lower-than-expected revenue, our bookings this year, coupled with our strong pipeline, sets us up for good revenue growth next year.
Our bookings revenue in Q3 was $1.59 billion, which is an all-time high and reflects 44% growth over Q3 of '14, including record amounts of new business activity. Our revenue backlog ended the quarter at $13.9 billion, which is up $10.2 billion -- from $10.2 billion a year ago and reflects the strong bookings in Q3 as well as the inclusion of backlog from Health Services.
Revenue in the quarter was $1.13 billion, which is up 34% over Q3 of '14 and includes approximately $250 million from Health Services. The total is about $20 million below the low end of our guidance range, with approximately half of the shortfall related to core Cerner and half attributable to Health Services.
On the Cerner side, the shortfall is much lower than previous quarters mainly because we appropriately adjusted our forecast for lower services revenue, which is the primary issue in prior quarters. This quarter, the lower-than-expected revenues is mostly a function of lower-than-usual levels of upfront software revenue on some of our larger contracts and technology resale being slightly below our expectations.
On the software portion, I'd like to note that we had an all-time high level of software bookings but a larger-than-normal portion of the contract was structured in a manner that resulted in the revenue being spread over a longer period. This is obviously good for future periods but did impact our current quarter revenue.
Relative to Health Services, the lower revenue was spread among a few areas, including software, technology resale and maintenance revenue and also reflects that we're continuing to fine tune our visibility in that space.
Another factor we have not discussed that has impacted revenue this year is foreign currency fluctuations. In Q3, revenue would have been $20 million higher if you held exchange rates consistent with those in Q3 of '14. While we have factored a portion of this into our guidance, it did have some impact beyond what we expected in Q3 and is also a contributor to the lower revenue for the year.
Now I'll quickly go through the total revenue composition for Q3. Total system sales revenue was $325 million, support and maintenance was $245 million, services was $539 million and reimbursed travel was $19 million.
System sales revenue reflects a 45% increase over Q3 of '14 with the growth mainly driven by an increase in subscriptions, which is where the addition of Health Services has had the biggest impact as well as growth in licensed software and tech resale.
Our software sales margin percent was 67.5%, which is up from 64.3% in Q2 due to sequential decline in technology resale. The margin percentage is down year-over-year mainly because Q3 '14 had a very low mix of tech resale that resulted in unusually high system sales margin percent.
Moving to services. Total services revenue, including professional and managed services was up 30%, compared to Q3 of '14 mainly driven by the addition of Health Services as well as growth in core Cerner managed services.
Support and maintenance revenue increased 38% over Q3 of '14, reflecting growth in core support and maintenance and the addition of Health Services. 
Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 35% over the year-ago quarter to $998 million and Global revenue grew 32% to $130 million, both driven largely by the addition of Health Services.
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q3 was 83.1%, which is basically flat both year-over-year and sequentially.
Looking at operating spending. Our third quarter non-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude share-based compensation expense, voluntary separation plan expense and acquisition-related adjustments were $661 million, which is up 36% compared to adjusted Q3 '14 operating expenses. This growth was primarily driven by the addition of Health Services business.
The total year-over-year growth for each expense category on a non-GAAP basis was 32% for our sales and client service, 37% for software development and 62% for G&A.
Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles which you recall is a new expense line we added in Q2 was basically flat. Note that similar to last quarter, this line is $25 million on our GAAP income statement and just $3 million in our non-GAAP results since we are excluding amortization related to Health Services.
Moving to operating margins. Similar to the past 2 quarters, we delivered basically in line earnings on lower revenue, resulting in a higher operating margin percent than we projected at the beginning of the year. Our operating margin before share-based compensation expenses, voluntary separation expense and acquisition-related adjustments was 24.5% in Q3. This is down 90 basis points year-over-year due mostly to the very low tech resale in Q3 '14 and up 30 basis points from Q2 of '15.
Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q3 were $147 million, or $0.42 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $189 million and adjusted EPS was $0.54, which is up 29% compared to Q3 of '14. Adjusted net earnings exclude share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on GAAP earnings of $14 million or $0.04 per diluted share as well as a voluntary separation plan expense, which had a net impact on GAAP earnings of $2.5 million or $0.01 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings also reflect adjustments related to Cerner's acquisition of Health Services, including Health Services acquisition-related amortization, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $15 million and $0.04, respectively. Other acquisition-related adjustments, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $4 million or $0.01, respectively. And the acquisition related deferred revenue adjustment, which is not included in the GAAP net earnings but increased adjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $6 million and $0.02, respectively.
The Q3 tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 32% which is slightly below our expected range of 33% to 34%.
Now I'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q3 with $766 million of total cash and investments, which is down from $857 million in Q2 primarily due to use of cash for our repurchase programs.
During the quarter, we finished the remaining $100 million of repurchases authorized in 2014 and purchased $100 million of the $245 million authorized in September of this year. In total, we repurchased 3.2 million shares at an average price of $61.91.
Moving to debt. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, is $631 million, which is basically flat compared to Q2.
Total receivables ended the quarter at $1.05 billion, which is up $50 million from Q2. Our Q3 DSO was 85 days compared to 81 days in Q2 and 67 days in the year-ago quarter. The higher DSO is primarily a function of the lower revenue in the quarter, and we are also still working through some delayed Billings for Health Services clients as part of the transition. We do expect DSO improvement in Q4.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $272 million, up from $109 million in Q2. q3 capital expenditures were $88 million and capitalized software was $72 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, is $111 million for the quarter, driven by strong operating cash flow.
Now I'll go through Q4 and full-year 2016 guidance. For Q4, we expect revenue between $1.15 billion and $1.2 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 27% over Q4 of '14. Our Q4 revenue guidance combined with year-to-date results put a slightly below the low end of previously provided full-year guidance as we have factored in the lower results from Q3 and lower Q4 to reflect a similar run rate.
So far this year, favorable mix of revenue lower expenses and Health Services synergies have allowed us to deliver mostly in line earnings despite our lower revenue. Looking at Q4, we do expect a lower revenue to have some impact on earnings, mainly due to continuing effect of lower services revenue and the impact of lower upfront software on some contracts.
We expect Q4 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation, voluntary separation plan expense and acquisition-related adjustments to be $0.56 to $0.58 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 21% growth over Q4 '14 adjusted EPS. This range is below consensus estimates and slightly below our original plan, but it does get us to the low end of our most recently provided full year guidance. Also the Q4 guidance combined with year-to-date results still reflects strong growth of 26% for the full year.
Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense is approximately $0.03 to $0.04 in Q4, which equates to $0.14 to $0.15 for the full year.
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q4 of $1.45 billion to $1.55 billion, with the midpoint reflecting strong growth of 29% over Q4 '14 and 31% growth for the full year.
Now I'd like to provide initial expectations for 2016. Note that these comments should be viewed as preliminary until we finalize our financial plan and provide more formal guidance when we report fourth quarter results.
We currently expect 2016 revenue to be over $5 billion, which equates to growth of at least 13% on top of what is projected to be approximately 30% growth in 2015. We realized the growth this year benefited from our acquisition and has come in below our original targets, but growing 13% on top of 30% growth year [ph] is still strong. Our 13% target does include the benefit of having 12 months of Health Services revenue in 2016 compared to 11 months in 2015, but that only equates to about 2% of the growth for the year, so our full-year growth target is still double digit even excluding the extra month.
While there are obviously many assumptions that go into projecting future revenue, we do feel positive about our ability to deliver good growth in 2016. A key element to our confidence in 2016 revenues are backlog, which has grown significantly this year due to our record bookings and the addition of Health Services business. This larger backlog translates into better visibility for 2016.
As we look at the rollout of backlog in 2016, we currently expect approximately 75% of our revenue to come from backlog, which is higher-than-historical levels. Another key assumption is we do believe the market opportunity remains strong, which Zane will discuss.
For earnings, we currently expect adjusted diluted earnings per share before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments between $2.30 and $2.40 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 13% growth over 2015 expected results. This range is below the current consensus estimate of $2.52, which was formed in the absence of company guidance. We believe the primary potential differences between our preliminary view and the consensus estimate may include higher noncash expenses and professional services contributions.
Regarding noncash expenses, our current estimates reflect an increase in depreciation and amortization of more than $75 million in 2016  which equates to nearly $0.15 of earnings per share. And we believe consensus estimates have less than this for noncash expense impact. The large increase in amortization is tied to a significant amount previously capitalized software expected to become generally available and a large increase in depreciation is related to recent increased levels of capital spending.
Relative to services contribution, while we expect strong growth in services revenue and earnings contributions next year, the growth will be coming off of the lower 2015 levels we have discussed. We do not intend to these comments to precisely reconcile our preliminary view to analyst estimates but more to provide our thoughts of potential differences.
In summary, realize it has been a challenging year relative to delivering against our revenue expectations. As I indicated, we believe revenue growth will be good next year and we have visibility to this growth, partially driven from the backlog that has benefited from what has been by far the best year of bookings in the history of our company. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane and talk about why our bookings are so strong."

Our bookings revenue in Q3 of $1.59 billion reflects strong growth of 44% over Q3 2014. Bookings this quarter included another all-time high level of large contracts with 45 contracts over $5 million, including 31 over $10 million. For long-term bookings, we did have 2 ITWorks contract, but the overall mix of long-term bookings was more in the normal range of 31%, which makes the strength of these bookings even more impressive because it wasn't driven by elevated levels of longer-term contracts.
Highlight of the quarter was we again signed a record number of new footprints, with 39% of our bookings coming from outside our core Millennium install base. So far this year, we have signed more new footprints measured by dollars and counter sites than any full year in our history. This success reflects our strong competitiveness and the continued large opportunity for competitive displacements. Our success this quarter and opportunities in our pipeline span many market segments, including IDNs, regional hospitals, children, community hospitals, state and federal, be a real health, ambulatory surgery centers and physician groups.
A particularly noteworthy area of success is large IDNs and in the investor on health systems. In addition to McLaren Health Care selecting Cerner for EHR Revenue Cycle and Population Health, which they announced last month, we also gained another large investor owned health system as a new client during the quarter. In addition, one of our existing investor owned clients chose to move forward with Cerner for an additional 24 sites. These are in addition to Baptist Health South Florida and the Department of Defense, which we talked about on our last call but occurred during the third quarter.
As I mentioned before, I believe a key element of our success is driven by our track record for delivering projects on time and on budget as well as creating measurable value, which aligns well with our clients focus on making ROI-based decisions. This ability to deliver value along with predictable cost and timelines and serves as a differentiator relative to our primary competitor. I believe their list of clients where the significant cost of deploying and maintaining our systems has been cited as a key reason for financial challenges is starting to impact them in the marketplace. This not only differentiates us from the sales process, it ahs also contributed in some of their existing clients switching to Cerner even after having spent 100-plus million dollar on their system.
We're also continuing to sign Health Services clients to migrate to Millennium, including both IDNs and small hospitals. Overall, we remain pleased with our progress with Health Services base with migrations continuing at a good pace.
Now I'd to highlight an important announcement we made during the Cerner Health Conference that represents a major milestone for our HealtheIntent platform. During Neal's keynote address, we announced that Geisinger Health System, a national model for high quality and high value health care decided to use our HealtheIntent Population Health platform to extend their data-driven population health capabilities. Cerner and Geisinger share a core belief that managing the health of population requires access to information outside its traditional healthcare domains, and we are excited to be a strategic part of Geisinger's ability to provide systems level insight to manage population health at scale. This relationship builds on proof of concept projects that started last year where Geisinger leverage HealtheIntent, our system-agnostic near real-time platform that normalizes data to aggregate clinical and financial data from its core EHR and other sources such as its insurance company. We believe this decision makes a clear statement to the market as Geisinger uses our primary competitor for their core EHR and as one of their longest duration and most significant clients. We believe this demonstrates that our capabilities cannot be equaled by a competitor and the HealtheIntent platform is the right platform to support Geisinger's quest for ongoing innovation. I also think this makes clear that our investments in interoperability and open platforms that enable client and third-party innovation are paying off. This a great example of why we believe Cerner's positioned to play a major road as healthcare continues to shift in a fee-for-service model to outcomes-based reimbursement model that incent in keeping people healthy.
Moving to our Revenue Cycle business, we had a good third quarter. We continue to have a high take rate of Revenue Cycle in our new EHR footprints which supports what we've been saying about the market looking to buy integrated systems. A key element of our success in Revenue Cycle has been the increasing number of proof points with our clients. One [indiscernible] example I'd like to share is something from a thank you note, client CFOs and as recently. In the note indicated that in the past year, they had decreased AR days 19%, increased average daily revenue 22% and reduced discharge not final bill days by 33%. These success stories are becoming more common and add to our momentum in the marketplace.
Moving to the ambulatory market where we had an all-time high level of bookings in Q3, surpassing our record we just set in the last quarter. The bookings were driven by success at displacing our key competitors both by expanding our solutions to the ambulatory venues of our acute-care clients and as part of new business footprints.
In the ambulatory business offer services, we had 2 displacements of a certain Cloud competitor. Our opportunity to displace this competitor resulted from their lack of execution, failure to meet the established objectives, rising cost after rates and realization by the client that they ended up needing similar or more staff even though they thought they had outsourced the function of our competitors because they have much of the harder work and complex work to the client.
We also had a strong quarter in the small hospital market and passed the 100 client milestone with our Cloud-based CommunityWorks offering. This quarter's success was again driven by combination of additional new footprints, extensions to our health system clients and Health Services migrations. We expect the CommunityWorks offering to exceed 125 clients by year-end.
In addition, CommunityWorks opened 2 new markets by completing multiple client diversions within stand-alone orthopedic surgical hospitals along with a multisite clinically integrated network in the state of Iowa. We believe there is good market opportunity for Cerner in the small hospital market and are very pleased of our competitiveness in this market.
Outside of the U.S., we had a solid Q3 with revenue growth of 32% and good bookings in Australia, United Kingdom and the Middle East. We continue to make progress with integrating the global components of Health Services, which is augmenting our global presence and positioning us for good long-term contributions from our Global business.
In summary, I'm very pleased with the success we are having in the marketplace and maintain a positive outlook because of our large pipeline, broad solution of services offering and strong competitive position.
With that, I'd like to open the call for questions."

Relative to license revenue, as we said, record bookings for license software in the quarter, we actually had record license revenue, very strong license revenue. However, it was lower than our projections, primarily because certain contracts have some provisions, especially as we started addressing the new markets for new clients who are coming off of a unsatisfactory relationship where they are looking to kind of hold the new supplier spit the fire a little bit. So we do have those contracts. They will have some payments tied to milestones. Traditionally, as we talked to y'all in the past, most of our payments for license software are date-based and don't impact revenue recognition at all. We have seen some payments being tied to milestones, which is very reasonable for clients to do that in this current environment. Those that tied into a milestone defers that revenue to the milestone occurring. So that revenue goes in the backlog and comes out at a future point in time as part of the project that's getting done. Good for the future, when you go into a quarter and don't see those provisions upfront as an expectation, but they are negotiated as we go forward, it does impact the amount of revenue we take in the initial quarter for particularly those new clients as we are seeing that."

Another key factor for '16 is that really in the last half of '15, particularly in Q3, we saw a strong increase in professional services implementation bookings. And we expect to see that in Q4. That strong increase in those specific bookings is beating the backlog, and those projects will be starting and underway in 2016. From a number of bodies times number of hours perspective, we hired over 200 people into this professional services organization during Q3. So we entered the Q2 [ph] with a larger workforce, which means we'll be able to go work additional hours, drive additional revenue from that backlog that's there. The 75% we referenced is coming -- 2016 revenue being driven from the backlog is the highest percent of revenue for a year that I've seen in my tenure here. Normally, I think reasonably it's kind of been in the low 70s. And all of that, out of this point, should be predictive work that we can drive with available headcount. We're not going to be in an HS mode of trying to decide should we hire, should we not hire. We are back into our mode of seeing the work, hiring the people, getting them back to speed. Unfortunately for us, in '15 the impact of that is going to be in '16."

This quarter, we actually delivered our services number, the number we have projected, we delivered that. The difference in the revenue from external projected from what we shared in our projections to what we delivered was really focused on 2 things, primarily license software from the Cerner side and from a lower-than-expected tech resale. We had a fairly significant -- couple of significant tech resale deals primarily related to third-party -- the resale of third-party software that we expected to happen in the quarter and they did not happen. One of those actually was changed to be sold by the manufacturer, we'll get some profitability out of that, but we won't get the revenue out of that. So that was the primary driver. On the license side for Cerner, why the license was less than we had projected even though it was strong and at record levels, we have projected even higher levels, those contracts from new clients, we had a few of those that were larger that included milestone-based payments. So the payments for the license are tied to milestones, we can't take the revenue for that license software until the milestone occurs. Relative to service businesses, we actually delivered the services number. That was the number we focused on internally and we actually delivered that. But for Q3, the difference was half at HS, half at the Cerner and on Cerner side it was license software and those 2 tech resale deals that didn't materialize."

And so I think if you kind of go map out the numbers, you'll end up with about the same operating margins next year, should be within 30, 40 basis points of kind of what we would end up with this year, which is somewhere around 24.5, somewhere in the 24.5 to 25 range would be my rough math for 2016. So we don't see a decrease. We do see because of the higher noncash spending challenging to grow above that. But I think, clearly, we're continuing to invest in the business and should be able to get to a level where we start getting some getting the leverage back in the business as those increases moderate."

We continue to have opportunities, certainly, on a combined HS and Cerner organization to drive out additional synergies on the spin side as well as the operating and revenue side.

We've invested heavily in R&D and those types of areas more recently, but I don't think you're going to see a lot of needed additional investment in those areas. You'll see us hiring people to go work on projects, drive revenue and you'll see us hiring for managed services which drives revenue, which drives revenue. So that's really what we're going to focus our dollars on. I think once you kind of get through a period of software turning on and ramping up some of the software amortization, we should get back to time when we you'll start seeing improvements in operating margins.

Obviously, you understand there's an element from the acquisition that impact that. But when you look at our bookings, you got the long-term component of them, which this quarter, even on a larger number trended down -- tends to be more normal like the 31% rather than the mid-30s that we've been seeing. That longer-term bookings don't have an immediate effect. They spread out over a period of time. They will help '16, but 1/10 of them helps '16. Relative to current quarters, the item we're talking about primarily was license component, and this is you're talking about $10 million or $15 million of license software when you're talking about that relative to the overall total revenue growth. So it's not a significant difference. A lot of these contracts have significant amount of professional services in them that rolls out over a period of time, sometimes multiyear period of time. They all have hosting element to them, which falls into our long-term bookings percentage. So really, the mix of the business is actually pretty much normalized in Q3. The big difference is even with strong license, based on that bigger number, we weren't -- we did not get much revenue from the current quarter as we would've expected that revenue falls forward. But I think from a growth perspective, if you look at 13% plus revenue growth in 2016 off of a number that grew 30% in 2015, we've got an extra $1 billion or so of revenue that we are growing on top of. We've always targeted growing double digits, especially after a year that was more challenging for us in '15. We're actually pretty feeling good about getting back to double-digit growth on a much higher base than we have had in the past. So we actually think this -- the growth in earnings and the growth in revenue being more aligned than normal is a matter of just not getting as much leverage in 2016 because of higher noncash expense. And I think that, as I said, moderates over time."

So even though people were post the technical ICD-10 go-live, there's still a good 6 months as people are going through and looking at making sure that they understand the impact of ICD-10. We look at what their needs are in the case their environment has changed. So I think that demand, as Zane said, I don't think flipping that switch is going to trigger a bunch of demand. I think it would be something you see starting to hit us in 2016."

But the vast majority, certainly 95% plus is related to Cerner and sale of our solutions and our services and our ITWorks and all of those things. So if you're really looking -- if you're trying to figure out, is this bookings increase reflective of Cerner's opportunities in the marketplace? It is almost entirely related to our opportunities.

Keep in mind this, George, this year we had significantly higher levels of long-term bookings, right. First 2 quarters were primarily -- were 35, 37, whatever the percent was, it was significantly higher relative to the bookings. Certainly, this quarter it's more like it's back into the 31% range, which is normal on a very much bigger number. There's -- a lot of these new contracts that are getting signed by new clients had a significant amount of services and other items that roll into the backlog. So I'm not sure that it's elongating the backlog because things like software and some to your point, if I day base payments, the software never really hits the backlog. It gets recognized part mostly in the quarter which is booked and that don't have any future impact. I am now getting for milestones, for some other contract terms, I am getting backlog that is coming in from license. Now it's more of a 2 to 3-year time frame, but it varies from day 1 to that. So from an elongated backlog, yes, it's slightly longer in some cases, but it's not materially different relative to the business. So understand that the large bookings number coming through feels like it should contribute more to '16. It does contribute more. I mean 75% of my revenue in '16 out of that backlog where in prior periods, it would've been closer to 70%. So I'm getting a significant -- I am getting more revenue coming through there. But it is -- the mix is similar except I have a lot more long-term this year than I've had in prior years.

So there is -- it isn't illogical that in the year following that significant amount of growth, particularly in the year I'm getting hit with these noncash expenses, that the growth might more track with revenue. I think, over time, we look to grow revenue double-digit. And then you would see us moving that earnings percentage growth up higher than our revenue growth. We will get leverage out way. The bigger the company we get, software companies we get more efficient on in our services businesses. As we roll to continue to rollout the model system, which is an effective way to go implement our software. As we look to go make very quick migrations of Siemens clients.

So we're not looking to go increase that significant amount. And I think we'll still see some of the impact to this milestone-based payments on contracts. It's going to have an impact on the timing of revenue recognition. So those are elements that as we look forward to the revenue coming out of Q4 that we expect it to be -- to probably be about $50 million lower probably from the midpoint as to what has previously been out there. Half of that is probably HS continuing to be lower than we projected, and the other half is basically Cerner professional services and some of our -- those Q3 elements rolling into Q4. So that's the primary difference you're going to see relative to the Q4 number. On the cash flow side, I think the -- we -- in Q4, we would expect we have some larger cash CapEx items related to buildings that will hit us in Q4. So we would expect to kind of end the year at about 475 -- 470,000 -- $470 million of total CapEx, including software CapEx. Next year, we probably have be a little bit of an uptick on that as we finish out our trails building. One of the key things in '15 is we are purchasing our data center building. We currently lease that and given that all of the data center activity that we have there, we want to own our future there. We don't want to be subject to the vagaries of the landlord, which has been a very good landlord to us, but we want to own of that facility.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I'll lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with results highlights and marketplace observations.

Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with results highlights and marketplace observations. Neal Patterson, our Chairman and CEO, will be available for Q&A. Now I'll turn to our results.
Similar to recent quarters, our great success in the marketplace is reflected in our record bookings, but we delivered revenues slightly below expectations. Today, we'll address the disconnect between our outstanding bookings in what remains a very strong marketplace and our near-term revenue shortfalls. While we are disappointed about delivering slightly lower-than-expected revenue, our bookings this year, coupled with our strong pipeline, sets us up for good revenue growth next year.
Our bookings revenue in Q3 was $1.59 billion, which is an all-time high and reflects 44% growth over Q3 of '14, including record amounts of new business activity. Our revenue backlog ended the quarter at $13.9 billion, which is up $10.2 billion -- from $10.2 billion a year ago and reflects the strong bookings in Q3 as well as the inclusion of backlog from Health Services.
Revenue in the quarter was $1.13 billion, which is up 34% over Q3 of '14 and includes approximately $250 million from Health Services. The total is about $20 million below the low end of our guidance range, with approximately half of the shortfall related to core Cerner and half attributable to Health Services.
On the Cerner side, the shortfall is much lower than previous quarters mainly because we appropriately adjusted our forecast for lower services revenue, which is the primary issue in prior quarters. This quarter, the lower-than-expected revenue is mostly a function of lower-than-usual levels of upfront software revenue on some of our larger contracts and technology resale being slightly below our expectations.
On the software portion, I'd like to note that we had an all-time high level of software bookings but a larger-than-normal portion of the contract was structured in a manner that resulted in revenue being spread over a longer period. This is obviously good for future periods, but did impact our current quarter revenue.
Relative to Health Services, the lower revenue was spread among a few areas, including software, technology resale and maintenance revenue and also reflects that we're continuing to fine tune our visibility in that space.
Another factor we have not discussed that has impacted revenue this year is foreign currency fluctuations. In Q3, revenue would have been $20 million higher if you held exchange rates consistent with those in Q3 of '14. While we have factored a portion of this into our guidance, it did have some impact beyond what we expected in Q3 and is also a contributor to the lower revenue for the year.
Now I'll quickly go through the total revenue composition for Q3. Total system sales revenue was $325 million, support and maintenance was $245 million, services was $539 million and reimbursed travel was $19 million.
System sales revenue reflects a 45% increase over Q3 of '14 with the growth mainly driven by an increase in subscriptions, which is where the addition of Health Services has had the biggest impact as well as growth in licensed software and tech resale.
Our software sales margin percent was 67.5%, which is up from 64.3% in Q2 due to sequential decline in technology resale. The margin percentage is down year-over-year mainly because Q3 '14 had a very low mix of tech resale that resulted in unusually high system sales margin percent.
Moving to services. Total services revenue, including professional and managed services was up 30% compared to Q3 of '14 mainly driven by the addition of Health Services as well as growth in core Cerner managed services.
Support and maintenance revenue increased 38% over Q3 of '14, reflecting growth in core support and maintenance and the addition of Health Services. 
Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 35% over the year-ago quarter to $998 million and Global revenue grew 32% to $130 million, both driven largely by the addition of Health Services.
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q3 was 83.1%, which is basically flat both year-over-year and sequentially.
Looking at operating spending. Our third quarter non-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude share-based compensation expense, voluntary separation plan expense and acquisition-related adjustments were $661 million, which is up 36% compared to adjusted Q3 '14 operating expenses. This growth was primarily driven by the addition of Health Services business.
The total year-over-year growth for each expense category on a non-GAAP basis was: 32% for sales and client service; 37% for software development; and 62% for G&A.
Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, which you recall is a new expense line we added in Q2, was basically flat. Note that similar to last quarter, this line is $25 million on our GAAP income statement and just $3 million in our non-GAAP results since we are excluding amortization related to Health Services.
Moving to operating margins. Similar to the past 2 quarters, we delivered basically in-line earnings on lower revenue, resulting in a higher operating margin percent than we projected at the beginning of the year. Our operating margin before share-based compensation expenses, voluntary separation expense and acquisition-related adjustments was 24.5% in Q3. This is down 90 basis points year-over-year due mostly to the very low tech resale in Q3 '14 and up 30 basis points from Q2 of '15.
Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q3 were $147 million, or $0.42 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $189 million and adjusted EPS was $0.54, which is up 29% compared to Q3 of '14. Adjusted net earnings exclude share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on GAAP earnings of $14 million or $0.04 per diluted share as well as a voluntary separation plan expense, which had a net impact on GAAP earnings of $2.5 million or $0.01 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings also reflect adjustments related to Cerner's acquisition of Health Services, including Health Services acquisition-related amortization, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $15 million and $0.04, respectively; other acquisition-related adjustments, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $4 million or $0.01, respectively; and the acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustment, which is not included in the GAAP net earnings but increased adjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $6 million and $0.02, respectively.
The Q3 tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 32%, which is slightly below our expected range of 33% to 34%.
Now I'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q3 with $766 million of total cash and investments, which is down from $857 million in Q2, primarily to the use of cash for our repurchase programs.
During the quarter, we finished the remaining $100 million of repurchases authorized in 2014 and purchased $100 million of the $245 million authorized in September of this year. In total, we repurchased 3.2 million shares at an average price of $61.91.
Moving to debt. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, is $631 million, which is basically flat compared to Q2.
Total receivables ended the quarter at $1.05 billion, which is up $50 million from Q2. Our Q3 DSO was 85 days compared to 81 days in Q2 and 67 days in the year-ago quarter. The higher DSO is primarily a function of the lower revenue in the quarter, and we are also still working through some delayed billings for Health Services clients as part of the transition. We do expect DSO improvement in Q4.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $272 million, up from $109 million in Q2. Q3 capital expenditures were $88 million, and capitalized software was $72 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $111 million for the quarter, driven by strong operating cash flow.
Now I'll go through Q4 and full-year 2016 guidance. For Q4, we expect revenue between $1.15 billion and $1.2 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 27% over Q4 of '14. Our Q4 revenue guidance combined with year-to-date results were slightly below the low end of previously provided full-year guidance, as we have factored in the lower results from Q3 and lower Q4 to reflect a similar run rate.
So far this year, favorable mix of revenue lower expenses and Health Services synergies have allowed us to deliver mostly in-line earnings despite our lower revenue. Looking at Q4, we do expect lower revenue to have some impact on earnings, mainly due to the continuing effect of lower services revenue and the impact of lower upfront software on some contracts.
We expect Q4 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation, voluntary separation plan expense and acquisition-related adjustments to be $0.56 to $0.58 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 21% growth over Q4 '14 adjusted EPS. This range is below consensus estimates and slightly below our original plan, but it does get us to the low end of our most recently provided full year guidance. Also the Q4 guidance combined with year-to-date results still reflects strong growth of 26% for the full year.
Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense is approximately $0.03 to $0.04 in Q4, which equates to $0.14 to $0.15 for the full year.
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q4 of $1.45 billion to $1.55 billion, with the midpoint reflecting strong growth of 29% over Q4 '14 and 31% growth for the full year.
Now I'd like to provide initial expectations for 2016. Note that these comments should be viewed as preliminary until we finalize our financial plan and provide more formal guidance when we report fourth quarter results.
We currently expect 2016 revenue to be over $5 billion, which equates to growth of at least 13% on top of what is projected to be approximately 30% growth in 2015. We realized that the growth this year benefited from our acquisition and has come in below our original targets, but growing 13% on top of 30% growth year is still strong. Our 13% target does include a benefit of having 12 months of Health Services revenue in 2016 compared to 11 months in 2015, but that only equates to about 2% of the growth for the year, so our full year growth target is still double digit, even excluding the extra month.
While there are obviously many assumptions that go into projecting future revenue, we do feel positive about our ability to deliver good growth in 2016. A key element to our confidence in 2016 revenues are backlog, which has grown significantly this year due to our record bookings and the addition of Health Services business. This larger backlog translates into better visibility for 2016.
As we look at the rollout of backlog in 2016, we currently expect approximately 75% of our revenue to come from backlog, which is higher-than-historical levels. Another key assumption is we do believe the market opportunity remains strong, which Zane will discuss.
For earnings, we currently expect adjusted diluted earnings per share before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments between $2.30 and $2.40 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 13% growth over 2015 expected results. This range is below the current consensus estimate of $2.52, which was formed in the absence of company guidance. We believe the primary potential differences between our preliminary view and the consensus estimate may include higher noncash expenses and professional services contributions.
Regarding noncash expenses, our current estimates reflect an increase in depreciation and amortization of more than $75 million in 2016, which equates to nearly $0.15 of earnings per share. And we believe consensus estimates have less than this for noncash expense impact. The large increase in amortization is tied to a significant amount previously capitalized software expected to become generally available and a large increase in depreciation is related to recent increased levels of capital spending.
Relative to services contribution, while we expect strong growth in services revenue and earnings contributions next year, the growth will be coming off of the lower 2015 levels we have discussed. We do not intend to these comments to precisely reconcile our preliminary view to analyst estimates, but more to provide our thoughts on potential differences.
In summary, we realize this has been a challenging year relative to delivering against our revenue expectations. As I indicated, we believe revenue growth will be good next year and we have visibility to this growth, partially driven from a backlog that has benefited from what has been by far the best year of bookings in the history of our company. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane who can talk about why our bookings are so strong."

Bookings this qu",1194,"Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. I'll start with our results.
Our bookings revenue in Q3 of $1.59 billion reflects strong growth of 44% over Q3 2014. Bookings this quarter included another all-time high level of large contracts with 45 contracts over $5 million, including 31 over $10 million. For long-term bookings, we did have 2 ITWorks contract, but the overall mix of long-term bookings was more in the normal range of 31%, which makes the strength of these bookings even more impressive because it wasn't driven by elevated levels of longer-term contracts.
A highlight of the quarter was that we again signed a record number of new footprints, with 39% of our bookings coming from outside our core Millennium install base. So far this year, we have signed more new footprints measured by dollars and counter sites than any full year in our history. This success reflects our strong competitiveness and the continued large opportunity for competitive displacements. Our success this quarter and opportunities in our pipeline span many market segments, including IDNs, regional hospitals, children, community hospitals, state and federal, behavioral health, ambulatory surgery centers and physician groups.
A particularly noteworthy area of success is large IDNs and investor-owned health systems. In addition to McLaren Health Care selecting Cerner for EHR Revenue Cycle and Population Health, which they announced last month, we also gained another large investor owned health system as a new client during the quarter. In addition, one of our existing investor owned clients chose to move forward with Cerner for an additional 24 sites. These are in addition to Baptist Health South Florida and the Department of Defense, which we talked about on our last call but occurred during the third quarter.
As I mentioned before, I believe a key element of our success is driven by our track record for delivering projects on time and on budget as well as creating measurable value, which aligns well with our clients focus on making ROI-based decisions. This ability to deliver value along with predictable cost and timelines serves as a differentiator relative to our primary competitor. I believe their list of clients, where the significant cost of deploying and maintaining our systems has been cited as a key reason for financial challenges, is starting to impact them in the marketplace. This not only differentiates us from the sales process, it has also contributed to some of their existing clients switching to Cerner even after having spent 100-plus million dollar on their system.
We're also continuing to sign Health Services clients to migrate to Millennium, including both IDNs and small hospitals. Overall, we remain pleased with our progress with Health Services base with migrations continuing at a good pace.
Now I'd to highlight an important announcement we made during the Cerner Health Conference that represents a major milestone for our HealtheIntent platform. During Neal's keynote address, we announced that Geisinger Health System, a national model for high quality and high value health care decided to use our HealtheIntent Population Health platform to extend their data-driven population health capabilities. Cerner and Geisinger share a core belief that managing the health of population requires access to information outside its traditional healthcare domains, and we are excited to be a strategic part of Geisinger's ability to provide systems level insight to manage population health at scale. This relationship builds on proof of concept projects that started last year, where Geisinger leveraged HealtheIntent, our system-agnostic near real-time platform that normalizes data to aggregate clinical and financial data from its core EHR and other sources such as its insurance company. We believe this decision makes a clear statement to the market, as Geisinger uses our primary competitor for their core EHR and as one of their longest duration and most significant clients. We believe this demonstrates that our capabilities cannot be equaled by a competitor and the HealtheIntent platform is the right platform to support Geisinger's quest for ongoing innovation. I also think this makes clear that our investments in interoperability and open platforms that enable client and third-party innovation are paying off. This is a great example of why we believe Cerner is positioned to play a major role, as healthcare continues to shift in a fee-for-service model to outcomes-based reimbursement model that incent in keeping people healthy.
Moving to our Revenue Cycle business, we had a good third quarter. We continue to have a high take rate of Revenue Cycle in our new EHR footprints which supports what we've been saying about the market looking to buy integrated systems. A key element of our success in Revenue Cycle has been the increasing number of proof points with our clients. One cook example I'd like to share is something from a thank you note, client CFOs sent us recently. In the note indicated that in the past year, they had decreased AR days 19%, increased average daily revenue 22% and reduced discharge not final bill days by 33%. These success stories are becoming more common and add to our momentum in the marketplace.
Moving to the ambulatory market where we had an all-time high level of bookings in Q3, surpassing our record we just set in the last quarter. The bookings were driven by success at displacing our key competitors, both by expanding our solutions to the ambulatory venues of our acute-care clients and as part of new business footprints.
In the ambulatory business office services, we had 2 displacements of a certain cloud competitor. Our opportunity to displace this competitor resulted from their lack of execution, failure to meet established objectives, rising cost after teaser rates and realization by the client that they ended up needing similar or more staff even though they thought they had outsourced the function to our competitor, because they left much of the harder work and complex work to the client.
We also had a strong quarter in the small hospital market and passed the 100 client milestone with our cloud-based CommunityWorks offering. This quarter's success was again driven by a combination of traditional new footprints, extensions through our health system clients and Health Services migrations. We expect the CommunityWorks offering to exceed 125 clients by year-end.
In addition, CommunityWorks opened 2 new markets by completing multiple client conversions within stand-alone orthopedic surgical hospitals along with a multisite clinically integrated network in the State of Iowa. We believe there is good market opportunity for Cerner in the small hospital market and are very pleased with our competitiveness in this market.
Outside of the U.S., we had a solid Q3 with revenue growth of 32% and good bookings in Australia, United Kingdom and the Middle East. We continue to make progress with integrating the global components of Health Services, which is augmenting our global presence and positioning us for good, long-term contributions from our Global business.
In summary, I'm very pleased with the success we are having in the marketplace and maintain a positive outlook because of our large pipeline, broad solution and services offering and strong competitive position.
With that, I'd like to open the call for questions."

The -- relative to license revenue, as we said, record bookings for licensed software in the quarter, we actually had record license revenue, very strong license revenue. However, it was lower than our projections, primarily because certain contracts have some provisions, especially as we started addressing the new market for new clients who are coming off of a unsatisfactory relationship where they are looking to kind of hold the new supplier feed the fire a little bit. So we do have those contracts. They will have some payments tied to milestones. Traditionally, as we've talked to you all in the past, most of our payments for license software are date-based and don't impact revenue recognition at all. We're now seeing some payments being tied to milestones, which is very reasonable for clients to do that in this current environment. Those that tie into a milestone defers that revenue to the milestone occurring. So that revenue goes in the backlog and comes out at a future point in time as part of the project that's getting done. Good for the future, but when you go into a quarter and don't see those provisions upfront as an expectation, but they are negotiated as we go forward, it does impact the amount of revenue we take in the initial quarter for particularly those new clients is what we're seeing there."

No. The key for 2016 when I'm looking at '16 is the amount of backlog we have and the fact that I am having things such as license software rolling out based on the projection of the projects as I do hours to be done. Another key factor for '16 is that really in the last half of '15, particularly in Q3, we saw a strong increase in professional services implementation bookings. And we expect to see that in Q4. That strong increase in those specific bookings is feeding the backlog, and those projects will be started and underway in 2016. From a number of bodies x number of hours perspective, we hired over 200 people into this professional services organization during Q3. So we entered the Q2 with a larger workforce, which means we'll be able to go work additional hours, drive additional revenue from that backlog that's there. The 75% we referenced is coming as 2016 revenue being driven from the backlog is the highest percent of revenue for a year that I've seen in my tenure here. Normally, I think recently it's kind of been in the low 70s. So -- and all of that, at this point, should be predictive work that we can drive with available headcount. We're not going to be in an HS mode of trying to decide should we hire, should we not hire. We are back into our mode of seeing the work, hiring the people, getting them up to speed. Unfortunately for us, in '15 the impact of that is going to be in '16."

This quarter, we actually delivered our services number, the number we have projected, we delivered that. The difference in the revenue from external projected from what we shared in our projections to what we delivered was really focused on 2 things, primarily license software from the Cerner side and from a lower-than-expected tech resale. We had a fairly significant -- couple of significant tech resale deals primarily related to third-party -- the resale of third-party software that we expected to happen in the quarter and they did not happen. One of those actually was changed to be sold by the manufacturer. We'll get some profitability out of that, but we won't get the revenue out of that. So that was the primary driver on the license side for Cerner, why the license was less than we had projected even though it was strong and at record levels, we had projected even higher levels. Those contracts from new clients, we had a few of those that were larger that included milestone-based payments. So the payments for the license are tied to milestones. We can't take the revenue for that license software until the milestone occurs. Relative to the service businesses, we actually delivered the services number. That was the number we focused on internally and we actually delivered that. But for Q3, the difference was half of it HS, half of it Cerner and on Cerner side, it was license software and those 2 tech resale deals that didn't materialize."

We clearly, because of lower revenue this year, have actually gotten almost back to our prior operating margin levels. Next year, it's really the impact of the noncash expenses. I mean, that's a $75 million to $80 million hit that is going to impact my operating margins. This is not a cash hit, but it is additional expense. And so I think when you -- if you kind of go math out the numbers, you'll end up with about the same operating margins next year, should be within 30, 40 basis points of kind of what we would end up with this year, which is somewhere around 24.5, so somewhere in the 24.5 to 25 range would be my rough math for 2016. So we don't see a decrease. We do see because of the higher noncash spending challenging to grow above that. But I think, clearly, we'll continue to invest in the business and should be able to get to a level where we start getting some more -- getting the leverage back in the business as those increases moderate."

But that doesn't really affect my revenue recognition because any at-risk payment doesn't get recognized until we actually receive the payment.

I don't think we're in a period where we would expect operating margins to kind of stay at the same level. We continue to have opportunities, certainly, on a combined HS and Cerner organization to drive out additional synergies on the spend side as well as the operating and the revenue side. I think that what you'll see us in 2016 kind of offsetting the impact of significantly higher noncash expense, we will add resources at Cerner as to the extent that they drive revenue, and that's kind of been our philosophy in many times -- many points in time. We've invested heavily in R&D in those types of areas more recently, but I don't think you're going to see a lot of needed additional investment in those areas. You'll see us hiring people to go work on projects, drive revenue out. You'll see us hiring people for managed services which drives revenue, some support organization which drives revenue. So that's really what we're going to focus our dollars on. I think once you kind of get through a period of software turning on and ramping up some of the software amortization, we should get back to a time when we can start -- you'll start seeing improvements in operating margins. There is no real change in the mix of the business. Software is still really strong, and that strength in software should logically get through some of this is noncash spending element.

It's just the expiration of certain maintenance. And in some cases, people just not renewing their maintenance contracts relative to the equipment that they had through Siemens.

And keep in mind, you've got -- in 2015, we are growing revenue 30%, we're growing earnings 26%. Obviously, you understand there's an element of -- from the acquisition that impact that. But when you look at our bookings, you've got the long-term component of them, which this quarter, even on a larger number, trended down -- or trended to be more normal like the 31% rather than the mid-30s that we've been seeing. That longer-term -- the longer-term bookings don't have an immediate effect. They've spread out over a period of time. They will help '16, but 1/10 of them helps '16. Relative to current quarters, the item we were talking about primarily was the license component, and this is -- you're talking about $10 million or $15 million of license software when you're talking about that relative to the overall total revenue growth. So it's not a significant difference. A lot of these contracts have a significant amount of professional services in them that rolls out over a period of time, sometimes a multiyear period of time. They all have a hosting element to them, which falls into our long-term bookings percentage. So really, the mix of the business is actually pretty much normalized in Q3. The big difference is even with strong license, based on that bigger number, we weren't -- we did not get as much revenue from the current quarter as we would have expected if that revenue falls as close forward. But I think from a growth perspective, if you look at 13% plus revenue growth in 2016 off of a number that grew 30% in 2015, we've got an extra $1 billion or so of revenue that we are growing on top of. We've always targeted growing double digits, especially after a year where that was more challenging for us in '15. We're actually pretty -- feeling good about getting back to double-digit growth on a much higher base than we have had in the past. So we actually think this -- the growth in earnings and the growth in revenue being more aligned than normal is a matter of just not getting as much leverage in 2016 because of higher noncash expense. And I think that, as I said, moderates over time."

Keep in mind this, George, this year, we had significantly higher levels of long-term bookings, right? The first 2 quarters were primarily -- were 35, 37, whatever the percent was, it was very -- significantly higher relative to the bookings. Certainly, this quarter, it's more like it's back into the 31% range, which is normal on a very -- a much bigger number. There's -- a lot of these new contracts that are getting signed by new clients have a significant amount of services and other items that roll into the backlog. So I'm not sure that it's elongating the backlog because things like software, and in sum, to your point, if I've day-based payments, the software really never hits the backlog. It gets recognized mostly in the quarter and which is booked and that don't have any future impact. I am now getting, for milestones, for some other contract terms, I am getting backlog that is coming in from license. Now it's more of a 2- to 3-year time frame, but it varies from day 1 to that. So if -- from an elongated backlog, yes, it's slightly longer in some cases, but it's not materially different relative to the business. So understand that the large bookings number coming through feels like it should contribute more to '16. It does contribute more. I'm getting 75% of my revenue in '16 out of that backlog, where in prior periods, it would have been closer to 70%. So I'm getting a significant -- I am getting more revenue coming through there. But it is -- the mix is similar except I have a lot more long-term this year than I've had in prior years. And that is going to -- that's all 10-year stuff that is going to basically add to the overall average number of years it takes to drive a backlog out."

We are a business that should have leverage. Keep in mind, we are growing off of the 2015 that we put in Siemens. And so certainly, that helped us. But now in '16, we're growing on top of that. So we're having to go grow revenue on top of the 30% revenue growth business. I have to grow earnings on top of the 26% earnings growth business. So there is -- it isn't illogical that in the year following that significant amount of growth, particularly in the year I'm getting hit with these noncash expenses, that the growth might more track with revenue. I think, over time, we would look to grow revenue double-digit. And then you would see us moving that earnings percentage growth up higher than our revenue growth. We will get leverage that way. The bigger a company we get, as the software companies, we get more efficient on in our services businesses. And as we roll -- continue to roll out the model system, which is an effective way to go implement our software, as we look to go make very quick migrations of Siemens clients, I think there's a lot of opportunities for us to certainly get efficiency in the business. So yes, I wouldn't -- I'm not calling this the new normal. There's upside to our growth percentages."

We have probably expected Q4 to grow a little bit from that number. I think our current projections, based on the timing of hiring new people and based on the work, is that Q4 would be relatively flat on the services side to Q3. So we're not looking to go increase that a significant amount. And I think we'll still see some of the impact to this milestone-based payments on contracts. It's going to have an impact on the timing of revenue recognition. So those are elements that as we look forward to the revenue coming out of Q4, that we expect it to be -- to probably be about $50 million lower probably from the midpoint as to what had previously been out there. Half of that is probably is HS continuing to be lower than we projected, and the other half is basically Cerner professional services and some of our -- of those Q3 elements rolling into Q4. So that's the primary difference you're going to see relative to the Q4 number. On the cash flow side, I think the -- we've -- in Q4, we would expect we have some larger cash -- CapEx items related to buildings that will hit us in Q4. So we would expect to kind of end the year at about, I think, $475,000, $470,000 -- $470 million of total CapEx, including software CapEx. Next year, we probably have -- there will be a little bit of an uptick on that as we finish out our Trails building. And one of the key things in '15 is we are purchasing our Lee Summit  data center building. We currently leased that, and given all of the data center activity that we have there, we want to own our future there. We don't want to be subject to the vagaries of a landlord, which has been a very good landlord to us, but we want to own that facility.

It's not going to be a really perfectly straight path, but where we're situated between health care and IT, I think, gives us a lot of opportunities. We're investing $700 million a year in R&D to address those opportunities. And I think that level of investment, especially when you look at it in the context of other people trying to buy things that they're going to put together, is impressive and will generate a long-term benefit and advantage for us. Many of you had a chance to attend our health care conference, where we had 14,000 attendees focused on solving major issues in health care. It's hard to come out of that conference not being energized with a belief that we are on the right track. We're actually now just getting to some of the fun stuff with the base level of digitization in health care, using data, predictive analytics. We think this can have a real disruptive impact on quality and outcomes and payment models, and we expect to be right in the middle of that disruption.

Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with results highlights and marketplace observations. Neal Patterson, our Chairman and CEO, will be available for Q&A. Now I'll turn to our results.
Similar to recent quarters, our great success in the marketplace is reflected in our record bookings, but we delivered revenues slightly below expectations. Today, we'll address the disconnect between our outstanding bookings in what remains a very strong marketplace and our near-term revenue shortfalls. While we are disappointed about delivering slightly lower-than-expected revenue, our bookings this year, coupled with our strong pipeline, sets us up for good revenue growth next year.
Our bookings revenue in Q3 was $1.59 billion, which is an all-time high and reflects 44% growth over Q3 of '14, including record amounts of new business activity. Our revenue backlog ended the quarter at $13.9 billion, which is up $10.2 billion -- from $10.2 billion a year ago and reflects the strong bookings in Q3 as well as the inclusion of backlog from Health Services.
Revenue in the quarter was $1.13 billion, which is up 34% over Q3 of '14 and includes approximately $250 million from Health Services. The total is about $20 million below the low end of our guidance range, with approximately half of the shortfall related to core Cerner and half attributable to Health Services.
On the Cerner side, the shortfall is much lower than previous quarters mainly because we appropriately adjusted our forecast for lower services revenue, which is the primary issue in prior quarters. This quarter, the lower-than-expected revenue is mostly a function of lower-than-usual levels of upfront software revenue on some of our larger contracts and technology resale being slightly below our expectations.
On the software portion, I'd like to note that we had an all-time high level of software bookings but a larger-than-normal portion of the contracts was structured in a manner that resulted in revenue being spread over a longer period. This is obviously good for future periods, but did impact our current quarter revenue.
Relative to Health Services, the lower revenue was spread among a few areas, including software, technology resale and maintenance revenue and also reflects that we're continuing to fine tune our visibility in that space.
Another factor we have not discussed that has impacted revenue this year is foreign currency fluctuations. In Q3, revenue would have been $20 million higher if you held exchange rates consistent with those in Q3 of '14. While we have factored a portion of this into our guidance, it did have some impact beyond what we expected in Q3 and is also a contributor to the lower revenue for the year.
Now I'll quickly go through the total revenue composition for Q3. Total system sales revenue was $325 million, support and maintenance was $245 million, services was $539 million and reimbursed travel was $19 million.
System sales revenue reflects a 45% increase over Q3 of '14 with the growth mainly driven by an increase in subscriptions, which is where the addition of Health Services has had the biggest impact as well as growth in licensed software and tech resale.
Our software sales margin percent was 67.5%, which is up from 64.3% in Q2 due to sequential decline in technology resale. The margin percentage is down year-over-year mainly because Q3 '14 had a very low mix of tech resale that resulted in an unusually high system sales margin percent.
Moving to services. Total services revenue, including professional and managed services was up 30% compared to Q3 of '14 mainly driven by the addition of Health Services as well as growth in core Cerner managed services.
Support and maintenance revenue increased 38% over Q3 of '14, reflecting growth in core support and maintenance and the addition of Health Services. 
Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue increased 35% over the year-ago quarter to $998 million and Global revenue grew 32% to $130 million, both driven largely by the addition of Health Services.
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q3 was 83.1%, which is basically flat both year-over-year and sequentially.
Looking at operating spending. Our third quarter non-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude share-based compensation expense, voluntary separation plan expense and acquisition-related adjustments were $661 million, which is up 36% compared to adjusted Q3 '14 operating expenses. This growth was primarily driven by the addition of Health Services business.
The total year-over-year growth for each expense category on a non-GAAP basis was: 32% for sales and client service; 37% for software development; and 62% for G&A.
Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, which you recall is a new expense line we added in Q2, was basically flat. Note that similar to last quarter, this line is $25 million on our GAAP income statement and just $3 million in our non-GAAP results since we are excluding amortization related to Health Services.
Moving to operating margins. Similar to the past 2 quarters, we delivered basically in-line earnings on lower revenue, resulting in a higher operating margin percent than we projected at the beginning of the year. Our operating margin before share-based compensation expenses, voluntary separation expense and acquisition-related adjustments was 24.5% in Q3. This is down 90 basis points year-over-year due mostly to the very low tech resale in Q3 '14 and up 30 basis points from Q2 of '15.
Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q3 were $147 million, or $0.42 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $189 million and adjusted EPS was $0.54, which is up 29% compared to Q3 of '14. Adjusted net earnings exclude share-based compensation expense, which had a net impact on GAAP earnings of $14 million or $0.04 per diluted share as well as a voluntary separation plan expense, which had a net impact on GAAP earnings of $2.5 million or $0.01 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings also reflect adjustments related to Cerner's acquisition of Health Services, including Health Services acquisition-related amortization, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $15 million and $0.04, respectively; other acquisition-related adjustments, which reduced GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $4 million or $0.01, respectively; and the acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustment, which is not included in the GAAP net earnings but increased adjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $6 million and $0.02, respectively.
The Q3 tax rate for adjusted net earnings was 32%, which is slightly below our expected range of 33% to 34%.
Now I'll move to our balance sheet. We ended Q3 with $766 million of total cash and investments, which is down from $857 million in Q2, primarily due to the use of cash for our repurchase programs.
During the quarter, we finished the remaining $100 million of repurchases authorized in 2014 and purchased $100 million of the $245 million authorized in September of this year. In total, we repurchased 3.2 million shares at an average price of $61.91.
Moving to debt. Our total debt, including capital lease obligations, is $631 million, which is basically flat compared to Q2.
Total receivables ended the quarter at $1.05 billion, which is up $50 million from Q2. Our Q3 DSO was 85 days compared to 81 days in Q2 and 67 days in the year-ago quarter. The higher DSO is primarily a function of the lower revenue in the quarter, and we are also still working through some delayed billings for Health Services clients as part of the transition. We do expect DSO improvement in Q4.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $272 million, up from $109 million in Q2. Q3 capital expenditures were $88 million, and capitalized software was $72 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $111 million for the quarter, driven by strong operating cash flow.
Now I'll go through Q4 and full-year 2016 guidance. For Q4, we expect revenue between $1.15 billion and $1.2 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 27% over Q4 of '14. Our Q4 revenue guidance combined with year-to-date results were slightly below the low end of previously provided full-year guidance, as we have factored in the lower results from Q3 and lower Q4 to reflect a similar run rate.
So far this year, favorable mix of revenue, lower expenses and Health Services synergies have allowed us to deliver mostly in-line earnings despite our lower revenue. Looking at Q4, we do expect the lower revenue to have some impact on earnings, mainly due to the continuing effect of lower services revenue and the impact of lower upfront software on some contracts.
We expect Q4 adjusted EPS before share-based compensation, voluntary separation plan expense and acquisition-related adjustments, to be $0.56 to $0.58 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 21% growth over Q4 '14 adjusted EPS. This range is below consensus estimates and slightly below our original plan, but it does get us to the low end of our most recently provided full year guidance. Also, the Q4 guidance combined with year-to-date results still reflects strong growth of 26% for the full year.
Our estimate for the impact of share-based compensation expense is approximately $0.03 to $0.04 in Q4, which equates to $0.14 to $0.15 for the full year.
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q4 of $1.45 billion to $1.55 billion, with the midpoint reflecting strong growth of 29% over Q4 '14 and 31% growth for the full year.
Now I'd like to provide initial expectations for 2016. Note that these comments should be viewed as preliminary until we finalize our financial plan and provide more formal guidance when we report fourth quarter results.
We currently expect 2016 revenue to be over $5 billion, which equates to growth of at least 13% on top of what is projected to be approximately 30% growth in 2015. We realized that the growth this year benefited from our acquisition and has come in below our original targets, but growing 13% on top of 30% growth, year is still strong. Our 13% target does include a benefit of having 12 months of Health Services revenue in 2016 compared to 11 months in 2015, but that only equates to about 2% of the growth for the year, so our full year growth target is still double digit, even excluding the extra month.
While there are obviously many assumptions that go into projecting future revenue, we do feel positive about our ability to deliver good growth in 2016. A key element to our confidence in 2016 revenues are backlog, which has grown significantly this year due to our record bookings and the addition of Health Services business. This larger backlog translates into better visibility for 2016.
As we look at the rollout of backlog in 2016, we currently expect approximately 75% of our revenue to come from backlog, which is higher-than-historical levels. Another key assumption is we do believe the market opportunity remains strong, which Zane will discuss.
For earnings, we currently expect adjusted diluted earnings per share before share-based compensation and acquisition-related adjustments between $2.30 and $2.40 per share, with the midpoint reflecting 13% growth over 2015 expected results. This range is below the current consensus estimate of $2.52, which was formed in the absence of company guidance. We believe the primary potential differences between our preliminary view and the consensus estimate may include higher noncash expenses and professional services contributions.
Regarding noncash expenses, our current estimates reflect an increase in depreciation and amortization of more than $75 million in 2016, which equates to nearly $0.15 of earnings per share. And we believe consensus estimates have less than this for noncash expense impact. The large increase in amortization is tied to a significant amount previously capitalized software expected to become generally available and a large increase in depreciation is related to recent increased levels of capital spending.
Relative to services contribution, while we expect strong growth in services revenue and earnings contributions next year, the growth will be coming off of the lower 2015 levels we have discussed. We do not intend for these comments to precisely reconcile our preliminary view to analyst estimates, but more to provide our thoughts on potential differences.
In summary, we realize this has been a challenging year relative to delivering against our revenue expectations. As I indicated, we believe revenue growth will be good next year and we have visibility to this growth, partially driven from a backlog that has benefited from what has been by far the best year of bookings in the history of our company. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Zane who can talk about why our bookings are so strong."

Bookings this qu",1195,"Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. I'll start with our results.
Our bookings revenue in Q3 of $1.59 billion reflects strong growth of 44% over Q3 2014. Bookings this quarter included another all-time high level of large contracts with 45 contracts over $5 million, including 31 over $10 million. For long-term bookings, we did have 2 ITWorks contracts, but the overall mix of long-term bookings was more in the normal range of 31%, which makes the strength of these bookings even more impressive because it wasn't driven by elevated levels of longer-term contracts.
A highlight of the quarter was that we again signed a record number of new footprints, with 39% of our bookings coming from outside our core Millennium install base. So far this year, we have signed more new footprints measured by dollars and counter sites than any full year in our history. This success reflects our strong competitiveness and the continued large opportunity for competitive displacements. Our success this quarter and the opportunities in our pipeline span many market segments, including IDNs, regional hospitals, children and community hospitals, state and federal, behavioral health, ambulatory surgery centers and physician groups.
A particularly noteworthy area of success is large IDNs and investor-owned health systems. In addition to McLaren Health Care selecting Cerner for EHR Revenue Cycle and Population Health, which they announced last month, we also gained another large investor owned health system as a new client during the quarter. In addition, one of our existing investor owned clients chose to move forward with Cerner for an additional 24 sites. These are in addition to Baptist Health South Florida and the Department of Defense, which we talked about on our last call but occurred during the third quarter.
As I mentioned before, I believe a key element of our success is driven by our track record for delivering projects on time and on budget as well as creating measurable value, which aligns well with our clients focus on making ROI-based decisions. This ability to deliver value along with predictable cost and timelines serves as a differentiator relative to our primary competitor. I believe their list of clients, where the significant cost of deploying and maintaining our systems has been cited as a key reason for financial challenges, is starting to impact them in the marketplace. This not only differentiates us from the sales process, it has also contributed to some of their existing clients switching to Cerner even after having spent $100-plus million on their system.
We're also continuing to sign Health Services clients to migrate to Millennium, including both IDNs and small hospitals. Overall, we remain pleased with our progress with Health Services base with migrations continuing at a good pace.
Now I'd to highlight an important announcement we made during the Cerner Health Conference that represents a major milestone for our HealtheIntent platform. During Neal's keynote address, we announced that Geisinger Health System, a national model for high quality and high value health care decided to use our HealtheIntent Population Health platform to extend their data-driven population health capabilities. Cerner and Geisinger share a core belief that managing the health of population requires access to information outside traditional healthcare domains, and we are excited to be a strategic part of Geisinger's ability to provide systems level insight to manage population health at scale. This relationship builds on proof of concept projects that started last year, where Geisinger leveraged HealtheIntent, our system-agnostic near real-time platform that normalizes data to aggregate clinical and financial data from its core EHR and other sources such as its insurance company. We believe this decision makes a clear statement to the market, as Geisinger uses our primary competitor for their core EHR and as one of their longest duration and most significant clients. We believe this demonstrates that our capabilities cannot be equaled by a competitor and the HealtheIntent platform is the right platform to support Geisinger's quest for ongoing innovation. I also think this makes clear that our investments in interoperability and open platforms that enable client third-party innovation are paying off. This is a great example of why we believe Cerner is positioned to play a major role, as healthcare continues to shift from a fee-for-service model to outcomes-based reimbursement models that incent in keeping people healthy.
Moving to our Revenue Cycle business, we had a good third quarter. We continue to have a high take rate of Revenue Cycle in our new EHR footprints which supports what we've been saying about the market looking to buy integrated systems. A key element of our success in Revenue Cycle has been the increasing number of proof points with our clients. One cook example I'd like to share is something from a thank you note, a client CFO sent us recently. In the note, he indicated that in the past year, they had decreased AR days 19%, increased average daily revenue 22% and reduced discharged not final bill days by 33%. These success stories are becoming more common and add to our momentum in the marketplace.
Moving to the ambulatory market where we had an all-time high level of bookings in Q3, surpassing our record we just set in the last quarter. The bookings were driven by success at displacing our key competitors, both by expanding our solutions to the ambulatory venues of our acute-care clients and as part of new business footprints.
In the ambulatory business office services, we had 2 displacements of a certain cloud competitor. Our opportunity to displace this competitor resulted from their lack of execution, failure to meet established objectives, rising cost after teaser rates and realization by the client that they ended up needing similar or more staff even though they thought they had outsourced the function to our competitor, because they left much of the harder work and complex work to the client.
We also had a strong quarter in the small hospital market and passed the 100 client milestone with our cloud-based CommunityWorks offering. This quarter's success was again driven by a combination of traditional new footprints, extensions through our health system clients and Health Services migrations. We expect the CommunityWorks offering to exceed 125 clients by year-end.
In addition, CommunityWorks opened 2 new markets by completing multiple client conversions within stand-alone orthopedic surgical hospitals along with a multisite clinically integrated network in the State of Iowa. We believe there is good market opportunity for Cerner in the small hospital market and are very pleased with our competitiveness in this market.
Outside of the U.S., we had a solid Q3 with revenue growth of 32% and good bookings in Australia, United Kingdom and the Middle East. We continue to make progress with integrating the global components of Health Services, which is augmenting our global presence and positioning us for good, long-term contributions from our Global business.
In summary, I'm very pleased with the success we are having in the marketplace and maintain a positive outlook because of our large pipeline, broad solution and services offering and strong competitive position.
With that, I'd like to open the call for questions."

The -- relative to license revenue, as we said, record bookings for licensed software in the quarter, we actually had record license revenue, very strong license revenue. However, it was lower than our projections, primarily because certain contracts have some provisions, especially as we started addressing the new market for new clients who are coming off of a unsatisfactory relationship where they are looking to kind of hold the new supplier's feet to the fire a little bit. So we do have those contracts that will have some payments tied to milestones. Traditionally, as we've talked to you all in the past, most of our payments for license software are date-based and don't impact revenue recognition at all. We're now seeing some payments being tied to milestones, which is very reasonable for clients to do that in this current environment. Those that tie into a milestone defers that revenue to the milestone occurring. So that revenue goes in the backlog and comes out at a future point in time as part of the project is getting done. Good for the future, but when you go into a quarter and don't see those provisions upfront as an expectation, but they are negotiated as we go forward, it does impact the amount of revenue we take in the initial quarter for particularly those new clients, is what we're seeing there."

No. The key for 2016 when I'm looking at '16 is the amount of backlog we have and the fact that I am having things such as license software rolling out based on a projection of the projects as I do hours to be done. Another key factor for '16 is that really in the last half of '15, particularly in Q3, we saw a strong increase in professional services implementation bookings. And we expect to see that in Q4. That strong increase in those specific bookings is feeding the backlog, and those projects will be started and underway in 2016. Just from a number of bodies x number of hours perspective, we hired over 200 people into this professional services organization during Q3. So we entered the Q2 with a larger workforce, which means we'll be able to go work additional hours, drive additional revenue from that backlog that's there. The 75% we referenced is coming as 2016 revenue being driven from the backlog is the highest percent of revenue for a year that I've seen in my tenure here. Normally, I think recently it's kind of been in the low 70s. So -- and all of that, at this point, should be predictive work that we can drive with available headcount. We're not going to be in an HS mode of trying to decide should we hire, should we not hire. We are back into our mode of seeing the work, hiring the people, getting them up to speed. Unfortunately for us in '15, the impact of that is going to be in '16."

This quarter, we actually delivered our services number, the number we have projected, we delivered that. The difference in the revenue from external projected -- from what we shared in our projections to what we delivered, was really focused on 2 things, primarily license software from the Cerner side and from a lower-than-expected tech resale. We had a fairly significant -- couple of significant tech resale deals primarily related to third-party -- the resale of third-party software that we expected to happen in the quarter and they did not happen. One of those actually was changed to be sold by the manufacturer. We'll get some profitability out of that, but we won't get the revenue out of that. So that was the primary driver on the license side for Cerner, why the license was less than we had projected even though it was strong and at record levels, we had projected even higher levels. Those contracts from new clients, we had a few of those that were larger, that included milestone-based payments. So the payments for the license are tied to milestones. We can't take the revenue for that license software until the milestone occurs. Relative to the service businesses, we actually delivered the services number. That was the number we focused on internally and we actually delivered that. But for Q3, the difference was half of it HS, half of it Cerner and on the Cerner side, it was license software and those 2 tech resale deals that didn't materialize."

And to get to the earnings, I think we -- with HS expected not to grow quite as much on the operating margin side, we clearly, because of lower revenue this year, have actually gotten almost back to our prior operating margin levels. Next year, it's really the impact of the noncash expenses. I mean, that's a $75 million to $80 million hit that is going to impact my operating margins. This is not a cash hit, but it is additional expense. And so I think when you -- if you kind of go math out the numbers, you'll end up with about the same operating margins next year, should be within 30, 40 basis points of kind of what we would end up with this year, which is somewhere around 24.5, so somewhere in the 24.5 to 25 range would be my rough math for 2016. So we don't see a decrease. We do see because of the higher noncash spending, challenging to grow above that. But I think, clearly, we'll continue to invest in business and should be able to get to a level where we start getting some more -- getting the leverage back into the business as those increases moderate."

You'll see us hiring people to go work on projects, drive revenue out. You'll see us hire people for managed services which drives revenue, some support organization which drives revenue. So that's really what we're going to focus our dollars on. I think once you kind of get through a period of software turning on and ramping up some of the software amortization, we should get back to a time when we can start -- you'll start seeing improvements in operating margins. There is no real change in the mix of the business. Software is still really strong, and that strength in software should logically get through some of this noncash spending element. You should actually get to a point where operating margins can increase."

The HS was really not related to selling more Siemens software because we aren't expecting to sell a lot of additional Siemens software. Specifically, migrations are doing well.

Those are dependent on that client having certain equipment or keeping that maintenance contract with Siemens, but didn't reflect really a major change. It's just the expiration of certain maintenance. And in some cases, people just not renewing their maintenance contracts relative to the equipment that they had through Siemens. The rest of it was just kind of spread throughout the piece of the organization, but nothing that was reflecting a trend relative to their selling more of their Siemens software, which we didn't expect and they didn't do or migrations which are going well and once again fall into a bucket that is not necessarily -- we can't necessarily attribute it to Siemens since we're selling the revenue.

Obviously, you understand there's an element of -- from the acquisition that impacts that. But when you look at our bookings, you've got the long-term component of them, which this quarter, even on a larger number, trended down -- or trended to be more normal like the 31% rather than the mid-30s that we've been seeing. That longer-term -- the longer-term bookings don't have an immediate effect. They've spread out over a period of time. They will help '16, but 1/10 of them helps '16. Relative to current quarters, the item we were talking about primarily was the license component, and this is -- you're talking about $10 million or $15 million of license software when you're talking about that relative to the overall total revenue growth. So it's not a significant difference. A lot of these contracts have a significant amount of professional services in them that rolls out over a period of time, sometimes multiyear period of time. They all have a hosting element to them, which falls into our long-term bookings percentage. So really, the mix of the business is actually pretty much normalized in Q3. The big difference is even with strong license, based on that bigger number, we weren't -- we did not get as much revenue from the current quarter as we would have expected if that revenue falls as close forward. But I think from a growth perspective, if you look at 13% plus revenue growth in 2016 off of a number that grew 30% in 2015, we've got an extra $1 billion or so of revenue that we are growing on top of. We've always targeted growing double digits, especially after a year where that was more challenging for us in '15. We're actually pretty -- feeling good about getting back to double-digit growth on a much higher base than we have had in the past. So we actually think this -- the growth in earnings and the growth in revenue being more aligned than normal is a matter of just not getting as much leverage in 2016 because of higher noncash expense. And I think that, as I said, moderates over time."

Keep in mind this, George, this year, we had significantly higher levels of long-term bookings, right? The first 2 quarters were primarily -- were 35, 37, whatever the percent was, it was very -- significantly higher relative to the bookings. Certainly, this quarter, it's more like it's back into the 31% range, which is normal on a very -- a much bigger number. There's -- a lot of these new contracts that are getting signed by new clients have a significant amount of services and other items that roll into the backlog. So I'm not sure that it's elongating the backlog because things like software, and in sum, to your point, if I've day-based payments, the software really never hits the backlog. It gets recognized mostly in the quarter in which it's booked and I don't have any future impact. I am now getting, for milestones, for some other contract terms, I am getting backlog that is coming in from license. Now it's more of a 2- to 3-year time frame, but it varies from day 1 to that. So if -- from an elongated backlog, yes, it's slightly longer in some cases, but it's not materially different relative to the business. So understand that the large bookings number coming through feels like it should contribute more to '16. It does contribute more. I'm getting 75% of my revenue in '16 out of that backlog, where in prior periods, it would have been closer to 70%. So I'm getting a significant -- I am getting more revenue coming through there. But it is -- the mix is similar except I have a lot more long-term this year than I've had in prior years.

So there is -- it isn't illogical that in the year following that significant amount of growth, particularly in the year I'm getting hit with these noncash expenses, that the growth might more track with revenue. I think, over time, we would look to grow revenue double-digit. And then you would see us moving that earnings percentage growth up higher than our revenue growth. We will get leverage that way.

But I think that's the -- keep in mind, that most of the growth this year was pretty much organic. It wasn't impacted a lot by HS on the bookings side. Certainly, on their earnings and revenue side, it was impacted. But on the bookings side, it wasn't. So we grew 30% relatively organically on the bookings side. We see a very active marketplace. So that's -- our goal is to grow on top of that 30% uptick in bookings we saw in 2015."

I think what you're seeing is we had a large number of big systems making purchases. So we talked about our competitiveness in the IDN marketplace and the investor-owned marketplace and so just some pure very large new business and current clients that are out procuring solutions to standardize their businesses as they move forward on a standard platform and using Cerner to help drive cost down and leverage, create leverage for their organizations. And I think some of those larger contracts are all about actually creating leverage in their organization, so whether it's ITWorks-type situations where our clients are utilizing our scale to help drive costs appropriately on their side and prepare for the future elements. So I think some of those larger elements are reflective of a broad base to the business because we hit on pretty much every large contract in that space, big IDNs, investor-owned or ITWorks businesses, our regional and community hospital marketplace, they're going to drive significant large upfront bookings. So I think it's a combination of things, and it's really about our clients are preparing for the future of health care. And that's what we're helping to provide them to help drive their cost down and to improve their quality of care."

We have probably expected Q4 to grow a little bit from that number. I think our current projections, based on the timing of hiring new people and based on the work, is that Q4 would be relatively flat on the services side to Q3. So we're not looking to go increase that a significant amount. And I think we'll still see some of the impact to this milestone-based payments on contracts. It's going to have an impact on the timing of revenue recognition. So those are elements that as we look forward to the revenue coming out of Q4, that we expect it to be -- to probably be about $50 million lower probably from the midpoint as to what had previously been out there. Half of that is probably is HS continuing to be lower than we projected, and the other half is basically Cerner professional services and some of our -- of those Q3 elements rolling into Q4. So that's the primary difference you're going to see relative to the Q4 number. On the cash flow side, I think the -- we've -- in Q4, we would expect we have some larger cash -- CapEx items related to buildings that will hit us in Q4. So we would expect to kind of end the year at about, I think, $475,000, $470,000 -- $470 million of total CapEx, including software CapEx. Next year, we probably have -- there will be a little bit of an uptick on that as we finish out our Trails building. And one of the key things in '15 is we are purchasing our Lee Summit data center building. We currently lease that, and given all of the data center activity that we have there, we want to own our future there. We don't want to be subject to the vagaries of a landlord, which has been a very good landlord to us, but we want to own that facility. So I think we've got -- as you look at this year, we end up with about $405 million of CapEx, about $275 million of software CapEx, and those probably increment up a little bit as we go into 2016."

Well, with that, I'd like to close -- like to maybe just step back a little bit to kind of provide a little perspective. We certainly understand our accountability to deliver against all our metrics, but Zane's commentary around our bookings and our current position in the marketplace gives us confidence regarding our success in that marketplace. We've been at this a very long time and one thing we've always been driven by is to kind of deliver it on the bigger vision. We're focused on long-term value, but also been pretty good about delivering against near-term expectations. I think we're incredibly well-positioned to become a large company. It's not going to be a really perfectly straight path, but where we're situated between health care and IT, I think, gives us a lot of opportunities. We're investing $700 million a year in R&D to address those opportunities. And I think that level of investment, especially when you look at it in the context of other people trying to buy things that they're going to put together, is impressive and will generate a long-term benefit and advantage for us. Many of you had a chance to attend our health care conference, where we had 14,000 attendees focused on solving major issues in health care. It's hard to come out of that conference not being energized with a belief that we are on the right track. We're actually now just getting to some of the fun stuff with the base level of digitization in health care, using data, predictive analytics. We think this can have a real disruptive impact on quality and outcomes and payment models, and we expect to be right in the middle of that disruption. What we do is hard and it's complex, but we think we're well positioned and certainly, I wouldn't trade our position for anybody else's. Thanks for listening, and have a good evening."
