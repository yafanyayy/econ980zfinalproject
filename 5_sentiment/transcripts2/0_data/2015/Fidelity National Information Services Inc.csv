Thank you for joining us on today's call. Turning to Slide 6, 2014 proved to be another very strong year.

Turning to Slide 6, 2014 proved to be another very strong year. We drove consistent execution, continued to deliver on our financial commitments to our shareholders and achieved our full year growth outlook. We finished the year with record revenue of $6.4 billion, reflecting 6% year-over-year growth. We drove adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $3.10, growing our earnings per share by 10% year-over-year. We generated free cash flow of $864 million. 
In the fourth quarter, our results are equally as strong. Revenue increased 7%, EBITDA increased 9%, margins expanded 30 basis points and adjusted earnings per share increased 16% over the prior-year period. We finished the year on a strong footing with continued sales success across all markets, a robust pipeline and good visibility heading into 2015. 
Turning to Slide 7. Consistent with our growth strategy, we are using our significant cash flow to drive value for our clients and our shareholders. First, we continued to invest for growth in our operations that target global financial institutions as well as strategic solution-oriented acquisitions, including Clear2Pay, Reliance Trust and CMSI, all of which strengthened our payments well and lending capabilities, respectively. Second, we maintained our strong balance sheet ending the year with leverage of 2.6x debt-to-EBITDA, which reflects complete deleveraging of our investment in Clear2Pay during the fourth quarter. Our continued financial discipline was recognized by upgrades from both Fitch and Standard & Poor's during 2014.
Third, we continued to deliver strong value to our investors, returning $750 million to our shareholders in 2014 through $475 million of stock repurchases and $275 million in dividends. We also recently announced an 8% increase in the quarterly dividend. Overall, our strong fourth quarter and full year results demonstrate the continued successful execution of our business strategy and our ability to consistently enhance shareholder returns.
Turning now to the markets on Slide 8. We continue to capitalize on the increasing market demand for scalable outsourced solutions and transformational services by leveraging our comprehensive suite of end-to-end technology assets, consulting services and outsourced managed delivery capabilities. We saw increased demand in the quarter and year-over-year for our suite of integrated financial solutions. This was especially true in North America, where we saw a number of 2 competitive core banking wins in the quarter and for the full year. For the fourth quarter, we signed 14 new core deals, and for the year, we saw a 54% increase in total new core wins compared to the prior year. 
Digital channels continued to be a key driver as consumer adoption rates grow, creating strong opportunities for our broad-based mobile platforms. These opportunities have translated into strong double-digit revenue growth in our mobile business supported by a strong performance in new mobile deals last year in a user base approaching $30 million. We continue to be one of the leaders in integrated digital channels and mobile platforms and are delivering key innovations that are changing the way people bank.
As you would expect, with the increasing regulatory burdens, our enterprise, governance, risk and compliance business continues to experience double-digit growth. We see institutions of all sizes looked at by us to more effectively address the increasing regulatory requirements, enforcement actions and cyber security duress. In fact, last week, we hosted over 300 clients in San Diego for our 11th annual enterprise, governance, risk and compliance summit. This event brings together key stakeholders from banks and nonbanks to federal and state regulatory agencies to discuss emergency -- emerging risk and explore new best practices for handling these risks. These events are not only information-sharing events, but create significant sales opportunities for our teams over the following months. These successes, coupled with others within our North American businesses, have created strong momentum and pipeline for 2015.
Outside North America, macroeconomic trends around the globe continued to cause headwinds in Brazil and some slippage of deals in Europe. Foreign currency exchange rates were a headwind in Q4 and will continue in 2015. However, due to our broad geographic business and extensive asset portfolio, we produced strong double-digit growth overall for the year and have confidence in similar double-digit organic growth in 2015. This confidence is due to our success in 2014 delivering several key client wins as well as continued progress on our large implementation projects. For example, in Q4, [indiscernible] Financial Services Limpid [ph] India's largest micro-finance institution with over 2,000 locations and 6 million customers will be authoring retail banking services to its customers utilizing our core banking capabilities on an outsourced basis. The proposed [indiscernible] bank plans to launch between 400 to 600 branch locations beginning in Q2 of 2015. In addition, Leduc Financial Partners also delivered another strong growth opportunity in Q4 by selecting us to fully manage its ATM services and switching solutions across India. Finally, new startup banks in the U.K. proved to be a solid area of opportunity with FIS signing several startup bank clients in the quarter. 
To capitalize on the large acting spend and our success in selling to the top global financial institutions, throughout 2014, we added new global client partners, sales and client implementation support teams, along with client-centered marketing to our operations. As a result of these additions, we are building on our 2014 success and have a strong pipeline for large transformational outsourcing deals and are seeing results as cost containment, regulatory pressures and front to back office transformation projects continued to dominate our clients' agendas.
Additionally, we have seen significant increase in demand for our Clear2Pay solutions among these institutions. Our integration of Clear2Pay is on track, and early sales results were in line with our investment case. We continue to see the benefit of FIS's global salesforce adds to these strategic acquisitions by increasing access to our broad client base. 
Before I turn it over to Woody for the financial report, I'd like to review the key pillars of our multiyear strategy that provide us a strong foundation for success in 2015. 
Turning to Slide 9. The breadth and depth of FIS's solution portfolio, combined with our large scale and global reach, enables us to drive change within our organization to deliver on our growth commitments. From this, we are able to deliver on our financial commitments to our shareholders while continuing to drive profitable growth consistently year-over-year; strengthen our balance sheet by maintaining and improving our investment-grade ratings and meeting our total debt-to-EBITDA target; continue to return cash to our shareholders in the form of share buybacks and quarterly dividends; leverage our scale and cost-effectively manage our operations through continuous expense management discipline; and then act on strategic acquisitions in an environment of increasingly rapid and aggressive global competition. This increasingly rapid change is driven by disruptive innovators, entrenched competitors expanding their services and global players with scale with a wider breadth of solutions and services is growing of importance to clients. This strategic focus provides us confidence in our ability to drive continued growth and strong financial performance. Woody will now provide details around our Q4 and full year performance. Woody?"

I'll begin on Slide 11 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter and then for the full year 2014. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue increased 7% on a reported basis to $1.7 billion. Consolidated revenue increased 5",1308,"Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 11 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter and then for the full year 2014. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue increased 7% on a reported basis to $1.7 billion. Consolidated revenue increased 5.4% on an organic basis, continuing our trend of accelerating organic revenue growth this year. EBITDA increased 9% to $526 million with EBITDA margin expanding 30 basis points to 31.1% compared to 30.8% in the prior-year period. Non-GAAP adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased to $249 million from $220 million and adjusted earnings per share increased 16% to $0.87 from $0.75 in the fourth quarter of 2013.
For the year, revenue increased 6% on a reported basis and 5% on an organic basis to $6.4 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 5% to $1.9 billion. EBITDA margin of 30% was up 20 basis points lower than the prior-year period reflecting our strategic investment in the global financial institutions market, shift in revenue mix and lower termination fees. Adjusted earnings per share rose 10% to $3.10 per share, which is in line with the EPS guidance we provided in the third quarter call. These results include a negative currency impact on EPS of $0.01 for the quarter and $0.02 for the full year. 
Next I will continue on Slide 12 with a review of segment results. In the fourth quarter, Financial Solutions revenue grew 7% on a reported basis and 4% on an organic basis to $645 million. These results were driven primarily by growth in implementations, consulting and services and risk and compliance solutions. Financial Solutions EBITDA for the quarter increased 6% to $253 million. The EBITDA margin was 39.2%, down from 39.7% in the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting higher consulting and services revenue. For the year, Financial Solutions revenue increased 6% on a reported basis and 4% on an organic basis to $2.5 billion from $2.3 billion. This growth was primarily driven by consulting and services, mobile banking and risk and compliance solutions. Full year EBITDA increased 4% to $980 million. EBITDA margin was 39.3% with 70 basis points lower than the prior-year period resulting primarily from lower termination fees.
Turning to Slide 13. In the fourth quarter, Payment Solutions revenue increased 5% on a reported basis and 3% on an organic basis to $647 million. This growth reflects increased volumes in network solutions and card production. Payment Solutions EBITDA increased 5% to $275 million in the quarter and the margin increased 10 basis points to 42.5%, driven primarily by transaction volume growth on our processing platforms. For the full year, Payment Solutions revenue increased 2% on a reported and organic basis to $2.5 billion. Full year adjusted EBITDA increased 2% to $1.1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 30 basis points primarily due to lower termination fees compared to the prior-year period. Now I will cover our international business on Slide 14.
In the fourth quarter, International Solutions revenue grew 13% on a reported basis and 11% on an organic basis to $398 million. This double-digit organic growth was driven by increased implementation revenue and consulting services. International EBITDA increased 7% to $103 million. EBITDA margin was 25.9%, down 140 basis points compared to the prior year due to shift in revenue mix. For the full year, International Solutions revenue increased 12% on a reported basis and 11% on an organic basis to $1.4 billion. Full year EBITDA increased 6% to $320 million compared to $303 million in the prior-year period. EBITDA margin decreased 140 basis points to 22.5%, reflecting a shift in revenue mix in 2014 and the investment in the global financial institution market. 
Overall, corporate expense in the fourth quarter was $105 million, down from $114 million in the prior-year period. For the year, corporate expense was down $18 million to $427 million. This decrease is driven by our continued commitment to productivity improvements and cost management. 
Moving to the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP EPS on Slide 15. GAAP earnings totaled $0.71 per share compared to $0.25 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013. GAAP results for the quarter are adjusted to exclude $0.12 for acquisition-related purchase price amortization and $0.04 per share related to acquisition, integration and severance costs. Adjusted cash flow from operations totaled $455 million in the quarter of 2014 and $1.2 billion for the full year. Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $99 million and $371 million for the year. The $371 million for the year is 6% of 2014 revenue and represents our commitment to continue to invest in our businesses and new products and services. We delivered free cash flow of $357 million for the quarter and $864 million for the full year of 2014. These results are consistent with our previous guidance for free cash flow conversion to approximate adjusted net earnings for the full year. Our uses of cash flow during 2014 were consistent with our capital allocations priorities of investing for future growth, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders.
Moving to Slide 16. We returned $750 million to shareholders in 2014. This consisted of $275 million in dividends and $475 million in share repurchases. In 2014, we repurchased 8.7 million shares in the open market at an average cost of about $55 per share. The share repurchase program drove a 2% decrease in our weighted average diluted share count to 288.7 million in 2014 from 294.2 million in 2013. We did not repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter as we reduced debt related to the Clear2Pay acquisition. Debt outstanding totaled $5.1 billion as of December 31. The weighted average interest rate was 3.1% at year-end. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 2.6x, which is in line with our target of approximately 2.5x. 
On December 18, we announced the amendment of our existing credit facility. We increased our revolver capacity from $2 billion to $3 billion and extended the maturity to 2019 from 2017. Heading into 2015, we feel very comfortable with the strength of our balance sheet and the flexibility that affords us to continue to invest for growth. 
Moving on to Slide 17, I will discuss our outlook for 2015. For 2015, we expect revenue growth of 5% to 7% on both a reported and organic basis. As stated in our third quarter call, we expect margin expansion to continue into 2015 and to be in the range of 10 to 30 basis points for the year. We expect 2015 adjusted earnings per share in a range of $3.37 to $3.49 per share, which is a 9% to 13% increase over 2014. Foreign currency exchange rates will continue to be a meaningful headwind in 2015, negatively impacting EPS by approximately $0.06. Excluding the impact of currency, our 2015 EPS growth would be 11% to 15%. We expect free cash flow to approximate adjusted net earnings. Finally, as Gary noted, we recently increased our dividend by 8% to $0.26 per share. 
Today, we're also providing first quarter 2014 EPS guidance to give color on the calendarization of our 2015 plan. We expect continued negative foreign currency impacts in Q1 of 2015. Additionally, while good news for the long term, we are planning for very little impact from bank consolidation resulting in our lowest level of termination fees in the first quarter over the past 3 years. Based on these items, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.72 per share in the first quarter. We are confident that we will again deliver on our full year guidance. This is based in our proven ability to execute and meet our stated financial commitments, revenue visibility from deals sold in 2014, our sales pipeline and our continued focus on managing our cost structure. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for questions."

Because as we've talked off in the past, even when one of our clients buys one of our [indiscernible], 1 plus 1 never equals 2.

I wish some of these deals wouldn't slip from quarter-to-quarter, but that's just the nature of these areas and the economy.

Thank you for joining us on today's call. Turning to Slide 6, 2014 proved to be another very strong year.

Turning to Slide 6, 2014 proved to be another very strong year. We drove consistent execution, continued to deliver on our financial commitments to our shareholders and achieved our full year growth outlook. We finished the year with record revenue of $6.4 billion, reflecting 6% year-over-year growth. We drove adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $3.10, growing our earnings per share by 10% year-over-year. We generated free cash flow of $864 million. 
In the fourth quarter, our results are equally as strong. Revenue increased 7%, EBITDA increased 9%, margins expanded 30 basis points and adjusted earnings per share increased 16% over the prior year period. We finished the year on a strong footing with continued sales success across all markets, a robust pipeline and good visibility heading into 2015. 
Turning to Slide 7. Consistent with our growth strategy, we are using our significant cash flow to drive value for our clients and our shareholders. First, we continued to invest for growth in our operations that target global financial institutions as well as strategic solution-oriented acquisitions, including Clear2Pay, Reliance Trust and CMSI, all of which strengthened our payments, wealth and lending capabilities, respectively. Second, we maintained our strong balance sheet ending the year with leverage of 2.6x debt-to-EBITDA, which reflects complete deleveraging of our investment in Clear2Pay during the fourth quarter. Our continued financial discipline was recognized by upgrades from both Fitch and Standard & Poor's during 2014.
Third, we continued to deliver strong value to our investors, returning $750 million to our shareholders in 2014 through $475 million of stock repurchases and $275 million in dividends. We also recently announced an 8% increase in the quarterly dividend. Overall, our strong fourth quarter and full year results demonstrate the continued successful execution of our business strategy and our ability to consistently enhance shareholder returns.
Turning now to the markets on Slide 8. We continue to capitalize on the increasing market demand for scalable outsource solutions and transformational services by leveraging our comprehensive suite of end-to-end technology assets, consulting services and outsourced managed delivery capabilities. We saw increased demand in the quarter and year-over-year for our suite of integrated financial solutions. This was especially true in North America, where we saw a number of key competitive core banking wins in the quarter and for the full year. For the fourth quarter, we signed 14 new core deals; and for the year, we saw a 54% increase in total new core wins compared to the prior year. 
Digital channels continue to be a key driver as consumer adoption rates grow, creating strong opportunities for our broad-based mobile platforms. These opportunities have translated into strong double-digit revenue growth in our mobile business supported by a strong performance in new mobile deals last year and a user base approaching 30 million. We continue to be one of the leaders in integrated digital channels and mobile platforms, and are delivering key innovations that are changing the way people bank.
As you would expect, with the increasing regulatory burdens, our Enterprise, Governance, Risk and Compliance business continues to experience double-digit growth. We see institutions of all sizes look to FIS to more effectively address the increasing regulatory requirements, enforcement actions and cyber security threats. In fact, last week, we hosted over 300 clients in San Diego for our 11th annual Enterprise, Governance, Risk and Compliance Summit. This event brings together key stakeholders from banks and nonbanks to federal and state regulatory agencies to discuss emergency -- emerging risk and explore new best practices for handling these risks. These events are not only information-sharing events, but create significant sales opportunities for our teams over the following months. These successes, coupled with others within our North American businesses, have created strong momentum and pipeline for 2015.
Outside North America, macroeconomic trends around the globe continued to cause headwinds in Brazil and some slippage of deals in Europe. Foreign currency exchange rates were a headwind in Q4 and will continue in 2015. However, due to our broad geographic business and extensive asset portfolio, we produced strong double-digit growth overall for the year and have confidence in similar double-digit organic growth in 2015. This confidence is due to our success in 2014 delivering several key client wins as well as continued progress on our large implementation projects. 
For example, in Q4, Bandhan Financial Services Ltd., India's largest microfinance institution with over 2,000 locations and 6 million customers, will be offering retail banking services to its customers utilizing our core banking capabilities on an outsourced basis. The proposed Bandhan Bank plans to launch between 400 to 600 branch locations beginning in Q2 of 2015. In addition, Muthoot Financial Partners also delivered another strong growth opportunity in Q4 by selecting us to fully manage its ATM services and switching solutions across India. Finally, new startup banks in the U.K. proved to be a solid area of opportunity, with FIS signing several startup bank clients in the quarter. 
To capitalize on the large IT spend and our success in selling to the top global financial institutions, throughout 2014, we added new global client partners, sales and client implementation support teams, along with client-centered marketing to our operations. As a result of these additions, we are building on our 2014 success and have a strong pipeline for large transformational outsourcing deals and are seeing results as cost containment, regulatory pressures and front to back office transformation projects continue to dominate our clients' agendas.
Additionally, we have seen significant increase in demand for our Clear2Pay solutions among these institutions. Our integration of Clear2Pay is on track and early sales results are in line with our investment case. We continue to see the benefit of FIS' global sales force adds to these strategic acquisitions by increasing access to our broad client base. 
Before I turn it over to Woody for the financial report, I'd like to review the key pillars of our multiyear strategy that provide us a strong foundation for success in 2015. 
Turning to Slide 9. The breadth and depth of FIS' solution portfolio, combined with our large scale and global reach, enables us to drive change within our organization to deliver on our growth commitments. From this, we are able to deliver on our financial commitments to our shareholders, while continuing to drive profitable growth consistently year-over-year; strengthen our balance sheet by maintaining and improving our investment-grade ratings and meeting our total debt-to-EBITDA target; continue to return cash to our shareholders in the form of share buybacks and quarterly dividends; leverage our scale and cost-effectively manage our operations through continuous expense management discipline; and then act on strategic acquisitions in an environment of increasingly rapid and aggressive global competition.
This increasingly rapid change is driven by disruptive innovators, entrenched competitors expanding their services and global players with scale with a wider breadth of solutions and services is growing in importance to clients. This strategic focus provides us confidence in our ability to drive continued growth and strong financial performance.
Woody will now provide details around our Q4 and full year performance. Woody?"

I'll begin on Slide 11 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter and then for the full year 2014. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue increased 7% on a reported basis to $1.7 billion. Consolidated revenue increased 5",1319,"Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 11 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter and then for the full year 2014. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue increased 7% on a reported basis to $1.7 billion. Consolidated revenue increased 5.4% on an organic basis, continuing our trend of accelerating organic revenue growth this year. EBITDA increased 9% to $526 million, with EBITDA margin expanding 30 basis points to 31.1% compared to 30.8% in the prior year period. Non-GAAP adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased to $249 million from $220 million, and adjusted earnings per share increased 16% to $0.87 from $0.75 in the fourth quarter of 2013.
For the year, revenue increased 6% on a reported basis and 5% on an organic basis to $6.4 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 5% to $1.9 billion. EBITDA margin of 30% was 20 basis points lower than the prior year period, reflecting our strategic investment in the global financial institutions market, shift in revenue mix and lower termination fees. Adjusted earnings per share rose 10% to $3.10 per share, which is in line with the EPS guidance we provided in the third quarter call. These results included a negative currency impact on EPS of $0.01 for the quarter and $0.02 for the full year. 
Next I will continue on Slide 12 with a review of segment results. In the fourth quarter, Financial Solutions revenue grew 7% on a reported basis and 4% on an organic basis to $645 million. These results were driven primarily by growth in implementations, consulting and services and risk and compliance solutions. Financial Solutions EBITDA for the quarter increased 6% to $253 million. The EBITDA margin was 39.2%, down from 39.7% in the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting higher consulting and services revenue.
For the year, Financial Solutions revenue increased 6% on a reported basis and 4% on an organic basis to $2.5 billion from $2.3 billion. This growth was primarily driven by consulting and services, mobile banking and risk and compliance solutions. Full year EBITDA increased 4% to $980 million. EBITDA margin was 39.3% and was 70 basis points lower than prior -- than the prior year period resulting primarily from lower termination fees.
Turning to Slide 13. In the fourth quarter, Payment Solutions revenue increased 5% on a reported basis and 3% on an organic basis to $647 million. This growth reflects increased volumes in network solutions and card production. Payment Solutions EBITDA increased 5% to $275 million in the quarter, and the margin increased 10 basis points to 42.5%, driven primarily by transaction volume growth on our processing platforms.
For the full year, Payment Solutions revenue increased 2% on a reported and organic basis to $2.5 billion. Full year adjusted EBITDA increased 2% to $1.1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 30 basis points primarily due to lower termination fees compared to the prior year period.
Now I will cover our international business on Slide 14. In the fourth quarter, International Solutions revenue grew 13% on a reported basis and 11% on an organic basis to $398 million. This double-digit organic growth was driven by increased implementation revenue and consulting services. International EBITDA increased 7% to $103 million. EBITDA margin was 25.9%, down 140 basis points compared to the prior year due to shift in revenue mix.
For the full year, International Solutions revenue increased 12% on a reported basis and 11% on an organic basis to $1.4 billion. Full year EBITDA increased 6% to $320 million compared to $303 million in the prior year period. EBITDA margin decreased 140 basis points to 22.5%, reflecting a shift in revenue mix in 2014 and the investment in the global financial institution market. 
Overall corporate expense in the fourth quarter was $105 million, down from $114 million in the prior year period. For the year, corporate expense was down $18 million to $427 million. This decrease is driven by our continued commitment to productivity improvements and cost management. 
Moving to the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP EPS on Slide 15. GAAP earnings totaled $0.71 per share compared to $0.25 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013. GAAP results for the quarter are adjusted to exclude $0.12 for acquisition-related purchase price amortization and $0.04 per share related to acquisition, integration and severance costs. Adjusted cash flow from operations totaled $455 million in the quarter of 2014 and $1.2 billion for the full year. Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $99 million and $371 million for the year. The $371 million for the year is 6% of 2014 revenue and represents our commitment to continue to invest in our businesses and new products and services.
We delivered free cash flow of $357 million for the quarter and $864 million for the full year of 2014. These results are consistent with our previous guidance for free cash flow conversion to approximate adjusted net earnings for the full year. Our uses of cash flow during 2014 were consistent with our capital allocation priorities of investing for future growth, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders.
Moving to Slide 16. We returned $750 million to shareholders in 2014. This consisted of $275 million in dividends and $475 million in share repurchases. In 2014, we repurchased 8.7 million shares in the open market at an average cost of about $55 per share. The share repurchase program drove a 2% decrease in our weighted average diluted share count to 288.7 million in 2014 from 294.2 million in 2013. We did not repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter as we reduced debt related to the Clear2Pay acquisition. Debt outstanding totaled $5.1 billion as of December 31. The weighted average interest rate was 3.1% at year end. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 2.6x, which is in line with our target of approximately 2.5x. 
On December 18, we announced the amendment of our existing credit facility. We increased our revolver capacity from $2 billion to $3 billion and extended the maturity to 2019 from 2017. Heading into 2015, we feel very comfortable with the strength of our balance sheet and the flexibility that affords us to continue to invest for growth. 
Moving on to Slide 17, I will discuss our outlook for 2015. For 2015, we expect revenue growth of 5% to 7% on both a reported and organic basis. As stated in our third quarter call, we expect margin expansion to continue into 2015 and to be in the range of 10 to 30 basis points for the year. We expect 2015 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.37 to $3.49 per share, which is a 9% to 13% increase over 2014. Foreign currency exchange rates will continue to be a meaningful headwind in 2015, negatively impacting EPS by approximately $0.06. Excluding the impact of currency, our 2015 EPS growth would be 11% to 15%. We expect free cash flow to approximate adjusted net earnings. Finally, as Gary noted, we recently increased our dividend by 8% to $0.26 per share. 
Today, we're also providing first quarter 2014 EPS guidance to give color on the calendarization of our 2015 plan. We expect continued negative foreign currency impacts in Q1 of 2015. Additionally, while good news for the long term, we are planning for very little impact from bank consolidation, resulting in our lowest level of termination fees in the first quarter over the past 3 years. Based on these items, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.72 per share in the first quarter.
We are confident that we will, again, deliver on our full year guidance. This is based in our proven ability to execute and meet our stated financial commitments, revenue visibility from deals sold in 2014, our sales pipeline and our continued focus on managing our cost structure.

We don't know what acquisitions are going on in the market until typically they're announced. So every now and then we'd get a little advance notice. But you think about when we came out of the 2008 economic collapse, and once the banks stabilized and dealt with all of their loan issues and we saw the closure rate fall off, we now have seen a spike over the last several years of increased, what I would say, almost pent-up acquisition demand. As Woody said, the good news is, we see that trailing off. I mean, which is positive for us. Because as we've talked in the past, even when one of our clients buys one of our clients, 1 plus 1 never equals 2. So for us, based on what we're seeing, based on what our clients are telling us, that's going to continue to trend down. We saw a drop in term fees last year. We think it's going to be a drop again this year. But as far as the growth that the revenue does, it always cycles where Q1 is always typically our slowest growth and then it ramps up through the course of the year.

I wish some of these deals wouldn't slip from quarter-to-quarter, but that's just the nature of these areas and the economy.

Again, Glenn, our overall services businesses, just across, and our company continues to grow very well. And that's the testament to the size of our company and the ability to deliver these kind of robust services. So you got that, in general, growing double-digits. But you also, keep in mind, you've got the Clear2Pay acquisition, which is a very nice product fall-through that's going to be splitting between ISG and PSG. So -- and as Woody pointed out, there's a number of key product elements that I even mentioned in my prepared remarks around mobile and some of those things. So it's going to be a nice dynamic, but we feel comfortable that the margin expansion that we described will come through in 2015."

So as I've said in my prepared remarks, if we can find an opportunity that drives earnings per share, always compare it to share buybacks as kind of the bar, then we'll certainly evaluate it. We've done a number of acquisitions last year. You've seen over the last 3 years the level of acquisition activity from a dollar amount has increased consistently. I think last year, we did about $600 million in acquisitions. So it's important for us to keep ahead of the innovation curve. It's important -- our clients, we continue to see are demanding a larger portfolio suite for providers like us in order to be competitive, to deal with the regulatory burden and the security burden, and, frankly, just all the innovations going on.

With that, I will turn the call over to Gary to discuss the fourth quarter financial highlights on Slide 6. Gary?"

Turning to Slide 6, 2014 proved to be another very strong year. We drove consistent execution, continued to deliver on our financial commitments to our shareholders and achieved our full year growth outlook. We finished the year with record revenue of $6.4 billion, reflecting 6% year-over-year growth. We drove adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $3.10, growing our earnings per share by 10% year-over-year. We generated free cash flow of $864 million. 
In the fourth quarter, our results are equally as strong. Revenue increased 7%, EBITDA increased 9%, margins expanded 30 basis points and adjusted earnings per share increased 16% over the prior year period. We finished the year on a strong footing with continued sales success across all markets, a robust pipeline and good visibility heading into 2015. 
Turning to Slide 7. Consistent with our growth strategy, we are using our significant cash flow to drive value for our clients and our shareholders. First, we continued to invest for growth in our operations that target global financial institutions as well as strategic solution-oriented acquisitions, including Clear2Pay, Reliance Trust and CMSI, all of which strengthened our payments, wealth and lending capabilities, respectively. Second, we maintained our strong balance sheet, ending the year with leverage of 2.6x debt-to-EBITDA, which reflects complete deleveraging of our investment in Clear2Pay during the fourth quarter. Our continued financial discipline was recognized by upgrades from both Fitch and Standard & Poor's during 2014.
Third, we continued to deliver strong value to our investors, returning $750 million to our shareholders in 2014 through $475 million of stock repurchases and $275 million in dividends. We also recently announced an 8% increase in the quarterly dividend. Overall, our strong fourth quarter and full year results demonstrate the continued successful execution of our business strategy and our ability to consistently enhance shareholder returns.
Turning now to the markets on Slide 8. We continue to capitalize on the increasing market demand for scalable outsource solutions and transformational services by leveraging our comprehensive suite of end-to-end technology assets, consulting services and outsourced managed delivery capabilities. We saw increased demand in the quarter and year-over-year for our suite of integrated financial solutions. This was especially true in North America, where we saw a number of key competitive core banking wins in the quarter and for the full year. For the fourth quarter, we signed 14 new core deals; and for the year, we saw a 54% increase in total new core wins compared to the prior year. 
Digital channels continue to be a key driver as consumer adoption rates grow, creating strong opportunities for our broad-based mobile platforms. These opportunities have translated into strong double-digit revenue growth in our mobile business, supported by a strong performance in new mobile deals last year and a user base approaching 30 million. We continue to be one of the leaders in integrated digital channels and mobile platforms, and are delivering key innovations that are changing the way people bank.
As you would expect, with the increasing regulatory burdens, our Enterprise Governance, Risk and Compliance business continues to experience double-digit growth. We see institutions of all sizes look to FIS to more effectively address the increasing regulatory requirements, enforcement actions and cyber security threats. In fact, last week, we hosted over 300 clients in San Diego for our 11th annual Enterprise Governance, Risk and Compliance Summit. This event brings together key stakeholders from banks and nonbanks to federal and state regulatory agencies to discuss emergency -- emerging risk and explore new best practices for handling these risks. These events are not only information-sharing events, but create significant sales opportunities for our teams over the following months. These successes, coupled with others within our North American businesses, have created strong momentum and pipeline for 2015.
Outside North America, macroeconomic trends around the globe continued to cause headwinds in Brazil and some slippage of deals in Europe. Foreign currency exchange rates were a headwind in Q4 and will continue in 2015. However, due to our broad geographic business and extensive asset portfolio, we produced strong double-digit growth overall for the year and have confidence in similar double-digit organic growth in 2015. This confidence is due to our success in 2014 delivering several key client wins as well as continued progress on our large implementation projects. 
For example, in Q4, Bandhan Financial Services Ltd., India's largest microfinance institution with over 2,000 locations and 6 million customers, will be offering retail banking services to its customers utilizing our core banking capabilities on an outsourced basis. The proposed Bandhan Bank plans to launch between 400 to 600 branch locations beginning in Q2 of 2015. In addition, Muthoot Financial Partners also delivered another strong growth opportunity in Q4 by selecting us to fully manage its ATM services and switching solutions across India. Finally, new startup banks in the U.K. proved to be a solid area of opportunity, with FIS signing several startup bank clients in the quarter. 
To capitalize on the large IT spend and our success in selling to the top global financial institutions, throughout 2014, we added new global client partners, sales and client implementation support teams, along with client-centered marketing to our operations. As a result of these additions, we are building on our 2014 success and have a strong pipeline for large transformational outsourcing deals and are seeing results as cost containment, regulatory pressures and front to back office transformation projects continue to dominate our clients' agendas.
Additionally, we have seen significant increase in demand for our Clear2Pay solutions among these institutions. Our integration of Clear2Pay is on track and early sales results are in line with our investment case. We continue to see the benefit of FIS' global sales force adds to these strategic acquisitions by increasing access to our broad client base. 
Before I turn it over to Woody for the financial report, I'd like to review the key pillars of our multiyear strategy that provide us a strong foundation for success in 2015. 
Turning to Slide 9. The breadth and depth of FIS' solution portfolio, combined with our large scale and global reach, enables us to drive change within our organization to deliver on our growth commitments. From this, we are able to deliver on our financial commitments to our shareholders, while continuing to drive profitable growth consistently year-over-year; strengthen our balance sheet by maintaining and improving our investment-grade ratings and meeting our total debt-to-EBITDA target; continue to return cash to our shareholders in the form of share buybacks and quarterly dividends; leverage our scale and cost-effectively manage our operations through continuous expense management discipline; and then act on strategic acquisitions in an environment of increasingly rapid and aggressive global competition.
This increasingly rapid change is driven by disruptive innovators, entrenched competitors expanding their services and global players, where scale with a wider breadth of solutions and services is growing in importance to clients. This strategic focus provides us confidence in our ability to drive continued growth and strong financial performance.
Woody will now provide details around our Q4 and full year performance. Woody?"

I'll begin on Slide 11 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter and then for the full year 2014. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue increased 7% on a reported basis to $1.7 billion. Consolidated revenue increased 5",1320,"Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 11 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter and then for the full year 2014. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue increased 7% on a reported basis to $1.7 billion. Consolidated revenue increased 5.4% on an organic basis, continuing our trend of accelerating organic revenue growth this year. EBITDA increased 9% to $526 million, with EBITDA margin expanding 30 basis points to 31.1%, compared to 30.8% in the prior year period. Non-GAAP adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased to $249 million from $220 million, and adjusted earnings per share increased 16% to $0.87 from $0.75 in the fourth quarter of 2013.
For the year, revenue increased 6% on a reported basis and 5% on an organic basis to $6.4 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 5% to $1.9 billion. EBITDA margin of 30% was 20 basis points lower than the prior year period, reflecting our strategic investment in the global financial institutions market, a shift in revenue mix and lower termination fees. Adjusted earnings per share rose 10% to $3.10 per share, which is in line with the EPS guidance we provided in the third quarter call. These results include a negative currency impact on EPS of $0.01 for the quarter and $0.02 for the full year. 
Next, I will continue on Slide 12 with a review of segment results. In the fourth quarter, Financial Solutions revenue grew 7% on a reported basis and 4% on an organic basis to $645 million. These results were driven primarily by growth in implementations, consulting and services and risk and compliance solutions. Financial Solutions EBITDA for the quarter increased 6% to $253 million. The EBITDA margin was 39.2%, down from 39.7% in the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting higher consulting and services revenue.
For the year, Financial Solutions revenue increased 6% on a reported basis and 4% on an organic basis to $2.5 billion from $2.3 billion. This growth was primarily driven by consulting and services, mobile banking and risk and compliance solutions. Full year EBITDA increased 4% to $980 million. EBITDA margin was 39.3% and was 70 basis points lower than prior -- than the prior year period, resulting primarily from lower termination fees.
Turning to Slide 13. In the fourth quarter, Payment Solutions revenue increased 5% on a reported basis and 3% on an organic basis to $647 million. This growth reflects increased volumes in network solutions and card production. Payment Solutions EBITDA increased 5% to $275 million in the quarter, and the margin increased 10 basis points to 42.5%, driven primarily by transaction volume growth on our processing platforms.
For the full year, Payment Solutions revenue increased 2% on a reported and organic basis to $2.5 billion. Full year adjusted EBITDA increased 2% to $1.1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 30 basis points, primarily due to lower termination fees compared to the prior year period.
Now I will cover our international business on Slide 14. In the fourth quarter, International Solutions revenue grew 13% on a reported basis and 11% on an organic basis to $398 million. This double-digit organic growth was driven by increased implementation revenue and consulting services. International EBITDA increased 7% to $103 million. EBITDA margin was 25.9%, down 140 basis points compared to the prior year due to shift in revenue mix.
For the full year, International Solutions revenue increased 12% on a reported basis and 11% on an organic basis to $1.4 billion. Full year EBITDA increased 6% to $320 million, compared to $303 million in the prior year period. EBITDA margin decreased 140 basis points to 22.5%, reflecting a shift in revenue mix in 2014 and the investment in the global financial institution market. 
Overall corporate expense in the fourth quarter was $105 million, down from $114 million in the prior year period. For the year, corporate expense was down $18 million to $427 million. This decrease is driven by our continued commitment to productivity improvements and cost management. 
Moving to the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP EPS on Slide 15. GAAP earnings totaled $0.71 per share compared to $0.25 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013. GAAP results for the quarter are adjusted to exclude $0.12 for acquisition-related purchase price amortization and $0.04 per share related to acquisition, integration and severance costs. Adjusted cash flow from operations totaled $455 million in the quarter of 2014 and $1.2 billion for the full year. Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $99 million and $371 million for the year. The $371 million for the year is 6% of 2014 revenue and represents our commitment to continue to invest in our businesses and new products and services.
We delivered free cash flow of $357 million for the quarter and $864 million for the full year of 2014. These results are consistent with our previous guidance for free cash flow conversion to approximate adjusted net earnings for the full year. Our uses of cash flow during 2014 were consistent with our capital allocation priorities of investing for future growth, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders.
Moving to Slide 16. We returned $750 million to shareholders in 2014. This consisted of $275 million in dividends and $475 million in share repurchases. In 2014, we repurchased 8.7 million shares in the open market at an average cost of about $55 per share. The share repurchase program drove a 2% decrease in our weighted average diluted share count to 288.7 million in 2014, from 294.2 million in 2013. We did not repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter as we reduced debt related to the Clear2Pay acquisition. Debt outstanding totaled $5.1 billion as of December 31. The weighted average interest rate was 3.1% at year end. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 2.6x, which is in line with our target of approximately 2.5x. 
On December 18, we announced the amendment of our existing credit facility. We increased our revolver capacity from $2 billion to $3 billion and extended the maturity to 2019 from 2017. Heading into 2015, we feel very comfortable with the strength of our balance sheet and the flexibility it affords us to continue to invest for growth. 
Moving on to Slide 17, I will discuss our outlook for 2015. For 2015, we expect revenue growth of 5% to 7% on both a reported and organic basis. As stated in our third quarter call, we expect margin expansion to continue into 2015 and to be in the range of 10 to 30 basis points for the year. We expect 2015 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.37 to $3.49 per share, which is a 9% to 13% increase over 2014. Foreign currency exchange rates will continue to be a meaningful headwind in 2015, negatively impacting EPS by approximately $0.06. Excluding the impact of currency, our 2015 EPS growth would be 11% to 15%. We expect free cash flow to approximate adjusted net earnings. Finally, as Gary noted, we recently increased our dividend by 8% to $0.26 per share. 
Today, we're also providing first quarter 2015 EPS guidance to give color on the calendarization of our 2015 plan. We expect continued negative foreign currency impacts in Q1 of 2015. Additionally, while good news for the long term, we are planning for very little impact from bank consolidation, resulting in our lowest level of termination fees in the first quarter over the past 3 years. Based on these items, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.72 per share in the first quarter.
We are confident that we will again deliver on our full year guidance. This is based on our proven ability to execute and meet our stated financial commitments, revenue visibility from deals sold in 2014, our sales pipeline and our continued focus on managing our cost structure. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for questions."

But if you think about when we came out of the 2008 economic collapse, and once the banks stabilized and dealt with all of their loan issues and we saw the closure rate fall off, we now have seen a spike over the last several years of increased, what I would say, almost pent-up acquisition demand. As Woody said, the good news is we see that trailing off. I mean, which is positive for us, because as we've talked in the past, even when one of our clients buys one of our clients, 1 plus 1 never equals 2. So for us, based on what we're seeing, based on what our clients are telling us, that's going to continue to trend down. We saw a drop in term fees last year. We think it's going to be a drop again this year. But as far as the growth of the revenue goes, it always cycles where Q1 is always typically our slowest growth and then it ramps up through the course of the year. It's just the nature of the business."

And then we saw a good bounce-back in Europe, where we saw mid-teen growth in Europe. Adding it all together, we ended up at that, sort of, I think it was around 11% for the full year in terms of growth. We're seeing -- again, we keep talking about India, you're hearing wins in Asia, it's not a huge dollar impact yet, but it's growing very rapidly for us, and we believe it will become a more and more important piece of the overall pie.

We continue to see our consulting business grow exponentially in that market, which is always a great sign. And we've already announced a number of big transformational outsourcing deals. So I think when I think about the global marketplace, global financial institution marketplace, the pipeline continues to grow. We continue to execute. I wish some of these deals wouldn't slip from quarter-to-quarter, but that's just the nature of these areas and the economy. When I turn to the U.S., the U.S. sales team had a great year last year and had good strong consistent growth over the prior year, and their pipeline is starting to see good throughput. So all in all, I'm very bullish on where the company is, where the -- how the sales team's executing. And I think that's why we've increased our guidance for growth going into 2015."

Thank you for joining us on today's call. 
Starting on Slide 5. We finished the quarter with an increase in revenue of $1.6 billion, reflecting a 2% reported revenue growth while adjusted earnings per share was down 4% from the prior year quarter. Fundamentally, our integrated Financial Solutions segment had a solid quarter while our global Financial Solutions segment was presented with a number of challenges that will continue into Q2. In the quarter, we were negatively impacted in our global segment by changes in foreign exchange rates, continued slow higher margin product sales, a project delay on a previously announced large-scale transportational project and a large non-bank contract that did not meet our profitability metrics. We also experienced the lowest level of termination fees due to bank consolidation we have seen in the last 11 quarters. While this initially creates and challenges in our IFS segment's first half comparisons, overall, it translates into a lower-client churn and replacement cost. Adjusted for these onetime fees reported revenue growth would have resulted in 5% top line and 7% bottom line growth in the IFS segment. 
The combination of all these factors impacted our Q1 results and prompted the changing guidance for the quarter and the full year, which we announced on April 9. Consistent with our growth strategy and in line with me becoming CEO, we have resegmented the company to give great transparency around the drivers for FIS as well as highlight the potential value for expansion due to the 2 diverse businesses that we currently operate. These 2 segments are the Integrated Financial Solutions segment, which focuses primarily on regional and community-based financial institutions in the United States; and Global Financial Solutions segment, which asserts global and international financial institutions. We will continue to leverage our technology investment and scale across both market segments while we capitalize on growth opportunities created with a fundamentally different needs and buying patterns of each of these respective markets. 
This segmentation will also enable more accurate comparison of the segments against the unique competitors in their respective markets to drive overall long-term shareholder value. 
Next, I will define the business conditions and strategy for each segment as well as provide business insight on their performance for the quarter. Woody will provide some additional insights to the financial performance of these segments for the quarter as well as additional metrics we are now reporting. 
Turning to Slide 6. Served by our new Integrated Financial Solutions segment, U.S.-based regional and region and community institutions traditionally buy end-to-end integrated and outsourced solutions. These institutions are value partners that offer a total solution package and own an outsourced basis, investing in new ways that allowed them to more effectively compete with the largest global money center banks. Due to continued bank consolidation, this is a slower-growing, but solid market segments where FIS can leverage its scale and solution integration to generate attractive margin and to drive a significant highly recurring revenue base. The fundamentals of the IFS segment are strong. They had a good first quarter when looking beyond the lower term fees that will continue into Q2, but improve in the back half of the year. As banks continue to move beyond the increased burden of regulatory environment and economic recovery, we should see continued increase in investment decisions, which should also increase reported revenue growth in the back half of the year. From a sales standpoint for IFS, close to number of long term outsourcing deals, including a large multibillion-dollar back that is utilizing our core digital banking and processing capabilities, demonstrating our continued ability to deliver a comprehensive outsourced solution. 
Wealth management also continues to perform well for the company. As an example, we signed a new long-term agreement with Arjun Financial. This win combines our trust platform solutions for the full suite of outsourced back-office services. This agreement we just won of our wealth wins this quarter and a solid proof point of how last year's acquisition of Reliance Trust is creating new wealth management opportunities. 
These types of successes, coupled with others within our Integrated Financial Solutions segment, have allowed a year-over-year increase in new contract value sales for 5 consecutive quarters. Additionally, we just completed one of our largest client conferences hosting record client and prospect attendance. Feedback and client engagement was extremely positive with strong opportunities being generated as a result. 
Turning to the Global Financial Solutions segment. These clients have a greater demand for outcome-based, intellectual-property-led services and an increased willingness to outsource solutions and services to drive cost reductions and transformation. They have a strong desire to innovate, particularly in the consumer-oriented channels and value partners that have the agility to develop and bring solutions to market at scale and across geographic boundaries. 
This is a higher growth market where we generate lower margins due to the high makes up professional services, including consulting, IT integration and business process outsourcing. Over the last 4 quarters, our higher margin product sales in our GFI market have not met our expectations. Meanwhile our consulting business and our intellectual-property-led recurring services continue to accelerate causing us a mixed problem with regards to revenue and profits. 
Based on these results, and as Woody and I discussed on prior calls, we are restructuring our 2 former divisions of Global Financial Institutions and International Financial Institutions. As part of this restructuring, we also have moved all appropriate products and product sales that serve global requirements into our GFS segment. 
In making these adjustments, we expect margin expansion to occur over time in this segments as we gain scale and continue to rationalize our operations. The restructuring of these 2 significant additions will continue in Q2. These adjustments as well as the resolution to a number of the prior mentioned headwinds for the segment will accelerate our revenue and profit growth in the back half of the year. Despite these challenges, we did see a number of very nice wins in the quarter. We saw significant increases in our consulting business in Europe and North America and are in final negotiations on a number of key outsourcing transactions. Asia continues to be a strong market with rapid growth. We extended that success with the recently signed engagement with Karnataka Bank to deliver an entirely new e-lobby self-service channel. In addition, we continue our success in the auto finance market, signing a significant outsourcing agreement with the financial subsidiary of a top automobile manufacturer in North America. 
Turning to Slide 7. I'd like to summarize the quarter before I turn it over to Woody for the financial report by saying Q1 was clearly a more challenging quarter than expected for FIS. We continue to grow revenue and return cash to shareholders, demonstrating the consistency of our business model, but we did not achieve the results we had expected. The restructuring and resegmentation of our business enables us to achieve operational efficiencies and better combat timing and revenue mix changes that occur with large complex deals, such as in our GFS segment. Our new segmentation model better aligns our service and solution sets to clients bearing requirements and enables us to leverage FIS's scale to more effectively propel our clients business forward. We are confident that our business model, proven execution and deep client relationships will continue to enable us to drive profitable growth, maintain the strength of our balance sheet and return value to our shareholders. 
Woody will now provide details around our Q1 performance. Woody?"

I will begin on Slide 9 with the summary of our consolidated results for the quarter. The first quarter consolidated revenue increased 2% on a reported basis and 5% on a constant currency basis to $1.6 billion. EBITDA was $425 million, a decline of  5% from the prior year period, with EBITDA margin declined 190 basis points to 27.4% compared to 29.3% in the prior year. 
Non-GAAP adjusted net earnings from continuing operations decreased to $186 million from $199 million and adjusted earnings per share was $0.65 per share compared to $0.68 per share in the prior year period. 
Our results for the quarter reflect the negative impacts from lower termination fees; increased investment in our European capabilities; and the scope modification delay in a significant project, which adversely impacted quarter. In addition, the quarter was negatively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
Non-GAAP results for the quarter are adjusted to exclude $0.12 per share for acquisition-related purchase price amortization; $0.10 per share related to global restructuring activities; and $0.03 per share related to acquisition, integration and severance costs. 
The global restructuring charges is a result of our resegmentation and alignment of resources in our Global Financial Solutions segment. the activities relate primarily to Europe and are a combination of optimizing onshore and offshore resources as well as the removal of overlapping management resources. As Gary mentioned, we resegmented the business into 2 new reportable segments: The Integrated Financial Solutions segment and Global Financial Solutions segment. 
We are also providing additional financial and operating metrics, which we believe provide greater visibility and transparency into each segment and the key drivers we monitor to operate the business. These resegmentation provides flexibility and more clearly differentiates the market dynamics and gives better comparisons of our results with our competitors. I will now continue on Slide 10 for the first quarter segment results. 
In the first quarter, integrated Financial Solutions revenue grew 2% on a reported basis to $969 million. Termination fees were $28 million lower compared to the prior year period. Integrated Financial Solutions EBITDA for the quarter decreased 1% to $379 million. EBITDA margin was 39.1%, down from 40.2% in the prior period, primarily reflecting lower termination fees. 
Turning to Slide 11. You'll see new details on revenue contribution and growth from banking, business and payment solutions and revenue composition for the period. We're also providing metrics regarding outsourced accounts process and transaction volumes, both, which are key metrics underlying the recovery revenue the business. For the first quarter, this segment had 89% recurring revenue. Banking solutions grew 12%, driven by our acquisition of Reliance Trust and cross-selling and up selling new products into our existing clients. Business solutions grew 4%, primarily driven by card production. Our Payment Solutions revenue was down 4%, primarily driven by a termination fee headwind from the prior year period. 
Turning to Slide 12. In the first quarter, Global Financial Solutions revenue increased 1% on a reported basis to  $587 million. The reported results with GFS reflect a negative foreign currency translation revenue impact of $45 million for the quarter and the previously  announced nonrenewal of a nonbank contract. On a constant-currency basis, global revenue grew 8%. Global Financial Solutions EBITDA decreased 14% to $90 million. EBITDA margins were 15.4%. These results were adversely impacted by foreign currency exchange rates, the project delay; investment in expanding capabilities in the U.K.; lower-than-expected product sales and a heavier mix of services revenue, which was partially offset by cost actions and lower incentives for the quarter. 
Moving to Slide 13. You will see our reporting metrics for Global Financial Solutions. We are including revenue growth by region and constant currency. For the quarter, Asia-Pacific had strong growth of 45%, driven primarily by the India ATM deal and our expanding core banking presence in India. Europe grew 16% driven primarily by Clear2Pay and Capital Consulting. In North America, product sales and Information Technology outsourcing was lower than anticipated. And as expected Latin America revenue growth remains slower due to macroeconomic conditions. 
We are also disclosing the revenue composition for the segment. 73% of GFS' revenue is recurring in nature. The bottom half of the slide provides revenue by currency and our consulting and services headcount. The largest global and international banks, the target market of the GFS segment, continue to focus their spending on services and consulting. This drive strong revenue growth that creates margin headwind with the change in revenue mix. As disclosed in the 8-K filed a few weeks ago, corporate expenses directly related to supporting the segments, such as sales, finance and human resources, are now reflected in the segment results. For the quarter, corporate expenses not attributable directly to the segments were $44 million. Please refer to the appendix material in the presentation for more information on the businesses and products for both segments. 
Moving to Slide 14. We continue to reinvest in our business. Adjusted cash flow from operations totaled $315 million for the first quarter of 2015. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $101 million. We delivered free cash flow of $214 million for the quarter. These results are consistent with our previous guidance of free cash flow conversion to approximated net earnings. 
For the quarter, we returned $223 million to shareholders. $150 million was returned to shareholders through the repurchase of 2.2 million shares in the open market at an average cost of about $68 per share. The share repurchase programs drove a 2% decrease in our weighted average diluted share count to 286.8 million. 
We returned $73 million to shareholders through dividends. As of March 31, debt outstanding was $5.2 billion, resulting in a leverage ratio of 2.7x debt-to-EBITDA. The weighted average interest rate was 3% at the end of the quarter. 
Moving on to Slide 15. On April 9, we adjusted our outlook for the full year. There were a number of moving parts to that change, and I want to walk you through each one. 
First, M&A &A activity creates a tailwind reported growth of approximately 2%. This is comprised of a 3% tailwind from acquisitions, primarily Clear2Pay and Reliance Trust and a 1% headwind from divestitures, primarily the strategy gaming business; second, we announced the nonrenewal of a contract, which created a 1% headwind to reported growth. This contract was not a financial institution and had minimal profitability; third, we had a project delay in Europe and high-margin global product sales are not materializing as we anticipated, creating another 1% of headwind. Since providing our initial guidance on February 5, we have continued to see pressure from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This further decline of nondollar currencies is expected to about our full year reported growth by 4% or an additional 2% adverse change from our February guidance. 
We now expect reported revenue growth of 1% to 3%. 
Moving to Slide 16. In an effort to help with quarterly modeling of our full year outlook, I will add some color on the second quarter and full year. The second quarter of 2015 will continue to see headwinds and difficult comparisons. The prior year quarter included benefits of approximately $0.09 from termination fees and a discrete tax benefit. We do not expect to see similar benefits again in the second quarter of 2015. Foreign currency exchange rate headwinds and the project delay will also adversely impact the second quarter. Our restructuring efforts to address the shift in GFS sales mix will benefit the third and fourth quarters more heavily. 
Based on these factors we are now expecting second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.73 per diluted share. As discussed in the first half of the year is challenging. The second half of 2015 will drive more earnings per share as we anniversary difficult comparisons and see the impacts of cost actions taken. Further, we expect the project delay issue to be behind us. For the remainder of 2015, we expect reported revenue growth in the range of 1% to 3%. We expect margin expansion to continue into 2015, and we'll now be about 50 basis points. We expect 2015 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.27 to $3.37, which is a 6% to 9% increase over 2014.

We continue to see a lot of consolidation and acquisition in that space, as you're very aware in the U.S., that continues to be of consistent trend. So the sales teams is doing  a very nice job of selling through that and maintaining kind of consistent account volumes and that is attributed to our flow of growth in that segment. You do see one big, which is really an interesting anomaly. We had a very large bank that actually had an in-house developed system, where it's the only ones I can think that's happened like this in the last 3 or 4 years, and they actually migrated in-house on their in-house developed system. It was a simple product offerings. We extended a real robust services engagement firm. So that's the anomaly you seen on the drop there. When you go on to the ITO and BPO resources, frankly, that's all Brazil. As Woody mentioned, we've got some serious macroeconomic issues in Brazil. It's really growing slow, and it's transaction volumes come down. You'd expect your call center agents to come down as well. So that's what's going on into that, in that grouping."

One of the fixed the, but global market very consistently as we've gone through that, we disclosed to the market as well is as we felt that there was an opportunity to pull more higher margin product sales into that business, as you see and what we disclosed this quarter, I think it was 2%, was software license. What we continue see over the last 4 quarters is we continue to see some of our license engagement slide from quarter-to-quarter. We're not seeing other people win those, but we're also seeing that getting converted to complex services engagements, where we leverage our software, but frankly, it goes into either our outsourcing which we're actually seeing see a ramp up around in Europe around our banking utility we're building out. And so after 4 quarters of this consistently, we decide to actually take a former product division, which was IFI, and we took our former services division, GFI, and we're putting those together. So we're getting a lot of opportunity of moving some resources from very expensive countries to offshore. And as you know, that's been a consistent strategy for us for years. We've also gotten some synergies in management. We've also gotten some synergies and go-to-market. So you can tell by the severance cost, granted they're skewed with some so that's we have the resources been, but we have a lot of synergies between those 2 divisions. And that's going to continue through Q2 as we build-out the go-to-market. We also, as I mentioned in my script, there's a number of large outsourcing engagements we're in the final negotiations stage of as well. So that makes us feel confident that the services concept. So if you see what we disclosed, you'll see our intellectual property that services consistently growing quarter-over-quarter. And you'll see our software sales at a very small amount. So these 2 trends over the last year has allowed us to bring these things together. We think we've made the necessary actions. We feel confident with the pipeline and all of the services-led opportunities that we have in the pipeline and we're in final negotiations on a number of them."

It actually has gotten traction. It's just gotten more traction in more complex services and transformation, particularly can be attributed through seeing in that growth occur, so they continued to drag and penetrate very nicely in those global institutions with some large transformation or outsourcing deals. One of the things that's also interesting is a lot of that is leading into long-term contracts. So it's not a classic services business where you're having book and build in a very short time frame. We're getting a lot of long term. So that actually is gaining very nice traction. The issue for us is just the elimination of really the software license as a material component of that business. That was something that we saw transitioning after 2008. But frankly, it just, for whatever reason, as the market continues to evolve, that type of business is not coming back. And now those clients are really looking for ways that we can leverage our talent, drive their cost down and use our intellectual property to drive a different outcome for them. So really that GFI investment has done well. We did, as I just mentioned though, we -- as we went through the restructuring, we put these 2 groups together. We were able to get some efficiencies and some of our go-to-market overlap as well. So long-term, it's going to be of the outcome for this group."

If the dollar weakens a little bit, against these currencies, obviously, it wouldn't have as big of an impact. Very difficult to identify to figure out exactly what currencies may land. If you look at the euro and the rial, for example, I think they're down or have depreciated about 18% compared to this time last year. But you are right.

But clearly, the biggest headwind this group had is just consolidation in the industry, right? I mean, we continue to see acquisitions upper through the various different asset ranges within the space. Depending on what that continues to do, that will actually turn into a nice tailwind for IFS. But certainly, we think long term given our position, given our dominance in outsourcing in a number of the key markets, it's certainly a mid-single-digit grower for us. You see the margins that we generate out of that. Frankly, when you start really breaking out that group and comparing it to some of its competitors, you're going to see that the margin contribution, given the outsourced nature of the business is going to be superior to a lot of the competitors. So it's a very strong fundamental business. And we would expect that would -- growth over the long term would accelerate back into the mid-single digits, which frankly, as I said on adjusted basis, this term fees didn't fix it, if up over, that's exactly where we would've been this quarter, which is right about 5% and 7% on the EBITDA line. And so we would've gotten margin expansion and good mid-single digit growth. So it's really just the nature of how the acquisitions hit at any given point in time in that business, but fundamentally, it's a strong business and should continue to operate in that mid-single-digit range."

We had a lot of success in that region with the Challenger Bank. So that ended up having us build out scope to build out a much larger bank in utility, given some of that success. So I think it's a combination of those 2 things. As you know, I've been with the company 27 years. We've had project delays before. Any big company that would tell you they haven't had a project delay is not being accurate, but the reality is, this one kind of called us from those couple of factors. We definitely have made some changes in our program management function. Obviously, as we build out these capabilities in Europe, we've got to make sure that we have the talent that's applied to these projects to make sure they have high success.

And so we see good line of sight that we can continue to that growth in these large transformational engagements. Capital has been just an unbelievable acquisition for us.

Frankly, this was an IT Data Center engagement, and it was a very low-margin contract. The client wanted to have a reduction that was even lower that would make actually the agreement unprofitable. It's not just a strategic business for us. So what we just chose not to renew it. I mean, as I said expected the financial services industry whatsoever that assuages not going to provide a service at this kind of margins for a company and our shareholders. If you start getting into financial institutions, as I mentioned earlier question, we do continue to see a lot of competition or perhaps, even an oversupply in what I would say the traditional U.S. business, right? What we're now calling the Integrated Financial Solutions segment. So pricing is always going to be an issue, especially when you got what I would call a player. So you got a single product offering in the market or in that customer. Some of the pricing characteristics of that can be disproportion. You can also see opportunities were larger scale competitors of ours that will have a broader solution as they try to move upmarket. You can also see some oppressiveness run price.  When we get over in the global marketplace, it's a little different. You million dollars those large transformational project, there's always going to be an element of cost saves involved in those. That would be one of the reasons why our large acquisition would, but not only outsource because of some into the property and the capability would have, but they're looking for ways that through our best practices, we can drive those costs down, but we don't see as much aggression from some of the other profit providers because it's more of a long-term project-based that approach on those."

I think we've proven that over the last 2 years, we've really signed some very nice agreements and we've been able to deliver on those. And so we've seen the revenue and profit growth associated with those services. When you get the investments, to Woody's point, there are some good opportunities outside the U.S. for acquisition the Clear2Pay acquisition it's been a good win for us. That's a great example where they had some great IT capabilities are a payment of technology and the money center best, but best, but, heavy services oriented around deployment of that. So we continue to look at this opportunities. We also are continuing to invest in into the property for that market. We're seeing a lot of engagements with some of our largest clients where we'll come in and do a specific build leveraging some of our components, but then customizing it to their benefit, once again, through a services engagement. But you're right. I mean as we grow that business, the recruitment of talent is going to continue to be an important issue for us to monitor. I'll tell you, I mean, our consulting group, Capital is really a desirable place if you want to be in the consulting field in financial services to join so we're able to recruit very well on that space from a lot of the larger providers.

The team is very focused whereas in the past, we used to have that team being distracted to focus on things going on in the global markets even though the revenue didn't flow there. A lot of the R&D was going on in that group just over just because historically that's where it was. We know got to groups that truly own and to and all of their capabilities. They have the products that debuted in both markets. When you get over to global comp it's just that we've really moved no global from a sales engine to truly an end-to-end business. So no they've got the capability to invest or their product or deinvest in solutions that aren't working in that market. So in the simplest form, it's just oneoff accountability and focus that we think are going to drive much, much better results. We've been moving in this direction for a number of years. When we announced our strategy shift back in 2012, this was the direction we've been taking the company. It -- as you would expect, these are a lot of people to reorganize. And so fundamentally this was the last step in the strategy. It's overcoat to get people that have a lot more focus on accountability.

Thank you for joining us on today's call. Starting on Slide 5.

Thank you for joining us on today's call. 
Starting on Slide 5. We finished the quarter with an increase in revenue of $1.6 billion, reflecting a 2% reported revenue growth while adjusted earnings per share was down 4% from the prior year quarter. Fundamentally, our integrated Financial Solutions segment had a solid quarter, while our global Financial Solutions segment was presented with a number of challenges that will continue into Q2. In the quarter, we were negatively impacted in our global segment by changes in foreign exchange rates, continued slow higher margin product sales, a project delay on a previously announced large-scale transportational project and a large non-bank contract that did not meet our profitability metrics. We also experienced the lowest level of termination fees due to bank consolidation we have seen in the last 11 quarters. While this initially creates some challenges in our IFS segment first half comparisons, overall, it translates into a lower-client churn and replacement cost. Adjusted for these onetime fees, reported revenue growth would have resulted in 5% top line and 7% bottom line growth in the IFS segment. 
The combination of all these factors impacted our Q1 results and prompted the changing guidance for the quarter and the full year, which we announced on April 9. Consistent with our growth strategy and in line with me becoming CEO, we have resegmented the company to give great transparency around the drivers for FIS as well as highlight the potential value for expansion due to the 2 diverse businesses that we currently operate. These 2 segments are the Integrated Financial Solutions segment, which focuses primarily on regional and community-based financial institutions in the United States; and Global Financial Solutions segment, which asserts global and international financial institutions. We will continue to leverage our technology investment and scale across both market segments, while we capitalize on growth opportunities created by the fundamentally different needs and buying patterns of each of these respective markets. 
This segmentation will also enable more accurate comparison of these segments against the unique competitors in their respective markets to drive overall long-term shareholder value. 
Next, I'll define the business conditions and strategy for each segment as well as provide business insight on their performance in the quarter. Woody will provide some additional insights to the financial performance of these segments for the quarter as well as additional metrics we are now reporting. 
Turning to Slide 6. Served by our new Integrated Financial Solutions segment, U.S.-based regional and community institutions traditionally buy end-to-end integrated and outsourced solutions. These institutions value partners that offer a total solution package and own an outsourced basis, invest in new ways that allow them to more effectively compete with the largest global money center banks. Due to continued bank consolidations, this is a slower growing, but solid market segments where FIS can leverage its scale and solution integration to generate attractive margins and to drive a significant highly recurring revenue base. The fundamentals of the IFS segment are strong. They had a good first quarter when looking beyond the lower term fees that will continue into Q2, but improve in the back half of the year. As banks continue to move beyond the increased burden of regulatory environment and economic recovery, we should see continued increase in investment decisions, which should also increase reported revenue growth in the back half of the year. From a sales standpoint for IFS, we closed a number of long-term outsourcing deals, including a large multibillion-dollar bank that is utilizing our core digital banking and auto-processing capabilities, demonstrating our continued ability to deliver a comprehensive outsourced solution. 
Wealth management also continues to perform well for the company. As an example, we signed a new long-term agreement with Argent Financial. This win combines our trust platform solution with the full suite of outsourced back-office services. This agreement we've just one of our wealth wins this quarter and a solid proof point of how last year's acquisition of Reliance Trust is creating new wealth management opportunities. 
These types of successes, coupled with others within our Integrated Financial Solutions segment, have allowed a year-over-year increase in new contract value sales for 5 consecutive quarters. Additionally, we just completed one of our largest client conferences, hosting record client and prospect attendance. Feedback and client engagement was extremely positive with strong opportunities being generated as a result. 
Turning to the Global Financial Solutions segment. These clients have a greater demand for outcome-based, intellectual-property-led services and an increased willingness to outsource solutions and services to drive cost reductions and transformation. They have a strong desire to innovate, particularly in the consumer-oriented channels and value partners that have the agility to develop and bring solutions to market at scale and across geographic boundaries. 
This is the higher growth market where we generate lower margins due to the high mix of professional services, including consulting, IT integration and business process outsourcing. Over the last 4 quarters, our higher margin product sales in our GFI market have not met our expectations. Meanwhile our consulting business and our intellectual-property-led recurring services continue to accelerate, causing us a mixed problem with regards to revenue and profits. 
Based on these results, and as Woody and I've discussed on prior calls, we are restructuring our 2 former divisions of Global Financial Institutions and International Financial Institutions. As part of this restructuring, we also have moved all appropriate products and product sales that serve global requirements into our GFS segment. 
In making these adjustments, we expect margin expansion to occur over time in this segment as we gain scale and continue to rationalize our operations. The restructuring of these 2 significant additions will continue in Q2. These adjustments as well as the resolution to a number of the prior mentioned headwinds for this segment will accelerate our revenue and profit growth in the back half of the year. Despite these challenges, we did see a number of very nice wins in the quarter. We saw significant increases in our consulting business in Europe and North America and are in final negotiations on a number of key outsourcing transactions. Asia continues to be a strong market with rapid growth. We extended that success with the recently signed engagement with Karnataka Bank to deliver an entirely new e-lobby self-service channel. In addition, we continue our success in the auto finance market, signing a significant outsourcing agreement with the financial subsidiary of a top automobile manufacturer in North America. 
Turning to Slide 7. I'd like to summarize the quarter before I turn it over to Woody for the financial report by saying Q1 was clearly a more challenging quarter than expected for FIS. We continue to grow revenue and return cash to shareholders, demonstrating the consistency of our business model, but we did not achieve the results we had expected. The restructuring and resegmentation of our business enables us to achieve operational efficiencies and better combat timing and revenue mix changes that occur with large complex deals, such as in our GFS segment. Our new segmentation model better aligns our service and solution sets to clients bearing requirements and enables us to leverage FIS's scale to more effectively propel our clients business forward. We are confident that our business model, proven execution and deep client relationships will continue to enable us to drive profitable growth, maintain the strength of our balance sheet and return value to our shareholders. 
Woody will now provide details around our Q1 performance. Woody?"

I will begin on Slide 9 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter. The first quarter consolidated revenue increased 2% on a reported basis and 5% on a constant currency basis to $1.6 billion. EBITDA was $425 million, a decline of  5% from the prior year period, with EBITDA margin declining 190 basis points to 27.4% compared to 29.3% in the prior year. 
Non-GAAP adjusted net earnings from continuing operations decreased to $186 million from $199 million, and adjusted earnings per share was $0.65 per share compared to $0.68 per share in the prior year period. 
Our results for the quarter reflect the negative impacts from lower termination fees; increased investment in our European capabilities; and a scope modification delay in a significant project, which adversely impacted the quarter. In addition, the quarter was negatively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
Non-GAAP results for the quarter are adjusted to exclude $0.12 per share for acquisition-related purchase price amortization; $0.10 per share related to global restructuring activities; and $0.03 per share related to acquisition, integration and severance costs. 
The global restructuring charges is a result of our resegmentation and alignment of resources in our Global Financial Solutions segment. the activities relate primarily to Europe, and are a combination of optimizing onshore and offshore resources as well as the removal of overlapping management resources. As Gary mentioned, we resegmented the business into 2 new reportable segments: The Integrated Financial Solutions segment and Global Financial Solutions segment. 
We are also providing additional financial and operating metrics, which we believe provide greater visibility and transparency into each segment and the key drivers we monitor to operate the business. This resegmentation provides flexibility and more clearly differentiates the market dynamics and gives better comparisons of our results to our competitors. I will now continue on Slide 10 for the first quarter segment results. 
In the first quarter, Integrated Financial Solutions revenue grew 2% on a reported basis to $969 million. Termination fees were $28 million lower compared to the prior year period. Integrated Financial Solutions EBITDA for the quarter decreased 1% to $379 million. EBITDA margin was 39.1%, down from 40.2% in the prior year period, primarily reflecting lower termination fees. 
Turning to Slide 11. You'll see new details on revenue contribution and growth from banking, business and payment solutions and revenue composition for the period. We're also providing metrics regarding outsourced accounts process and transaction volumes, both, which are key metrics underlying the recurring revenue the business. For the first quarter, this segment had 89% recurring revenue. Banking solutions grew 12%, driven by our acquisition of Reliance Trust and cross-selling and upselling new products into our existing clients. Business solutions grew 4%, primarily driven by card production. Our Payment Solutions revenue was down 4%, primarily driven by a termination fee headwind from the prior year period. 
Turning to Slide 12. In the first quarter, Global Financial Solutions revenue increased 1% on a reported basis to $587 million. The reported results with GFS reflecting negative foreign currency translation revenue impact of $45 million for the quarter, and the previously  announced nonrenewal of a nonbank contract. On a constant-currency basis, global revenue grew 8%. Global Financial Solutions EBITDA decreased 14% to $90 million. EBITDA margins were 15.4%. These results were adversely impacted by foreign currency exchange rates, the project delay; investment in expanding capabilities in the U.K.; lower-than-expected product sales and a heavier mix of services revenue, which was partially offset by cost actions and lower incentives for the quarter. 
Moving to Slide 13. You will see our reporting metrics for Global Financial Solutions. We are including revenue growth by region and constant currency. For the quarter, Asia Pacific had strong growth of 45%, driven primarily by the India ATM deal and our expanding core banking presence in India. Europe grew 16%, driven primarily by Clear2Pay and Capco Consulting. In North America, product sales and Information Technology outsourcing was slower than anticipated. And as expected Latin America revenue growth remained slower due to macroeconomic conditions. 
We're also disclosing the revenue composition for the segment. 73% of GFS' revenue is recurring in nature. The bottom half of the slide provides revenue by currency and our consulting and services headcount. The largest global and international banks, the target market of the GFS segment, continue to focus their spending on services and consulting. This drives strong revenue growth that creates margin headwind with the change in revenue mix. As disclosed in the 8-K filed a few weeks ago, corporate expenses directly related to supporting the segments, such as sales, finance and human resources, are now reflected in the segment results. For the quarter, corporate expenses not attributable directly to the segments were $44 million. Please refer to the appendix material in the presentation for more information on the businesses and products for both segments. 
Moving to Slide 14. We continue to reinvest in our business. Adjusted cash flow from operations totaled $315 million for the first quarter of 2015. Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $101 million. We delivered free cash flow of $214 million for the quarter. These results are consistent with our previous guidance of free cash flow conversion to approximate adjusted net earnings. 
For the quarter, we returned $223 million to shareholders. $150 million was returned to shareholders through the repurchase of 2.2 million shares in the open market at an average cost of about $68 per share. The share repurchase program drove a 2% decrease in our weighted average diluted share count to 286.8 million. 
We returned $73 million to shareholders through dividends. As of March 31, debt outstanding was $5.2 billion, resulting in a leverage ratio of 2.7x debt-to-EBITDA. The weighted average interest rate was 3% at the end of the quarter. 
Moving on to Slide 15. On April 9, we adjusted our outlook for the full year. There were a number of moving parts to that change, and I want to walk you through each one. 
First, M&A activity creates a tailwind to reported growth of approximately 2%. This is comprised of a 3% tailwind from acquisitions, primarily Clear2Pay and Reliance Trust, and a 1% headwind from divestitures, primarily the Certegy Gaming business; second, we announced the nonrenewal of a contract, which created a 1% headwind to reported growth. This contract was not with a financial institution and had minimal profitability; third, we had a project delay in Europe and high-margin global product sales are not materializing as we anticipated, creating another 1% of headwind. Since providing our initial guidance on February 5, we have continued to see pressure from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This further decline of nondollar currencies is expected to impact our full year reported growth by 4%, or an additional 2% adverse change from our February guidance. 
We now expect reported revenue growth of 1% to 3%. 
Moving to Slide 16. In an effort to help with quarterly modeling of our full year outlook, I will add some color on the second quarter and full year. The second quarter of 2015 will continue to see headwinds and difficult comparisons. The prior year quarter included benefits of approximately $0.09 from termination fees and a discrete tax benefit. We do not expect to see similar benefits again in the second quarter of 2015. Foreign currency exchange rate headwinds and the project delay will also adversely impact the second quarter. Our restructuring efforts to address the shift in GFS sales mix will benefit the third and fourth quarters more heavily. 
Based on these factors we are now expecting second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.73 per diluted share. As discussed, the first half of the year is challenging. The second half of 2015 will drive more earnings per share as we anniversary difficult comparisons and see the impacts of cost actions taken. Further, we expect the project delay issue to be behind us. For the remainder of 2015, we expect reported revenue growth in the range of 1% to 3%. We expect margin expansion to continue into 2015, and we'll now be about 50 basis points. We expect 2015 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.27 to $3.37, which is a 6% to 9% increase over 2014. This will be more heavily weighted in the second half of the year based on the items described above, and we expect free cash flow to approximate adjusted net earnings. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the lines for questions."

As you're very aware in the U.S., that continues to be a consistent trend. So the sales teams doing a very nice job of selling through that and maintaining kind of consistent account volumes and that is attributing to our slower growth in that segment. You do see one big drop, which is really an interesting anomaly. We had a very large bank that actually had an in-house developed system, were the only ones I think that's happened like this in the last 3 or 4 years, and they actually migrated in-house on their in-house developed system. It's a simple product offerings. We extended a real robust services engagement for them. So that's the anomaly you see in the drop there. When you go on to the ITO and BPO resources, frankly, that's all Brazil. As Woody mentioned, we've got some serious macroeconomic issues in Brazil. It's really growing slow, and as transaction volumes come down you'd expect your call center agents to come down as well. So that's what's going on into that -- in that grouping."

One of the things we bought, looked at in the global market very consistently as we've gone to that, we've disclosed to the market as well is we felt that there was an opportunity that pulled more higher margin product sales into that business, as you see in what we disclosed this quarter, I think it was 2%, was software license. What we continued to see over the last 4 quarters is we continue to see some of our license engagement slide from quarter-to-quarter. We're not seeing other people win those, but we're also seeing them getting converted to complex services engagements, where we leverage our software. But frankly, it goes into either our outsourcing which we're actually seeing see a ramp up in Europe around our banking utility we're building out. And so after 4 quarters of this consistently, we decide to actually take our former product division, which was IFI, and we took our former services division, GFI, and we're putting those together. So we're getting a lot of opportunity of moving some resources from very expensive countries to offshore. And as you know, that's been a consistent strategy for us for years. We've also gotten some synergies in management. We've also gotten some synergies in go-to-market. So you can tell by the severance cost, granted they're skewed because some of the countries that we had the resources in, but we had a lot of synergies between those 2 divisions. And that's going to continue through Q2 as we build out the go-to-market. We also, as I mentioned in my script, there's a number of large outsourcing engagements we're in the final negotiation stage of as well. So that makes us feel confident that the services concept. So if you see what we disclosed, you'll see our intellectual-property-led services consistently growing quarter-over-quarter. And you'll see our software sales is a very small amount. So these 2 trends over the last year has allowed us to bring these things together. So we think we made the necessary actions. And we feel confident with the pipeline and all of the services-led opportunities that we have in the pipeline, and we're in final negotiations on a number of them."

It's just gotten traction in more complex services and transformation. It's -- really can be attributed to, as you are seeing that growth occur, so they continue to drag and penetrate very nicely in those global institutions with some large transformational outsourcing deals. One of the things that's also interesting is a lot of that's leading into long-term contracts. So it's not a classic services business where you're having to book and build on a very short time frame. We're getting a lot of long term. So that actually is gaining very nice traction. The issue for us is just the elimination of really the software license as a material component of that business. That was something that we saw transitioning after 2008. But frankly, it just, for whatever reason, as the market continues to evolve, that type of business is not coming back. And now those clients are really looking for ways that we can leverage our talent, drive their costs down and use our intellectual property to drive a different outcome for them. So really that GFI investment has done well. We did, as I just mentioned though, we -- as we went through the restructuring, and when we put these 2 groups together we were able to get some efficiencies in some of our go-to-market overlap as well. So long term, it's going to be a good outcome for this group."

If the dollar weakens a little bit, against these currencies, obviously, it wouldn't have as big of an impact. Very difficult, right now, to try to figure out exactly what currencies may land. If you look at the euro and the real, for example, I think they're down or have depreciated about 18% compared to this time last year. But you are right.

I mean, we continue to see acquisitions occur through the various different asset ranges within the space. Depending on what that continues to do, that will actually turn into a nice tailwind for IFS. But certainly, we think long term, given our position, given our dominance in outsourcing in a number of the key markets, it's certainly a mid-single-digit grower for us. You see the margins that we generate out of that. Frankly, when you start really breaking out that group and comparing it to some of its competitors, you're going to see that the margin contribution, given the outsourced nature of the business is going to be superior to a lot of the competitors. So it's a very strong fundamental business. And we would expect that would -- growth over the long term would accelerate back into the mid-single digits, which is frankly, as I said on adjusted basis, if term fees didn't exist, if that grow over, that's exactly where we would've been this quarter, which is right about 5% and 7% on the EBITDA line. So we would've gotten margin expansion and good mid-single digit growth.

Frankly, it was impacted by 2 things: One, it is a very large transformational project, and we're bringing this financial institution out of a very old legacy environment. So they have some issues on their side as well that would have actually -- that actually added to the delay. We also kind of had a perfect storm there. We had a lot of success in that region with the Challenger Bank. So that ended up having us build out scope to build out a much larger banking utility, given some of that success. So I think it's the combination of those 2 things. As you know, I've been with the company, 27 years. We had project delays before. Any big company that would tell you they haven't had a project delay is not being accurate, but the reality is, this one kind of called us from those couple of angles. We definitely have made some changes in our program management function. Obviously, as we build out these capabilities in Europe, we've got to make sure that we have the talent that's applied to these projects to make sure they have high success. But am I overly concerned about the project delay? I'm not. I think the team is very focused. And when I look at not only the sales success we've had to date, we've announced some of those, but when I look at the contracts that we're actively negotiating I feel very confident that the whole banking utility is going to be a very successful business for FIS going forward."

Frankly, this was an IT Data Center engagement, and it was a very low-margin contract. The client wanted to have a reduction, that was even lower that would make actually the agreement nonprofitable. It's not just a strategic business for us. So what we just chose not to renew it. I mean, as I said it wouldn't in the financial services industry whatsoever because we're just not going to provide a service at those kind of margins for our company and our shareholders. If you start getting into financial institutions, as I mentioned in earlier question, we do continue to see a lot of competition or perhaps, even an oversupply in what I would say the traditional U.S. business, right? What we're now calling the Integrated Financial Solutions segment. So pricing is always going to be an issue, especially when you got to what I would call a monoline player. So you got a single product offering in the market or in that customer. Some of the pricing characteristics of that can be disproportionate. You can also see opportunities where larger scale competitors of ours that will have a broader solution as they try to move upmarket. You can also see some aggressiveness around price. When we get over in the global marketplace, it's a little different. You're really, in those large transformational projects, there's always going to be an element of cost saves involved in those. That would be one of the reasons why our large global institution would not only outsource because we got some intellectual property and the capability we have, but they're looking for ways that through our best practices, we can drive those costs down. But we don't see as much aggression from some of the other profit providers because it's more of a long-term project-based type approach on those."

But most of our focus in that market would be larger community banks. So I'm draw in the greater than $1 billion. I mean, we might go down to greater than $500 million, but when you really get in the small end, a lot of our competitors, they have very nice share down in the smaller end of that market. And frankly, a lot of the consolidation at least the number of the units is occurring down on that low end. So we'll talk a lot about that on Monday. But basically, what you're seeing is actually the mid-tier is actually growing at greater than $1 billion because we've got clients that are trying to get the scale to build with the regulatory change and frankly, the complexity of all the technology that's being rolled out. And that's playing really to FIS's strength long term. We definitely will have some lumpiness due to term fees because when we add a large multibillion dollar bank get acquired, typically the term fees can be a very large number. As you see by evidenced by this quarter, but when you look at that greater $1 billion space, we continue to gain share in that market. We continue to see evidence when really 2 large institutions combine together that they look to FIS to outsource to, and so all of that will -- is going to be positive trends for IFS long term. But you won't hear on Monday that part of our strategies to push deeper in the lower end of the community bank market or frankly, in the low end of the credit union market. We'll certainly continue to be opportunistic there. We've got a number of customers there. We're going to serve them just as well as we serve any of them.

I think we've proven that over the last 2 years, we've really signed some very nice agreements and we've been able to deliver on those. And so -- and we've seen the revenue and profit growth associated with those services. When you get to investments, to Woody's point, there are some good opportunities outside the U.S. for acquisition. The Clear2Pay acquisition is been a good one for us. That's a great example where they had some great IT capabilities around payment of technology already in the money center banks, but once again, heavily services oriented around the deployment of that. So we'll continue to look at those opportunities. We also are continuing to invest in intellectual property for that market. We've seen a lot of engagements with some of our largest clients where we'll come in and do a specific build, leveraging some of our components, but then customizing it to their benefit, once again, through a services engagement. But you're right. I mean, as we grow that business, the recruitment of talent is going to continue to be an important issue for us to monitor. I'll tell you, I mean, our consulting group, Capco is really a desirable place if you wanted to be in the consulting field and financial services to join, so we're able to recruit very well on that space from a lot of the larger providers.

We've moved all our product, all of accountability, all of ownership in both unique segments. You've got the IFS segment, which is really -- it's just a dominant outsourcer in community banking. It's got the broadest product suite in the industry. The team is very focused, whereas in the past, we used to have that team being distracted to help focus on things going on in the global markets even though the revenue didn't flow there. A lot of the R&D was going on in that group just over -- just because historically that's where it was. We now got 2 groups that truly own end-to-end all their capabilities. They have the products that they need in both markets. When you get over to global, it's just that we've really moved now global from a sales engine to truly an end-to-end business. So now they've got the capability to invest in their products or deinvest in solutions that aren't working in that market. So in the simplest form, it's just one-off accountability and focus that we think are going to drive much, much better results. We've been moving in this direction for a number of years. When we announced our strategy shift back in 2012, this was the direction we've been taking the company. It -- as you would expect, these are a lot of people to reorganize. And so fundamentally, this was the last step in the strategy. And so we're going to get people that have lot more focus and accountability, right products. We're going to be able to make investments more effectively in those segments and then convey them to our investors on the returns we expect.

Thank you for joining us on today's call. 
Starting on Slide 5. We finished the quarter with an increase in revenue of $1.6 billion, reflecting a 2% reported revenue growth while adjusted earnings per share was down 4% from the prior year quarter. Fundamentally, our integrated Financial Solutions segment had a solid quarter, while our global Financial Solutions segment was presented with a number of challenges that will continue into Q2. In the quarter, we were negatively impacted in our global segment by changes in foreign exchange rates, continued slow higher margin product sales, a project delay on a previously announced large-scale transportational project and a large non-bank contract that did not meet our profitability metrics. We also experienced the lowest level of termination fees due to bank consolidation we have seen in the last 11 quarters. While this initially creates some challenges in our IFS segment first half comparisons, overall, it translates into a lower-client churn and replacement cost. Adjusted for these onetime fees, reported revenue growth would have resulted in 5% top line and 7% bottom line growth in the IFS segment. 
The combination of all these factors impacted our Q1 results and prompted the changing guidance for the quarter and the full year, which we announced on April 9. Consistent with our growth strategy and in line with me becoming CEO, we have resegmented the company to give great transparency around the drivers for FIS as well as highlight the potential value for expansion due to the 2 diverse businesses that we currently operate. These 2 segments are the Integrated Financial Solutions segment, which focuses primarily on regional and community-based financial institutions in the United States; and Global Financial Solutions segment, which serves global and international financial institutions. We will continue to leverage our technology investment and scale across both market segments, while we capitalize on growth opportunities created by the fundamentally different needs and buying patterns of each of these respective markets. 
This segmentation will also enable more accurate comparison of these segments against the unique competitors in their respective markets to drive overall long-term shareholder value. 
Next, I'll define the business conditions and strategy for each segment as well as provide business insight on their performance in the quarter. Woody will provide some additional insights to the financial performance of these segments for the quarter as well as additional metrics we are now reporting. 
Turning to Slide 6. Served by our new Integrated Financial Solutions segment, U.S.-based regional and community institutions traditionally buy end-to-end integrated and outsourced solutions. These institutions value partners that offer a total solution package and own an outsourced basis, invest in new ways that allow them to more effectively compete with the largest global money center banks. Due to continued bank consolidations, this is a slower growing, but solid market segments where FIS can leverage its scale and solution integration to generate attractive margins and to drive a significant highly recurring revenue base. The fundamentals of the IFS segment are strong. They had a good first quarter when looking beyond the lower term fees that will continue into Q2, but improve in the back half of the year. As banks continue to move beyond the increased burden of regulatory environment and economic recovery, we should see continued increase in investment decisions, which should also increase reported revenue growth in the back half of the year. From a sales standpoint for IFS, we closed a number of long-term outsourcing deals, including a large multibillion-dollar bank that is utilizing our core digital banking and auto-processing capabilities, demonstrating our continued ability to deliver a comprehensive outsourced solution. 
Wealth management also continues to perform well for the company. As an example, we signed a new long-term agreement with Argent Financial. This win combines our trust platform solution with the full suite of outsourced back-office services. This agreement we've just one of our wealth wins this quarter and a solid proof point of how last year's acquisition of Reliance Trust is creating new wealth management opportunities. 
These types of successes, coupled with others within our Integrated Financial Solutions segment, have allowed a year-over-year increase in new contract value sales for 5 consecutive quarters. Additionally, we just completed one of our largest client conferences, hosting record client and prospect attendance. Feedback and client engagement was extremely positive with strong opportunities being generated as a result. 
Turning to the Global Financial Solutions segment. These clients have a greater demand for outcome-based, intellectual-property-led services and an increased willingness to outsource solutions and services to drive cost reductions and transformation. They have a strong desire to innovate, particularly in the consumer-oriented channels and value partners that have the agility to develop and bring solutions to market at scale and across geographic boundaries. 
This is the higher growth market where we generate lower margins due to the high mix of professional services, including consulting, IT integration and business process outsourcing. Over the last 4 quarters, our higher margin product sales in our GFI market have not met our expectations. Meanwhile our consulting business and our intellectual-property-led recurring services continue to accelerate, causing us a mixed problem with regards to revenue and profits. 
Based on these results, and as Woody and I've discussed on prior calls, we are restructuring our 2 former divisions of Global Financial Institutions and International Financial Institutions. As part of this restructuring, we also have moved all appropriate products and product sales that serve global requirements into our GFS segment. 
In making these adjustments, we expect margin expansion to occur over time in this segment as we gain scale and continue to rationalize our operations. The restructuring of these 2 significant additions will continue in Q2. These adjustments as well as the resolution to a number of the prior mentioned headwinds for this segment will accelerate our revenue and profit growth in the back half of the year. Despite these challenges, we did see a number of very nice wins in the quarter. We saw significant increases in our consulting business in Europe and North America and are in final negotiations on a number of key outsourcing transactions. Asia continues to be a strong market with rapid growth. We extended that success with the recently signed engagement with Karnataka Bank to deliver an entirely new e-lobby self-service channel. In addition, we continue our success in the auto finance market, signing a significant outsourcing agreement with the financial subsidiary of a top automobile manufacturer in North America. 
Turning to Slide 7. I'd like to summarize the quarter before I turn it over to Woody for the financial report by saying Q1 was clearly a more challenging quarter than expected for FIS. We continue to grow revenue and return cash to shareholders, demonstrating the consistency of our business model, but we did not achieve the results we had expected. The restructuring and resegmentation of our business enables us to achieve operational efficiencies and better combat timing and revenue mix changes that occur with large complex deals, such as in our GFS segment. Our new segmentation model better aligns our service and solution sets to clients bearing requirements and enables us to leverage FIS's scale to more effectively propel our clients business forward. We are confident that our business model, proven execution and deep client relationships will continue to enable us to drive profitable growth, maintain the strength of our balance sheet and return value to our shareholders. 
Woody will now provide details around our Q1 performance. Woody?"

I will begin on Slide 9 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter. The first quarter consolidated revenue increased 2% on a reported basis and 5% on a constant currency basis to $1.6 billion. EBITDA was $425 million, a decline of 5% from the prior year period, with EBITDA margin declining 190 basis points to 27.4% compared to 29.3% in the prior year. 
Non-GAAP adjusted net earnings from continuing operations decreased to $186 million from $199 million, and adjusted earnings per share was $0.65 per share compared to $0.68 per share in the prior year period. 
Our results for the quarter reflect the negative impacts from lower termination fees; increased investment in our European capabilities; and a scope modification delay of a significant project, which adversely impacted the quarter. In addition, the quarter was negatively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
Non-GAAP results for the quarter are adjusted to exclude $0.12 per share for acquisition-related purchase price amortization; $0.10 per share related to global restructuring activities; and $0.03 per share related to acquisition, integration and severance costs. 
The global restructuring charges is a result of our resegmentation and alignment of resources in our Global Financial Solutions segment. the activities relate primarily to Europe, and are a combination of optimizing onshore and offshore resources as well as the removal of overlapping management resources. As Gary mentioned, we resegmented the business into 2 new reportable segments: The Integrated Financial Solutions segment and Global Financial Solutions segment. 
We are also providing additional financial and operating metrics, which we believe provide greater visibility and transparency into each segment and the key drivers we monitor to operate the business. This resegmentation provides flexibility and more clearly differentiates the market dynamics and gives better comparisons of our results to our competitors. I will now continue on Slide 10 for the first quarter segment results. 
In the first quarter, Integrated Financial Solutions revenue grew 2% on a reported basis to $969 million. Termination fees were $28 million lower compared to the prior year period. Integrated Financial Solutions EBITDA for the quarter decreased 1% to $379 million. EBITDA margin was 39.1%, down from 40.2% in the prior year period, primarily reflecting lower termination fees. 
Turning to Slide 11. You'll see new details on revenue contribution and growth from banking, business and payment solutions and revenue composition for the period. We're also providing metrics regarding outsourced accounts process and transaction volumes, both, which are key metrics underlying the recurring revenue the business. For the first quarter, this segment had 89% recurring revenue. Banking solutions grew 12%, driven by our acquisition of Reliance Trust and cross-selling and upselling new products into our existing clients. Business solutions grew 4%, primarily driven by card production. Our Payment Solutions revenue was down 4%, primarily driven by a termination fee headwind from the prior year period. 
Turning to Slide 12. In the first quarter, Global Financial Solutions revenue increased 1% on a reported basis to $587 million. The reported results with GFS reflecting negative foreign currency translation revenue impact of $45 million for the quarter, and the previously  announced nonrenewal of a nonbank contract. On a constant-currency basis, global revenue grew 8%. Global Financial Solutions EBITDA decreased 14% to $90 million. EBITDA margins were 15.4%. These results were adversely impacted by foreign currency exchange rates, the project delay; investment in expanding capabilities in the U.K.; lower-than-expected product sales and a heavier mix of services revenue, which was partially offset by cost actions and lower incentives for the quarter. 
Moving to Slide 13. You will see our reporting metrics for Global Financial Solutions. We are including revenue growth by region in constant currency. For the quarter, Asia Pacific had strong growth of 45%, driven primarily by the India ATM deal and our expanding core banking presence in India. Europe grew 16%, driven primarily by Clear2Pay and Capco Consulting. In North America, product sales and Information Technology outsourcing was slower than anticipated. And as expected Latin America revenue growth remained slower due to macroeconomic conditions. 
We're also disclosing the revenue composition for the segment. 73% of GFS' revenue is recurring in nature. The bottom half of the slide provides revenue by currency and our consulting and services headcount. The largest global and international banks, the target market of the GFS segment, continue to focus their spending on services and consulting. This drives strong revenue growth that creates margin headwind with the change in revenue mix. As disclosed in the 8-K filed a few weeks ago, corporate expenses directly related to supporting the segments, such as sales, finance and human resources, are now reflected in the segment results. For the quarter, corporate expenses not attributable directly to the segments were $44 million. Please refer to the appendix material in the presentation for more information on the businesses and products for both segments. 
Moving to Slide 14. We continue to reinvest in our business. Adjusted cash flow from operations totaled $315 million for the first quarter of 2015. Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $101 million. We delivered free cash flow of $214 million for the quarter. These results are consistent with our previous guidance of free cash flow conversion to approximate adjusted net earnings. 
For the quarter, we returned $223 million to shareholders. $150 million was returned to shareholders through the repurchase of 2.2 million shares in the open market at an average cost of about $68 per share. The share repurchase program drove a 2% decrease in our weighted average diluted share count to 286.8 million. 
We returned $73 million to shareholders through dividends. As of March 31, debt outstanding was $5.2 billion, resulting in a leverage ratio of 2.7x debt-to-EBITDA. The weighted average interest rate was 3% at the end of the quarter. 
Moving on to Slide 15. On April 9, we adjusted our outlook for the full year. There were a number of moving parts to that change, and I want to walk you through each one. 
First, M&A activity creates a tailwind to reported growth of approximately 2%. This is comprised of a 3% tailwind from acquisitions, primarily Clear2Pay and Reliance Trust, and a 1% headwind from divestitures, primarily the Certegy Gaming business; second, we announced the nonrenewal of a contract, which created a 1% headwind to reported growth. This contract was not with a financial institution and had minimal profitability; third, we had a project delay in Europe and high-margin global product sales are not materializing as we anticipated, creating another 1% of headwind. Since providing our initial guidance on February 5, we have continued to see pressure from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This further decline of nondollar currencies is expected to impact our full year reported growth by 4%, or an additional 2% adverse change from our February guidance. 
We now expect reported revenue growth of 1% to 3%. 
Moving to Slide 16. In an effort to help with quarterly modeling of our full year outlook, I will add some color on the second quarter and full year. The second quarter of 2015 will continue to see headwinds and difficult comparisons. The prior year quarter included benefits of approximately $0.09 from termination fees and a discrete tax benefit. We do not expect to see similar benefits again in the second quarter of 2015. Foreign currency exchange rate headwinds and the project delay will also adversely impact the second quarter. Our restructuring efforts to address the shift in GFS sales mix will benefit the third and fourth quarters more heavily. 
Based on these factors we are now expecting second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.73 per diluted share. As discussed, the first half of the year is challenging. The second half of 2015 will drive more earnings per share as we anniversary difficult comparisons and see the impacts of cost actions taken. Further, we expect the project delay issue to be behind us. For the remainder of 2015, we expect reported revenue growth in the range of 1% to 3%. We expect margin expansion to continue into 2015, and we'll now be about 50 basis points. We expect 2015 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.27 to $3.37, which is a 6% to 9% increase over 2014. This will be more heavily weighted in the second half of the year based on the items described above, and we expect free cash flow to approximate adjusted net earnings. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the lines for questions."

As we talked about the Integrated Financial Solutions segment. We continue to see a lot of consolidation and acquisition in that space. As you're very aware in the U.S., that continues to be a consistent trend. So the sales teams doing a very nice job of selling through that and maintaining kind of consistent account volumes and that is attributing to our slower growth in that segment. You do see one big drop, which is really an interesting anomaly. We had a very large bank that actually had an in-house developed system, one of the only ones I think that's happened like this in the last 3 or 4 years, and they actually migrated in-house on their in-house developed system. It's a simple product offerings. We extended a real robust services engagement for them. So that's the anomaly you see in the drop there. When you go on to the ITO and BPO resources, frankly, that's all Brazil. As Woody mentioned, we've got some serious macroeconomic issues in Brazil. It's really growing slow, and as transaction volumes come down you'd expect your call center agents to come down as well. So that's what's going on into that -- in that grouping."

One of the things we bought, looked at in the global market very consistently as we've gone to that, we've disclosed to the market as well is we felt that there was an opportunity to pull more higher margin product sales into that business, as you see in what we disclosed this quarter, I think it was 2%, was software license. What we continued to see over the last 4 quarters is we continue to see some of our license engagement slide from quarter-to-quarter. We're not seeing other people win those, but we're also seeing them getting converted to complex services engagements, where we leverage our software. But frankly, it goes into either our outsourcing which we're actually seeing see a ramp up in Europe around our banking utility we're building out. And so after 4 quarters of this consistently, we decide to actually take our former product division, which was IFI, and we took our former services division, GFI, and we're putting those together. So we're getting a lot of opportunity of moving some resources from very expensive countries to offshore. And as you know, that's been a consistent strategy for us for years. We've also gotten some synergies in management. We've also gotten some synergies in go-to-market. So you can tell by the severance cost, granted they're skewed because some of the countries that we had the resources in, but we had a lot of synergies between those 2 divisions. And that's going to continue through Q2 as we build out the go-to-market. We also, as I mentioned in my script, there's a number of large outsourcing engagements we're in the final negotiation stage of as well. So that makes us feel confident that the services concept. So if you see in what we disclosed, you'll see our intellectual-property-led services consistently growing quarter-over-quarter. And you'll see our software sales is a very small amount. So these 2 trends over the last year has allowed us to bring these things together. So we think we made the necessary actions. And we feel confident with the pipeline and all of the services-led opportunities that we have in the pipeline, and we're in final negotiations on a number of them."

It's just gotten traction in more complex services and transformation. It's -- really can be attributed to, as you are seeing that growth occur, so they continue to drag and penetrate very nicely in those global institutions with some large transformational outsourcing deals. One of the things that's also interesting is a lot of that's leading into long-term contracts. So it's not a classic services business where you're having to book and build on a very short time frame. We're getting a lot of long term. So that actually is gaining very nice traction. The issue for us is just the elimination of really the software license as a material component of that business. That was something that we saw transitioning after 2008. But frankly, it just, for whatever reason, as the market continues to evolve, that type of business is not coming back. And now those clients are really looking for ways that we can leverage our talent, drive their costs down and use our intellectual property to drive a different outcome for them. So really that GFI investment has done well. We did, as I just mentioned though, we -- as we went through the restructuring, and when we put these 2 groups together we were able to get some efficiencies in some of our go-to-market overlap as well.

But clearly, the biggest headwind this group has is just consolidation in the industry, right? I mean, we continue to see acquisitions occur through the various different asset ranges within the space. Depending on what that continues to do, that will actually turn into a nice tailwind for IFS. But certainly, we think long term, given our position, given our dominance in outsourcing in a number of the key markets, it's certainly a mid-single-digit grower for us. You see the margins that we generate out of that. Frankly, when you start really breaking out that group and comparing it to some of its competitors, you're going to see that the margin contribution, given the outsourced nature of the business is going to be superior to a lot of the competitors. So it's a very strong fundamental business. And we would expect that would -- growth over the long term would accelerate back into the mid-single digits, which is frankly, as I've said on adjusted basis, if term fees didn't exist, if that grow over, that's exactly where we would've been this quarter, which is right about 5% and 7% on the EBITDA line. So we would've gotten margin expansion and good mid-single digit growth. So it's really just the nature of how the acquisitions hit at any given point in time in that business, but fundamentally, it's a strong business and should continue to operate in that mid-single-digit range."

So they have some issues on their side as well that would have actually -- that actually added to the delay. We also kind of had a perfect storm there. We had a lot of success in that region with the Challenger Bank. So that ended up having us build out scope to build out a much larger banking utility, given some of that success. So I think it's the combination of those 2 things. As you know, I've been with the company, 27 years. We've had project delays before. Any big company that would tell you they haven't had a project delay is not being accurate, but the reality is, this one kind of caught us from those couple of angles. We definitely have made some changes in our program management function. Obviously, as we build out these capabilities in Europe, we've got to make sure that we have the talent that's applied to these projects to make sure they have high success. But am I overly concerned about the project delay? I'm not. I think the team is very focused. And when I look at not only the sales success we've had to date, we've announced some of those, but when I look at the contracts that we're actively negotiating, I feel very confident that the whole banking utility is going to be a very successful business for FIS going forward."

It's not just a strategic business for us. So what we just chose not to renew it. I mean, as I said it wouldn't in the financial services industry whatsoever because we're just not going to provide a service at those kind of margins for our company and our shareholders. If you start getting into financial institutions, as I mentioned in earlier question, we do continue to see a lot of competition or perhaps, even an oversupply in what I would say the traditional U.S. business, right? What we're now calling the Integrated Financial Solutions segment. So pricing is always going to be an issue, especially when you got to what I would call a monoline player. So you got a single product offering in the market or in that customer. Some of the pricing characteristics of that can be disproportionate. You can also see opportunities where larger scale competitors of ours that will have a broader solution as they try to move upmarket. You can also see some aggressiveness around price. When we get over in the global marketplace, it's a little different. You're really, in those large transformational projects, there's always going to be an element of cost saves involved in those. That would be one of the reasons why our large global institution would not only outsource because we got some intellectual property and the capability we have, but they're looking for ways that through our best practices, we can drive those costs down.

A good bit of that is in Europe, where you got a higher level of severance, if you will, associated with removing headcount. The vast majority of that will be in the third and the fourth quarter, Glenn, and we're looking at in the range of probably 70% of our savings in the third and the fourth quarter this year compared to the charge. So you definitely will see benefits there. Some of those benefits will flow through and anniversary into 2016 as well. But most of it is going to hit the third and the fourth quarter in terms of benefit. As we transition in onshore, or offshore, some of those resources, and then, obviously, the pure management overlaps will take place a little faster than that."

But most of our focus in that market would be larger community banks. So I'd draw you in the greater than $1 billion. I mean, we might go down to greater than $500 million, but when you really get in the small end, a lot of our competitors, they have very nice share down in the smaller end of that market. And frankly, a lot of the consolidation at least the number of the units is occurring down on that low end. So we'll talk a lot about that on Monday. But basically, what you're seeing is actually the mid-tier is actually growing, that greater than $1 billion because we've got clients that are trying to get the scale to deal with the regulatory change and frankly, the complexity of all the technology that's being rolled out. And that's playing really to FIS's strength long term. We definitely will have some lumpiness due to term fees because when we add a large multibillion dollar bank get acquired, typically the term fees can be a very large number as you see by evidenced by this quarter. But when you look at that greater $1 billion space, we continue to gain share in that market. We continue to see evidence when really 2 large institutions combine together that they look to FIS to outsource to, and so all of that will -- is going to be positive trends for IFS long term. But you won't hear on Monday that part of our strategies to push deeper in the lower end of the community bank market or frankly, in the low end of the credit union market. We'll certainly continue to be opportunistic there. We've got a number of customers there. We're going to serve them just as well as we serve any of them.

I think we've proven that over the last 2 years, we've really signed some very nice agreements and we've been able to deliver on those. And so -- and we've seen the revenue and profit growth associated with those services. When you get to investments, to Woody's point, there are some good opportunities outside the U.S. for acquisition. The Clear2Pay acquisition is been a good one for us. That's a great example where they had some great IT capabilities around payment of technology already in the money center banks, but once again, heavily services oriented around the deployment of that. So we'll continue to look at those opportunities. We also are continuing to invest in intellectual property for that market. We've seen a lot of engagements with some of our largest clients where we'll come in and do a specific build, leveraging some of our components, but then customizing it to their benefit, once again, through a services engagement. But you're right. I mean, as we grow that business, the recruitment of talent is going to continue to be an important issue for us to monitor. I'll tell you, I mean, our consulting group, Capco is really a desirable place if you wanted to be in the consulting field and financial services to join, so we're able to recruit very well on that space from a lot of the larger providers.

We've moved all our product, all of accountability, all of ownership in both unique segments. You've got the IFS segment, which is really -- it's just a dominant outsourcer in community banking. It's got the broadest product suite in the industry. The team is very focused, whereas in the past, we used to have that team being distracted to help focus on things going on in the global markets even though the revenue didn't flow there. A lot of the R&D was going on in that group just over -- just because historically that's where it was. We've now got 2 groups that truly own end-to-end all their capabilities. They have the products that they need in both markets. When you get over to global, it's just that we've really moved now global from a sales engine to truly an end-to-end business. So now they've got the capability to invest in their products or deinvest in solutions that aren't working in that market. So in the simplest form, it's just one-off accountability and focus that we think are going to drive much, much better results. We've been moving in this direction for a number of years. When we announced our strategy shift back in 2012, this was the direction we've been taking the company. It -- as you would expect, these are a lot of people to reorganize. And so fundamentally, this was the last step in the strategy. And so we're going to get people that have lot more focus and accountability, right products. We're going to be able to make investments more effectively in those segments and then convey them to our investors on the returns we expect.

If you look, the services fees from a professional services consulting piece is very small in IFS. We don't have a lot of that type of revenue driven.

Thank you for joining us on today's call.Starting on Slide 5.

Thank you for joining us on today's call.
Starting on Slide 5. We finished the quarter with reported revenue of $1.6 billion, which is an increase of 3% on a constant currency basis and delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.74 while returning $224 million to shareholders. Year-to-date, we have returned $447 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
We continue to invest for growth in order to consistently deliver shareholder returns and generate significant recurring revenue. We saw strong deal closure in the quarter and continued to drive long-term client relationships. We are pleased with the recent restructuring and resegmentation of our business, which has allowed us to align our service and solution portfolio to address clients' unique business challenges.
As we discussed in the first quarter call, we continued to experience a lower-than-expected termination fees in 2015. This is a positive long-term outcome. Our earnings per share for the second quarter were better than expected, and we remain on track with our current guidance for the year.
Moving to Slide 6, I'll speak to our segment activity in the quarter. As a reminder, our 2 segments were created to meet the demands of 2 distinct markets, driven by different buying behaviors and growth profiles. These segments allow us to more effectively sell, deliver and support the clients in these distinct markets. The Integrated Financial Solutions segment is comprised of U.S. financial institutions seeking comprehensive integrated and outsourced solutions. This segment drives high reoccurring revenue, generates significant cash flow and drives higher margins with expansion through increased leverage. Our Global Financial Solutions segment is comprised of large global and international clients seeking tailored solutions, leveraging a combination of products, consulting and professional services. This segment typically drives lower margin and has a higher revenue growth profile.
In the quarter, FIS had 89% of its revenue recurring. Deal closure in FIS was solid this quarter with many new wins. FIS was chosen by Pacific Western Bank, a $17 billion financial institution, to replace its retail and commercial banking platform including core processing, commercial lending, consumer and business eBanking, digital, mobile, EFT, item processing and branch technology. This decision was driven by the bank's desire to better position itself for future growth. 
In another long-term agreement, a $70 billion regional bank chose FIS to provide an end-to-end consumer loan servicing solution. This solution better positions the bank to grow and service its lending business.
Also, UMB, an $18 billion institution, made the decision to partner with FIS on its loan portfolio, moving for the first time from an internally hosted platform to an FIS-hosted processing model to gain processing efficiencies and more robust lending functionality. 
Finally, we signed several new digital banking and payments agreements including one with Centennial bank, an $8 billion community bank who was seeking a new strategic technology partner in support of the bank's initiative to upgrade its digital channels including consumer and business eBanking as well as wire automation solutions. All of these wins demonstrate our ability to capitalize on increasing industry demand for solutions that enhance an institution's ability to meet its strategic growth and operational goals.
Turning to our Global Financial Solutions segment, revenue increased 8% on a constant currency basis. We continue to invest for growth in this segment and continued to see steady progress in signing long-term deals. Deal closure was solid as we continue to benefit from the demand for our solutions. 
In Asia, we saw strong growth from continued expansion of our core banking and payments process across the region. During the quarter, we continued to expand existing relationships as well as sign multiple new engagements resulting in a growth rate of 29% on a constant currency basis for the quarter. In Europe, we continue to see new opportunities in the emerging challenging bank market. In the quarter, FIS became the strategic technology partner for the newly announced Adam [ph] Bank, the U.K.'s first digital-only based bank. We also signed another significant agreement with Credit Agricole the leader in consumer credit business in the Netherlands, expanding our existing relationship through the addition of real-time core processing capabilities. In North America, our top 10 U.S. Bank signed a multiyear software and services deal to utilize FIS's leading consumer lending product. This continues to solidify our advanced loan system as the leading consumer lending package in large progressive banks throughout the world.
Turning to Slide 7. I'd like to summarize the quarter before I turn it over to Woody for the financial report. We continue to grow revenue and return cash to shareholders. The restructuring and resegmentation of our business have allowed us to achieve operational efficiencies, leverage our scale globally and better align our services and solutions to address clients' business challenges. We're confident that our proven execution and deep client relationships will continue to enable us to invest for growth, maintain the strength of our balance sheet and return value to our shareholders. 
Woody will now provide details around the Q2 performance. Woody?"
10081196,306094806,836396,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2015",2015-07-23,"Earnings Calls","Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 9 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter. In the second quarter, as expected, we continued to face difficult comparisons. Consolidated revenue was $1.6 billion, an increase of 3% on a constant currency",1259,"Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 9 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter. In the second quarter, as expected, we continued to face difficult comparisons. Consolidated revenue was $1.6 billion, an increase of 3% on a constant currency basis. EBITDA was $453 million and the EBITDA margin was 28.5%. Non-GAAP adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $211 million for the quarter and $397 million for the first 6 months of 2015. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.74 for the second quarter. 
Our highly recurring revenue model, combined with several new wins Gary mentioned earlier, helped us maintain consistent overall results despite the continued low termination fees, increased investment in European capabilities and FX headwinds, particularly in Brazil and Europe. FX translation held back revenue by $63 million for the quarter and EPS by $0.03.
Non-GAAP results for the quarter are adjusted to exclude $0.12 per share for acquisition-related purchase price amortization, $0.03 per share related to acquisition, integration and severance costs and a $0.25 per share gain related to the previously announced divestiture of our gaming business. This sale generated $238 billion in pretax proceeds. We are continuing to provide certain check guaranty services to the buyer and, accordingly, are not treating this divestiture as discontinued operation for accounting purposes. 
I will now continue on Slide 10 for second quarter segment results. In the second quarter, Integrated Financial Solutions revenue was $969 million, which was flat to prior year revenue. EBITDA was $378 million, which was also flat to 2014. EBITDA margins were 39%, a slight drop of 20 basis points. This margin decline primarily reflects continued low termination fees, which were $14 million lower than the prior year period. NIFS year-to-date term fees are lower than 2014 by $42 million. As we discussed in the past, lower acquisition-related term fees have an immediate impact in terms of difficult comparisons but create longer-term value as we retain profitable long-term relationships with our clients. Normalizing the quarter for onetime items including divestiture activities and lower term fees, IFS revenue growth would've been 3.6% speaking to the strength of the underlying business. 
Turning to Slide 11. As you saw in the first quarter, the IFS business consistently produced strong recurring revenues with diverse offerings helping to deliver consistent performance within the segment. IFS again produced 89% recurring revenue. 
Our Payment Solutions revenue was down 3%. This was driven by lower pass-through revenues, divestitures and pricing pressure, partially offset by transaction volume growth. Business solutions revenue grew 5%, primarily driven by card production activities. Banking solutions revenue were flat compared to the prior year, driven by the difficult comparisons discussed earlier. 
Turning to Slide 12. In the second quarter, Global Financial Solutions reported revenue was $619 million. The second quarter reported results for GFS reflecting negative foreign currency translation revenue impact of $63 million. The majority of FX translation impact was concentrated in the Brazilian real and euro. On a constant currency basis, GFS revenue grew 8% for the quarter and 8% for the first half of 2015. As anticipated, we continue to see a strong U.S. dollar for the back half of 2015, and FX translation will continue to be a headwind. Global Financial Solutions EBITDA was $123 million compared to $126 million in the prior period. EBITDA was $135 million or 7% higher on a constant currency basis in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the prior year period. EBITDA margins were 19.8% compared to 20% in the prior year period. 
Moving to Slide 13. Year-to-date 2015, 70% of GFS revenues were recurring in nature, consistent with historical performance. For the second quarter, Asia Pacific had strong revenue growth of 29% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by our expanding core banking and payments presence in India. As Gary described, we are pleased with several new signings and the ability for the team to expand existing relationships in the region. We expect the Asia Pacific region to continue to be a strong grower for GFS. 
Europe grew 25% on a constant currency basis due primarily by our continued success with the challenging banks in the U.K., revenue growth from Clear2Pay and consulting revenue growth. We also expanded an already meaningful relationship with Crédit Agricole. 
In the North American region GFS revenues were $277 million compared to $287 million in the prior year period. The primary driver of the change was our previously announced nonrenewal of a contract discussed in Q1. As Gary mentioned, the underlying business had some nice wins including a large deal in our end-to-end lending solutions.
As expected, Latin America revenue growth remains modest due to macroeconomic conditions in Brazil. When we resegmented the company, in the first quarter, corporate functions directly supporting IFS and GFS were moved into the individual segment results. Residual corporate expenses were $48 million for the quarter. We expect corporate expense to trend down in the back half of the year as we continue to focus on cost actions to improve profitability.
Other income included a gain on the sale of an investment of $7 million. The effective tax rate was 33.4% for the quarter compared to 30.2% for the prior year quarter. As previously mentioned, the prior year quarter included an approximate $0.04 EPS benefit due to a discrete tax benefit.
We continue to reinvest in the business. Adjusted cash flow from operations totaled $197 million in the second quarter of 2015. Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $117 million, resulting in free cash flow of $79 million for the quarter. The $117 million in capital expenditures is higher than normal, primarily due to the timing of certain investments. For the year, we expect capital expenditures to be in line with our previous guidance of 5% to 6% of revenue. We still anticipate full year free cash flow to approximate net earnings. 
For the quarter, we returned $224 million to shareholders. Approximately $150 million was returned to shareholders through the repurchase of 2.3 [ph] million shares in the open market at an average cost of $64.36 per share. The share repurchase program was open in our weighted average diluted share count of 284.4. Basic shares outstanding at the end of the period were 280 million. Approximately $1.2 million remain on our existing purchase authorization program. In addition, we returned $74 million to shareholders through dividends.
Maintaining a strong balance sheet remains a key component of our capital allocation strategy. As of June 30, debt outstanding was $5 billion, [indiscernible] a leverage ratio of approximately 2.7x debt to EBITDA. This is slightly above our target of 2.5x leverage ratio based primarily on the timing of cash flows. We expect our leverage ratio to be at 2.5x by the end of the year. The weighted average interest rate was 3% at the end of the quarter.
Moving to Slide 15. Our sales execution in the quarter was a tailwind to our Q2 results. A few of the deals were signed more quickly than originally planned, helping to flatten out our back half of the year growth curve. For the full year 2015, we continue to expect reported revenue growth in the range of 1% to 3%; margin expansion for the full year of approximately 50 basis points, 2015 adjusted earnings per share in a range of $3.27 to $3.37, which is a 6% to 9% increase over 2014; and we expect full year free cash flow to approximate adjusted net earnings. Back that concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the lines for question."

Primarily, we got natural acceleration in the first half versus the second half. If you look over the past 4 years or so, that's been probably 3% first half versus second half in terms of accelerated growth. The second would be term fees. As we've talked about, term fees in the first half this year were about $42 million lower than last year. We do anticipate more term fees in the back half of the year and have pretty good visibility into them. Reiterating that, low term fees is a good thing for us long term. It does create some lumpiness, but it's a good thing for us long term. The third will be the cost action. The cost actions that we took in the first quarter, you've seen some of that kick in, in terms of the margin, in terms of the profitability growth, and we've got more cost levers in the back half if sales execution doesn't come where we need to be. And then the fourth will be our contract delay that we mentioned in the fourth quarter. As it's gotten back on track, you saw some lift in Q2 from it and we believe we'll see further lift in the second half of the year. So those are really the 4 main drivers, David, and we've got pretty good visibility into them, particularly on the cost levers side."

So we see some bright spots in execution, David. We're going to continue to monitor it. As we said in the first quarter, we took that opportunity when we weren't seeing the product pull-through that we necessarily wanted. We restructured the company and actually brought 2 major divisions together. We've seen some nice synergies come through that and operating efficiencies that Woody pointed to in the back half. But what I'd tell you, we wouldn't do the investment again. No, I wouldn't. It's an important market for us. Being able to penetrate our product and services in those markets is going to be a long-term success criteria at FIS. So this quarter showed a number of good signs of product pull-throughs."

In terms of the margin profile, you are seeing some of our cost actions start to kick in. They're driving some incremental margin benefit, to answer your first question. To answer your second question, when you look at the back half of the year, a significant component of the back half of the year growth is both in term fees, which we talked about which is going very high incremental margins. And the majority of the cost actions are driving benefit in the second half of the year. As you heard me talk about, trending corporate expense is down as well as -- and the operations are driving some expense reduction as well. Both of those will help drive margin in the back half of the year, giving us some confidence in that 50 basis points in -- for the full year."

We have other levers within our cost structures that could help us continue to make sure we maintain the profitability guidance, Ashwin, and protect the profitability guidance that we get in the marketplace. So those are kind of the 3 big ones. The fourth would be back to our contract delay. We've got some milestones that we'll meet in the back of of the year and one of those larger deals that will have some incremental earnings per share as well.

As we talked about when we did that acquisition, one of the things that resonate as almost with Clear2Pay especially with our open payment framework was the fact that they're already penetrating many of the Tier 1s through a single payment type around the world. And so what the opportunity there is, as you penetrate with a particular payment type say, ACH and then you come in and then you add wires, you add other types to the open payment framework. So we're very pleased with this acquisition at this point. It's integrated very cleanly into the company. GFS has done a good job of accelerating the product growth rate by putting it through our sales engine. So right now it's still early, but we would say we're very pleased."

Thank you for joining us on today's call.Starting on Slide 5. We finished the quarter with reported revenue of $1.6 billion, which is an increase of 3% on a constant currency basis, and delivered adjusted ear",839,"Thank you, Pete, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call.
Starting on Slide 5. We finished the quarter with reported revenue of $1.6 billion, which is an increase of 3% on a constant currency basis, and delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.74 while returning $224 million to shareholders. Year-to-date, we have returned $447 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
We continue to invest for growth in order to consistently deliver shareholder returns and generate significant recurring revenue. We saw strong deal closure in the quarter and continued to drive long-term client relationships. We are pleased with the recent restructuring and resegmentation of our business, which has allowed us to align our service and solution portfolio to address clients' unique business challenges.
As we discussed in the first quarter call, we continued to experience lower-than-expected termination fees in 2015. This is a positive long-term outcome. Our earnings per share for the second quarter were better than expected, and we remain on track with our current guidance for the year.
Moving to Slide 6, I'll speak to our segment activity in the quarter. As a reminder, our 2 segments were created to meet the demands of 2 distinct markets, driven by different buying behaviors and growth profiles. These segments allow us to more effectively sell, deliver and support the clients in these distinct markets. The Integrated Financial Solutions segment is comprised of U.S. financial institutions seeking comprehensive, integrated and outsourced solutions. This segment drives high reoccurring revenue, generates significant cash flow and drives higher margins with expansion through increased leverage. Our Global Financial Solutions segment is comprised of large global and international clients seeking tailored solutions, leveraging a combination of products, consulting and professional services. This segment typically drives lower margin and has a higher revenue growth profile.
In the quarter, IFS had 89% of its revenue recurring. Deal closure in IFS was solid this quarter with many new wins. FIS was chosen by Pacific Western Bank, a $17 billion financial institution, to replace its retail and commercial banking platform including core processing, commercial lending, consumer and business eBanking, digital, mobile, EFT, item processing and branch technology. This decision was driven by the bank's desire to better position itself for future growth.
In another long-term agreement, a $70 billion regional bank chose FIS to provide an end-to-end consumer loan servicing solution. This solution better positions the bank to grow and service its lending business.
Also, UMB, an $18 billion institution, made the decision to partner with FIS on its loan portfolio, moving for the first time from an internally hosted platform to an FIS-hosted processing model to gain processing efficiencies and more robust lending functionality.
Finally, we signed several new digital banking and payments agreements, including one with Centennial Bank, an $8 billion community bank who is seeking a new strategic technology partner in support of the bank's initiative to upgrade its digital channels including consumer and business eBanking as well as wire automation solutions. All of these wins demonstrate our ability to capitalize on increasing industry demand for solutions that enhance an institution's ability to meet its strategic growth and operational goals.
Turning to our Global Financial Solutions segment, revenue increased 8% on a constant currency basis. We continue to invest for growth in this segment and continue to see steady progress in signing long-term deals. Deal closure was solid as we continue to benefit from the demand for our solutions.
In Asia, we saw strong growth from continued expansion of our core banking and payments presence across the region. During the quarter, we continued to expand existing relationships as well as sign multiple new engagements resulting in a growth rate of 29% on a constant currency basis for the quarter.
In Europe, we continue to see new opportunities in the emerging challenger bank market. In the quarter, FIS became the strategic technology partner for the newly announced Atom Bank, the U.K.'s first digital-only based bank. We also signed another significant agreement with Crédit Agricole, the leader in consumer credit business in the Netherlands, expanding our existing relationship through the addition of real-time core processing capabilities.
In North America, a top 10 U.S. bank signed a multiyear software and services deal to utilize FIS's leading consumer lending product. This continues to solidify our advanced loan system as the leading consumer lending package in large progressive banks throughout the world.
Turning to Slide 7. I'd like to summarize the quarter before I turn it over to Woody for the financial report. We continue to grow revenue and return cash to shareholders. The restructuring and resegmentation of our business has allowed us to achieve operational efficiencies, leverage our scale globally and better align our services and solutions to address clients' business challenges. We're confident that our proven execution and deep client relationships will continue to enable us to invest for growth, maintain the strength of our balance sheet and return value to our shareholders.
Woody will now provide details around the Q2 performance. Woody?"
10081196,306094806,836588,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2015",2015-07-23,"Earnings Calls","Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 9 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter. In the second quarter, as expected, we continued to face difficult comparisons. Consolidated revenue was $1.6 billion, an increase of 3% on a constant currency",1256,"Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 9 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter. In the second quarter, as expected, we continued to face difficult comparisons. Consolidated revenue was $1.6 billion, an increase of 3% on a constant currency basis. EBITDA was $453 million, and the EBITDA margin was 28.5%. Non-GAAP adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $211 million for the quarter and $397 million for the first 6 months of 2015. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.74 for the second quarter.
Our highly recurring revenue model, combined with several new wins Gary mentioned earlier, helped us make consistent overall results despite the continued low termination fees, increased investment in European capabilities and FX headwinds, particularly in Brazil and Europe. FX translation held back revenue by $63 million for the quarter and EPS by $0.03.
Non-GAAP results for the quarter are adjusted to exclude $0.12 per share for acquisition-related purchase price amortization, $0.03 per share related to acquisition, integration and severance costs and a $0.25 per share gain related to the previously announced divestiture of our gaming business. This sale generated $238 million in pretax proceeds. We are continuing to provide certain check guarantee  services to the buyer and, accordingly, are not treating this divestiture as a discontinued operation for accounting purposes.
I will now continue on Slide 10 for second quarter segment results. In the second quarter, Integrated Financial Solutions revenue was $969 million, which was flat to prior year revenue. EBITDA was $378 million, which was also flat to 2014. EBITDA margins were 39%, a slight drop of 20 basis points. This margin decline primarily reflects continued low termination fees, which were $14 million lower than the prior year period.
In IFS, year-to-date term fees are lower than 2014 by $42 million. As we've discussed in the past, lower acquisition-related term fees have an immediate impact in terms of difficult comparisons, but create longer-term value as we retain profitable long-term relationships with our clients.
Normalizing the quarter for onetime items, including divestiture activities and lower term fees, IFS revenue growth would've been 3.6%, speaking to the strength of the underlying business.
Turning to Slide 11. As you saw in the first quarter, the IFS business consistently produces strong recurring revenues with diverse offerings helping to deliver consistent performance within the segment. IFS again produced 89% recurring revenue.
Our Payment Solutions revenue was down 3%. This was driven by lower pass-through revenues, divestitures and pricing pressure, partially offset by transaction volume growth. Business solutions revenue grew 5%, primarily driven by card production activities. Banking solutions revenue were flat compared to the prior year, driven by the difficult comparisons discussed earlier.
Turning to Slide 12. In the second quarter, Global Financial Solutions reported revenue was $619 million. The second quarter reported results for GFS reflecting negative foreign currency translation revenue impact of $63 million. The majority of FX translation impact was concentrated in the Brazilian real and euro. On a constant currency basis, GFS revenue grew 8% for the quarter and 8% for the first half of 2015. As anticipated, we continue to see a strong U.S. dollar for the back half of 2015, and FX translation will continue to be a headwind. Global Financial Solutions EBITDA was $123 million, compared to $126 million in the prior period. EBITDA was $135 million or 7% higher on a constant currency basis in the second quarter 2015 compared to the prior year period. EBITDA margins were 19.8%, compared to 20% in the prior year period.
Moving to Slide 13. Year-to-date 2015, 70% of GFS revenues were recurring in nature, consistent with historical performance. For the second quarter, Asia Pacific had strong revenue growth of 29% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by our expanding core banking and payments presence in India. As Gary described, we are pleased with several new signings and the ability for the team to expand existing relationships in the region. We expect the Asia Pacific region to continue to be a strong grower for GFS.
Europe grew 25% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by our continued success with the challenger banks in the U.K., revenue growth from Clear2Pay and consulting revenue growth. We also expanded an already meaningful relationship with Crédit Agricole.
In the North American region, GFS revenues were $277 million, compared to $287 million in the prior year period. The primary driver of the change was our previously announced nonrenewal of a contract discussed in Q1. As Gary mentioned, the underlying business had some nice wins, including a large deal in our end-to-end lending solutions.
As expected, Latin America revenue growth remains modest due to macroeconomic conditions in Brazil. When we resegmented the company, in the first quarter, corporate functions directly supporting IFS and GFS were moved into the individual segment results. Residual corporate expenses were $48 million for the quarter. We expect corporate expense to trend down in the back half of the year as we continue to focus on cost actions to improve profitability.
Other income included a gain on the sale of an investment of $7 million. The effective tax rate was 33.4% for the quarter, compared to 30.2% for the prior year quarter. As previously mentioned, the prior year quarter included an approximate $0.04 EPS benefit due to a discrete tax benefit.
We continue to reinvest in the business. Adjusted cash flow from operations totaled $197 million in the second quarter of 2015. Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $117 million, resulting in free cash flow of $79 million for the quarter. The $117 million in capital expenditure is higher than normal, primarily due to the timing of certain investments. For the year, we expect capital expenditures to be in line with our previous guidance of 5% to 6% of revenue. We still anticipate full year free cash flow to approximate net earnings.
For the quarter, we returned $224 million to shareholders. Approximately $150 million was returned to shareholders through the repurchase of 2.3 million shares in the open market at an average cost of $64.36 per share. The share repurchase program resulted in our weighted average diluted share count of 284.4 million. Basic shares outstanding at the end of the period were 280 million. Approximately $1.2 billion remain on our existing purchase authorization program. In addition, we returned $74 million to shareholders through dividends.
Maintaining a strong balance sheet remains a key component of our capital allocation strategy. As of June 30, debt outstanding was $5 billion, resulting in a leverage ratio of approximately 2.7x debt-to-EBITDA. This is slightly above our targeted 2.5x leverage ratio, based primarily on the timing of cash flows. We expect our leverage ratio to be at 2.5x by the end of the year. The weighted average interest rate was 3% at the end of the quarter.
Moving to Slide 15. Our sales execution in the quarter was a tailwind to our Q2 results. A few of the deals were signed more quickly than originally planned, helping to flatten out our back half of the year growth curve. For the full year 2015, we continue to expect reported revenue growth in the range of 1% to 3%; margin expansion for the full year of approximately 50 basis points; 2015 adjusted earnings per share in a range of $3.27 to $3.37, which is a 6% to 9% increase over 2014; and we expect full year free cash flow to approximate adjusted net earnings.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for question."

Primarily, we got natural acceleration in the first half versus the second half. If you look over the past 4 years or so, that's been probably 3% first half versus second half in terms of accelerated growth. The second would be term fees. As we've talked about, term fees in the first half this year were about $42 million lower than last year. We do anticipate more term fees in the back half of the year and have pretty good visibility into them. Reiterating that, low term fees is a good thing for us, long term. It does create some lumpiness, but it's a good thing for us, long term. The third will be the cost action. The cost actions that we took in the first quarter, we've seen some of that kick in, in terms of the margin, in terms of the profitability growth. And we've got more cost levers in the back half if sales execution doesn't come where we need to be. And then the fourth will be our contract delay that we mentioned in the fourth quarter. As it's gotten back on track, you saw some lift in Q2 from it and we believe we'll see further lift in the second half of the year. So those are really the 4 main drivers, David, and we've got pretty good visibility into them, particularly on the cost levers side."

In terms of the margin profile, you are seeing some of our cost actions start to kick in that are driving some incremental margin benefit. To answer your first question. To answer your second question, when you look at the back half of the year, a significant component of the back half of the year growth is both in term fees, which we talked about, it's on a very high incremental margin. And the majority of the cost actions are driving benefit in the second half of the year. As you heard me talk about, trending corporate expenses down as well as -- and the operations are driving some expense reduction as well. Both of those will help drive margin in the back half of the year, giving us some confidence in that 50 basis points in the full -- for the full year."

So those are the -- it's kind of the 3 big ones. The fourth would be back to our contract delay. We've got some milestones that we'll meet in the back of of the year and one of those larger deals that will drive some incremental earnings per share as well.

As we talked about when we did that acquisition, one of the things that resonates most with Clear2Pay, especially with their open-payment framework, was the fact that they were already penetrating many of the Tier 1s through a single payment type around the world. And so what the opportunity there is, as you penetrate with a particular payment type, say, ACH, and then you come in and you add wires, you add other types to the open-payment framework. So we're very pleased with this acquisition at this point. It's integrated very cleanly into the company. GFS has done a good job of accelerating the product growth rate by putting it through our sales engine. So right now, it's still early, but we would say we're very pleased."

We finished the quarter with reported revenue of $1.6 billion, which is an increase of 3% on a constant currency basis, and delivered adjusted ear",839,"Thank you, Pete, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call.
Starting on Slide 5. We finished the quarter with reported revenue of $1.6 billion, which is an increase of 3% on a constant currency basis, and delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.74 while returning $224 million to shareholders. Year-to-date, we have returned $447 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
We continue to invest for growth in order to consistently deliver shareholder returns and generate significant recurring revenue. We saw strong deal closure in the quarter and continued to drive long-term client relationships. We are pleased with the recent restructuring and resegmentation of our business, which has allowed us to align our service and solution portfolio to address clients' unique business challenges.
As we discussed in the first quarter call, we continued to experience lower-than-expected termination fees in 2015. This is a positive long-term outcome. Our earnings per share for the second quarter were better than expected, and we remain on track with our current guidance for the year.
Moving to Slide 6, I'll speak to our segment activity in the quarter. As a reminder, our 2 segments were created to meet the demands of 2 distinct markets, driven by different buying behaviors and growth profiles. These segments allow us to more effectively sell, deliver and support the clients in these distinct markets. The Integrated Financial Solutions segment is comprised of U.S. financial institutions seeking comprehensive, integrated and outsourced solutions. This segment drives high reoccurring revenue, generates significant cash flow and drives higher margins with expansion through increased leverage. Our Global Financial Solutions segment is comprised of large global and international clients seeking tailored solutions, leveraging a combination of products, consulting and professional services. This segment typically drives lower margins and has a higher revenue growth profile.
In the quarter, IFS had 89% of its revenue recurring. Deal closure in IFS was solid this quarter with many new wins. FIS was chosen by Pacific Western Bank, a $17 billion financial institution, to replace its retail and commercial banking platform including core processing, commercial lending, consumer and business eBanking, digital, mobile, EFT, item processing and branch technology. This decision was driven by the bank's desire to better position itself for future growth.
In another long-term agreement, a $70 billion regional bank chose FIS to provide an end-to-end consumer loan servicing solution. This solution better positions the bank to grow and service its lending business.
Also, UMB, an $18 billion institution, made the decision to partner with FIS on its loan portfolio, moving for the first time from an internally hosted platform to an FIS-hosted processing model to gain processing efficiencies and more robust lending functionality.
Finally, we signed several new digital banking and payments agreements, including one with Centennial Bank, an $8 billion community bank who is seeking a new strategic technology partner in support of the bank's initiative to upgrade its digital channels including consumer and business eBanking as well as wire automation solutions. All of these wins demonstrate our ability to capitalize on increasing industry demand for solutions that enhance an institution's ability to meet its strategic growth and operational goals.
Turning to our Global Financial Solutions segment, revenue increased 8% on a constant currency basis. We continue to invest for growth in this segment and continue to see steady progress in signing long-term deals. Deal closure was solid as we continue to benefit from the demand for our solutions.
In Asia, we saw strong growth from continued expansion of our core banking and payments presence across the region. During the quarter, we continued to expand existing relationships as well as sign multiple new engagements resulting in a growth rate of 29% on a constant currency basis for the quarter.
In Europe, we continue to see new opportunities in the emerging challenger bank market. In the quarter, FIS became the strategic technology partner for the newly announced Atom Bank, the U.K.'s first digital-only based bank. We also signed another significant agreement with Crédit Agricole, the leader in consumer credit business in the Netherlands, expanding our existing relationship through the addition of real-time core processing capabilities.
In North America, a top 10 U.S. bank signed a multiyear software and services deal to utilize FIS's leading consumer lending product. This continues to solidify our advanced loan system as the leading consumer lending package in large progressive banks throughout the world.
Turning to Slide 7. I'd like to summarize the quarter before I turn it over to Woody for the financial report. We continue to grow revenue and return cash to shareholders. The restructuring and resegmentation of our business has allowed us to achieve operational efficiencies, leverage our scale globally and better align our services and solutions to address clients' business challenges. We're confident that our proven execution and deep client relationships will continue to enable us to invest for growth, maintain the strength of our balance sheet and return value to our shareholders.
Woody will now provide details around the Q2 performance. Woody?"
10081196,306094806,836952,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2015",2015-07-23,"Earnings Calls","Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 9 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter. In the second quarter, as expected, we continued to face difficult comparisons. Consolidated revenue was $1.6 billion, an increase of 3% on a constant currency",1257,"Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 9 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter. In the second quarter, as expected, we continued to face difficult comparisons. Consolidated revenue was $1.6 billion, an increase of 3% on a constant currency basis. EBITDA was $453 million, and the EBITDA margin was 28.5%. Non-GAAP adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $211 million for the quarter and $397 million for the first 6 months of 2015. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.74 for the second quarter.
Our highly recurring revenue model, combined with several new wins Gary mentioned earlier, helped us make consistent overall results despite the continued low termination fees, increased investment in European capabilities and FX headwinds, particularly in Brazil and Europe. FX translation held back revenue by $63 million for the quarter and EPS by $0.03.
Non-GAAP results for the quarter are adjusted to exclude $0.12 per share for acquisition-related purchase price amortization, $0.03 per share related to acquisition, integration and severance costs and a $0.25 per share gain related to the previously announced divestiture of our gaming business. This sale generated $238 million in pretax proceeds. We are continuing to provide certain check guarantee  services to the buyer and, accordingly, are not treating this divestiture as a discontinued operation for accounting purposes.
I will now continue on Slide 10 for second quarter segment results. In the second quarter, Integrated Financial Solutions revenue was $969 million, which was flat to prior year revenue. EBITDA was $378 million, which was also flat to 2014. EBITDA margins were 39%, a slight drop of 20 basis points. This margin decline primarily reflects continued low termination fees, which were $14 million lower than the prior year period.
In IFS, year-to-date term fees are lower than 2014 by $42 million. As we've discussed in the past, lower acquisition-related term fees have an immediate impact in terms of difficult comparisons, but create longer-term value as we retain profitable long-term relationships with our clients.
Normalizing the quarter for onetime items, including divestiture activities and lower term fees, IFS revenue growth would've been 3.6%, speaking to the strength of the underlying business.
Turning to Slide 11. As you saw in the first quarter, the IFS business consistently produces strong recurring revenues with diverse offerings helping to deliver consistent performance within the segment. IFS again produced 89% recurring revenue.
Our Payment Solutions revenue was down 3%. This was driven by lower pass-through revenues, divestitures and pricing pressure, partially offset by transaction volume growth. Business solutions revenue grew 5%, primarily driven by card production activities. Banking solutions revenue were flat compared to the prior year, driven by the difficult comparisons discussed earlier.
Turning to Slide 12. In the second quarter, Global Financial Solutions reported revenue was $619 million. The second quarter reported results for GFS reflect a negative foreign currency translation revenue impact of $63 million. The majority of FX translation impact was concentrated in the Brazilian real and euro. On a constant currency basis, GFS revenue grew 8% for the quarter and 8% for the first half of 2015. As anticipated, we continue to see a strong U.S. dollar for the back half of 2015, and FX translation will continue to be a headwind. Global Financial Solutions EBITDA was $123 million, compared to $126 million in the prior period. EBITDA was $135 million or 7% higher on a constant currency basis in the second quarter 2015 compared to the prior year period. EBITDA margins were 19.8%, compared to 20% in the prior year period.
Moving to Slide 13. Year-to-date 2015, 70% of GFS revenues were recurring in nature, consistent with historical performance. For the second quarter, Asia Pacific had strong revenue growth of 29% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by our expanding core banking and payments presence in India. As Gary described, we are pleased with several new signings and the ability for the team to expand existing relationships in the region. We expect the Asia Pacific region to continue to be a strong grower for GFS.
Europe grew 25% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by our continued success with the challenger banks in the U.K., revenue growth from Clear2Pay and consulting revenue growth. We also expanded an already meaningful relationship with Crédit Agricole.
In the North American region, GFS revenues were $277 million, compared to $287 million in the prior year period. The primary driver of the change was our previously announced nonrenewal of a contract discussed in Q1. As Gary mentioned, the underlying business had some nice wins, including a large deal in our end-to-end lending solutions.
As expected, Latin America revenue growth remains modest due to macroeconomic conditions in Brazil. When we resegmented the company, in the first quarter, corporate functions directly supporting IFS and GFS were moved into the individual segment results. Residual corporate expenses were $48 million for the quarter. We expect corporate expense to trend down in the back half of the year as we continue to focus on cost actions to improve profitability.
Other income included a gain on the sale of an investment of $7 million. The effective tax rate was 33.4% for the quarter, compared to 30.2% for the prior year quarter. As previously mentioned, the prior year quarter included an approximate $0.04 EPS benefit due to a discrete tax benefit.
We continue to reinvest in the business. Adjusted cash flow from operations totaled $197 million in the second quarter of 2015. Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $117 million, resulting in free cash flow of $79 million for the quarter. The $117 million in capital expenditure is higher than normal, primarily due to the timing of certain investments. For the year, we expect capital expenditures to be in line with our previous guidance of 5% to 6% of revenue. We still anticipate full year free cash flow to approximate net earnings.
For the quarter, we returned $224 million to shareholders. Approximately $150 million was returned to shareholders through the repurchase of 2.3 million shares in the open market at an average cost of $64.36 per share. The share repurchase program resulted in our weighted average diluted share count of 284.4 million. Basic shares outstanding at the end of the period were 280 million. Approximately $1.2 billion remain on our existing purchase authorization program. In addition, we returned $74 million to shareholders through dividends.
Maintaining a strong balance sheet remains a key component of our capital allocation strategy. As of June 30, debt outstanding was $5 billion, resulting in a leverage ratio of approximately 2.7x debt-to-EBITDA. This is slightly above our targeted 2.5x leverage ratio, based primarily on the timing of cash flows. We expect our leverage ratio to be at 2.5x by the end of the year. The weighted average interest rate was 3% at the end of the quarter.
Moving to Slide 15. Our sales execution in the quarter was a tailwind to our Q2 results. A few of the deals were signed more quickly than originally planned, helping to flatten out our back half of the year growth curve. For the full year 2015, we continue to expect reported revenue growth in the range of 1% to 3%; margin expansion for the full year of approximately 50 basis points; 2015 adjusted earnings per share in a range of $3.27 to $3.37, which is a 6% to 9% increase over 2014; and we expect full year free cash flow to approximate adjusted net earnings.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for questions."

Primarily, we got natural acceleration in the first half versus the second half. If you look over the past 4 years or so, that's been probably 3% first half versus second half in terms of accelerated growth. The second would be term fees. As we've talked about, term fees in the first half this year were about $42 million lower than last year. We do anticipate more term fees in the back half of the year and have pretty good visibility into them. Reiterating that, low term fees is a good thing for us, long term. It does create some lumpiness, but it's a good thing for us, long term. The third would be the cost action. The cost actions that we took in the first quarter, we've seen some of that kick in, in terms of the margin, in terms of the profitability growth. And we've got more cost levers in the back half if sales execution doesn't come where we need to be. And then the fourth will be our contract delay that we mentioned in the fourth quarter. As it's gotten back on track, you saw some lift in Q2 from it and we believe we'll see further lift in the second half of the year. So those are really the 4 main drivers, David, and we've got pretty good visibility into them, particularly on the cost levers side."

Well, I mean, if you look at it, Dave, frankly, we've gotten a lot of noise going on in payments. The term fees has hit significantly there in the quarter. We've actually had an accounting change, where Woody mentioned about our pass-through revenues. So you've got some gross-to-net issues going on in there, and you've also got some compression. But if you normalize all that, we think we'll see payments can return to a low single-digit growth rate going into next year and then accelerate beyond that. Also keep in mind, we also had the divestiture of gaming that was in that quarter as well that's in that number."

In terms of the margin profile, you are seeing some of our cost actions start to kick in that are driving some incremental margin benefit. To answer your first question. To answer your second question, when you look at the back half of the year, a significant component of the back half of the year growth is both in term fees, which we talked about, it's on a very high incremental margin. And the majority of the cost actions are driving benefit in the second half of the year. As you heard me talk about, trending corporate expenses down as well as -- and the operations are driving some expense reduction as well. Both of those will help drive margin in the back half of the year, giving us some confidence in that 50 basis points in the full -- for the full year."

So those are the -- it's kind of the 3 big ones. The fourth would be back to our contract delay. We've got some milestones that we'll meet in the back of of the year on one of those larger deals that will drive some incremental earnings per share as well.

As we talked about when we did that acquisition, one of the things that resonates most with Clear2Pay, especially with their open-payment framework, was the fact that they were already penetrating many of the Tier 1s through a single payment type around the world. And so what the opportunity there is, is you penetrate with a particular payment type, say, ACH, and then you come in and you add wires, you add other types to the open-payment framework. So we're very pleased with this acquisition at this point. It's integrated very cleanly into the company.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'd like to start by giving you a strategic update on our business starting with our pending acquisition of SunGard, which is the significant achievement and long-term value creator for the value and alliance with our long-term growth and performance goals. This combination allows us to address a wider array of client business needs with a broader set of expertise and intellectual property-based offerings in an adjacent and complementary financial services market. The combined company will be positioned as the clear leader in retail and wholesale financial technology globally. We are also very excited about the shared opportunities that creates and our customer base having independently received very positive feedback from our clients about this combination and the benefits it will provide to their organizations. It will bring new talent and leadership, which when combined with FIS, drives us value as a much larger company. Ultimately, this combination will drive extended demand through the following ways by capitalizing on a much broader capability set for our existing clients. In many instances, the 2 companies combined will be considered a very large existing provider to many global financial institutions. Second, by exposing FIS to much broader market set such as asset managers and private equity firms, which will allow us to sell many of FIS existing products to those new prospects overtime. Currently, we have received all regulatory approvals and our targeting closing the week in November 30th. The teams of both companies have been working together since the announcement on integration planning. These efforts are producing solid lineup site to our long-term synergy targets, which we previously shared. We are pleased with the results to date. We are confident our proven track record of integrating acquired assets combined with our global delivery scale and financial strength will enable us to deliver on this value-creation strategy. 
Turning now to the quarter results on Slide 5. Consolidated revenue was $1.6 billion, an increase of 3% on a constant currency basis, which is below our expectations. We continue to see macroeconomic demand softening in our large and global financial institution clients primarily our people-based services. Overall, EBITDA was a strong at $530 million, representing a 12% increase on a constant currency basis versus prior year. This earnings growth and a softer-than-expected revenue quarter highlights the strength of our business model and sound execution on managing and reducing our cost structure. Our results continue to drive shareholder value delivering adjusted earnings per share of $0.90, an increase of 15% on a constant currency basis. 
Our long-term client relationships together with global scale and operating leverage continue to drive highly recurring revenue and consistent profitable growth. Our business model and execution generates strong free cash flow. In this quarter, we delivered $223 million of free cash flow and returned $73 million to shareholders through dividends. 
Our Integrated Financial Solutions segment continues to drive very strong reoccurring revenue, largely driven by our established community and regional bank business and continues to produce industry-leading margins. The long-term growth profile of this segment was enhanced this quarter by the addition of numerous new community banking clients who selected FIS as their new core banking provider. This core wins represent a 15% increase compared to the prior year period. Each of these wins also include a digital banking and/or payment capabilities, underscoring our solid position within the bank market as a leading strategic partner for end-to-end banking and Payment Solutions. During the quarter, our digital solutions saw a double-digit growth. Sales momentum has been strong year-to-date but was partially offset by continued bank consolidation and price compression in this segment. The underlying fundamentals of the business are very strong. 
Turning next to our Global Financial Solutions business. We saw a double-digit growth in Europe as our Clear2Pay solutions continue to perform as well as our sales teams delivered high margin product sales in core banking and Payment Solutions. Deal closure in Asia Pacific was a robust. Our Asia Pacific business continued its recent successes driving double-digit growth. Our leadership team in the region has consistently delivered strong results over the last several years. Through that leadership, we continue to expand relationships with existing clients through the same cross-sell and upsell model that we established in our U.S. domestic business. Deals within this region continue to be focused on our core banking and Payment Solutions. Latin America continues to experience an overall tough macroeconomic environment. Despite this, the underlying business drove low double-digit constant currency growth. 
In North America, results were impacted by the large nonrenewal of a nonstrategic contract disclosed earlier this year coupled with demand softness in our people-based professional services. 
Turning next to Slide 6. Before I turn the call over to Woody for financial summary, I'd like to reinforce that FIS is a company that delivers consistent long-term profit growth and a solid track record of performance. 
Our 4-point strategy reviewed in this year's Investor Day material centers around driving shareholder value. First, we are expanding relationships through cross-sell, upsell actions evidenced by our double-digit product sales in digital and solutions and expanded client relationships through our new core wins. Second, we are expanding our solutions and client value propositions through our build, buy, partner model as evidenced by our strategic SunGard acquisition. Third, we are driving continued operating leverage and margin expansion through our highly recurring revenue model leveraging our scale and broad product scope. And fourth, our capital allocation discipline is allowing us to invest for growth, maintain a flexible but solid balance sheet and return capital to shareholders. We are confident that the strategic direction to drive growth in global markets is the right strategy for long-term earnings growth and shareholder value. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Woody for additional detail on the financial results for the quarter. Woody?"

I'll begin on Slide 8 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter. In the third quarter, consolidated revenue was $1.6 billion, increasing 3% on a constant currency basis. EBITDA was $530 million, increasing 9% as reported and",1165,"Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 8 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter. In the third quarter, consolidated revenue was $1.6 billion, increasing 3% on a constant currency basis. EBITDA was $530 million, increasing 9% as reported and 12% on a constant currency basis. The EBITDA margin expanded 320 basis points to 33.6%. 
In the quarter, foreign currency translation negatively impacted revenue by $71 million and EBITDA by $15 million. Year-to-date, foreign currency negatively impacted revenue by $180 million, EBITDA by $33 million and earnings per share by $0.06. As Gary indicated, we're experiencing macroeconomic headwinds in our business. These headwinds impact our clients and affect the amount they spend with us for our people-based services. Therefore, we have proactively taken costs out of the business following additional cost levers were performance did not expectations. We will continue to monitor the global environment and adjust our cost structure accordingly. 
Non-GAAP adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $255 million for the quarter and $652 million for the first 9 months of 2015. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.90 for the third quarter, an increase of 12.5% or 15% on a constant currency basis. We suspended share repurchase beginning in May based on our discussions with SunGard, which resulted in a negative impact on EPS of $0.01 per share for the quarter. 
Non-GAAP results for the quarter are adjusted to exclude acquisition-related purchase price amortization of $0.12 per share, merger acquisition integration and severance cost of $0.12 per share and a tax impact from the divestiture of our gaming assets of $0.03 per share. 
I will continue on Slide 9 for the third quarter segment results. In the third quarter, Integrated Financial Solutions revenue was $971 million, which was up 1% compared to the prior year. The underlying IF business fundamentals remain sound. Revenue grew 4% after normalizing for divestitures and the change with the [indiscernible] we previously discussed. EBITDA increased 6% to $408 million. EBITDA margins increased 200 basis points to 42% for the quarter and 40% for the first 9 months of 2015. This margin expansion speaks to our ability to manage and adjust our variable cost structure in reaction to top line growth trends and performance. IFS margins also benefited from $20 million in term fees, which was in-line with our guidance earlier this year. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our Payment Solution revenue was $403 million, down 1% for the quarter. This was negatively impacted by the change with the loyalty loyalty vendor and a divestiture in the second quarter. Absent these changes, Payment Solutions grew 3% for the quarter. Business solutions revenue was $280 million and grew 2% compared to the prior year. Business solutions grew 9% for the quarter after eliminating the effect of the divestiture of our gaming business. For the first 9 months of the year, business solutions revenue was $845 million, up 4% compared to  prior year. 
Banking solutions revenue was $287 million and grew 2% compared to the prior year. For the first 9 months of the year, banking solutions revenue was $843 million, up 5% compared to the prior year. 
Turning to Slide 11. In the third quarter, Global Financial Solutions revenue reported $609 million, representing a 5% decline over the prior year. On a constant currency basis, GFS revenue grew 6% for the quarter and 7% for the first 9 months of the year. Global Financial Solutions EBITDA was $157 million on a reported basis or $174 million, a 23% increase on a constant currency basis. EBITDA margins were 25.8% compared to 22% in the prior year period. This expansion is primarily driven by restructuring and resegmentation cost actions disclosed earlier in the year and also higher margin product sales in our international regions. 
Moving to Slide 12. For the third quarter, North America produced revenues of $268 million compared to $289 million in the prior year period.
[Audio Gap]
to $220 million driven primarily by growth in our Clear2Pay business. Without Clear2Pay, Europe grew 5% in the quarter and 7% year-to-date on a constant currency basis. Latin America revenue grew 11% on a constant currency basis to $120 million for the quarter and reflects an easy comparison to the prior year. We anticipate growth in Latin America to continue to be muted over the coming quarters based primarily on the economic conditions in Brazil. 
Asia Pacific continue its strong performance at 27% on a constant currency basis. Corporate expenses were $35 million for the quarter, driven by diligent cost management. The effective tax rate was 32.8% for the quarter compared to 31.2% in the prior year period. The prior year period included a discrete tax benefit of approximately $9 million. 
As of September 30, our weighted average interest rate on our existing debt was 3%. Our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage was 2.6x. 
Moving to Slide 13. On October 13, we announced and completed the issuance of $4.5 billion in senior notes and have received commitments for $1.5 billion in new term loans. This was done in anticipation of closing the SunGard transaction in the fourth quarter. The remainder of the cash proceeds necessary facilitate closing the transaction and retiring the existing SunGard debt will come in the form of borrowings in our existing revolver. We anticipate retiring the existing SunGard debt at or shortly following the transaction closing date. 
We continue to reinvest in the business. Adjusted cash flow from operations totaled $310 million in the third quarter of 2015. Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $87 million resulting in free cash flow of $223 million for the quarter. 
For the year, we expect CapEx to be slightly higher than our goal of 6%. We still anticipate full year free cash flow to be roughly approximate net earnings. We returned $73 million to shareholders through dividends. We suspended our share repurchase program due to the pending SunGard transaction. Post closing will be highly focused on paying down debt and delevering the balance sheet. 
Moving on to Slide 14 for my concluding remarks. For the year, we expect over reported revenue growth to be flat as we continue to see significant negative foreign currency translation headwinds. Revenue growth in constant currency is expected to be approximately 3%. An overall slowdown in global market spending is resulting in softer demand for people-based services particularly in our GFS segment. As noted in the quarter, we continue to adjust our variable cost structure in reaction to revenue softness to drive earnings growth in difficult market conditions. 
Our EPS guidance for the year will be below the low end of our previously guided range due to the following: The suspension of the share repurchases since May related to our discussion activities with SunGard; and the carrying cost to be incremental $4.5 billion in debt issued in October 20 in anticipation of the SunGard transaction. 
We are looking forward to closing the SunGard deal and excited about the prospects it brings. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator?"

We've formed a dedicated integration team. There's been tremendous progress as the leaderships from both companies have come together and worked through the various integration strategies. And as you remember back when we did the large Metavante deal, it's all about for us hitting the ground running. So for us, we feel very good about our guidance that we've given on cost take-out, line of sight of that. We've got time frames to deployment. We feel comfortable on our $100 million commitment for next year. And certainly, we're in the process of implementing those plans and we continue to do more bottoms up analysis. So very early days. We haven't even closed yet, but I would say we're in extremely good shape at this point in the transaction with regards to how we're going to integrate the companies what the synergies.

So we want to make sure that we have direct line of sight to be able to call on those clients at a very cohesive way. But when we look at where the product solutions fall, what's very nice is how SunGard really breaks this into a lot of adjacent markets and frankly, we're actually seeing product sales in some of those market SunGard growing a little faster in some of the markets we're in. So we think there's a real opportunity for the sales forces to come together on a complementary fashion. And we would expect to see some nice traction out of that post close."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'd like to start by giving you a strategic update on our business, starting with our pending acquisition of SunGard, which is a significant achievement and long-term value creator [Audio Gap] value and alliance with our long-term growth and performance goals. This combination allows us to address a wider array of client business needs with a broader set of expertise and intellectual property-based offerings in an adjacent and complementary financial services market. The combined company will be positioned as the clear leader in retail and wholesale financial technology globally. 
We are also very excited about the shared opportunities that creates and our customer base having independently received very positive feedback from our clients about this combination and the benefits it will provide to their organizations. It will bring new talent and leadership, which when combined with FIS, drives us value as a much larger company. Ultimately, this combination will drive extended demand through the following ways: By capitalizing on a much broader capability set for our existing clients. In many instances, the 2 companies combined will be considered a very large existing provider to many global financial institutions. Second, by exposing FIS to a much broader market set such as asset managers and private equity firms, which will allow us to sell many of FIS' existing products to those new prospects over time. 
Currently, we have received all regulatory approvals and our targeting closing, the week in November 30th. The teams of both companies have been working together since the announcement on integration planning. These efforts are producing solid lineup site to our long-term synergy targets, which we previously shared. We are pleased with the results to date. We are confident that our proven track record of integrating acquired assets combined with our global delivery scale and financial strength will enable us to deliver on this value-creation strategy. 
Turning now to the quarter results on Slide 5. Consolidated revenue was $1.6 billion, an increase of 3% on a constant currency basis, which is below our expectations. We continue to see macroeconomic demand softening in our large and global financial institution clients primarily in our people-based services. Overall, EBITDA was strong at $530 million, representing a 12% increase on a constant currency basis versus prior year. This earnings growth and a softer-than-expected revenue quarter highlights the strength of our business model and sound execution on managing and reducing our cost structure. 
Our results continue to drive shareholder value delivering adjusted earnings per share of $0.90, an increase of 15% on a constant currency basis. Our long-term client relationships, together with our global scale and operating leverage, continue to drive highly reoccurring revenue and consistent profitable growth. Our business model and execution generates strong free cash flow. In this quarter, we delivered $223 million of free cash flow and returned $73 million to shareholders through dividends. 
Our Integrated Financial Solutions segment continues to drive very strong reoccurring revenue, largely driven by our established community and regional bank business and continues to produce industry-leading margins. The long-term growth profile of this segment was enhanced this quarter by the addition of numerous new community banking clients, who selected FIS as their new core banking provider. These core wins represent a 15% increase compared to the prior year period. Each of these wins also include digital banking and/or payment capabilities, underscoring our solid position within the bank market as a leading strategic partner for end-to-end banking and Payment Solutions. During the quarter, our digital solutions saw double-digit growth. Sales momentum has been strong year-to-date but was partially offset by continued bank consolidation and price compression in this segment. The underlying fundamentals of the business are very strong. 
Turning next to our Global Financial Solutions business. We saw double-digit growth in Europe as our Clear2Pay solutions continue to perform as well as our sales teams delivered high margin product sales in core banking and Payment Solutions. Deal closure in Asia Pacific was robust. Our Asia-Pacific business continued its recent successes driving double-digit growth. Our leadership team in the region has consistently delivered strong results over the last several years. Through that leadership, we continue to expand relationships with existing clients through the same cross-sell and up sell model that we established in our U.S. domestic business. Deals within this region continue to be focused on our core banking and Payment Solutions. Latin America continues to experience an overall tough macroeconomic environment. Despite this, the underlying business drove low double-digit constant currency growth. 
In North America, results were impacted by the large nonrenewal of a nonstrategic contract disclosed earlier this year coupled with demand softness in our people-based professional services. 
Turning next to Slide 6. Before I turn the call over to Woody for the financial summary, I'd like to reinforce that FIS is a company that delivers consistent long-term profit growth and a solid track record of performance. Our 4-point strategy reviewed in this year's Investor Day material centers around driving shareholder value. First, we're expanding relationships with cross-sell, up-sell actions evidenced by our double-digit product sales in digital and wealth solutions and expanded client relationships through our new core wins. Second, we are expanding our solutions and client value propositions through our build-buy-partner model as evidenced by our strategic SunGard acquisition. Third, we are driving continued operating leverage and margin expansion through our highly reoccurring revenue model leveraging our scale and broad product scope. And fourth, our capital allocation discipline is allowing us to invest for growth, maintain a flexible but solid balance sheet and return capital to shareholders. We are confident that the strategic direction to drive growth in global markets is the right strategy for long-term earnings growth and shareholder value. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Woody for additional detail on the financial results for the quarter. Woody?"

In the third quarter, consolidated revenue was $1.6 billion, increasing 3% on a constant currency basis. EBITDA was $530 million, increasing 9% as reported and 12% on a constant currency basis. EBITDA margin expanded 320 basis points to 33.6%. 
In the quarter, foreign currency translation negatively impacted revenue by $71 million and EBITDA by $15 million. Year-to-date, foreign currency negatively impacted revenue by $180 million, EBITDA by $33 million and earnings per share by $0.06. As Gary indicated, we're experiencing macroeconomic headwinds in our business. These headwinds impact our clients and affect the amount they spend with us for our people-based services. Therefore, we have proactively taken costs out of the business pulling additional variable cost levers where performance did not meet expectations. We will continue to monitor the global environment and adjust our cost structure accordingly. 
Non-GAAP adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $255 million for the quarter and $652 million for the first 9 months of 2015. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.90 for the third quarter, an increase of 12.5% or 15% on a constant currency basis. We suspended share repurchase beginning in May based on our discussions with SunGard, which resulted in a negative impact on EPS of $0.01 per share for the quarter. 
Non-GAAP results for the quarter are adjusted to exclude acquisition-related purchase price amortization of $0.12 per share, merger acquisition integration and severance cost of $0.12 per share and the tax impact from the divestiture of our gaming assets of $0.03 per share. 
I will continue on Slide 9 for the third quarter segment results. In the third quarter, Integrated Financial Solutions revenue was $971 million, which was up 1% compared to the prior year. The underlying IFS business fundamentals remained sound. Revenue grew 4% after normalizing for divestitures and the change with the loyalty vendor we previously discussed. EBITDA increased 6% to $408 million. EBITDA margins increased 200 basis points to 42% for the quarter and 40% for the first 9 months of 2015. This margin expansion speaks to our ability to manage and adjust our variable cost structure in reaction to top line growth trends and performance. IFS margins also benefited from $20 million in term fees, which was in line with our guidance earlier this year. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our Payment Solutions revenue was $403 million, down 1% for the quarter. This was negatively impacted by the change with the loyalty vendor and a divestiture in the second quarter. Absent these changes, Payment Solutions grew 3% for the quarter. Business solutions revenue was $280 million and grew 2% compared to the prior year. Business solutions grew 9% for the quarter after eliminating the effect of the divestiture of our gaming business. For the first 9 months of the year, business solutions revenue was $845 million, up 4% compared to prior year. 
Banking solutions revenue was $287 million and grew 2% compared to the prior year. For the first 9 months of the year, banking solutions revenue was $843 million, up 5% compared to the prior year. 
Turning to Slide 11. In the third quarter, Global Financial Solutions revenue reported $609 million, representing a 5% decline over the prior year. On a constant currency basis, GFS revenue grew 6% for the quarter and 7% for the first 9 months of the year. Global Financial Solutions EBITDA was $157 million on a reported basis or $174 million, a 23% increase on a constant currency basis. EBITDA margins were 25.8% compared to 22% in the prior year period. This expansion is primarily driven by restructuring and resegmentation cost actions disclosed earlier in the year and also higher margin product sales in our international regions. 
Moving to Slide 12. For the third quarter, North America produced revenues of $268 million compared to $289 million in the prior year period. [Audio Gap] $220 million, driven primarily by growth in our Clear2Pay business. Without Clear2Pay, Europe grew 5% in the quarter and 7% year-to-date on a constant currency basis. Latin America revenue grew 11% on a constant currency basis to $120 million for the quarter and reflects an easy comparison to the prior year. We anticipate growth in Latin America to continue to be muted over the coming quarters based primarily on the economic conditions in Brazil.  Asia Pacific continued its strong performance at 27% on a constant currency basis. 
Corporate expenses were $35 million for the quarter, driven by diligent cost management. The effective tax rate was 32.8% for the quarter, compared to 31.2% in the prior year period. The prior year period included a discrete tax benefit of approximately $9 million. As of September 30, our weighted average interest rate on our existing debt was 3%. Our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage was 2.6x. 
Moving to Slide 13. On October 13, we announced and completed the issuance of $4.5 billion in senior notes and have received commitments for $1.5 billion in new term loans. This was done in anticipation of closing the SunGard transaction in the fourth quarter. The remainder of the cash proceeds necessary to facilitate closing the transaction and retiring the existing SunGard debt will come in the form of borrowings under our existing revolver. We anticipate retiring the existing SunGard debt at or shortly following the transaction closing date. 
We continue to reinvest in the business. Adjusted cash flow from operations totaled $310 million in the third quarter of 2015. Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $87 million resulting in free cash flow of $223 million for the quarter. For the year, we expect CapEx to be slightly higher than our goal of 6%. 
We still anticipate full year free cash flow to be roughly approximate net earnings. We returned $73 million to shareholders through dividends. We suspended our share repurchase program due to the pending SunGard transaction. Post-closing, we'll be highly focused on paying down debt and delevering the balance sheet. 
Moving on to Slide 14 for my concluding remarks. For the year, we expect our reported revenue growth to be flat as we continue to see significant negative foreign currency translation headwinds. Revenue growth in constant currency is expected to be approximately 3%. An overall slowdown in global market spending is resulting in softer demand for people-based services, particularly in our GFS segment. As noted in the quarter, we continue to adjust our variable cost structure in reaction to revenue softness to drive earnings growth in difficult market conditions. 
Our EPS guidance for the year will be below the low end of our previously guided range due to the following: The suspension of the share repurchases since May related to our discussion activities with SunGard; and the carrying cost of the incremental $4.5 billion in debt issued in October 20 in anticipation of the SunGard transaction. We are looking forward to closing the SunGard deal and excited about the prospects it brings. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator?"

So for us, we feel very good about our guidance that we've given on cost take-out, line of sight of that. We've got time frames to deployment.

If you look at that, that seems to be where we're seeing most of the softness there. It's both in North America at the big banks but also outside the U.S. in the big banks as well. So if you look at that, we are seeing -- that is the area where we're seeing the softness in the demand. We've seen it probably through the first quarter. You saw us take some cost actions. You're seeing some in the second quarter and much more really in the third quarter. So we do see that as sort of a global sluggishness from professional services consulting demand, and for the moment, we're seeing that carry into '16 right now. We're not giving full '16 guidance right now, but we're definitely seeing the global sluggishness in the economy impacting those demand drivers for people-based services would have an impact."

When you're dealing with short-term professional services businesses, you're going to see some headwinds that can come from time to time due to macroeconomic issues, because that's typically one of the first things that our clients slow their spending on. We've seen this before in these businesses. As I've said, it's highlighted a little bit, because we've had some consolidation issues around acquisitions, and so we've had to grow through those. But we don't see any glaring issues in the product suite today. We continue to see our consulting business grow. It's just not growing as fast as it has in the past.

But again, I think that's primarily PS [Audio Gap] we're ultimately flushing capital budgets. So the product -- the product business, the underlying business as you kind of heard [Audio Gap]"

shareholder value and aligns with our long-term growth and performance goals. This combination allows us to address a wider array of client business needs with a broader set of expertise and intellectual property-based offerings in an adjacent and complementary financial services market. The combined company will be positioned as the clear leader in retail and wholesale financial technology globally. 
We are also very excited about the shared opportunities it creates in our customer base, having independently received very positive feedback from our clients about this combination and the benefits it will provide to their organizations. It will bring new talent and leadership, which when combined with FIS, drives us value as a much larger company. Ultimately, this combination will drive extended demand through the following ways: By capitalizing on a much broader capability set for our existing clients. In many instances, the 2 companies combined will be considered a very large existing provider to many global financial institutions. Second, by exposing FIS to a much broader market set such as asset managers and private equity firms, which will allow us to sell many of FIS' existing products to those new prospects over time. 
Currently, we have received all regulatory approvals and are targeting closing the week of November 30. The teams of both companies have been working together since the announcement on integration planning. These efforts are producing solid line of sight to our long-term synergy targets, which we previously shared. We are pleased with the results to date. We are confident that our proven track record of integrating acquired assets combined with our global delivery scale and financial strength will enable us to deliver on this value-creation strategy. 
Turning now to the quarter results on Slide 5. Consolidated revenue was $1.6 billion, an increase of 3% on a constant currency basis, which is below our expectations. We continue to see macroeconomic demand softening in our large and global financial institution clients, primarily in our people-based services. Overall, EBITDA was strong at $530 million, representing a 12% increase on a constant currency basis versus prior year. This earnings growth and a softer-than-expected revenue quarter highlights the strength of our business model and sound execution on managing and reducing our cost structure. 
Our results continue to drive shareholder value, delivering adjusted earnings per share of $0.90, an increase of 15% on a constant currency basis. Our long-term client relationships, together with our global scale and operating leverage, continue to drive highly reoccurring revenue and consistent profitable growth. Our business model and execution generates strong free cash flow. In this quarter, we delivered $223 million of free cash flow and returned $73 million to shareholders through dividends. 
Our Integrated Financial Solutions segment continues to drive very strong reoccurring revenue, largely driven by our established community and regional bank business and continues to produce industry-leading margins. The long-term growth profile of this segment was enhanced this quarter by the addition of numerous new community banking clients, who selected FIS as their new core banking provider. These core wins represent a 15% increase compared to the prior year period. Each of these wins also included digital banking and/or payment capabilities, underscoring our solid position within the bank market as a leading strategic partner for end-to-end banking and Payment Solutions. During the quarter, our digital solutions saw double-digit growth. Sales momentum has been strong year-to-date but was partially offset by continued bank consolidation and price compression in this segment. The underlying fundamentals of the business are very strong. 
Turning next to our Global Financial Solutions business. We saw double-digit growth in Europe as our Clear2Pay solutions continue to perform as well as our sales teams delivered high margin product sales in core banking and Payment Solutions. Deal closure in Asia Pacific was robust. Our Asia Pacific business continued its recent successes driving double-digit growth. Our leadership team in the region has consistently delivered strong results over the last several years. Through that leadership, we continue to expand relationships with existing clients through the same cross-sell and up-sell model that we established in our U.S. domestic business. Deals within this region continue to be focused on our core banking and Payment Solutions. Latin America continues to experience an overall tough macroeconomic environment. Despite this, the underlying business drove low double-digit constant currency growth. 
In North America, results were impacted by the large nonrenewal of a nonstrategic contract disclosed earlier this year, coupled with demand softness in our people-based professional services. 
Turning next to Slide 6. Before I turn the call over to Woody for the financial summary, I'd like to reinforce that FIS is a company that delivers consistent long-term profit growth and a solid track record of performance. Our 4-point strategy reviewed in this year's Investor Day material centers around driving shareholder value. First, we're expanding client relationships through cross-sell, up-sell actions evidenced by our double-digit product sales in digital and wealth solutions and expanded client relationships through our new core wins. Second, we are expanding our solutions and client value propositions through a build-buy-partner model as evidenced by our strategic SunGard acquisition. Third, we are driving continued operating leverage and margin expansion through our highly reoccurring revenue model leveraging our scale and broad product scope. And fourth, our capital allocation discipline is allowing us to invest for growth, maintain a flexible but solid balance sheet and return capital to shareholders. We are confident that the strategic direction to drive growth in global markets is the right strategy for long-term earnings growth and shareholder value. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Woody for additional detail on the financial results of the quarter. Woody?"

I'll begin on Slide 8 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter. In the third quarter, consolidated revenue was $1.6 billion, increasing 3% on a constant currency basis. EBITDA was $530 million, increasing 9% as reported and",1166,"Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 8 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter. In the third quarter, consolidated revenue was $1.6 billion, increasing 3% on a constant currency basis. EBITDA was $530 million, increasing 9% as reported and 12% on a constant currency basis. EBITDA margin expanded 320 basis points to 33.6%. 
In the quarter, foreign currency translation negatively impacted revenue by $71 million and EBITDA by $15 million. Year-to-date, foreign currency negatively impacted revenue by $180 million, EBITDA by $33 million and earnings per share by $0.06. As Gary indicated, we're experiencing macroeconomic headwinds in our business. These headwinds impact our clients and affect the amount they spend with us for our people-based services. Therefore, we have proactively taken costs out of the business, pulling additional variable cost levers where performance did not meet expectations. We will continue to monitor the global environment and adjust our cost structure accordingly. 
Non-GAAP adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $255 million for the quarter and $652 million for the first 9 months of 2015. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.90 for the third quarter, an increase of 12.5% or 15% on a constant currency basis. We suspended share repurchase beginning in May based on our discussions with SunGard, which resulted in a negative impact on EPS of $0.01 per share for the quarter. 
Non-GAAP results for the quarter are adjusted to exclude acquisition-related purchase price amortization of $0.12 per share, merger acquisition integration and severance cost of $0.12 per share and the tax impact from the divestiture of our gaming assets of $0.03 per share. 
I will continue on Slide 9 for the third quarter segment results. In the third quarter, Integrated Financial Solutions revenue was $971 million, which was up 1% compared to the prior year. The underlying IFS business fundamentals remain sound. Revenue grew 4% after normalizing for divestitures and the change with the loyalty vendor we previously discussed. EBITDA increased 6% to $408 million. EBITDA margins increased 200 basis points to 42% for the quarter and 40% for the first 9 months of 2015. This margin expansion speaks to our ability to manage and adjust our variable cost structure in reaction to top line growth trends and performance. IFS margins also benefited from $20 million in term fees, which was in line with our guidance earlier this year. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our Payment Solutions revenue was $403 million, down 1% for the quarter. This was negatively impacted by the change with the loyalty vendor and a divestiture in the second quarter. Absent these changes, Payment Solutions grew 3% for the quarter. Business solutions revenue was $280 million and grew 2% compared to the prior year. Business solutions grew 9% for the quarter after eliminating the effect of the divestiture of our gaming business. For the first 9 months of the year, business solutions revenue was $845 million, up 4% compared to prior year. 
Banking solutions revenue was $287 million and grew 2% compared to the prior year. For the first 9 months of the year, banking solutions revenue was $843 million, up 5% compared to the prior year. 
Turning to Slide 11. In the third quarter, Global Financial Solutions revenue reported $609 million, representing a 5% decline over the prior year. On a constant currency basis, GFS revenue grew 6% for the quarter and 7% for the first 9 months of the year. Global Financial Solutions EBITDA was $157 million on a reported basis or $174 million, a 23% increase, on a constant currency basis. EBITDA margins were 25.8% compared to 22% in the prior year period. This expansion is primarily driven by restructuring and resegmentation cost actions disclosed earlier in the year and also higher margin product sales in our international regions. 
Moving to Slide 12. For the third quarter, North America produced revenues of $268 million compared to $289 million in the prior year period.
[Audio Gap] 
basis to $220 million, driven primarily by growth in our Clear2Pay business. Without Clear2Pay, Europe grew 5% in the quarter and 7% year-to-date on a constant currency basis. Latin America revenue grew 11% on a constant currency basis to $120 million for the quarter and reflects an easy comparison to the prior year. We anticipate growth in Latin America to continue to be muted over the coming quarters based primarily on the economic conditions in Brazil.  Asia Pacific continued its strong performance at 27% on a constant currency basis. 
Corporate expenses were $35 million for the quarter, driven by diligent cost management. The effective tax rate was 32.8% for the quarter, compared to 31.2% in the prior year period. The prior year period included a discrete tax benefit of approximately $9 million. As of September 30, our weighted average interest rate on our existing debt was 3%. Our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage was 2.6x. 
Moving to Slide 13. On October 13, we announced and completed the issuance of $4.5 billion in senior notes and have received commitments for $1.5 billion in new term loans. This was done in anticipation of closing the SunGard transaction in the fourth quarter. The remainder of the cash proceeds necessary to facilitate closing the transaction and retiring the existing SunGard debt will come in the form of borrowings under our existing revolver. We anticipate retiring the existing SunGard debt at or shortly following the transaction closing date. 
We continue to reinvest in the business. Adjusted cash flow from operations totaled $310 million in the third quarter of 2015. Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $87 million resulting in free cash flow of $223 million for the quarter. For the year, we expect CapEx to be slightly higher than our goal of 6%. 
We still anticipate full year free cash flow to roughly approximate net earnings. We returned $73 million to shareholders through dividends. We suspended our share repurchase program due to the pending SunGard transaction. Post-closing, we'll be highly focused on paying down debt and delevering the balance sheet. 
Moving on to Slide 14 for my concluding remarks. For the year, we expect our reported revenue growth to be flat as we continue to see significant negative foreign currency translation headwinds. Revenue growth in constant currency is expected to be approximately 3%. An overall slowdown in global market spending is resulting in softer demand for people-based services, particularly in our GFS segment. As noted in the quarter, we continue to adjust our variable cost structure in reaction to revenue softness to drive earnings growth in difficult market conditions. 
Our EPS guidance for the year will be below the low end of our previously guided range due to the following: The suspension of the share repurchases since May related to our discussion activities with SunGard; and the carrying cost of the incremental $4.5 billion in debt issued October 20 in anticipation of the SunGard transaction. We are looking forward to closing the SunGard deal and excited about the prospects it brings. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator?"

SunGard is about 36% of their revenue is outside the U.S. For us, for FIS, it's about 22%. Combined based on the scale of the 2 models, it will be about 25% outside the U.S. In terms of where it is, they have a more significant presence in Europe, which is complementary to where we are from a size perspective. They have a small Latin America presence, where we have a pretty large Latin America presence. And to be clear, that's probably one of the most significant macroeconomic headwinds that we've got, where currency for Brazil was down 17% since July, since we announced previously. So we've got pretty good exposure there from in terms of revenue growth. They do have a significant presence in Asia Pacific, but it's blended across a number of different countries. So hopefully that will add -- give you some color as to where it's at. Net-net, it should increase our international exposure around 4% to 5%."

At this point in time, I think it's much more just macroeconomic in issue, and I think some of our larger institutions, you see them announcing all the time, big cost-cutting initiatives, et cetera, and I think they're looking for ways to do that. When you look at SunGard, I don't think it changes the way we think about our go-to-market. SunGard is much more IT centric, very much like traditionally FIS, but they don't have as large of a PS business as to its  percentages in the aggregate. But we're going to be very focused on bringing world-class wholesale products to market. And so combining that with our go-to-market sales force, we think the combination will be very beneficial."
