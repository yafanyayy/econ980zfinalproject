Our earnings press release dated January 8, 2015 can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, www.bedbathandbeyond.com. For those of you who might not have had the chance to read the press release, here are some highlights. Our third quarter of fiscal 2014 net earnings per diluted share were $1.23, which includes approximately $0.04 per diluted share of net benefits for certain nonrecurring items including credit card fees litigation. Third quarter net sales were $2.9 billion, an increase of approximately 2.7% over the prior year period. Comparable sales increased by approximately 1.7% in the third quarter.  
For the fourth quarter of 2014, our model continues to show net earnings per diluted share in the range of approximately $1.78 to $1.83. We are now modeling full year net earnings per diluted share of approximately $5.05 to $5.09, which reflects our third quarter actual results and our current fourth quarter model.

Sue will discuss our third quarter financial results in more detail as well as provide an update on our modeling assumptions for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 and some preliminary thoughts regarding fiscal 2015.  But first, let me turn the call over to Steve."

It's a thrill that you joined us. And to our listeners, good afternoon, and I'd like to wish everyone a healthy and happy new year. The retail environment is ever-changing, and Bed Bath & Beyond",1902,"Thank you, Janet, and again, welcome to Bed Bath & Beyond. It's a thrill that you joined us. And to our listeners, good afternoon, and I'd like to wish everyone a healthy and happy new year. 
The retail environment is ever-changing, and Bed Bath & Beyond has more than 43 years of experience navigating the challenges of this competitive and dynamic industry. This past holiday season reflect this continuing evolution in retailing as we saw more customers interact with us online and through their mobile devices than ever before.
True to our history and as our successful track record shows, while never satisfied, overall, we were able to meet the needs of the customers, and we are confident in our ability to prosper and in this evolving retail environment. We continue to maintain our philosophy of providing great service and great selection at the right value. 
And now we can do this in more ways than ever.  Our ability to interact with our customers wherever, whenever and however takes lifestyle and habits and move to their various life stages, creates a powerful customer value proposition and a loyal customer base. By combining our services and merchandise offerings together with the ability to utilize the significant data available to us about our customers preferences, we are excited to have the opportunity to become more dynamic and more relevant to our customers.
As Janet mentioned and as Sue will discuss in more detail, Bed Bath & Beyond reported net earnings per diluted share of $1.23, which includes approximately $0.04 per diluted share of net benefits for certain nonrecurring items, including credit card fees litigation, and net sales of $2.9 billion and a comp sales increase of approximately 1.7%.  And we continue to model net earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.78 to $1.83 for the fourth quarter. 
As a reminder, with respect to our comparable sales metric, it includes sales transactions consummated through all of our retail channels, including in-store, online and through our mobile device. Today, more than ever, customers are taking advantage of omni-channel environment by using more than 1 platform to make their purchases.  
For example, a customer may go to our store and be assisted by an associate to create a wedding or baby registry. This registry gift could then be purchased from one of our websites. Or a shopper may research a particular item in our website and varies customer reviews before visiting a store to make a purchase. The same customer may choose to execute the sale via a mobile device and choose either in-store pickup or home delivery, which could then be fulfilled from a distribution facility, from a store or directly from a vendor. As we've consistently said, we believe an integrated shopping experience must exist among all channels to provide a seamless and efficient customer experience.  Today, our customers have many convenient options to interact with us, to find what they need when and how they want it. 
Another example of our seamless shopping experience is that we accept returns in-store without regard to the channel in which the purchase was consummated. It's worth noting that in the case of an item being purchased online and returned to a store, the sales return actually results in a reduction in store sales, even though the sale is consummated in a different channel. Our highly integrated retail operation makes it difficult for us to reasonably track the channel in which a sale is initiated. However, as we did last quarter, we can provide directional information on how the sale was completed. 
With all this in mind, during the third quarter of fiscal 2014, comparable sales consummated through customer-facing online websites and mobile applications grew in excess of 40%, while comparable sales consummated in our stores were relatively flat.  As a reminder, we re-platformed both the buybuy BABY and Bed Bath & Beyond websites during the second quarter of fiscal 2013.
Our commitment to take care of our customer is directly related to many of our capital investments, including our investments in technology. We believe new features and improved technology have created a better customer experience by contributing to an online sales growth. We recognize that the capital investments we are making and the incremental expenses related to them are increasing our technology costs and depreciation as well as other expenses as a percentage of net sales in the short term. However, we are confident we are making the appropriate investments to position our company for long-term profitable growth and to further enhance shareholder value in an evolving retail environment.
At this time, I'd like to provide an update on some of the progress we're making. We continue to add new functionality and assortment to our selling websites, mobile sites and apps. Today, we have more than 200,000 unique SKUs available online across our websites, representing an increase of more than 40% since last January. Many of these new SKUs can be shipped to our customers directly from our vendors. 
We have introduced new categories online as well as expanded our assortments in others. Our online offerings now include such things as a selection of jewelry and watches. And we have greatly expanded online merchandise offerings for many categories such as audio and electronics, furniture, lighting, rugs, pet care as well ask lawn and garden. 
Also in our Bed Bath & Beyond website, you can now purchase a variety of greenhouses and herb gardens as well as some interesting finds such as motorized scooters, electric snow throwers, doghouses, aviaries and chicken coops.
Further, to support our merchandise expansion in home furnishings in areas such as living room, dining room and bedroom sets, we have enhanced our vendor relationships and delivery capabilities to allow for the shipment of large items directly to our customer's home. Our enhanced delivery capabilities give our customers the choice of several delivery options ranging from curb side to light glove, which could include assembly and removal of product packaging. 
We have also expanded the online registry services to Bed Bath & Beyond to enable customers to schedule an appointment for an in-store wedding consultation. In addition, we now have the capability to accept PayPal transactions online, and we are continuing to expand the acceptance of international credit cards. In international orders, we have partnered with a third-party company to better enable the shipment of merchandise overseas.
We are also continuing our deployment of systems, equipment and increased bandwidth in our stores. These in-store system enhancements enable our associates to optimize our shipping costs for home deliveries as well as to improve inventory ordering and workforce management. They will also enable us over time to develop a digital shopping experience that will provide real-time personalized offers and recommendations that can be sent directly to a customer's mobile device. WiFi access to customers and store associates will enable a more dynamic shopping experience.
Further, we also plan to launch a new robust point-of-sale system that will, in conjunction with other system enhancements over time, allow customers to use their mobile device in our stores to shop and make purchases, to receive and redeem personalized coupons as well as receive a selection of multiple item price deals to enhance their shopping experience. These new system enhancements will also enable customers to make payments in foreign currencies and receipts to be issued in foreign languages.
In addition, we are also creating more flexible fulfillment options to allow us to deliver orders more quickly and cost-effectively. For example, to support our growing direct-to-consumer shipments and the growth of our health and beauty care offerings, we plan to open an additional distribution facility in Las Vegas in early 2015. As a reminder, product can ship directly from one of our distribution facilities, from one of our stores or directly from our vendors.
Looking ahead, we will continue to enhance and improve upon our online search and navigation capabilities, which is one way to better understand our customers' preferences and deliver a more personalized shopping experience; continue to enhance the shopping experience on our mobile websites by optimizing the mobile display capabilities; continue to strengthen and deepen our IT, analytics, marketing and e-commerce groups; enable our customers to manage the coupons in one place on our mobile apps; expand our buy online, pick up in store feature into Canada; and expand our online registry services for buybuy BABY including Canada to enable customers to schedule an appointment for in-store baby registry consultation.
We are pleased by the progress and adoption of our omni-channel initiatives. We're also very pleased by our customers' acceptance of our ever-increasing and differentiated merchandise assortments. We continue to leverage our product offerings, services and promotional activities across all channels, concepts and countries in which we do business so that we can do more for and with our customers.
On the real estate side, our third quarter activities included opening 4 new Bed Bath & Beyond stores, 1 buybuy BABY store and 1 Cost Plus World Market store and the closing of 2 Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Including stores opened to date, we are still on track to open approximately 22 new stores company-wide during our 2014 fiscal year. 
During this current fourth quarter, we opened our first buybuy BABY store in Canada. On December 5, we opened our doors in Edmonton. We are excited about our opportunity to grow our baby offerings throughout Canada. It is our intent to continue to optimize our store operations and market coverage by expanding downsizing, renovating, opening, closing and relocating stores. We continue to actively manage our real estate portfolio in a manner that permits store sizes, layouts, locations and offerings to evolve over time to optimize market profitability.  Throughout the United States and Canada, we believe we have the opportunity to open stores in new and existing markets across all our concepts. Our goal is to provide more products, services and solutions to our customers and our stores continue to play a vital role in that strategy.
Additionally, in connection with leveraging our merchandise assortments and optimizing our operations, we continue to expand across selected stores a number of specialty departments such as health and beauty care, baby, specialty food and beverage. Although the number of these placements continues to evolve, and Bed Bath & Beyond stores alone, we have nearly 200 locations that have at least one specialty department already, and we believe there is an opportunity to add at least one more -- or one or more additional specialty departments to more than 1/3 of these stores. Also, we believe there's an opportunity to launch specialty departments in roughly 240 Bed Bath & Beyond stores that currently do not have one.
We are also a partner in a Mexican joint venture, which opened 1 Bed Bath & Beyond store earlier this year and currently operates 5 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in the Mexico City market. We continue to be excited about Mexico and, with our partners, plan to open additional stores in the future. And as you are probably aware, in addition to our retail operations, we are also growing our complementary institutional business, with the potential to utilize our existing vendor base to provide products and services to hospitality, travel and other institutional customers.
I'll now turn the call over to Sue to review our quarterly financial results and our planning assumptions. Sue?"

Net sales for the fiscal third quarter were approximately $2.9 billion, approximately 2.7% higher than net sales in the prior year period.

Net sales for the fiscal third quarter were approximately $2.9 billion, approximately 2.7% higher than net sales in the prior year period. Of this increase, approximately 60% was attributable to the increase in comp sales and the remainder is primarily from new stores. Comparable sales for the fiscal third quarter increased approximately by 1.7% this year compared with an increase of 1.3% last year. The comparable sales increase this year was attributed to increases in both the average transaction amount and the number of transaction.
Gross profit for the fiscal third quarter was approximately 38.4% of net sales compared to approximately 39.2% of net sales in the corresponding period a year ago. The decrease in the gross profit margin, as a percentage of net sales in order of magnitude, was primarily attributed to first, an increase in coupon expense, resulting from an increase in redemptions, partially offset by a slight decrease in the average coupon amount; and second, an increase in net direct-to-customer shipping expense, which continues to be impacted by a reduction in Bed Bath & Beyond free shipping threshold to $49, which is due to anniversary next month.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter were approximately 26.4% of net sales as compared to 26.1% of net sales in the prior year period. This 30 basis point increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increased technology expenses and related depreciation and increased advertising expenses, partially offset by the year-over-year net benefits of certain nonrecurring items, primarily relating to credit card fees litigation.  The increase in technology expenses and related depreciation as a percentage of net sales represented approximately 40 basis points for the quarter. The year-over-year favorable net benefits of certain nonrecurring items as a percentage of net sales represented approximately 30 basis points for the quarter. 
Reflecting the movements in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the third quarter operating profit margin of 12% was 110 basis points lower when compared with the same period last year.
Net interest expense of $19.6 million in the third quarter relates primarily to interest associated with our $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes issued in July 2014. 
Our provision for income taxes for the fiscal third quarter was approximately 32.3% compared to approximately 36.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2013.  The third quarter provisions included net after-tax benefits of approximately $16.7 million this year and $4.9 million last year due to distinct tax events occurring during the quarters.  Year-to-date net after-tax benefits for 2014 were $19.3 million versus $17.2 million for the comparable period in 2013. Our quarterly provisions for income taxes continue to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated.
Considering all of these activity, net earnings per diluted share were $1.23 for the third quarter of 2014, an increase of 9.8% compared to $1.12 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2013.
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. As of November 29, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents and investment securities were approximately $1.3 billion. Retail inventories at cost were approximately $3 billion or $70.43 per square foot, an increase of approximately 5.3% on a per square foot basis over the end of last year's third quarter. Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition.
Capital expenditures for the first 9 months of fiscal 2014 were approximately $231 million. Slightly more than half of these expenditures were for technology enhancements, with the remaining balance being used primarily for new stores, existing store improvements and other projects important to our future.
Consolidated shareholders' equity at the end of the quarter was approximately $3.2 billion, net of the initial shares delivered under the $1.1 billion accelerated share repurchase program, which commenced in July 2014. The company's $2 billion share repurchase authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $1.8 billion at the end of the quarter and is expected to be completed during fiscal 2016.
Regarding our store count, we currently operate 1,512 stores, consisting of 1,020 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states, the District of Colombia, Puerto Rico and Canada; 270 stores under the names World Market, Cost Plus World Market or Cost Plus; 94 buybuy BABY stores, including our newest and first store in Canada; 78 stores under the names Christmas Tree Shops, Christmas Tree Shops andThat! or andThat!; and 50 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values.  As of November 29, 2014, consolidated store space net of openings and closings for all of our concepts was approximately 43 million square feet, an increase of approximately 1.1% over the prior year period.
Turning to the remainder of fiscal 2014, the following are some of our planning assumptions. Based upon sales to date and our assumptions for the rest of the fourth quarter, we continue to model fourth quarter comp sales to be in the range of 4% to 5%. This will bring the modeled full year comp sales to a range of 2.4% to 2.7%. Consolidated net sales are modeled to increase in the range of approximately 4.4% to 5.4% for the fourth quarter. This results in a modeled full year consolidated net sales increase of approximately 3.4% to 3.6%.
Assuming these sales levels, we are modeling slight deleverage in gross profit margin for the fourth quarter and deleverage for the full year. Contributing to the modeled deleverage are increases in coupon expense and net direct to customer shipping expense. While any free shipping threshold is subject to change, our current $49 free shipping threshold at www.bedbathandbeyond.com is due to anniversary next month.
For SG&A, we are modeling slight deleverage as a percentage of net sales in both the fourth quarter and full year. The modeled SG&A includes increases in technology expense and depreciation related to ongoing investments. As Steve mentioned, we believe the technology investments we are making will produce long-term benefits and improve our omni-channel capabilities across all of our concepts.
Depreciation for fiscal 2014 is expected to be approximately $240 million.
Our model for interest expense for the fourth quarter is approximately $20.3 million, including the interest related to our $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes and the interest resulting from our sale leaseback obligations related to certain distribution facilities. 
The fourth quarter tax provision is estimated to be in the mid- to high 30s percentage range with expected variability as distinct tax events occur.
We expect to continue generating positive operating cash flow.
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2014 are now planned to be $330 million, with slightly more than half for technology enhancements. As a reminder, these expenditures remain subject to the timing and composition of projects.
Our model reflects continued repurchases of shares under our $2 billion share repurchase program with an assumed completion during fiscal 2016, which may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions. The $1.1 billion accelerated share repurchase program, which commenced in July 2014, was completed in December 2014 as planned.
In connection with the share repurchase activity, which includes assumptions about future market conditions including share price and trading volume, we are continuing to model diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 178 million for the third quarter and 189 million for the full year.
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are continuing to model net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $1.78 to $1.83 for the fourth quarter, now bringing the full year modeled net earnings per diluted share to a range of $5.05 to $5.09.
I would like to remind you that the timing and amount of our accelerated share repurchase impacts the quarterly and full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding differently. As you can see from our model of diluted weighed average shares outstanding, and as we explained last quarter, the impact on our individual quarters will be greater than the impact on the full year. As a result, the sum of the net earnings per diluted share for the four quarters of the year representing the 3 fiscal quarters already reported and the estimated earnings per diluted share for the fiscal fourth quarter are greater than the estimated full year net earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.06 to $0.07.
Turning to fiscal 2015. While we are in the process of completing our annual budget, our preliminary modeling assumptions include the following: We expect to make continued investments in technology and in our omni-channel capabilities. We also anticipate higher technology expenses and related depreciation in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales in conjunction with these technology investments. 
We anticipate opening approximately 30 stores across all concepts. We expect to continue our program of renovating or repositioning stores within markets where appropriate. 
As we previously discussed, while any free shipping threshold is subject to change, our current $49 free shipping threshold at www.bedbathandbeyond.com is due to anniversary next month.
We anticipate interest expense of approximately $82 million including the interest related to the $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes and the interest from our sale leaseback obligations related to certain distribution facilities. 
We expect continuing variability in our quarterly tax rates.
Our model reflects continued repurchases of shares under our $2 billion share repurchase program, with an assumed completion during fiscal 2016, which may be influenced by several factors including business and market conditions.
We will provide further information related to the fiscal first quarter and full year of 2015 on our next quarterly conference call on April 8, 2015. I would now like to turn the call back to Steve."

As Janet mentioned and as Sue will discuss in more detail, Bed Bath & Beyond reported net earnings per diluted share of $1.23, which includes approximately $0.04 per diluted share of net benefits for certain nonrecurring items, including credit card fee litigation, net sales of $2.9 billion and a comp sales increase of approximately 1.7%.  And we continue to model net earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.78 to $1.83 for the fourth quarter.
As a reminder, with respect to our comparable sales metric, it includes sales transactions consummated through all of our retail channels, including in-store, online and through a mobile device. Today, more than ever, customers are taking advantage of an omnichannel environment by using more than one platform to make their purchases.
For example, a customer may go to our store and be assisted by an associate to create a wedding or baby registry. This registry gift could then be purchased from one of our websites. Or a shopper may research a particular item on our websites and read various customer reviews before visiting a store to make a purchase. The same customer may choose to execute the sale via a mobile device and choose either in-store pickup or home delivery, which could then be fulfilled from a distribution facility, from a store or directly from a vendor. As we've consistently said, we believe an integrated shopping experience must exist among all channels to provide a seamless and efficient customer experience.  Today, our customers have many convenient options to interact with us, to find what they need when and how they want it. 
Another example of our seamless shopping experience is that we accept returns in-store without regard to the channel in which the purchase was consummated. It's worth noting that in a case of an item being purchased online and returned to a store, the sales return actually results in a reduction in store sales, even though the sale is consummated in a different channel. Our highly integrated retail operation makes it difficult for us to reasonably track the channel in which a sale is initiated. However, as we did last quarter, we can provide directional information on how the sale was completed.
With all this in mind, during the third quarter of fiscal 2014, comparable sales consummated through customer-facing online websites and mobile applications grew in excess of 40%, while comparable sales consummated in our stores were relatively flat. As a reminder, we re-platformed both the buybuy BABY and Bed Bath & Beyond websites during the second quarter of fiscal 2013.
Our commitment to take care of our customer is directly related to many of our capital investments, including our investments in technology. We believe new features and improved technology have created a better customer experience by contributing to an online sales growth. We recognize that the capital investments we are making and the incremental expenses related to them are increasing our technology costs and depreciation as well as other expenses as a percentage of net sales in the short term. However, we are confident we are making the appropriate investments to position our company for long-term profitable growth and to further enhance shareholder value in an evolving retail environment.
At this time, I like to provide an update on some of the progress we're making. We continue to add new functionality and assortment to our selling websites, mobile sites and apps. Today, we have more than 200,000 unique SKUs available online across our websites, representing an increase of more than 40% since last January. Many of these new SKUs can be shipped to our customers directly from our vendors.
We have introduced new categories online as well as expanded our assortments in others. Our online offerings now include such things as a selection of jewelry and watches. And we have greatly expanded online merchandise offerings for many categories, such as audio and electronics, furniture, lighting, rugs, pet care as well as lawn and garden.
Also on our Bed Bath & Beyond website, you can now purchase a variety of greenhouses and herb gardens as well as some interesting finds such as motorized scooters, electric snow throwers, dog houses, aviaries and chicken coops.
Further, to support our merchandise expansion in home furnishings in areas such as living room, dining room and bedroom sets, we have enhanced our vendor relationships and delivery capabilities to allow for the shipment of larger items directly to our customer's home. Our enhanced delivery capabilities give our customers the choice of several delivery options, ranging from curbside to white glove, which could include assembly and removal of product packaging.
We have also expanded the online registry services to Bed Bath & Beyond to enable customers to schedule an appointment for an in-store wedding consultation. In addition, we now have the capability to accept PayPal transactions online, and we are continuing to expand the acceptance of international credit cards. And for international orders, we have partnered with a third-party company to better enable the shipment of merchandise overseas.
We are also continuing our deployment of systems, equipment and increased bandwidth in our stores. These in-store system enhancements enable our associates to optimize our shipping costs for home deliveries as well as to improve inventory ordering and workforce management. They will also enable us over time to develop a digital shopping experience that will provide real-time personalized offers and recommendations that could be sent directly to a customer's mobile device. WiFi access to customers and store associates will enable a more dynamic shopping experience.
Further, we also plan to launch a new robust point-of-sale system that will, in conjunction with other system enhancements, over time allow customers to use their mobile device in our stores to shop and make purchases, to receive and redeem personalized coupons as well as receive a selection of multiple item-priced deals to enhance their shopping experience. These new system enhancements will also enable customers to make payments in foreign currencies and receipts to be issued in foreign languages.
In addition, we are also creating more flexible fulfillment options to allow us to deliver orders more quickly and cost-effectively. For example, to support our growing direct-to-consumer shipments and the growth of our health and beauty care offerings, we plan to open an additional distribution facility in Las Vegas in early 2015. As a reminder, product can ship directly from one of our distribution facilities, from one of our stores or directly from our vendors.
Looking ahead, we will continue to enhance and improve upon our online search and navigation capabilities, which is one way to better understand our customers' preferences and deliver a more personalized shopping experience; continue to enhance the shopping experience on our mobile websites by optimizing the mobile display capabilities; continue to strengthen and deepen our IT, analytics, marketing and e-commerce groups; enable our customers to manage their coupons in one place on our mobile apps; expand our buy online, pick up in store feature into Canada; and expand our online registry services for buybuy BABY, including Canada, to enable customers to schedule an appointment for in-store baby registry consultation.
We are pleased by the progress and adoption of our omnichannel initiatives. We're also very pleased by our customers' acceptance of our ever-increasing and differentiated merchandise assortments. We continue to leverage our product offerings, services and promotional activities across all channels, concepts and countries in which we do business so that we can do more for and with our customers.
On the real estate side, our third quarter activities included opening 4 new Bed Bath & Beyond stores, 1 buybuy BABY store and 1 Cost Plus World Market store and the closing of 2 Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Including stores opened to date, we are still on track to open approximately 22 new stores company-wide during our 2014 fiscal year.
During this current fourth quarter, we opened our first buybuy BABY store in Canada. On December 5, we opened our doors in Edmonton. We are excited about the opportunity to grow our baby offerings throughout Canada. It is our intent to continue to optimize our store operations and market coverage by expanding, downsizing, renovating, opening, closing and relocating stores. We continue to actively manage our real estate portfolio in a manner that permits store sizes, layouts, locations and offerings to evolve over time to optimize market profitability. Throughout the United States and Canada, we believe we have the opportunity to open stores in new and existing markets across all our concepts. Our goal is to provide more products, services and solutions to our customers, and our stores continue to play a vital role in that strategy.
Additionally, in connection with leveraging our merchandise assortments and optimizing our operations, we continue to expand across selected stores a number of specialty departments, such as health and beauty care, baby, specialty food and beverage. Although the number of these placements continues to evolve, in Bed Bath & Beyond stores alone, we have nearly 200 locations that have at least one specialty department already, and we believe there is an opportunity to add at least one more -- one or more additional specialty departments to more than 1/3 of these stores. Also, we believe there's an opportunity to launch specialty departments in roughly 240 Bed Bath & Beyond stores that currently do not have one.
We are also a partner in a Mexican joint venture, which opened 1 Bed Bath & Beyond store earlier this year and currently operates 5 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in the Mexico City market. We continue to be excited about Mexico and, with our partners, plan to open additional stores in the future. And as you are probably aware, in addition to our retail operations, we are also growing our complementary institutional business, with the potential to utilize our existing vendor base to provide products and services to hospitality, travel and other institutional customers.
I'll now turn the call over to Sue to review our quarterly financial results and our planning assumptions. Sue?"

Net sales for the fiscal third quarter were approximately $2.9 billion, approximately 2.7% higher than net sales in the prior year period.

Net sales for the fiscal third quarter were approximately $2.9 billion, approximately 2.7% higher than net sales in the prior year period. Of this increase, approximately 60% was attributable to the increase in comp sales and the remainder is primarily from new stores. Comparable sales for the fiscal third quarter increased approximately by 1.7% this year compared with an increase of 1.3% last year. The comparable sales increase this year was attributed to increases in both the average transaction amount and the number of transactions.
Gross profit for the fiscal third quarter was approximately 38.4% of net sales compared to approximately 39.2% of net sales in the corresponding period a year ago. The decrease in the gross profit margin, as a percentage of net sales in order of magnitude, was primarily attributed to first, an increase in coupon expense, resulting from an increase in redemptions, partially offset by a slight decrease in the average coupon amount; and second, an increase in net direct-to-customer shipping expense, which continues to be impacted by a reduction in bedbathandbeyond.com's free shipping threshold to $49, which is due to anniversary next month.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter were approximately 26.4% of net sales as compared to 26.1% of net sales in the prior year period. This 30 basis point increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increased technology expenses and related depreciation and increased advertising expenses, partially offset by the year-over-year net benefits of certain nonrecurring items, primarily relating to credit card fee litigation. The increase in technology expenses and related depreciation as a percentage of net sales represented approximately 40 basis points for the quarter. The year-over-year favorable net benefits of certain nonrecurring items as a percentage of net sales represented approximately 30 basis points for the quarter.
Reflecting the movements in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the third quarter operating profit margin of 12% was 110 basis points lower when compared with the same period last year.
Net interest expense of $19.6 million in the third quarter relates primarily to interest associated with our $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes issued in July 2014.
Our provision for income taxes for the fiscal third quarter was approximately 32.3% compared to approximately 36.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. The third quarter provisions included net after-tax benefits of approximately $16.7 million this year and $4.9 million last year due to distinct tax events occurring during the quarters.  Year-to-date net after-tax benefits for 2014 were $19.3 million versus $17.2 million for the comparable period in 2013. Our quarterly provisions for income taxes continue to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated.
Considering all of these activity, net earnings per diluted share were $1.23 for the third quarter of 2014, an increase of 9.8% compared to $1.12 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2013.
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. As of November 29, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents and investment securities were approximately $1.3 billion. Retail inventories at cost were approximately $3 billion or $70.43 per square foot, an increase of approximately 5.3% on a per square foot basis over the end of last year's third quarter. Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition.
Capital expenditures for the first 9 months of fiscal 2014 were approximately $231 million. Slightly more than half of these expenditures were for technology enhancements, with the remaining balance being used primarily for new stores, existing store improvements and other projects important to our future.
Consolidated shareholders' equity at the end of the quarter was approximately $3.2 billion, net of the initial shares delivered under the $1.1 billion accelerated share repurchase program, which commenced in July 2014. The company's $2 billion share repurchase authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $1.8 billion at the end of the quarter and is expected to be completed during fiscal 2016.
Regarding our store count, we currently operate 1,512 stores, consisting of 1,020 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada; 270 stores under the names World Market, Cost Plus World Market or Cost Plus; 94 buybuy BABY stores, including our newest and first store in Canada; 78 stores under the names Christmas Tree Shops, Christmas Tree Shops andThat! or andThat!; and 50 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values. As of November 29, 2014, consolidated store space, net of openings and closings for all of our concepts, was approximately 43 million square feet, an increase of approximately 1.1% over the prior year period.
Turning to the remainder of fiscal 2014, the following are some of our planning assumptions: Based upon sales to date and our assumptions for the rest of the fourth quarter, we continue to model fourth quarter comp sales to be in the range of 4% to 5%. This will bring the modeled full year comp sales to a range of 2.4% to 2.7%. Consolidated net sales are modeled to increase in the range of approximately 4.4% to 5.4% for the fourth quarter. This results in a modeled full year consolidated net sales increase of approximately 3.4% to 3.6%.
Assuming these sales levels, we are modeling slight deleverage in gross profit margin for the fourth quarter and deleverage for the full year. Contributing to the modeled deleverage are increases in coupon expense and net direct-to-customer shipping expense. While any free shipping threshold is subject to change, our current $49 free shipping threshold at bedbathandbeyond.com is due to anniversary next month.
For SG&A, we are modeling slight deleverage as a percentage of net sales in both the fourth quarter and full year. The modeled SG&A includes increases in technology expense and depreciation related to our ongoing investments. As Steve mentioned, we believe the technology investments we are making will produce long-term benefits and improve our omnichannel capabilities across all of our concepts.
Depreciation for fiscal 2014 is expected to be approximately $240 million.
Our model for interest expense for the fourth quarter is approximately $20.3 million, including the interest related to our $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes and the interest resulting from our sale leaseback obligations related to certain distribution facilities.
The fourth quarter tax provision is estimated to be in the mid- to high-30s percentage range with expected variability as distinct tax events occur.
We expect to continue generating positive operating cash flow.
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2014 are now planned to be $330 million, with slightly more than half for technology enhancements. As a reminder, these expenditures remain subject to the timing and composition of projects.
Our model reflects continued repurchases of shares under our $2 billion share repurchase program, with an assumed completion during fiscal 2016, which may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions. The $1.1 billion accelerated share repurchase program, which commenced in July 2014, was completed in December 2014, as planned.
In connection with the share repurchase activity, which includes assumptions about future market conditions, including share price and trading volume, we are continuing to model diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 178 million for the fourth quarter and 189 million for the full year.
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are continuing to model net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $1.78 to $1.83 for the fourth quarter, now bringing the full year modeled net earnings per diluted share to a range of $5.05 to $5.09.
I would like to remind you that the timing and amount of our accelerated share repurchase impacts the quarterly and full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding differently. As you can see from our model of diluted weighed average shares outstanding and as we explained last quarter, the impact on our individual quarters will be greater than the impact on the full year. As a result, the sum of the net earnings per diluted share for the four quarters of the year, representing the 3 fiscal quarters already reported and the estimated earnings per diluted share for the fiscal fourth quarter, are greater than the estimated full year net earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.06 to $0.07.
Turning to fiscal 2015. While we are in the process of completing our annual budget, our preliminary modeling assumptions include the following: We expect to make continued investments in technology and in our omnichannel capabilities. We also anticipate higher technology expenses and related depreciation in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales in conjunction with the technology investments. 
We anticipate opening approximately 30 stores across all concepts. We expect to continue our program of renovating or repositioning stores within markets where appropriate.
As we previously discussed, while any free shipping threshold is subject to change, our current $49 free shipping threshold at bedbathandbeyond.com is due to anniversary next month.
We anticipate interest expense of approximately $82 million, including the interest related to the $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes and the interest from our sale leaseback obligations related to certain distribution facilities. 
We expect continuing variability in our quarterly tax rates.
Our model reflects continued repurchases of shares under our $2 billion share repurchase program, with an assumed completion during fiscal 2016, which may be influenced by several factors including business and market conditions.
We will provide further information related to the fiscal first quarter and full year of 2015 on our next quarterly conference call on April 8, 2015.
I would now like to turn the call back to Steve."

We're thrilled that you joined us. And to our listeners, good afternoon, and I'd like to wish everyone a healthy and happy new year.
The retail environment is ever-changing, and Bed Bath & Beyond has more than 43 years of experience navigating the challenges of this competitive and dynamic industry. This past holiday season reflects this continuing evolution in retailing, as we saw more customers interact with us online and through their mobile devices than ever before.
True to our history and as our successful track record shows, while never satisfied, overall, we were able to meet the needs of our customers and we are confident in our ability to prosper in this evolving retail environment. We continue to maintain our philosophy of providing great service and great selection at the right value. And now we can do this in more ways than ever. 
Our ability to interact with our customers wherever, whenever and however they express their lifestyles and habits and move through their various life stages, creates a powerful customer value proposition and a loyal customer base. By combining our services and merchandise offerings together with the ability to utilize the significant data available to us about our customers' preferences, we are excited to have the opportunity to become more dynamic and more relevant to our customers.

And we continue to model net earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.78 to $1.83 for the fourth quarter.
As a reminder, with respect to our comparable sales metric, it includes sales transactions consummated through all of our retail channels, including in-store, online and through a mobile device. Today, more than ever, customers are taking advantage of our omnichannel environment by using more than one platform to make their purchases.
For example, a customer may go to our store and be assisted by an associate to create a wedding or baby registry. This registry gift could then be purchased from one of our websites. Or a shopper may research a particular item on our websites and read various customer reviews before visiting a store to make a purchase. The same customer may choose to execute the sale via a mobile device and choose either in-store pickup or home delivery, which could then be fulfilled from a distribution facility, from a store or directly from a vendor.

Our highly integrated retail operation makes it difficult for us to reasonably track the channel in which a sale is initiated. However, as we did last quarter, we can provide directional information on how the sale was completed.
With all this in mind, during the third quarter of fiscal 2014, comparable sales consummated through customer-facing online websites and mobile applications grew in excess of 40%, while comparable sales consummated in our stores were relatively flat. As a reminder, we re-platformed both the buybuy BABY and Bed Bath & Beyond websites during the second quarter of fiscal 2013.
Our commitment to take care of our customer is directly related to many of our capital investments, including our investments in technology. We believe new features and improved technology have created a better customer experience by contributing to our online sales growth. We recognize that the capital investments we are making and the incremental expenses related to them are increasing our technology costs and depreciation as well as other expenses as a percentage of net sales in the short term. However, we are confident we are making the appropriate investments to position our company for long-term profitable growth and to further enhance shareholder value in an evolving retail environment.
At this time, I like to provide an update on some of the progress we're making. We continue to add new functionality and assortment to our selling websites, mobile sites and apps. Today, we have more than 200,000 unique SKUs available online across our websites, representing an increase of more than 40% since last January. Many of these new SKUs can be shipped to our customers directly from our vendors.
We have introduced new categories online as well as expanded our assortments in others. Our online offerings now include such things as a selection of jewelry and watches. And we have greatly expanded our online merchandise offerings for many categories, such as audio and electronics, furniture, lighting, rugs, pet care as well as lawn and garden.
Also on our Bed Bath & Beyond website, you can now purchase a variety of greenhouses and herb gardens as well as some interesting finds such as motorized scooters, electric snow throwers, dog houses, aviaries and chicken coops.
Further, to support our merchandise expansion in home furnishings in areas such as living room, dining room and bedroom sets, we have enhanced our vendor relationships and delivery capabilities to allow for the shipment of larger items directly to our customers' homes. Our enhanced delivery capabilities give our customers the choice of several delivery options, ranging from curbside to white glove, which could include assembly and removal of product packaging.
We have also expanded the online registry services to Bed Bath & Beyond to enable customers to schedule an appointment for an in-store wedding consultation. In addition, we now have the capability to accept PayPal transactions online, and we are continuing to expand the acceptance of international credit cards. And for international orders, we have partnered with a third-party company to better enable the shipment of merchandise overseas.
We are also continuing our deployment of systems, equipment and increased bandwidth in our stores. These in-store system enhancements enable our associates to optimize our shipping costs for home deliveries as well as to improve inventory ordering and workforce management. They will also enable us over time to develop a digital shopping experience that will provide real-time personalized offers and recommendations that could be sent directly to a customer's mobile device. WiFi access to customers and store associates will enable a more dynamic shopping experience.
Further, we also plan to launch a new robust point-of-sale system that will, in conjunction with other system enhancements, over time, allow customers to use their mobile device in our stores to shop and make purchases, to receive and redeem personalized coupons as well as receive a selection of multiple item-priced deals to enhance their shopping experience. These new system enhancements will also enable customers to make payments in foreign currencies and receipts to be issued in foreign languages.
In addition, we are also creating more flexible fulfillment options to allow us to deliver orders more quickly and cost-effectively. For example, to support our growing direct-to-consumer shipments and the growth of our health and beauty care offerings, we plan to open an additional distribution facility in Las Vegas in early 2015. As a reminder, product can ship directly from one of our distribution facilities, from one of our stores or directly from our vendors.
Looking ahead, we will continue to enhance and improve upon our online search and navigation capabilities, which is one way to better understand our customers' preferences and deliver a more personalized shopping experience; continue to enhance the shopping experience on our mobile websites by optimizing the mobile display capabilities; continue to strengthen and deepen our IT, analytics, marketing and e-commerce groups; enable our customers to manage their coupons in one place on our mobile apps; expand our buy online, pick up in store feature into Canada; and expand our online registry services for buybuy BABY, including Canada, to enable customers to schedule an appointment for in-store baby registry consultation.
We are pleased by the progress and adoption of our omnichannel initiatives. We're also very pleased by our customers' acceptance of our ever-increasing and differentiated merchandise assortments. We continue to leverage our product offerings, services and promotional activities across all channels, concepts and countries in which we do business so that we can do more for and with our customers.
On the real estate side, our third quarter activities included opening 4 new Bed Bath & Beyond stores, 1 buybuy BABY store and 1 Cost Plus World Market store and the closing of 2 Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Including stores opened to date, we are still on track to open approximately 22 new stores company-wide during our 2014 fiscal year.
During this current fourth quarter, we opened our first buybuy BABY store in Canada. On December 5, we opened our doors in Edmonton. We are excited about the opportunity to grow our baby offerings throughout Canada. It is our intent to continue to optimize our store operations and market coverage by expanding, downsizing, renovating, opening, closing and relocating stores. 
We continue to actively manage our real estate portfolio in a manner that permits store sizes, layouts, locations and offerings to evolve over time to optimize market profitability. Throughout the United States and Canada, we believe we have the opportunity to open stores in new and existing markets across all our concepts. Our goal is to provide more products, services and solutions to our customers, and our stores continue to play a vital role in that strategy.
Additionally, in connection with leveraging our merchandise assortments and optimizing our operations, we continue to expand across selected stores a number of specialty departments, such as health and beauty care, baby, specialty food and beverage. 
Although the number of these placements continues to evolve, in Bed Bath & Beyond stores alone, we have nearly 200 locations that have at least 1 specialty department already, and we believe there is an opportunity to add at least 1 more -- 1 or more additional specialty departments to more than 1/3 of these stores. Also, we believe there's an opportunity to launch specialty departments in roughly 240 Bed Bath & Beyond stores that currently do not have one.
We are also a partner in a Mexican joint venture, which opened 1 Bed Bath & Beyond store earlier this year and currently operates 5 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in the Mexico City market. We continue to be excited about Mexico and, with our partners, plan to open additional stores in the future. And as you are probably aware, in addition to our retail operations, we are also growing our complementary institutional business, with the potential to utilize our existing vendor base to provide products and services to hospitality, travel and other institutional customers.
I'll now turn the call over to Sue to review our quarterly financial results and our planning assumptions. Sue?"

Net sales for the fiscal third quarter were approximately $2.9 billion, approximately 2.7% higher than net sales in the prior year period.

Net sales for the fiscal third quarter were approximately $2.9 billion, approximately 2.7% higher than net sales in the prior year period. Of this increase, approximately 60% was attributable to the increase in comp sales and the remainder is primarily from new stores. Comparable sales for the fiscal third quarter increased approximately by 1.7% this year compared with an increase of 1.3% last year. The comparable sales increase this year was attributed to increases in both the average transaction amount and the number of transactions.
Gross profit for the fiscal third quarter was approximately 38.4% of net sales compared to approximately 39.2% of net sales in the corresponding period a year ago. The decrease in the gross profit margin, as a percentage of net sales in order of magnitude, was primarily attributed to first, an increase in coupon expense, resulting from an increase in redemptions, partially offset by a slight decrease in the average coupon amount; and second, an increase in net direct-to-customer shipping expense, which continues to be impacted by a reduction in bedbathandbeyond.com's free shipping threshold to $49, which is due to anniversary next month.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter were approximately 26.4% of net sales as compared to 26.1% of net sales in the prior year period. This 30 basis point increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increased technology expenses and related depreciation and increased advertising expenses, partially offset by the year-over-year net benefits of certain nonrecurring items, primarily relating to credit card fee litigation. The increase in technology expenses and related depreciation as a percentage of net sales represented approximately 40 basis points for the quarter. 
The year-over-year favorable net benefits of certain nonrecurring items as a percentage of net sales represented approximately 30 basis points for the quarter.
Reflecting the movements in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the third quarter operating profit margin of 12% was 110 basis points lower when compared with the same period last year.
Net interest expense of $19.6 million in the third quarter relates primarily to interest associated with our $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes issued in July 2014.
Our provision for income taxes for the fiscal third quarter was approximately 32.3% compared to approximately 36.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. The third quarter provisions included net after-tax benefits of approximately $16.7 million this year and $4.9 million last year due to distinct tax events occurring during the quarters. 
Year-to-date net after-tax benefits for 2014 were $19.3 million versus $17.2 million for the comparable period in 2013. Our quarterly provisions for income taxes continue to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated.
Considering all of this activity, net earnings per diluted share were $1.23 for the third quarter of 2014, an increase of 9.8% compared to $1.12 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2013.
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. As of November 29, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents and investment securities were approximately $1.3 billion. Retail inventories at cost were approximately $3 billion or $70.43 per square foot, an increase of approximately 5.3% on a per square foot basis over the end of last year's third quarter. Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition.
Capital expenditures for the first 9 months of fiscal 2014 were approximately $231 million. Slightly more than half of these expenditures were for technology enhancements, with the remaining balance being used primarily for new stores, existing store improvements and other projects important to our future.
Consolidated shareholders' equity at the end of the quarter was approximately $3.2 billion, net of the initial shares delivered under the $1.1 billion accelerated share repurchase program, which commenced in July 2014. The company's $2 billion share repurchase authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $1.8 billion at the end of the quarter and is expected to be completed during fiscal 2016.
Regarding our store count, we currently operate 1,512 stores, consisting of 1,020 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada; 270 stores under the names World Market, Cost Plus World Market or Cost Plus; 94 buybuy BABY stores, including our newest and first store in Canada; 78 stores under the names Christmas Tree Shops, Christmas Tree Shops andThat! or andThat!; and 50 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values. As of November 29, 2014, consolidated store space, net of openings and closings for all of our concepts, was approximately 43 million square feet, an increase of approximately 1.1% over the prior year period.
Turning to the remainder of fiscal 2014, the following are some of our planning assumptions. Based upon sales to date and our assumptions for the rest of the fourth quarter, we continue to model fourth quarter comp sales to be in the range of 4% to 5%. This will bring the modeled full year comp sales to a range of 2.4% to 2.7%. Consolidated net sales are modeled to increase in the range of approximately 4.4% to 5.4% for the fourth quarter. This results in a modeled full year consolidated net sales increase of approximately 3.4% to 3.6%.
Assuming these sales levels, we are modeling slight deleverage in gross profit margin for the fourth quarter and deleverage for the full year. Contributing to the modeled deleverage are increases in coupon expense and net direct-to-customer shipping expense. While any free shipping threshold is subject to change, our current $49 free shipping threshold at bedbathandbeyond.com is due to anniversary next month.
For SG&A, we are modeling slight deleverage as a percentage of net sales in both the fourth quarter and full year. The modeled SG&A includes increases in technology expense and depreciation related to our ongoing investments. As Steve mentioned, we believe the technology investments we are making will produce long-term benefits and improve our omnichannel capabilities across all of our concepts. Depreciation for fiscal 2014 is expected to be approximately $240 million.
Our model for interest expense for the fourth quarter is approximately $20.3 million, including the interest related to our $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes and the interest resulting from our sale leaseback obligations related to certain distribution facilities.
The fourth quarter tax provision is estimated to be in the mid- to high-30s percentage range with expected variability as distinct tax events occur.
We expect to continue generating positive operating cash flow.
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2014 are now planned to be $330 million, with slightly more than half for technology enhancements. As a reminder, these expenditures remain subject to the timing and composition of projects.
Our model reflects continued repurchases of shares under our $2 billion share repurchase program, with an assumed completion during fiscal 2016, which may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions. The $1.1 billion accelerated share repurchase program, which commenced in July 2014, was completed in December 2014, as planned.
In connection with the share repurchase activity, which includes assumptions about future market conditions, including share price and trading volume, we are continuing to model diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 178 million for the fourth quarter and 189 million for the full year.
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are continuing to model net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $1.78 to $1.83 for the fourth quarter, now bringing the full year modeled net earnings per diluted share to a range of $5.05 to $5.09.
I would like to remind you that the timing and amount of our accelerated share repurchase impacts the quarterly and full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding differently. As you can see from our model of diluted weighted average shares outstanding and as we explained last quarter, the impact on our individual quarters will be greater than the impact on the full year. As a result, the sum of the net earnings per diluted share for the 4 quarters of the year, representing the 3 fiscal quarters already reported and the estimated earnings per diluted share for the fiscal fourth quarter, are greater than the estimated full year net earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.06 to $0.07.
Turning to fiscal 2015. While we are in the process of completing our annual budget, our preliminary modeling assumptions include the following: We expect to make continued investments in technology and in our omnichannel capabilities. We also anticipate higher technology expenses and related depreciation in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales in conjunction with these technology investments. 
We anticipate opening approximately 30 stores across all concepts. We expect to continue our program of renovating or repositioning stores within markets where appropriate.
As we previously discussed, while any free shipping threshold is subject to change, our current $49 free shipping threshold at bedbathandbeyond.com is due to anniversary next month.
We anticipate interest expense of approximately $82 million, including the interest related to the $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes and the interest from our sale leaseback obligations related to certain distribution facilities. 
We expect continuing variability in our quarterly tax rates.
Our model reflects continued repurchases of shares under our $2 billion share repurchase program, with an assumed completion during fiscal 2016, which may be influenced by several factors including business and market conditions.
We will provide further information related to the fiscal first quarter and full year of 2015 on our next quarterly conference call on April 8, 2015.
I would now like to turn the call back to Steve."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our earnings call to review our third quarter of fiscal 2014 results. I am joined by Steven Temares, Bed Bath & Beyond's Chief Executive Officer; and Sue Lattmann, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements about or references to our internal models and our long-term objectives. All such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we say during the call today. 
Please refer to our most recent periodic SEC filings for more detail on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, as events or circumstances may change after this call.
Our earnings press release dated January 8, 2015, can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, www.bedbathandbeyond.com. For those of you who might not have had the chance to read the press release, here are some highlights. Our third quarter of fiscal 2014 net earnings per diluted share were $1.23, which includes approximately $0.04 per diluted share of net benefits for certain nonrecurring items, including credit card fee litigation. Third quarter net sales were $2.9 billion, an increase of approximately 2.7% over the prior year period. Comparable sales increased by approximately 1.7% in the third quarter.
For the fourth quarter of 2014, our model continues to show net earnings per diluted share in the range of approximately $1.78 to $1.83. We are now modeling full year net earnings per diluted share of approximately $5.05 to $5.09, which reflects our third quarter actual results and our current fourth quarter model.

We're thrilled that you joined us.

We're thrilled that you joined us. And to our listeners, good afternoon, and I'd like to wish everyone a healthy and happy new year.
The retail environment is ever-changing, and Bed Bath & Beyond has more than 43 years of experience navigating the challenges of this competitive and dynamic industry. This past holiday season reflects this continuing evolution in retailing, as we saw more customers interact with us online and through their mobile devices than ever before.
True to our history and as our successful track record shows, while never satisfied, overall, we were able to meet the needs of our customers and we are confident in our ability to prosper in this evolving retail environment. We continue to maintain our philosophy of providing great service and great selection at the right value. And now we can do this in more ways than ever. 
Our ability to interact with our customers wherever, whenever and however they express their lifestyles and habits and move through their various life stages, creates a powerful customer value proposition and a loyal customer base. By combining our services and merchandise offerings together with the ability to utilize the significant data available to us about our customers' preferences, we are excited to have the opportunity to become more dynamic and more relevant to our customers.
As Janet mentioned and as Sue will discuss in more detail, Bed Bath & Beyond reported net earnings per diluted share of $1.23, which includes approximately $0.04 per diluted share of net benefits for certain nonrecurring items, including credit card fee litigation, net sales of $2.9 billion and a comp sales increase of approximately 1.7%. And we continue to model net earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.78 to $1.83 for the fourth quarter.
As a reminder, with respect to our comparable sales metric, it includes sales transactions consummated through all of our retail channels, including in-store, online and through a mobile device. Today, more than ever, customers are taking advantage of our omnichannel environment by using more than one platform to make their purchases.
For example, a customer may go to our store and be assisted by an associate to create a wedding or baby registry. This registry gift could then be purchased from one of our websites. Or a shopper may research a particular item on our websites and read various customer reviews before visiting a store to make a purchase. The same customer may choose to execute the sale via a mobile device and choose either in-store pickup or home delivery, which could then be fulfilled from a distribution facility, from a store or directly from a vendor. 
As we've consistently said, we believe an integrated shopping experience must exist among all channels to provide a seamless and efficient customer experience. Today, our customers have many convenient options to interact with us to find what they need when and how they want it. 
Another example of our seamless shopping experience is that we accept returns in-store without regard to the channel in which the purchase was consummated. It's worth noting that in a case of an item being purchased online and returned to a store, the sales return actually results in a reduction in store sales, even though the sale was consummated in a different channel. Our highly integrated retail operation makes it difficult for us to reasonably track the channel in which a sale is initiated. However, as we did last quarter, we can provide directional information on how the sale was completed.
With all this in mind, during the third quarter of fiscal 2014, comparable sales consummated through customer-facing online websites and mobile applications grew in excess of 40%, while comparable sales consummated in our stores were relatively flat. As a reminder, we re-platformed both the buybuy BABY and Bed Bath & Beyond websites during the second quarter of fiscal 2013.
Our commitment to take care of our customer is directly related to many of our capital investments, including our investments in technology. We believe new features and improved technology have created a better customer experience by contributing to our online sales growth. We recognize that the capital investments we are making and the incremental expenses related to them are increasing our technology costs and depreciation as well as other expenses as a percentage of net sales in the short term. However, we are confident we are making the appropriate investments to position our company for long-term profitable growth and to further enhance shareholder value in an evolving retail environment.
At this time, I like to provide an update on some of the progress we're making. We continue to add new functionality and assortment to our selling websites, mobile sites and apps. Today, we have more than 200,000 unique SKUs available online across our websites, representing an increase of more than 40% since last January. Many of these new SKUs can be shipped to our customers directly from our vendors.
We have introduced new categories online as well as expanded our assortments in others. Our online offerings now include such things as a selection of jewelry and watches. And we have greatly expanded our online merchandise offerings for many categories, such as audio and electronics, furniture, lighting, rugs, pet care as well as lawn and garden.
Also on our Bed Bath & Beyond website, you can now purchase a variety of greenhouses and herb gardens as well as some interesting finds such as motorized scooters, electric snow throwers, dog houses, aviaries and chicken coops. Further, to support our merchandise expansion in home furnishings in areas such as living room, dining room and bedroom sets, we have enhanced our vendor relationships and delivery capabilities to allow for the shipment of larger items directly to our customers' homes. Our enhanced delivery capabilities give our customers the choice of several delivery options, ranging from curbside to white glove, which could include assembly and removal of product packaging.
We have also expanded the online registry services to Bed Bath & Beyond to enable customers to schedule an appointment for an in-store wedding consultation. In addition, we now have the capability to accept PayPal transactions online, and we are continuing to expand the acceptance of international credit cards. And for international orders, we have partnered with a third-party company to better enable the shipment of merchandise overseas.
We are also continuing our deployment of systems, equipment and increased bandwidth in our stores. These in-store system enhancements enable our associates to optimize our shipping costs for home deliveries as well as to improve inventory ordering and workforce management. They will also enable us over time to develop a digital shopping experience that will provide real-time personalized offers and recommendations that could be sent directly to a customer's mobile device. WiFi access to customers and store associates will enable a more dynamic shopping experience.
Further, we also plan to launch a new robust point-of-sale system that will, in conjunction with other system enhancements, over time, allow customers to use their mobile device in our stores to shop and make purchases, to receive and redeem personalized coupons as well as receive a selection of multiple item-priced deals to enhance their shopping experience. These new system enhancements will also enable customers to make payments in foreign currencies and receipts to be issued in foreign languages.
In addition, we are also creating more flexible fulfillment options to allow us to deliver orders more quickly and cost-effectively. For example, to support our growing direct-to-consumer shipments and the growth of our health and beauty care offerings, we plan to open an additional distribution facility in Las Vegas in early 2015. As a reminder, product can ship directly from one of our distribution facilities, from one of our stores or directly from our vendors.
Looking ahead, we will continue to enhance and improve upon our online search and navigation capabilities, which is one way to better understand our customers' preferences and deliver a more personalized shopping experience; continue to enhance the shopping experience on our mobile websites by optimizing the mobile display capabilities; continue to strengthen and deepen our IT, analytics, marketing and e-commerce groups; enable our customers to manage their coupons in one place on our mobile apps; expand our buy online, pick up in store feature into Canada; and expand our online registry services for buybuy BABY, including Canada, to enable customers to schedule an appointment for in-store baby registry consultation.
We are pleased by the progress and adoption of our omnichannel initiatives. We're also very pleased by our customers' acceptance of our ever-increasing and differentiated merchandise assortments. We continue to leverage our product offerings, services and promotional activities across all channels, concepts and countries in which we do business so that we can do more for and with our customers.
On the real estate side, our third quarter activities included opening 4 new Bed Bath & Beyond stores, 1 buybuy BABY store and 1 Cost Plus World Market store and the closing of 2 Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Including stores opened to date, we are still on track to open approximately 22 new stores company-wide during our 2014 fiscal year.
During this current fourth quarter, we opened our first buybuy BABY store in Canada. On December 5, we opened our doors in Edmonton. We are excited about the opportunity to grow our baby offerings throughout Canada. It is our intent to continue to optimize our store operations and market coverage by expanding, downsizing, renovating, opening, closing and relocating stores. 
We continue to actively manage our real estate portfolio in a manner that permits store sizes, layouts, locations and offerings to evolve over time to optimize market profitability. Throughout the United States and Canada, we believe we have the opportunity to open stores in new and existing markets across all our concepts. Our goal is to provide more products, services and solutions to our customers, and our stores continue to play a vital role in that strategy.
Additionally, in connection with leveraging our merchandise assortments and optimizing our operations, we continue to expand across selected stores a number of specialty departments, such as health and beauty care, baby, specialty food and beverage. 
Although the number of these placements continues to evolve, in Bed Bath & Beyond stores alone, we have nearly 200 locations that have at least one specialty department already, and we believe there is an opportunity to add at least one more -- one or more additional specialty departments to more than 1/3 of these stores. Also, we believe there's an opportunity to launch specialty departments in roughly 240 Bed Bath & Beyond stores that currently do not have one.
We are also a partner in a Mexican joint venture, which opened one Bed Bath & Beyond store earlier this year and currently operates 5 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in the Mexico City market. We continue to be excited about Mexico and, with our partners, plan to open additional stores in the future. And as you are probably aware, in addition to our retail operations, we are also growing our complementary institutional business, with the potential to utilize our existing vendor base to provide products and services to hospitality, travel and other institutional customers.
I'll now turn the call over to Sue to review our quarterly financial results and our planning assumptions. Sue?"

Reflecting the movements in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the third quarter operating profit margin of 12% was 110 basis points lower when compared with the same period last year.
Net interest expense of $19.6 million in the third quarter relates primarily to interest associated with our $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes issued in July 2014.
Our provision for income taxes for the fiscal third quarter was approximately 32.3% compared to approximately 36.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. The third quarter provisions included net after-tax benefits of approximately $16.7 million this year and $4.9 million last year due to distinct tax events occurring during the quarters. 
Year-to-date net after-tax benefits for 2014 were $19.3 million versus $17.2 million for the comparable period in 2013. Our quarterly provisions for income taxes continue to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated.
Considering all of this activity, net earnings per diluted share were $1.23 for the third quarter of 2014, an increase of 9.8% compared to $1.12 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2013.
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. As of November 29, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents and investment securities were approximately $1.3 billion. Retail inventories at cost were approximately $3 billion or $70.43 per square foot, an increase of approximately 5.3% on a per square foot basis over the end of last year's third quarter. Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition.
Capital expenditures for the first 9 months of fiscal 2014 were approximately $231 million. Slightly more than half of these expenditures were for technology enhancements, with the remaining balance being used primarily for new stores, existing store improvements and other projects important to our future.
Consolidated shareholders' equity at the end of the quarter was approximately $3.2 billion, net of the initial shares delivered under the $1.1 billion accelerated share repurchase program, which commenced in July 2014. The company's $2 billion share repurchase authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $1.8 billion at the end of the quarter and is expected to be completed during fiscal 2016.
Regarding our store count, we currently operate 1,512 stores, consisting of 1,020 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada; 270 stores under the names World Market, Cost Plus World Market or Cost Plus; 94 buybuy BABY stores, including our newest and first store in Canada; 78 stores under the names Christmas Tree Shops, Christmas Tree Shops andThat! or andThat!; and 50 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values. As of November 29, 2014, consolidated store space, net of openings and closings for all of our concepts, was approximately 43 million square feet, an increase of approximately 1.1% over the prior year period.
Turning to the remainder of fiscal 2014, the following are some of our planning assumptions. Based upon sales to date and our assumptions for the rest of the fourth quarter, we continue to model fourth quarter comp sales to be in the range of 4% to 5%. This will bring the modeled full year comp sales to a range of 2.4% to 2.7%. Consolidated net sales are modeled to increase in the range of approximately 4.4% to 5.4% for the fourth quarter. This results in a modeled full year consolidated net sales increase of approximately 3.4% to 3.6%.
Assuming these sales levels, we are modeling slight deleverage in gross profit margin for the fourth quarter and deleverage for the full year. Contributing to the modeled deleverage are increases in coupon expense and net direct-to-customer shipping expense. While any free shipping threshold is subject to change, our current $49 free shipping threshold at bedbathandbeyond.com is due to anniversary next month.
For SG&A, we are modeling slight deleverage as a percentage of net sales in both the fourth quarter and full year. The modeled SG&A includes increases in technology expense and depreciation related to our ongoing investments. As Steve mentioned, we believe the technology investments we are making will produce long-term benefits and improve our omnichannel capabilities across all of our concepts. Depreciation for fiscal 2014 is expected to be approximately $240 million.
Our model for interest expense for the fourth quarter is approximately $20.3 million, including the interest related to our $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes and the interest resulting from our sale leaseback obligations related to certain distribution facilities.
The fourth quarter tax provision is estimated to be in the mid- to high-30s percentage range with expected variability as distinct tax events occur.
We expect to continue generating positive operating cash flow.
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2014 are now planned to be $330 million, with slightly more than half for technology enhancements. As a reminder, these expenditures remain subject to the timing and composition of projects.
Our model reflects continued repurchases of shares under our $2 billion share repurchase program, with an assumed completion during fiscal 2016, which may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions. The $1.1 billion accelerated share repurchase program, which commenced in July 2014, was completed in December 2014, as planned.
In connection with the share repurchase activity, which includes assumptions about future market conditions, including share price and trading volume, we are continuing to model diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 178 million for the fourth quarter and 189 million for the full year.
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are continuing to model net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $1.78 to $1.83 for the fourth quarter, now bringing the full year modeled net earnings per diluted share to a range of $5.05 to $5.09.
I would like to remind you that the timing and amount of our accelerated share repurchase impacts the quarterly and full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding differently. As you can see from our model of diluted weighted average shares outstanding and as we explained last quarter, the impact on our individual quarters will be greater than the impact on the full year. As a result, the sum of the net earnings per diluted share for the 4 quarters of the year, representing the 3 fiscal quarters already reported and the estimated earnings per diluted share for the fiscal fourth quarter, are greater than the estimated full year net earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.06 to $0.07.
Turning to fiscal 2015. While we are in the process of completing our annual budget, our preliminary modeling assumptions include the following: We expect to make continued investments in technology and in our omnichannel capabilities. We also anticipate higher technology expenses and related depreciation in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales in conjunction with these technology investments. 
We anticipate opening approximately 30 stores across all concepts. We expect to continue our program of renovating or repositioning stores within markets where appropriate.
As we previously discussed, while any free shipping threshold is subject to change, our current $49 free shipping threshold at bedbathandbeyond.com is due to anniversary next month.
We anticipate interest expense of approximately $82 million, including the interest related to the $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes and the interest from our sale leaseback obligations related to certain distribution facilities. 
We expect continuing variability in our quarterly tax rates.
Our model reflects continued repurchases of shares under our $2 billion share repurchase program, with an assumed completion during fiscal 2016, which may be influenced by several factors including business and market conditions.
We will provide further information related to the fiscal first quarter and full year of 2015 on our next quarterly conference call on April 8, 2015.
I would now like to turn the call back to Steve."

Fourth quarter net earnings per diluted share were $1.80, an increase of approximately 12.5% over the prior year period. Net sales for the quarter were $3.3 billion, an increase of approximately 4.2%. Quarterly comparable sales increased by approximately 3.7% or 3.9% on a constant currency basis.

Across our concepts, we believe that we produce meaningful enhancements to our omni-channel retail shopping experience this year by increasing and improving our use of emerging technologies to better understand and engage with our customers as they express their life interests and travel through various life stages, as well as by significantly expanding and differentiating our merchandise assortments, both in-store and online. Our customer-centric mission is what drives us to improve, innovate and ultimately, prosper in this ever-evolving retail industry.
Let me now turn the call over to Steven."
321778,276237707,788349,"Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2015",2015-04-08,"Earnings Calls","20230930-DK-Butterfly-1, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Janet, and good afternoon to everyone.

I'd like to start by reviewing our sales and earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter, then I'd like to take a few minutes to review our operations and the key strategies driving our mission to continue to do more for and with our customers. 
As Janet mentioned for fiscal 2014, we were able to deliver solid financial results, including growth in both net sales and net earnings per diluted share. We continue to enhance shareholder value by returning more than $2.2 billion to our shareholders through share repurchase but also making strategic investments to improve our omni-channel capabilities. We ended fiscal 2014 with our operations and finances in good shape, and we believe we are extremely well positioned for long-term success in an ever-evolving retail environment.
As Janet also mentioned, and as Sue will discuss in more detail, net earnings per diluted share in the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter were $1.80, a 12.5% increase over the fourth quarter of last year. Our net sales grew approximately 4.2% in the fiscal fourth quarter and comparable sales, which includes sales transactions, consummated through all of our retail channels, including in-store, online and through our mobile device, increased approximately 3.7% in the fourth quarter. This includes an unfavorable impact of about 20 basis points on comp sales due to the atypical fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate related to our Canadian operations. We would like to note that when we spoke to you back on January 8, we were pleased with our holiday sales performance and our actual results for the fourth quarter remained well within the range of our model for sales and comparable sales until the latter part of February when the adverse weather conditions worsened in many parts of the United States. Similar to other retailers, we were also impacted by the prolonged West Coast port slowdown. However, the negative effect on our fiscal fourth quarter sales was minimized as we were able to divert shipments to other ports, albeit at some additional costs. Regardless of the unpredictability of the weather and the West Coast port slowdown, the quarter was a good one.
Before we turn to an update on some of our strategic initiatives, I'd like to take a few minutes to talk about our operations. Our ability to interact with and satisfy our customers wherever, whenever and however they express their life interests and travel through their various life stages is our strategic imperative. We remain focused on enhancing our customer shopping experience and further integrating that experience across all of our retail channels. Our philosophy has always been to provide great service and a great selection of products at the right value. In keeping with this, we believe all of our merchandising service offerings across and integrated among our concepts brought in our customer base and enable us to meet our customers' needs and wants based upon their life interests and life stages as well as allow us to engage with our customers wherever, whenever and however they prefer in store, online and through a mobile device or in any combination of these methods.
Supporting this is our shared services model, which has been the bedrock of Bed Bath & Beyond's organizational structure since we made our first acquisition in 2002. The knowledge and best practices afforded us by our shared services model ultimately allows us to most efficiently drive a better and more robust customer experience. By leveraging our corporate infrastructure for managed functional areas where appropriate, we are able to significantly optimize efficiencies and profitability across our company. The capital investments we make in one area of our business can then be leveraged across all our concepts. For example, we leveraged our broad merchandise assortments by creating specialty departments within our concepts. In categories such as health and beauty care, baby, specialty food and beverage. We also gained economies of scale as we optimize our store operations and market coverage, resulting in favorable advertising real estate opportunities. 
In understanding and satisfying our customers' needs and wants, the whole is greater than the sum of our parts, which gives us a powerful retail model that will enable us to further refine the value proposition we provide to our customers. This is a model that we continue to improve upon through our investments and discipline such as analytics, targeted marketing and information technology.
As we all know advancements in information technology are rapidly changing the retail landscape by connecting all of the traditional retail sales channels to a vast and growing number of digitally empowered shoppers. We know that many of our customers start their shopping experience with us online or through a mobile device to research an item, read customer reviews or compare pricing. The experience does not stop there as many of these customers visit our stores and interact with one or more of our 60,000 associates to find what they need or to ask questions. The same customer can then choose to purchase the item in-store or execute a sale via their mobile device and in most cases choose item in-store pickup or home delivery. If the item they are looking for is not available in store, an associate can then assist a customer in placing the order via the Beyond store, our proprietary in-store web-based channel which has been in use in many of our stores since 2002, long before the evolution of omni-channel retailing and in which we continue to invest and evolve.
In addition to our integrated framework, we have the ability to fulfill orders in many ways, including shipping directly from the vendor from a single or multiple distribution facilities or from 1 or more of our stores depending on the item. We have been leveraging our stores for fulfillment with our decentralized culture since we launched our online capabilities in 1999, and as I said, continue to evolve them. Bed Bath & Beyond has been operating as an omni-channel retailer long before it became the norm. When you are customer-centric, these services are a natural extension of what we do to satisfy the customer.
We also have a long history of accepting returns in-store with our regard to the channel in which to purchase was completed. When an item is purchased online and then returned to a store, the sales return results in a reduction in store sales even though the sale was consummated in different channels. For all these reasons, it is difficult for us to reasonably track the channel in which a sale is initiated. However, we can, as we have any recent quarters, provide directional information on how the sale was completed. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, comparable sales consummated through customer-facing websites and mobile applications grew in excess of 40%, while comparable sales consummated in our stores were up slightly in excess of 1%.
As a reminder, we re-platformed both the buybuy BABY and Bed Bath & Beyond websites during the second quarter of fiscal 2013 and have since made enhancements to these websites as well as our mobile web and mobile apps and continue to do so. Just as examples, we enhanced the search experience, making a more relevant and giving our customers more tools to help find what they are looking for. For mobile users, we have enhanced the image viewing features to allow customers to pinch and zoom on a product detail page and provide ultimate images of a specific product. We are pleased that the customer adoption of our digital channels have steadily grown.
As evidence of this growth, year-over-year, we have seen very good trends in both visits to our websites, including both desktop and mobile and conversion rates; nearly double the number of digital orders placed via mobile devices in fiscal 2014; and significant growth in a number of reserve online pickup in-store transactions. As we continually say, we want to do more for and with our customers wherever, whenever and however they want to interact with us. The recent expansion of our assortments of merchandise both online and available for order in-store, coupled with enhanced delivery and payment options is accomplishing this. Our item expansion has been achieved with a strategic focus on the categories of business that strongly resonate with our customers.
Growing categories such as furniture, lighting and rugs, all part of a natural progression of the merchandise we already sell online or in our stores and extend our ability to satisfy our customers life interest as they travel through their life stages. For example, we have recently launched a full line of branding mattresses on our Bed Bath & Beyond website. We have also improved our assortment of indoor and outdoor furniture. We recently introduced several new collections of outdoor patio furniture and accessories online at bedbathandbeyond.com. We are pleased to be able to offer such a large selection of high-quality outdoor furniture. We have just held our first seasonal catalog, a limited distribution to showcase these new items and promote them directly to our customers. The virtual version of this catalog is available online. Our expanding merchandise offerings has been extremely well received by our customers and is a good indicator for continued acceptance.
Another initiative introduced this spring is a print to digital tool that enhances our Bed Bath & Beyond mobile app, while the mobile app already serves as a tool for wedding registrants to manage their registry anytime and any place, a registrant can now add any item in our wedding registry catalog to their registry simply by holding their phone over the page and tapping a hotspot which appears over each item. Through the use of augmented reality technology embedded in our mobile app, these hotspots or markers enable registrants to see enhanced 360-degree images, browse additional style or colors not shown in the book or add multiple items to the registry with one tap of a finger. We have further enhanced our online registry experience by enabling registrants to schedule an appointment with one of our expert consultants in their local store as well as create printed home announcement cards. As the leader in wedding registry, we are always looking for new ways to assist our customers during this very important life stage. We believe that, while we are never satisfied, we have created the best registry spreads available today by leveraging our in-store expertise along with meaningful technology to drive a relevant experience.
Some additional strategic initiatives we are working on are: Plans to open a new customer service contact center in late fiscal 2015 to support the anticipated growth across all channels and concepts and provide a seamless customer service experience. Located in Utah this new contact center will enable us to add support to our 24/7 East Coast contact center operation as well as limit potential disruptions from weather-related events. The deployment of systems equipment and increased bandwidth in our stores to develop a more dynamic shopping experience as well as to improve the productivity and working environment of our associates. We have begun rolling out tools to empower our associates to further engage with our customers on the selling floor. These tools will enable them to more quickly and easily access product information where house availability, pricing and ultimately, transact the sale. Other benefits include improving inventory ordering, optimizing workforce management and lowering our shipping costs for home deliveries.
The creation of more flexible fulfillment options to allow us to deliver orders more quickly and cross effectively. We are on track to open an additional Las Vegas distribution facility to support the growth of our online direct-to-consumer channel and our health and beauty care offerings.
Continued investment in analytics, both in people and technology, which has enabled us to develop an ever-expanding 360-degree view of our customers, including their life interests, life stages, attitudes and other insights that will help us improve the effectiveness of our marketing and really transform the way we interact and communicate with our customers. And ongoing efforts to develop a new calmer robust point-of-sale system, including both hardware and software elements and other integrated system enhancements that will over time provide a number of additional benefits such as mobile payment options, payment of foreign currencies, the ability to receive and redeem personalized coupons and receipts being issued in foreign languages.
Now turning to our real estate activities. In the fourth quarter, we opened 1 new Bed Bath & Beyond store, 1 new Cost Plus World Market store and 3 new buybuy BABY stores, including our first in Canada. At the same time, we closed 1 Bed Bath & Beyond store and 1 Cost Plus World Market store. In total, we opened 22 new stores and closed 5 stores company-wide during fiscal 2014.
We continue to actively manage our real estate portfolio in a manner that permits store sizes, layouts, locations and offerings to evolve over time to optimize market profitability. We are particularly excited about a new project underway in Brooklyn, New York. We have leased more than 100,000 square feet at Liberty View Industrial Plaza in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Sunset Park to place 4 of our concepts under 1 roof. This location provides us with an opportunity to create a unique shopping venue to showcase our ever-increasing and evolving merchandise assortment as well as our omni-channel capabilities. We are planning to open in Brooklyn during the latter part of spring 2016.
Internationally, we have continued our expansion in Canada and Mexico. As I mentioned, our first buybuy BABY store opened in Edmonton this past December, and we look forward to the opportunity to grow our baby offerings throughout Canada. Our Mexican joint venture currently operates 5 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in Mexico City. We continue be excited about our growth opportunities in Mexico and with our partners plan to open additional stores in the future, including 2 new stores outside of the Mexico City market during fiscal 2015.
In addition to our retail operations, we are also growing our complementary institutional business with the potential to utilize our existing vendor base to provide products and services to hospitality, travel and other institutional customers.
As a leading omni-channel retailer, this is truly an exciting time for us. We believe we are and must remain flexible and nimble to be able to respond to the ever-changing industry landscape. Through our decentralized culture and our steadfast mission to just take care of our customer, we believe we are extremely well-positioned to continued long-term profitable growth. 
I'll now turn the call over to Sue to review our quarterly financial results and some of our planning assumptions for fiscal 2015. Sue?"

Net sales for the fiscal fourth quarter were approximately $3.3 billion, approximately 4.2% higher than net sales in the prior year period. Of this increase, approximately 86% was attributable to the increase in comp sales and the remainder was primarily from new stores. To reiterate what Steven said earlier, even after considering the impact from Canadian currency fluctuations, disruptive weather and the West Coast port slowdown, it was a good quarter with the comparable sales increase of approximately 3.7%. If not for these factors, we would have been comfortably within our model comp sales range of 4% to 5%. Our 3.7% increase in comp for the quarter was attributable to increases in both the average transaction amount and the number of transactions.
Gross profit for the fiscal fourth quarter was approximately 39.7% of net sales compared to approximately 40.5% of net sales in the corresponding period a year ago. The primary factor contributing to this decrease was an increase in coupon expense due to an increase in redemptions, partially offset by a slight decrease in the average coupon amount. Also contributing to this decrease are increases in net direct-to-customer shipping expense, markdowns and shrink. As a reminder, the 1 year anniversary of bedbathandbeyond.com's $49 free shipping threshold was in February 2015.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter were approximately 23.8% of net sales as compared to 24% of net sales in the prior year period. This decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to a relative decrease in occupancy expenses. Reflecting the movements in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the fourth quarter operating profit margin of 15.9% was approximately 50 basis points lower when compared with the same period last year. Net interest expense of $19.3 million in the fourth quarter relates primarily to interest associated with our $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes issued in July 2014.
Our tax rate for the fiscal fourth quarter was approximately 37.4% compared to approximately 36.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. The fourth quarter provisions included net after-tax benefits of approximately $700,000 this year and $2.8 million last year due to distinct tax events occurring the quarters. Considering all of this activity, net earnings per diluted share were $1.80 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, an increase of 12.5%, which includes approximately $0.01 per diluted share due to the unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations during the quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet. As of February 28, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents and investments securities were approximately $1.1 billion. Retail inventory cost were approximately $2.7 billion or $62.58 per square foot, an increase of approximately 4.9% on a per square foot basis over the end of last year's fourth quarter. Retail inventories, which include inventory in our distribution facilities for direct-to-consumer shipment, continues to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2014 were approximately $331 million. Slightly more than half of these expenditures were for technology enhancements, with the remaining balance being used primarily for new stores, existing store improvements and other projects important to our future.
Consolidated shareholders' equity at the end of the fiscal year was approximately $2.7 billion, which is net of approximately $947 million, representing about 11.8 million shares of fourth quarter share repurchases. Of this total, approximately $782 million, representing approximately 10.3 million shares, were from open-market repurchases and the remaining $165 million and 1.5 million shares represented the net settlement of the completion of our $1.1 billion accelerated share repurchase program in December 2014. The company's current $2 billion share repurchase authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $884 million at the end of the fiscal year and is expected to be completed by early fiscal 2016.
Since our first share repurchase authorization back in December 2004 and through February 28, 2015, the company has returned more than $8.5 billion of cash to shareholders through repurchases, representing over 162 million shares. Bed Bath & Beyond continues to generate significant operating cash flow and maintains a solid balance sheet.
Regarding our store count, we currently operate 1,513 stores, consisting of 1,019 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada; 270 stores under the names World Market, Cost Plus World Market or Cost Plus; 96 buybuy BABY stores; 78 stores under the names Christmas Tree Shops, Christmas Tree Shops andTHAT! or andThat!; and 50 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values. As of February 28, 2015, consolidated store space, net of openings and closings for all of our concepts, was approximately 43 million square feet, an increase of approximately 1% over the prior year.
Now I would like to turn to our fiscal 2015 planning assumptions. To start, I would like to bring to your attention some items which affect the comparability of our completed fiscal 2014 results to our fiscal 2015 model. We had some one-time benefits in '14, which we are not modeling to the same extent or at all in '15, and we are modeling some incremental expenses in '15 that we didn't have in '14.
The benefits in '14 that we are not modeling to the same extent or at all of '15 are first, as we disclosed throughout 2014, we had several favorable distinct tax events totaling approximately $20 million for the full year. In 2015, we are only modeling approximately $7 million in distinct tax events for a year-over-year difference of $13 million in income tax expense.
Second as we disclosed in the third quarter, we had a nonrecurring favorable credit card fee litigation settlement which is not modeled to reoccur in 2015. The effect of these 2 items on our 2015 model represents approximately $0.08 and $0.05 per diluted share, respectively, based on our lowered model share count in 2015. This represents a total unfavorable impact of $0.13.
In addition to these items, we are modeling incremental expenses in 2015 which are not comparable to 2014. First, we are modeling an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of approximately $0.05 per diluted share based on a modeled 2015 Canadian currency exchange rate of approximately CAD 1.25 to each U.S. dollar. Second, we are modeling an increase in our investment in compensation and benefits beyond what we have always historically planned for to continue to ensure that we preserve our ability to attract and returning the best associates. This results in an incremental expense of approximately $0.06 per diluted share. The impact of these 4 noncomparable items on the differentials between our 2014 actuals and our 2015 model is approximately $0.24 per diluted share based upon our estimated 2015 full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding.
That said, I would now like to provide our remaining major planning assumptions for 2015. We are modeling a 2% to 3% increase for comparable sales for both the first quarter and full year 2015 and that net sales will exceed the comp sales percentage increase by approximately 70 basis points in the first quarter and by approximately 90 basis points for the year. This model comp sales range of 2% to 3% includes an unfavorable impact for both the first quarter and full year of about 20 to 30 basis points due to modeled fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates related to our Canadian operations.
Assuming these sales levels, gross profit is modeled to deleverage for both the first quarter and full year. Contributing to the model gross profit deleverage are increases in both coupon expense and net direct-to-customer shipping expense. Please note we are modeling the deleverage in gross profit as a percentage of net sales to be less than that it was in 2014, due in part to the 1-year anniversary of the $49 free shipping threshold on bedbathandbeyond.com, which occurred in February 2015.
SG&A is also modeled to deleverage for both the first quarter and full year. As a result of our ongoing strategic initiative included in this modeled deleverage for both the first quarter and full year are increases in technology-related expenses. Also contributing to the full year deleverage are modeled increases in our investments and compensation and benefits and a nonrecurring benefit relating to the credit card litigation settlement in the prior year.
Depreciation expenses modeled to be in the range of approximately $255 million to $265 million for the full year. Annual interest expense is anticipated to be approximately $82 million, primarily resulting from the interest related to the $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes and the interest from our sale-leaseback obligations related to certain distribution centers.
The first quarter and full year tax rates are estimated to be in the mid- to high 30s percent range, with an expected variability as distinct tax events occur. As I said earlier, this year's model assumes approximately $13 million less than favorable distinct tax benefits when compared to 2014. Based on our model, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow.
In connection with leveraging our merchandise assortments and optimizing our operations, we continue to expand across selected stores the number of specialty departments such as health and beauty care, baby, specialty food and beverage. At Bed Bath & Beyond stores alone, we have nearly 200 locations that have 1 or more of these departments. For 2015, we are modeling approximately 15 Bed Bath & Beyond stores to add at least 1 specialty department. 
Capital expenditures in 2015 are planned to be approximately $375 million to $400 million, which remains subject to the timing and composition of projects. Our technology-related projects represent nearly half of our planned capital expenditures and include the development of new systems and equipment in our stores, enhancements to our omni-channel capabilities, ongoing investment in data analytics, the continued build-out and utilization of our data center and the continued development of a new point-of-sale system. In addition to our technology-related projects, capital expenditures also include the opening of approximately 30 new stores company-wide, our Liberty View Brooklyn project and a new customer service contact center that Steven previously mentioned. We will also continue our program of renovating or repositioning stores within markets where appropriate.
In 2015, we are modeling a significant increase in the number of these new stores and repositioned stores that will be self-developed where Bed Bath & Beyond will be responsible for the construction and other improvement costs. We plan to continue making enhancements to our distribution and E-Commerce Fulfillment Centers to improve capacity and productivity. And we plan on making additional investments and other projects important to our future. 
We continue to plan to repurchase shares under our current $2 billion share repurchase program which we estimate to be completed by early fiscal 2016. However, this repurchase program may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions. We are modeling full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding for 2015 to be approximately 168 million, subject to the timing of our share repurchase program.
Based on these and other planning assumptions, including the items I previously discussed relating to the $0.24 of noncomparable items between 2014 and 2015, we are modeling 2015 net earnings per diluted share to be between relatively flat and a mid-single-digit percentage increase as compared to 2014. For the first quarter, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to be between $0.90 and $0.95 as compared to $0.93 in 2014, which included approximately $0.01 due to certain favorable distinct tax events that are not modeled to reoccur in 2015.
As a reminder, the first quarter typically accounts for the smallest portion of our annual net sales and net earnings, so any fixed cost such as depreciation as a percent of net sales are relatively more pronounced in the first quarter than they would be in any of the other 3 quarters. Please note we plan to report our 2015 first quarter net sales and net earnings results on Wednesday, June 24.
So in summary, our underlying business is strong. We are pleased that our technology investments are driving meaningful growth in sales from our digital channel. The enhancements to our online and mobile channels are benefiting our customers' omni-channel shopping experience. Our expanded merchandise offering are providing us further opportunities to do more for and with our customers than ever before and have been well-received. And we are also pleased with the performance of our institutional business. This is an exciting time in retail and we continue to manage our business for long-term growth and profitability. 
I would now like to turn the call back to Steven."

Here are some highlights. Fourth quarter net earnings per diluted share were $1.80, an increase of approximately 12.5% over the prior year period. Net sales for the quarter were $3.3 billion, an increase of approximately 4.2%. Quarterly comparable sales increased by approximately 3.7% or 3.9% on a constant currency basis.

Our customer-centric mission is what drives us to improve, innovate and ultimately, prosper in this ever-evolving retail industry.
Let me now turn the call over to Steven."
321778,276237707,788373,"Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2015",2015-04-08,"Earnings Calls","20230930-DK-Butterfly-1, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Janet, and good afternoon to everyone.

I'd like to start by reviewing our sales and earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter, then I'd like to take a few minutes to review our operations and the key strategies driving our mission to continue to do more for and with our customers.
As Janet mentioned for fiscal 2014, we were able to deliver solid financial results, including growth in both net sales and net earnings per diluted share. We continued to enhance shareholder value by returning more than $2.2 billion to our shareholders through share repurchase, while also making strategic investments to improve our omni-channel capabilities. We ended fiscal 2014 with our operations and finances in good shape, and we believe we are extremely well positioned for long-term success in an ever-evolving retail environment.
As Janet also mentioned, and as Sue will discuss in more detail, net earnings per diluted share in the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter were $1.80, a 12.5% increase over the fourth quarter of last year. Our net sales grew approximately 4.2% in the fiscal fourth quarter and comparable sales, which includes sales transactions, consummated through all of our retail channels, including in-store, online and through our mobile device, increased approximately 3.7% in the fourth quarter. This includes an unfavorable impact of about 20 basis points on comp sales due to the atypical fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate related to our Canadian operations. 
We will like to note that when we spoke to you back on January 8, we were pleased with our holiday sales performance and our actual results for the fourth quarter remained well within the range of our model for sale and comparable sales until the latter part of February, when the adverse weather conditions worsened in many parts of the United States. Similar to other retailers, we were also impacted by the prolonged West Coast port slowdown. However, the negative effect on our fiscal fourth quarter sales was minimized as we were able to divert shipments to other ports, albeit at some additional costs. Regardless of the unpredictability of the weather and the West Coast port slowdown, the quarter was a good one.
Before we turn to an update on some of our strategic initiatives, I'd like to take a few minutes to talk about our operations. Our ability to interact with and satisfy our customers wherever, whenever and however they express their life interests and travel through their various life stages is our strategic imperative. We remain focused on enhancing our customer's shopping experience and further integrating that experience across all of our retail channels. Our philosophy has always been to provide great service and a great selection of products at the right value. In keeping with this, we believe all of our merchandising service offerings across and integrated among our concepts, brought in our customer base and enable us to meet our customers' needs and wants based upon their life interests and life stages as well as allow us to engage with our customers wherever, whenever and however they prefer, in store, online, through a mobile device or in any combination of these methods.
Supporting this is our shared services model, which has been the bedrock of Bed Bath & Beyond's organizational structure since we made our first acquisition in 2002. The knowledge and best practices afforded us by our shared services model ultimately allows us to most efficiently drive a better and more robust customer experience. By leveraging our corporate infrastructure for many functional areas where appropriate, we are able to significantly optimize efficiencies and profitability across our company. The capital investments we make in one area of our business can then be leveraged across all our concepts. For example, we leveraged our broad merchandise assortments by creating specialty departments within our concepts. In categories such as health and beauty care, baby, specialty food and beverage. We also gained economies of scale as we optimize our store operations and market coverage, resulting in favorable advertising in real estate opportunities. 
In understanding and satisfying our customers' needs and wants, the whole is greater than the sum of our parts, which gives us a powerful retail model that will enable us to further refine the value proposition we provide to our customers. This is a model that we continue to improve upon through our investments and discipline such as analytics, target marketing and information technology.
As we all know advancements in information technology are rapidly changing the retail landscape by connecting all of the traditional retail sales channels to a vast and growing number of digitally empowered shoppers. We know that many of our customers start their shopping experience with us online or through a mobile device to research an item, read customer reviews or compare pricing. The experience does not stop there as many of these customers visit our stores and interact with one or more of our 60,000 associates to find what they need or to ask questions. 
The same customer can then choose to purchase the item in-store or execute a sale via their mobile device, and in most cases, choose item in-store pickup or home delivery. If the item they are looking for is not available in store, an associate can then assist a customer in placing the order via the Beyond store, our proprietary, in-store, web-based channel, which has been in use in many of our stores since 2002, long before the evolution of omni-channel retailing and in which we continue to invest and evolve.
In addition, through our integrated framework, we have the ability to fulfill orders in many ways, including shipping directly from the vendor from a single or multiple distribution facilities or from one or more of our stores, depending on the item. We have been leveraging our stores for fulfillment with our decentralized culture since we launched our online capabilities in 1999, and as I said, continue to evolve them. Bed Bath & Beyond has been operating as an omni-channel retailer long before it became the norm. When you are customer-centric, these services are a natural extension of what we do to satisfy the customer.
We also have a long history of accepting returns in-store, without regard to the channel in which the purchase was completed. When an item is purchased online and then returned to a store, the sales return results in a reduction in store sales even though the sale was consummated in a different channel. For all these reasons, it is difficult for us to reasonably track the channel in which a sale is initiated. However, we can, as we have in recent quarters, provide directional information on how the sale was completed. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, comparable sales consummated through customer-facing websites and mobile applications grew in excess of 40%, while comparable sales consummated in our stores were up slightly in excess of 1%.
As a reminder, we re-platformed both the buybuy BABY and Bed Bath & Beyond websites during the second quarter of fiscal 2013 and have since made enhancements to these websites as well as our mobile web and mobile apps and continue to do so. Just as examples, we enhanced the search experience, making a more relevant and giving our customers more tools to help find what they are looking for. For mobile users, we have enhanced the image viewing features to allow customers to pinch and zoom on a product detail page and provide alternate images of a specific product. We are pleased that the customer adoption of our digital channels have steadily grown.
As evidence of this growth, year-over-year, we have seen very good trends in both visits to our websites, including both desktop and mobile and conversion rates; nearly double the number of digital orders placed via mobile devices in fiscal 2014; and significant growth in a number of reserve online pickup in-store transactions. As we continually say, we want to do more for and with our customers wherever, whenever and however they want to interact with us. The recent expansion of our assortments of merchandise both online and available for order in-store, coupled with enhanced delivery and payment options is accomplishing this. Our item expansion has been achieved with a strategic focus on the categories of business that strongly resonate with our customers.
Growing categories such as furniture, lighting and rugs, are all part of the natural progression of the merchandise we already sell online or in our stores and extend our ability to satisfy our customers life interests as they travel through their life stages. For example, we have recently launched a full line of branding mattresses on our Bed Bath & Beyond website. We have also improved our assortment of indoor and outdoor furniture. We have recently introduced several new collections of outdoor patio furniture and accessories online at bedbathandbeyond.com. We are pleased to be able to offer such a large selection of high-quality outdoor furniture. We have just published our first seasonal catalog, a limited distribution to showcase these new items and promote them directly to our customers. The virtual version of this catalog is available online. Our expanded merchandise offerings have been extremely well received by our customers, and that is a good indicator for continued acceptance.
Another initiative introduced this spring is a print-to-digital tool that enhances our Bed Bath & Beyond mobile app. While the mobile app already serves as a tool for wedding registrants to manage their registry anytime and any place, a registrant can now add any item in our wedding registry catalog to their registry simply by holding their phone over the page and tapping a hotspot, which appears over each item. Through the use of augmented reality technology embedded in our mobile app, these hotspots or markers enable a registrant to see enhanced 360-degree images, browse additional styles or colors not shown in the book or add multiple items to the registry with one tap of a finger. 
We have further enhanced our online registry experience by enabling registrants to schedule an appointment with one of our expert consultants in their local store as well as create printed home announcement cards. As the leader in wedding registry, we are always looking for new ways to assist our customers during this very important life stage. We believe that, while we were never satisfied, we have created the best registry experience available today by leveraging our in-store expertise, along with meaningful technology to drive a relevant experience.
Some additional strategic initiatives we are working on are: plans to open a new customer service contact center in late fiscal 2015 to support the anticipated growth across all channels and concepts and provide a seamless customer service experience. Located in Utah, this new contact center will enable us to add support to our 24/7 East Coast contact center operation as well as limit potential disruptions from weather-related events. The deployment of systems, equipment and increased bandwidth in our stores to develop a more dynamic shopping experience as well as to improve the productivity and working environment of our associates. We have begun rolling out tools to empower our associates to further engage with our customers on the selling floor. These tools will enable them to more quickly and easily access product information, warehouse availability, pricing, and ultimately, transact the sale. Other benefits include improving inventory ordering, optimizing workforce management and lowering our shipping cost for home deliveries.
The creation of more flexible fulfillment options, to allow us to deliver orders more quickly and cost effectively. We are on track to open an additional Las Vegas distribution facility to support the growth of our online direct-to-consumer channel and our health and beauty care offerings.
Continued investment in analytics, both in people and technology, which has enabled us to develop an ever-expanding 360-degree view of our customers, including their life interests, life stages, attitudes and other insights that will help us improve the effectiveness of our marketing and really transform the way we interact and communicate with our customers. And ongoing efforts to develop a new, robust point-of-sale system, including both hardware and software elements and other integrated system enhancements that will over time provide a number of additional benefits such as mobile payment options, payment of foreign currencies, the ability to receive and redeem personalized coupons and receipts being issued in foreign languages.
Now turning to our real estate activities. In the fourth quarter, we opened one new Bed Bath & Beyond store, one new Cost Plus World Market store and 3 new buybuy BABY stores, including our first in Canada. At the same time, we closed one Bed Bath & Beyond store and one Cost Plus World Market store. In total, we opened 22 new stores and closed 5 stores company-wide during fiscal 2014.
We continue to actively manage our real estate portfolio in a manner that permits store sizes, layouts, locations and offerings to evolve over time to optimize market profitability. We are particularly excited about a new project underway in Brooklyn, New York. We have leased more than 100,000 square feet at Liberty View Industrial Plaza in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Sunset Park to place 4 of our concepts under one roof. This location provides us with an opportunity to create a unique shopping venue to showcase our ever-increasing and evolving merchandise assortment as well as our omni-channel capabilities. We are planning to open in Brooklyn during the latter part of spring 2016.
Internationally, we have continued our expansion in Canada and Mexico. As I mentioned, our first buybuy BABY store opened in Edmonton this past December, and we look forward to the opportunity to grow our baby offerings throughout Canada. Our Mexican joint venture currently operates 5 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in Mexico City. We continue be excited about our growth opportunities in Mexico and with our partners, plan to open additional stores in the future, including 2 new stores outside of the Mexico City market during fiscal 2015.
In addition to our retail operations, we are also growing our complementary institutional business with the potential to utilize our existing vendor base to provide products and services to hospitality, travel and other institutional customers.
As a leading omni-channel retailer, this is truly an exciting time for us. We believe we are and must remain flexible and nimble to be able to respond to the ever-changing industry landscape. Through our decentralized culture and our steadfast mission to just take care of our customer, we believe we are extremely well-positioned for continued long-term profitable growth. 
I'll now turn the call over to Sue, to review our quarterly financial results and some of our planning assumptions for fiscal 2015. Sue?"

Net sales for the fiscal fourth quarter were approximately $3.3 billion, approximately 4.2% higher than net sales in the prior year period. Of this increase, approximately 86% was attributable to the increase in comp sales and the remainder was primarily from new stores. To reiterate what Steven said earlier, even after considering the impact from Canadian currency fluctuations, disruptive weather and the West Coast port slowdown, it was a good quarter with a comparable sales increase of approximately 3.7%. If not for these factors, we would have been comfortably within our model comp sales range of 4% to 5%. Our 3.7% increase in comp for the quarter was attributable to increases in both the average transaction amount and the number of transactions.
Gross profit for the fiscal fourth quarter was approximately 39.7% of net sales compared to approximately 40.5% of net sales in the corresponding period a year ago. The primary factor contributing to this decrease was an increase in coupon expense, due to an increase in redemptions, partially offset by a slight decrease in the average coupon amount. Also contributing to this decrease are increases in net direct-to-customer shipping expense, markdowns and shrink. As a reminder, the 1 year anniversary of bedbathandbeyond.com's $49 free shipping threshold was in February 2015.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter were approximately 23.8% of net sales as compared to 24% of net sales in the prior year period. This decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to a relative decrease in occupancy expenses. Reflecting the movements in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the fourth quarter operating profit margin of 15.9% was approximately 50 basis points lower when compared with the same period last year. Net interest expense of $19.3 million in the fourth quarter relates primarily to interest associated with our $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes issued in July 2014.
Our tax rate for the fiscal fourth quarter was approximately 37.4% compared to approximately 36.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. The fourth quarter provisions included net after-tax benefits of approximately $700,000 this year and $2.8 million last year due to distinct tax events occurring the quarters. Considering all of this activity, net earnings per diluted share were $1.80 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, an increase of 12.5%, which includes approximately $0.01 per diluted share due to the unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations during the quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet. As of February 28, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents and investments securities were approximately $1.1 billion. Retail inventories at cost were approximately $2.7 billion or $62.58 per square foot, an increase of approximately 4.9% on a per square foot basis over the end of last year's fourth quarter. Retail inventories, which include inventory in our distribution facilities for direct-to-consumer shipment, continues to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2014 were approximately $331 million. Slightly more than half of these expenditures were for technology enhancements, with the remaining balance being used primarily for new stores, existing store improvements and other projects important to our future.
Consolidated shareholders' equity at the end of the fiscal year was approximately $2.7 billion, which is net of approximately $947 million, representing about 11.8 million shares of fourth quarter share repurchases. Of this total, approximately $782 million, representing approximately 10.3 million shares, were from open-market repurchases and the remaining $165 million and 1.5 million shares represented the net settlement of the completion of our $1.1 billion accelerated share repurchase program in December 2014. The company's current $2 billion share repurchase authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $884 million at the end of the fiscal year and is expected to be completed by early fiscal 2016.
Since our first share repurchase authorization back in December 2004 and through February 28, 2015, the company has returned more than $8.5 billion of cash to shareholders through repurchases, representing over 162 million shares. Bed Bath & Beyond continues to generate significant operating cash flow and maintains a solid balance sheet.
Regarding our store count, we currently operate 1,513 stores, consisting of 1,019 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada; 270 stores under the names World Market, Cost Plus World Market or Cost Plus; 96 buybuy BABY stores; 78 stores under the names Christmas Tree Shops, Christmas Tree Shops andThat! or andThat!; and 50 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values. As of February 28, 2015, consolidated store space, net of openings and closings for all of our concepts, was approximately 43 million square feet, an increase of approximately 1% over the prior year.
Now I would like to turn to our fiscal 2015 planning assumptions. To start, I would like to bring to your attention some items which affect the comparability of our completed fiscal 2014 results to our fiscal 2015 model. We had some one-time benefits in '14, which we are not modeling to the same extent or at all in '15, and we are modeling some incremental expenses in '15 that we didn't have in '14.
The benefits in '14 that we are not modeling to the same extent or at all in '15 are first, as we disclosed throughout 2014, we had several favorable distinct tax events totaling approximately $20 million for the full year. In 2015, we are only modeling approximately $7 million in distinct tax events, for a year-over-year difference of $13 million in income tax expense.
Second, as we disclosed in the third quarter, we had a nonrecurring favorable credit card fee litigation settlement, which is not modeled to reoccur in 2015. The effect of these 2 items on our 2015 model represents approximately $0.08 and $0.05 per diluted share, respectively, based on our lowered modeled share count in 2015. This represents a total unfavorable impact of $0.13.
In addition to these items, we are modeling incremental expenses in 2015, which are not comparable to 2014. First, we are modeling an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of approximately $0.05 per diluted share based on a modeled 2015 Canadian currency exchange rate of approximately CAD 1.25 to each U.S. dollar. Second, we are modeling an increase in our investments in compensation and benefits beyond what we have always historically planned for, to continue to assure that we preserve our ability to attract and retain the best associates. This results in an incremental expense of approximately $0.06 per diluted share. The impact of these 4 noncomparable items on the differentials between our 2014 actuals and our 2015 model is approximately $0.24 per diluted share based upon our estimated 2015 full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding.
That said, I would now like to provide our remaining major planning assumptions for 2015. We are modeling a 2% to 3% increase for comparable sales for both the first quarter and full year 2015 and that net sales will exceed the comp sales percentage increase by approximately 70 basis points in the first quarter and by approximately 90 basis points for the year. This model comp sales range of 2% to 3% includes an unfavorable impact for both the first quarter and full year of about 20 to 30 basis points due to modeled fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates related to our Canadian operations.
Assuming these sales levels, gross profit is modeled to deleverage for both the first quarter and full year. Contributing to the model gross profit deleverage are increases in both coupon expense and net direct-to-customer shipping expense. Please note, we are modeling the deleverage in gross profit as a percentage of net sales to be less than that it was in 2014, due in part to the 1-year anniversary of the $49 free shipping threshold on bedbathandbeyond.com, which occurred in February 2015.
SG&A is also modeled to deleverage for both the first quarter and full year. As a result of our ongoing strategic initiatives included in this modeled deleverage for both the first quarter and full year are increases in technology-related expenses. Also contributing to the full year deleverage are modeled increases in our investments and compensation and benefits and the nonrecurring benefit relating to the credit card litigation settlement in the prior year.
Depreciation expenses modeled to be in the range of approximately $255 million to $265 million for the full year. Annual interest expense is anticipated to be approximately $82 million, primarily resulting from the interest related to the $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes and the interest from our sale-leaseback obligations related to certain distribution centers.
The first quarter and full year tax rates are estimated to be in the mid- to high-30s-percent range, with an expected variability as distinct tax events occur. As I said earlier, this year's model assumes approximately $13 million less than favorable distinct tax benefits when compared to 2014. Based on our model, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow.
In connection with leveraging our merchandise assortments and optimizing our operations, we continue to expand across selected stores the number of specialty departments such as health and beauty care, baby, specialty food and beverage. At Bed Bath & Beyond stores alone, we have nearly 200 locations that have one or more of these departments. For 2015, we are modeling approximately 15 Bed Bath & Beyond stores to add at least one specialty department. 
Capital expenditures in 2015 are planned to be approximately $375 million to $400 million, which remains subject to the timing and composition of projects. Our technology-related projects represent nearly half of our planned capital expenditures and include the development of new systems and equipment in our stores, enhancements to our omni-channel capabilities, ongoing investment at data analytics, the continued build-out and utilization of our data center and the continued development of a new point-of-sale system. In addition to our technology-related projects, capital expenditures also include the opening of approximately 30 new stores company-wide, our Liberty View Brooklyn project and a new customer service contact center that Steven previously mentioned. We will also continue our program of renovating or repositioning stores within markets where appropriate.
In 2015, we are modeling a significant increase in the number of these new stores and repositioned stores that will be self-developed, where Bed Bath & Beyond will be responsible for the construction and other improvement costs. We plan to continue making enhancements to our distribution and e-commerce fulfillment centers to improve capacity and productivity. And we plan on making additional investments and other projects important to our future. 
We continue to plan to repurchase shares under our current $2 billion share repurchase program, which we estimate to be completed by early fiscal 2016. However, this repurchase program may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions. We are modeling full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding for 2015 to be approximately 168 million, subject to the timing of our share repurchase program.
Based on these and other planning assumptions, including the items I previously discussed relating to the $0.24 of noncomparable items between 2014 and 2015, we are modeling 2015 net earnings per diluted share to be between relatively flat and a mid-single-digit percentage increase as compared to 2014. For the first quarter, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to be between $0.90 and $0.95 as compared to $0.93 in 2014, which included approximately $0.01 due to certain favorable distinct tax events that are not modeled to reoccur in 2015.
As a reminder, the first quarter typically accounts for the smallest portion of our annual net sales and net earnings, so any fixed cost, such as depreciation as a percent of net sales, are relatively more pronounced in the first quarter than they would be in any of the other 3 quarters. Please note we plan to report our 2015 first quarter net sales and net earnings results on Wednesday, June 24.
So in summary, our underlying business is strong. We are pleased that our technology investments are driving meaningful growth in sales from our digital channel. The enhancements to our online and mobile channels are benefiting our customers' omni-channel shopping experience. Our expanded merchandise offerings are providing us further opportunities to do more for and with our customers than ever before, and have been well-received. And we are also pleased with the performance of our institutional business. This is an exciting time in retail and we continue to manage our business for long-term growth and profitability. 
I would now like to turn the call back to Steven."

Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements about or references to our internal models and our long-term objectives. All such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we say during the call today.

Our earnings press release dated April 8, 2015, can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.bedbathandbeyond.com. 
Here are some highlights. Fourth quarter net earnings per diluted share were $1.80, an increase of approximately 12.5% over the prior year period. Net sales for the quarter were $3.3 billion, an increase of approximately 4.2%. Quarterly comparable sales increased by approximately 3.7% or 3.9% on a constant currency basis. Fiscal 2014 net earnings per diluted share were $5.07. Full year net sales increased approximately 3.3% to $11.9 billion and comparable sales for the full year increased approximately 2.4%.

As we reflect on this past fiscal year, we delivered solid financial results and also continued to deliver on our objective to do more for and with our customers, wherever, whenever and however they want to interact with us. Across our concepts, we believe that we produced meaningful enhancements to our omni-channel retail shopping experience this year by increasing and improving our use of emerging technologies to better understand and engage with our customers as they express their life interests and travel through various life stages, as well as by significantly expanding and differentiating our merchandise assortments, both in store and online. Our customer-centric mission is what drives us to improve, innovate and ultimately, prosper in this ever-evolving retail industry.
Let me now turn the call over to Steven."
321778,276237707,788379,"Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 08, 2015",2015-04-08,"Earnings Calls","20230930-DK-Butterfly-1, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Janet, and good afternoon to everyone.

I'd like to start by reviewing our sales and earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter, then I'd like to take a few minutes to review our operations and the key strategies driving our mission to continue to do more for and with our customers.
As Janet mentioned, for fiscal 2014, we were able to deliver solid financial results, including growth in both net sales and net earnings per diluted share. We continued to enhance shareholder value by returning more than $2.2 billion to our shareholders through share repurchase, while also making strategic investments to improve our omni-channel capabilities. We ended fiscal 2014 with our operations and finances in good shape, and we believe we are extremely well positioned for long-term success in an ever-evolving retail environment.
As Janet also mentioned, and as Sue will discuss in more detail, net earnings per diluted share in the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter were $1.80, a 12.5% increase over the fourth quarter of last year. Our net sales grew approximately 4.2% in the fiscal fourth quarter and comparable sales, which includes sales transactions consummated through all of our retail channels, including in-store, online and through our mobile device, increased approximately 3.7% in the fourth quarter. This includes an unfavorable impact of about 20 basis points on comp sales due to the atypical fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate related to our Canadian operations. 
We would like to note that when we spoke to you back on January 8, we were pleased with our holiday sales performance and our actual results for the fourth quarter remained well within the range of our model for sales and comparable sales until the latter part of February, when the adverse weather conditions worsened in many parts of the United States. Similar to other retailers, we were also impacted by the prolonged West Coast port slowdown. However, the negative effect on our fiscal fourth quarter sales was minimized as we were able to divert shipments to other ports, albeit at some additional cost. Regardless of the unpredictability of the weather and the West Coast port slowdown, the quarter was a good one.
Before we turn to an update on some of our strategic initiatives, I'd like to take a few minutes to talk about our operations. Our ability to interact with and satisfy our customers wherever, whenever and however they express their life interests and travel through their various life stages is our strategic imperative. We remain focused on enhancing our customer's shopping experience and further integrating that experience across all of our retail channels. Our philosophy has always been to provide great service and a great selection of products at the right value. In keeping with this, we believe all of our merchandise and service offerings, across and integrated among our concepts, brought in our customer base and enable us to meet our customers' needs and wants based upon their life interests and life stages, as well as allow us to engage with our customers wherever, whenever and however they prefer, in store, online, through a mobile device or in any combination of these methods.
Supporting this is our shared services model, which has been the bedrock of Bed Bath & Beyond's organizational structure since we made our first acquisition in 2002. The knowledge and best practices afforded us by our shared services model ultimately allows us to most efficiently drive a better and more robust customer experience. By leveraging our corporate infrastructure through many functional areas, where appropriate, we are able to significantly optimize efficiencies and profitability across our company. The capital investments we make in one area of our business can then be leveraged across all our concepts. For example, we leveraged our broad merchandise assortments by creating specialty departments within our concepts in categories such as health and beauty care, baby, specialty food and beverage. We also gain economies of scale as we optimize our store operations and market coverage, resulting in favorable advertising and real estate opportunities. 
In understanding and satisfying our customers' needs and wants, the whole is greater than the sum of our parts, which gives us a powerful retail model that will enable us to further refine the value proposition we provide to our customers. This is a model that we continue to improve upon through our investments in disciplines such as analytics, target marketing and information technology.
As we all know, advancements in information technology are rapidly changing the retail landscape by connecting all of the traditional retail sales channels to a vast and growing number of digitally empowered shoppers. We know that many of our customers start their shopping experience with us online or through a mobile device to research an item, read customer reviews or compare pricing. The experience does not stop there as many of these customers visit our stores and interact with one or more of our 60,000 associates to find what they need or to ask questions. 
The same customer can then choose to purchase the item in store or execute the sale via their mobile device, and in most cases, choose either in-store pickup or home delivery. If the item they are looking for is not available in store, an associate can then assist a customer in placing the order via the Beyond store, our proprietary, in-store, web-based channel, which has been in use in many of our stores since 2002, long before the evolution of omni-channel retailing and in which we continue to invest and evolve.
In addition, through our integrated framework, we have the ability to fulfill orders in many ways, including shipping directly from the vendor, from a single or multiple distribution facilities or from one or more of our stores, depending on the item. We have been leveraging our stores for fulfillment with our decentralized culture since we launched our online capabilities in 1999, and as I said, continue to evolve them. Bed Bath & Beyond has been operating as an omni-channel retailer long before it became the norm. When you are customer-centric, these services are a natural extension of what you do to satisfy the customer.
We also have a long history of accepting returns in store, without regard to the channel in which the purchase was completed. When an item is purchased online and then returned to a store, the sales return results in a reduction in store sales even though the sale was consummated in a different channel. For all these reasons, it is difficult for us to reasonably track the channel in which a sale was initiated. However, we can, as we have in recent quarters, provide directional information on how the sale was completed. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, comparable sales consummated through customer-facing websites and mobile applications grew in excess of 40%, while comparable sales consummated in our stores were up slightly in excess of 1%.
As a reminder, we re-platformed both the buybuy BABY and Bed Bath & Beyond websites during the second quarter of fiscal 2013, and have since made enhancements to these websites as well as our mobile web and mobile apps and continue to do so. Just as examples, we enhanced the search experience, making it more relevant and giving our customers more tools to help find what they are looking for. For mobile users, we have enhanced the image-viewing features to allow customers to pinch and zoom on a product detail page and provide alternate images of a specific product. We are pleased that the customer adoption of our digital channels has steadily grown.
As evidence of this growth, year-over-year, we have seen very good trends in both visits to our websites, including both desktop and mobile; and conversion rates, nearly double the number of digital orders placed via mobile devices in fiscal 2014; and significant growth in the number of ""reserve online, pickup in-store"" transactions. As we continually say, we want to do more for and with our customers wherever, whenever and however they want to interact with us. The recent expansion of our assortments of merchandise both online and available for order in store, coupled with enhanced delivery and payment options, is accomplishing this. Our item expansion has been achieved with a strategic focus on the categories of business that strongly resonate with our customers.
Growing categories such as furniture, lighting and rugs are all part of the natural progression of the merchandise we already sell online or in our stores and extend our ability to satisfy our customers' life interests as they travel through their life stages. For example, we have recently launched a full line of brand-name mattresses on our Bed Bath & Beyond website. We have also improved our assortment of indoor and outdoor furniture. We have recently introduced several new collections of outdoor patio furniture and accessories online at bedbathandbeyond.com. We are pleased to be able to offer such a large selection of high-quality outdoor furniture. We have just published our first seasonal catalog, a limited distribution to showcase these new items and promote them directly to our customers. The virtual version of this catalog is available online. Our expanded merchandise offerings have been extremely well received by our customers, and that is a good indicator for continued acceptance.
Another initiative introduced this spring is a print-to-digital tool that enhances our Bed Bath & Beyond mobile app. While the mobile app already serves as a tool for wedding registrants to manage their registry anytime and anyplace, a registrant can now add any item in our wedding registry catalog to their registry simply by holding their phone over the page and tapping a hotspot, which appears over each item. Through the use of augmented reality technology embedded in our mobile app, these hotspots or markers enable a registrant to see enhanced 360-degree images, browse additional styles or colors not shown in the book or add multiple items to the registry with one tap of a finger. 
We have further enhanced our online registry experience by enabling registrants to schedule an appointment with one of our expert consultants in their local store as well as create printed home announcement cards. As the leader in wedding registry, we are always looking for new ways to assist our customers during this very important life stage. We believe that, while we were never satisfied, we have created the best registry experience available today by leveraging our in-store expertise, along with meaningful technology, to drive a relevant experience.
Some additional strategic initiatives we are working on are: plans to open a new customer service contact center in late fiscal 2015 to support the anticipated growth across all channels and concepts and provide a seamless customer service experience. Located in Utah, this new contact center will enable us to add support to our 24/7 East Coast contact center operation as well as limit potential disruptions from weather-related events. The deployment of systems, equipment and increased bandwidth in our stores to develop a more dynamic shopping experience as well as to improve the productivity and working environment of our associates. We have begun rolling out tools to empower our associates to further engage with our customers on the selling floor. These tools will enable them to more quickly and easily access product information, warehouse availability, pricing, and ultimately, transact the sale. Other benefits include improving inventory ordering, optimizing workforce management and lowering our shipping cost for home deliveries.
The creation of more flexible fulfillment options to allow us to deliver orders more quickly and cost effectively. We are on track to open an additional Las Vegas distribution facility to support the growth of our online direct-to-consumer channel and our health and beauty care offerings.
Continued investment in analytics, both in people and technology, which has enabled us to develop an ever-expanding 360-degree view of our customers, including their life interests, life stages, attitudes and other insights that will help us improve the effectiveness of our marketing and really transform the way we interact and communicate with our customers. And ongoing efforts to develop a new, robust point-of-sale system, including both hardware and software elements and other integrated system enhancements that will over time provide a number of additional benefits such as mobile payment options, payment in foreign currencies, the ability to receive and redeem personalized coupons and receipts being issued in foreign languages.
Now turning to our real estate activities. In the fourth quarter, we opened one new Bed Bath & Beyond store, one new Cost Plus World Market store and 3 new buybuy BABY stores, including our first in Canada. At the same time, we closed one Bed Bath & Beyond store and one Cost Plus World Market store. In total, we opened 22 new stores and closed 5 stores company-wide during fiscal 2014.
We continue to actively manage our real estate portfolio in a manner that permits store sizes, layouts, locations and offerings to evolve over time to optimize market profitability. We are particularly excited about a new project underway in Brooklyn, New York. We have leased more than 100,000 square feet at Liberty View Industrial Plaza in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Sunset Park to place 4 of our concepts under one roof. This location provides us with an opportunity to create a unique shopping venue to showcase our ever-increasing and evolving merchandise assortment as well as our omni-channel capabilities. We are planning to open in Brooklyn during the latter part of spring 2016.
Internationally, we have continued our expansion in Canada and Mexico. As I mentioned, our first buybuy BABY store opened in Edmonton this past December, and we look forward to the opportunity to grow our baby offerings throughout Canada. Our Mexican joint venture currently operates 5 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in Mexico City. We continue be excited about our growth opportunities in Mexico, and with our partners, plan to open additional stores in the future, including 2 new stores outside of the Mexico City market during fiscal 2015.
In addition to our retail operations, we are also growing our complementary institutional business with the potential to utilize our existing vendor base to provide products and services to hospitality, travel and other institutional customers.
As a leading omni-channel retailer, this is truly an exciting time for us. We believe we are and must remain flexible and nimble to be able to respond to the ever-changing industry landscape. Through our decentralized culture and our steadfast mission to just take care of our customer, we believe we are extremely well-positioned for continued long-term profitable growth. 
I'll now turn the call over to Sue to review our quarterly financial results and some of our planning assumptions for fiscal 2015. Sue?"

Net sales for the fiscal fourth quarter were approximately $3.3 billion, approximately 4.2% higher than net sales in the prior-year period. Of this increase, approximately 86% was attributable to the increase in comp sales and the remainder was primarily from new stores. To reiterate what Steven said earlier, even after considering the impact from Canadian currency fluctuations, disruptive weather and the West Coast port slowdown, it was a good quarter with a comparable sales increase of approximately 3.7%. If not for these factors, we would have been comfortably within our model comp sales range of 4% to 5%. Our 3.7% increase in comp for the quarter was attributable to increases in both the average transaction amount and the number of transactions.
Gross profit for the fiscal fourth quarter was approximately 39.7% of net sales compared to approximately 40.5% of net sales in the corresponding period a year ago. The primary factor contributing to this decrease was an increase in coupon expense due to an increase in redemptions, partially offset by a slight decrease in the average coupon amount. Also contributing to this decrease are increases in net direct-to-customer shipping expense, markdowns and shrink. As a reminder, the 1-year anniversary of bedbathandbeyond.com's $49 free shipping threshold was in February 2015.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter were approximately 23.8% of net sales as compared to 24% of net sales in the prior-year period. This decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to a relative decrease in occupancy expenses. Reflecting the movements in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the fourth quarter operating profit margin of 15.9% was approximately 50 basis points lower when compared with the same period last year. Net interest expense of $19.3 million in the fourth quarter relates primarily to interest associated with our $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes issued in July 2014.
Our tax rate for the fiscal fourth quarter was approximately 37.4% compared to approximately 36.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. The fourth quarter provisions included net after-tax benefits of approximately $700,000 this year and $2.8 million last year due to distinct tax events occurring the quarters. Considering all of this activity, net earnings per diluted share were $1.80 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, an increase of 12.5%, which includes approximately $0.01 per diluted share due to the unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations during the quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet. As of February 28, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents and investment securities were approximately $1.1 billion. Retail inventories at cost were approximately $2.7 billion or $62.58 per square foot, an increase of approximately 4.9% on a per-square-foot basis over the end of last year's fourth quarter. Retail inventories, which include inventory in our distribution facilities for direct-to-consumer shipment, continues to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2014 were approximately $331 million. Slightly more than half of these expenditures were for technology enhancements, with the remaining balance being used primarily for new stores, existing store improvements and other projects important to our future.
Consolidated shareholders' equity at the end of the fiscal year was approximately $2.7 billion, which is net of approximately $947 million representing about 11.8 million shares of fourth quarter share repurchases. Of this total, approximately $782 million, representing approximately 10.3 million shares, were from open-market repurchases and the remaining $165 million and 1.5 million shares represented the net settlement of the completion of our $1.1 billion accelerated share repurchase program in December 2014. The company's current $2 billion share repurchase authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $884 million at the end of the fiscal year and is expected to be completed by early fiscal 2016.
Since our first share repurchase authorization back in December 2004 and through February 28, 2015, the company has returned more than $8.5 billion of cash to shareholders through repurchases, representing over 162 million shares. Bed Bath & Beyond continues to generate significant operating cash flow and maintains a solid balance sheet.
Regarding our store count, we currently operate 1,513 stores, consisting of 1,019 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada; 270 stores under the names World Market, Cost Plus World Market or Cost Plus; 96 buybuy BABY stores; 78 stores under the names Christmas Tree Shops, Christmas Tree Shops andThat! or andThat!; and 50 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values. As of February 28, 2015, consolidated store space, net of openings and closings for all of our concepts, was approximately 43 million square feet, an increase of approximately 1% over the prior year.
Now I would like to turn to our fiscal 2015 planning assumptions. To start, I would like to bring to your attention some items which affect the comparability of our completed fiscal 2014 results to our fiscal 2015 model. We had some onetime benefits in '14, which we are not modeling to the same extent or at all in '15, and we are modeling some incremental expenses in '15 that we didn't have in '14.
The benefits in '14 that we are not modeling to the same extent or at all in '15 are first, as we disclosed throughout 2014, we had several favorable distinct tax events totaling approximately $20 million for the full year. In 2015, we are only modeling approximately $7 million in distinct tax events, for a year-over-year difference of $13 million in income tax expense.
Second, as we disclosed in the third quarter, we had a nonrecurring favorable credit card fee litigation settlement, which is not modeled to reoccur in 2015. The effect of these 2 items on our 2015 model represents approximately $0.08 and $0.05 per diluted share, respectively, based on our lowered modeled share count in 2015. This represents a total unfavorable impact of $0.13.
In addition to these items, we are modeling incremental expenses in 2015 which are not comparable to 2014. First, we are modeling an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of approximately $0.05 per diluted share based on a modeled 2015 Canadian currency exchange rate of approximately CAD 1.25 to each U.S. dollar. Second, we are modeling an increase in our investments in compensation and benefits beyond what we have always historically planned for, to continue to assure that we preserve our ability to attract and retain the best associates. This results in an incremental expense of approximately $0.06 per diluted share. The impact of these 4 noncomparable items on the differentials between our 2014 actuals and our 2015 model is approximately $0.24 per diluted share based upon our estimated 2015 full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding.
That said, I would now like to provide our remaining major planning assumptions for 2015. We are modeling a 2% to 3% increase for comparable sales for both the first quarter and full year 2015, and that net sales will exceed the comp sales percentage increase by approximately 70 basis points in the first quarter and by approximately 90 basis points for the year. This model comp sales range of 2% to 3% includes an unfavorable impact for both the first quarter and full year of about 20 to 30 basis points due to modeled fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate related to our Canadian operations.
Assuming these sales levels, gross profit is modeled to deleverage for both the first quarter and full year. Contributing to the model gross profit deleverage are increases in both coupon expense and net direct-to-customer shipping expense. Please note, we are modeling the deleverage in gross profit as a percentage of net sales to be less than that it was in 2014, due in part to the 1-year anniversary of the $49 free shipping threshold on bedbathandbeyond.com, which occurred in February 2015.
SG&A is also modeled to deleverage for both the first quarter and full year. As a result of our ongoing strategic initiatives, included in this modeled deleverage for both the first quarter and full year are increases in technology-related expenses. Also contributing to the full year deleverage are modeled increases in our investments in compensation and benefits and the nonrecurring benefit relating to the credit card litigation settlement in the prior year.
Depreciation expense is modeled to be in the range of approximately $255 million to $265 million for the full year. Annual interest expense is anticipated to be approximately $82 million, primarily resulting from the interest related to the $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes and the interest from our sale-leaseback obligations related to certain distribution centers.
The first quarter and full year tax rates are estimated to be in the mid- to high-30s-percent range, with an expected variability as distinct tax events occur. As I said earlier, this year's model assumes approximately $13 million less in favorable distinct tax benefits when compared to 2014. Based on our model, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow.
In connection with leveraging our merchandise assortments and optimizing our operations, we continue to expand across selected stores the number of specialty departments such as health and beauty care, baby, specialty food and beverage. At Bed Bath & Beyond stores alone, we have nearly 200 locations that have one or more of these departments. For 2015, we are modeling approximately 15 Bed Bath & Beyond stores to add at least one specialty department. 
Capital expenditures in 2015 are planned to be approximately $375 million to $400 million, which remains subject to the timing and composition of projects. Our technology-related projects represent nearly half of our planned capital expenditures and include the deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, enhancements to our omni-channel capabilities, ongoing investment at data analytics, the continued build-out and utilization of our data center and the continued development of a new point-of-sale system. In addition to our technology-related projects, capital expenditures also include the opening of approximately 30 new stores company-wide, our Liberty View Brooklyn project and a new customer service contact center that Steven previously mentioned. We will also continue our program of renovating or repositioning stores within markets where appropriate.
In 2015, we are modeling a significant increase in the number of these new stores and repositioned stores that will be self-developed, where Bed Bath & Beyond will be responsible for the construction and other improvement costs. We plan to continue making enhancements to our distribution and e-commerce fulfillment centers to improve capacity and productivity. And we plan on making additional investments in other projects important to our future. 
We continue to plan to repurchase shares under our current $2 billion share repurchase program, which we estimate to be completed by early fiscal 2016. However, this repurchase program may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions. We are modeling full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding for 2015 to be approximately 168 million, subject to the timing of our share repurchase program.
Based on these and other planning assumptions, including the items I previously discussed relating to the $0.24 of noncomparable items between 2014 and 2015, we are modeling 2015 net earnings per diluted share to be between relatively flat and a mid-single-digit percentage increase as compared to 2014. For the first quarter, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to be between $0.90 and $0.95 as compared to $0.93 in 2014, which included approximately $0.01 due to certain favorable distinct tax events that are not modeled to reoccur in 2015.
As a reminder, the first quarter typically accounts for the smallest portion of our annual net sales and net earnings, so any fixed costs, such as depreciation as a percent of net sales, are relatively more pronounced in the first quarter than they would be in any of the other 3 quarters. Please note, we plan to report our 2015 first quarter net sales and net earnings results on Wednesday, June 24.
So in summary, our underlying business is strong. We are pleased that our technology investments are driving meaningful growth in sales from our digital channel. The enhancements to our online and mobile channels are benefiting our customers' omni-channel shopping experience. Our expanded merchandise offerings are providing us further opportunities to do more for and with our customers than ever before and have been well-received. And we are also pleased with the performance of our institutional business. This is an exciting time in retail and we continue to manage our business for long-term growth and profitability. 
I would now like to turn the call back to Steven."

I'd like to take a few minutes to review some of the highlights of our quarter and then provide an update on several of our key initiatives. 
Overall, it was a good start to the fiscal year as we continue to strive to do more for and with our customers wherever, whenever and however they express their life interests and travel through their various life stages. At the same time, we continue to make the necessary investments to thrive in an ever-evolving retail environment. 
Financially, our fiscal first quarter performance was on track. As Janet mentioned and consistent with our model, we generated approximately $2.7 billion in net sales and $0.93 in net earnings per diluted share. First quarter comparable sales, which includes sales transactions consummated across all of our retail channels, increased approximately 2.2%. As anticipated, year-over-year Canadian currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted our comparable sales by approximately 30 basis points in the first quarter.
As we've explained previously, it is difficult for us to reasonably track the channel in which a sale was initiated. However, as we have been doing, we can provide directional information on how the sale was completed. 
During the first quarter, comparable sales consummated through customer-facing websites and mobile applications grew in excess of 35%, while comparable sales consummated in stores were relatively flat. Our digital channels have benefited from the investments made to date, and we continue to test and add new functionality to our websites and apps. 
Keep in mind that we've anniversary-ed the 2013 relaunch of the buybuy BABY and Bed Bath & Beyond websites as well as the $49 free shipping threshold on bedbathandbeyond.com, which anniversary-ed earlier this calendar year. As such, for the foreseeable future, we would expect the year-over-year growth comparisons to comparable sales consummated through customer-facing websites and mobile applications while continuing to be strong to moderate somewhat. 
We are pleased that customer adoption of our digital channel continues to trend favorably, including visits to our websites and online orders. Not surprisingly though, orders placed via mobile devices continue to see the strongest rate of growth. 
There's no doubt that digital technology is transforming retail and the way customers shop. For example, customers may now start their shopping experience with us online or through a mobile device to research an item, read customer reviews or compare price. Then he may go on to visit a store and interact with one of our associates before placing an order online or purchasing the item in the store. 
The evolution of omni-channel retailing has created a more seamless and personalized shopping experience for customers. At Bed Bath & Beyond, we have been committed to creating such an experience for quite some time. For example, we have been leveraging our stores for order fulfillment for more than a decade. During the same time, our associates have been assisting customers in placing in-store orders via the Beyond store. The Beyond store is our proprietary in-store web-based channel that extends the aisles of our stores by offering customers in our store a broader selection and assortment of products that can be shipped directly to their home. 
We also have a long history of accepting returns in store without regard to the channel in which the purchase was completed. We believe these services are a natural extension of what we do to satisfy our customers. 
Our omni-channel strategy is centered on the customer. We believe we have aligned our organization and our strategy to allow us to provide our customers a seamless experience, and we continue to work to improve upon this experience, whether they are interacting with us in a store, on a desktop or tablet, on a smartphone or through social media. Supporting the strategy are our key initiatives involve merchandising, marketing, analytics, fulfillment and customer service. I will touch upon a few of these during our call later today.
Our mission to do more for and with our customers starts with our merchandise and services, and our focus remains on increasing and differentiating these offerings. We do this in many different ways such as by introducing new categories; developing innovative product; offering exclusive product; developing private label brands; being the first to introduce a new product to the market; extending the quality, value and assortment of product in existing categories; enhancing our delivery and payment options, as well as providing other services and solutions. 
We currently have approximately 220,000 SKUs available both online and available for order in-store through the Beyond store. We believe our expanded offerings are part of a natural progression of the merchandise we already sell online or in our stores and extend our ability to satisfy our customers' life interests as they travel through their life stages. 
For example, earlier this year, we launched a full line of brand-name mattresses and introduced several new collections of outdoor patio furniture and accessories online at bedbathandbeyond.com. These new merchandise categories continue to be well received. 
More recently, we have expanded our assortment in other important categories, including bedding and home decor. In May, we announced the launch of Lady Antebellum's Heartland Home Collection, featuring designs inspired and derived from the country band's lifestyle, songs and stories. This bedding collection is available exclusively at Bed Bath & Beyond stores nationwide and at bedbathandbeyond.com. 
We also have a large and growing number of exclusive brands that we have licensed or internally developed. This suite of brands allows us to offer unique and differentiated product as well as a better product selection for our customers. Development of portfolio of private label brands has become a core focus for us and is one of the many ways in which we seek to differentiate ourselves from the competition. Brands such as Wamsutta, Real Simple and Kenneth Cole Reaction Home, to name a few, enable us to provide differentiated merchandise across multiple product categories, such as bedding, bath, storage, cleaning and dining. We have also recently introduced Studio 3B by Kyle Schuneman, an exclusive line of bedding aimed at urban apartment dwellers and small space living, designed by a creative and innovative interior designer.
We have also expanded our merchandise and service offerings over the years to become a destination for back-to-school shopping. Going away to college is an important life stage for our young customers and their parents. We have recently published both in print and online our annual Back-to-school Shop For College Guide and Checklist, which contains products, services, checklists and core inspiration for making any dorm room feel more warm and inviting while maximizing the functionality of the small space. 
Our college checklists contain a list of the basic items needed to furnish a dorm room or apartment. Our Shop for College section on the Bed Bath & Beyond website contains specific information about hundreds of different colleges and their residential life to help students plan for what they will need while away at a particular school. 
The website also contains links to social media content, including videos for additional dorm room decorating and storage steps. Through our college registry service, students can easily select the items they want for their dorm room and share their wishlist with friends and family. 
In addition, we continue to offer the popular service, which students can shop at the Bed Bath & Beyond closest to their hometown and then conveniently pick up everything at our store closest to their college campus. Our Shop Now Ship Later service allows students to purchase items in advance and we will ship them when directed. Students can also sign up to receive information about college moving events and other shopping events on or near their campus.
Through services and solutions such as these, coupled with our commitment to presenting exciting and increasingly differentiated product at the right value, our customers can meaningfully engage with us wherever, whenever and however they express their life interests and travel through various life stages.
In addition to our merchandising and service initiatives, our investments in marketing and analytics enable us to leverage available information and technology to further develop a 360-degree view of our customers. As we continue to evolve our target marketing capabilities, we'll be able to interact in a more personalized way with our customers and can launch more focused campaigns to drive purchasing behavior. 
And as digital traffic quickly shifts towards mobile, we want to continue to deliver a seamless mobile customer experience. As such, we continue to optimize our mobile touch points to further the convergence of our physical and digital channels. 
Some recent mobile enhancements include Express Checkout with PayPal, the ability to ship to more than 1 address in a single transaction and several search and navigation improvements that continue to drive positive results. We have also leveraged the augmented reality technology we discussed on our last call available through the Bed Bath & Beyond mobile app for use with a second registry catalog called the
In addition, we are making a number of enhancements to simplify and improve our customers' registry experience across channels. And we are developing and testing options to enable customers to further personalize their experience across our digital platforms. 
To further support our mission to just take care of our customers, we are creating more flexible fulfillment options that will allow us to deliver orders more quickly and cost effectively. During the first quarter, we opened our newest Las Vegas facility, and we're assessing additional sites throughout the country to gain even greater distribution efficiencies. As you know, we already have the capability to ship at most of our stores. 
Our plan to open a new customer service contact center in late fiscal 2015 are also on track. Located in Utah, this new contact center will enable us to add support to our 24/7 East Coast contact center operations as well as limit potential disruptions from weather-related events. 
We also continue to make progress in other strategic initiatives, including the deployment of systems, equipment and increased bandwidth in our stores; continued investments in analytics, marketing and technology; and development of a new point-of-sale system.
Turning to our real estate activities, which as you know, are always subject to some timing variations. We continue to actively manage our real estate portfolio in a manner that to our sizes, layouts, locations and offerings to evolve over time to optimize market profitability. We opened 2 new Bed Bath & Beyond stores during the first quarter, which ended on May 30, and at the same time, we closed 1 Cost Plus World Market Store. 
Since the start of our second quarter, we've opened 1 additional Bed Bath & Beyond store and 2 buybuy BABY stores. Including the 5 stores that we've opened to date, we are still modeling to open 30 new stores company-wide during fiscal 2015. Currently, we believe that fiscal 2015's mix of store openings by concept will be relatively comparable to that of fiscal 2014. 
As the digital world and physical stores converge, the physical stores remain integral to our success. Integrated properly, we have a unique opportunity to engage with our customers in new ways and develop deeper customer relationships. In addition to our merchandising efforts, we want to give our customers more reasons to spend time in our stores. We want to encourage product discovery, create an experiential shopping environment and enhance the services we offer. 
In keeping with this, we are excited about our Brooklyn project. We have leased more than 100,000 square feet at Liberty View Industrial Plaza in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Sunset Park, and development is underway to place 4 of our concepts under one roof. This location provides us with an opportunity to create a unique shopping venue to showcase our ever-increasing and evolving merchandise assortment as well as our omni-channel capabilities. We are planning to open in Brooklyn during the latter part of spring 2016.
Internationally, we have plans to continue our expansion in Canada and Mexico. In Canada, we currently operate 44 stores, including 1 buybuy BABY store and plan to open at least 3 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in Canada during fiscal 2015. Our Mexican joint venture currently operates 5 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in the Mexico City market. We continue to be excited about our growth opportunities in Mexico. And with our partners, planned to open 2 additional stores outside of the Mexico City market during fiscal 2015, the first of which is scheduled to open later this summer. 
In addition to our retail operations, we are also growing our complementary institutional business, which includes Harbour Lennon and TY Group by leveraging our combined expertise, product knowledge and relationships to provide products and services to hospitality, travel and other institutional customers.
This is an exciting time for our company with a thrilling pace of change. However, the one thing that has not changed is our mission to just take care of our customers. We're extremely excited about our future. We are and must remain flexible and nimble to be able to respond to the ever-changing industry landscape, and we're committed to making the necessary investments to continue to position our company for long-term success. 
I'll now turn the call over to Sue to review our quarterly financial results and provide an update on our planning assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2015. Sue?"

I'll start with some first quarter financial highlights. As a reminder, the first quarter typically accounts for the smallest portion of our annual net sales and earnings, so any fixed costs as a percentage of net sales are relatively more pronounced in the first quarter than they would be in any of the other 3 quarters.
Overall, we are pleased with our fiscal first quarter results. Net sales for the first quarter were approximately $2.7 billion, approximately 3.1% higher than net sales in the prior year period. Of this increase, approximately 70% was attributable to the increase in comp sales and the remainder was primarily from new stores. 
Our comparable sales in the first quarter increased by approximately 2.2%, attributable to increases in both the average transaction amount and the number of transactions. As anticipated, year-over-year Canadian currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted our comparable sales by approximately 30 basis points in the first quarter.
Gross profit for the first quarter was approximately 38.1% of net sales compared to approximately 38.8% of net sales in the corresponding period a year ago. The primary factors contributing to this decrease in order of magnitude were: first, an increase in coupon expense due to an increase in redemptions, partially offset by a slight decrease in the average coupon amount; and second, an increase in net direct-to-customer shipping expenses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter were approximately 28.1% of net sales as compared to 27.5% of net sales in the prior year period. This increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to higher technology costs, including-related depreciation and an increase in advertising expenses due in part to the growth in digital advertising. Consistent with our previous model and reflecting the movements in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the first quarter operating profit margin of 10% was approximately 130 basis points lower when compared with the same period last year.
Net interest expense of approximately $19.9 million in the first quarter relates primarily to interest associated with our $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes and interest from our sale-leaseback obligations related to certain distribution centers. Our tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 37.5% compared to approximately 37.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. 
The first quarter provisions included net after-tax benefits of approximately $1.5 million this year and approximately $1.8 million last year due to distinct tax events occurring during the quarters. Considering all of this activity, net earnings per diluted share were $0.93 for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 and in line with our modeled range.
Turning to the balance sheet. As of May 30, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents and investment securities were approximately $793 million. Retail inventories, which include inventory in our distribution facilities for direct-to-customer shipments, were approximately $2.8 billion at cost, an increase of approximately 5.3% compared to the end of the prior year period. This increase includes an initial investment in inventory related to our newest Las Vegas distribution facility, which opened during this quarter. 
Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. Capital expenditures for the first 3 months of fiscal 2015 were approximately $72 million and included expenditures for technology enhancements, new stores, existing store improvements and other projects. 
Consolidated shareholders' equity at the end of the first quarter was approximately $2.6 billion, which is net of approximately $385 million, representing about 5.3 million shares of first quarter share repurchases. The company's current $2 billion share repurchase authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $499 million at the end of the first quarter and is expected to be completed in early fiscal 2016. 
As a reminder, this repurchase program may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions. Since our first share repurchase authorization back in December 2004 and through May 30, 2015, the company has returned more than $8.9 billion of cash to shareholders through repurchases, representing over 167 million shares. And we have done this during a period of significant capital investment in the future of our company while continuing to generate significant operating cash flow and maintaining a solid balance sheet. 
Now I'd like to turn to our planning assumptions for the second quarter and full year, which include the following: We are modeling a 2% to 3% increase for comparable sales for the second quarter and continue to model a 2% to 3% increase for the back half of 2015; net sales will exceed the comp sales percentage increase by approximately 70 basis points in the second quarter and by approximately 110 basis points for the back half of the year. 
This model comp sales range of 2% to 3% includes an unfavorable impact for both the second quarter and back half of the year of about 20 to 30 basis points due to modeled year-over-year fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate related to our Canadian operations. 
Assuming these sales levels, gross profit is modeled to deleverage for both the second quarter and full year. Contributing to the modeled gross profit deleverage are increases in both coupon expense and net direct-to-customer shipping expense. As we said previously, we are modeling the fiscal 2015 deleverage in gross profit as a percentage of net sales to be less than it was in 2014. 
SG&A is also modeled to deleverage for both the second quarter and full year, which includes increases in technology-related expenses and investments in compensation and benefits. Also contributing to the full year deleverage is the nonrecurring benefit relating to the credit card litigation settlement which occurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. 
Depreciation expense continues to be modeled in the range of approximately $255 million to $265 million for the full year. Annual interest expense is now anticipated to be approximately $81 million, primarily resulting from the interest related to the $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes and the interest from our sale-leaseback obligations related to certain distribution centers. 
The second quarter and full year tax rates are estimated to be in the mid- to high-30s percent range with an expected variability as distinct tax events occur. Based on our model, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow. 
Capital expenditures in 2015 are planned to be approximately $375 million to $400 million, which remains subject to the timing and composition of projects. Our technology-related projects represent nearly half of our planned capital expenditures for the year and include the deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, enhancements to our omni-channel capabilities, ongoing investment in data analytics, the continued build-out and utilization of a data center in North Carolina and the continued development of a new point-of-sale system. 
In addition to our technology-related projects, capital expenditures also include the opening of approximately 30 new stores company-wide, including the 5 we have opened to date and our new customer service contact center that Steven previously mentioned. 
We will also continue our program of renovating or repositioning stores within markets where appropriate. As a reminder, we anticipate an increase in the number of new stores and repositioned stores that will be self-developed this year compared to last year. As such, we will incur incremental capital expenditures for the construction and other improvement. As you may know, this is not a new strategy for us but is a decision made on a project-by-project basis to optimize our real estate occupancy expense structure. 
As part of our strategy to renovate or reposition stores, we seek opportunities to leverage our broad merchandise assortments from all of our concepts. We have been creating specialty departments within our stores in categories such as health and beauty care, baby, specialty food and beverage. At Bed Bath & Beyond stores alone, we have nearly 200 locations that have 1 or more of these specialty departments, and we continue to model approximately 15 Bed Bath & Beyond stores to add at least 1 specialty department this fiscal year. 
And we will continue making enhancements to our distribution and e-commerce fulfillment centers to improve capacity and productivity. Regarding our current $2 billion share repurchase program, we plan to continue to repurchase shares and estimate this program to be completed by early fiscal 2016. This repurchase program, however, may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
We are now modeling full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding for 2015 to be approximately 167 million, subject to the timing of our share repurchase program. Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.18 to $1.23 in the second quarter as compared to $1.17 in 2014. 
For the full year, we are continuing to model net earnings per diluted share to be between relatively flat and a mid-single-digit percentage increase as compared to 2014. Our 2015 model incorporates an unfavorable Canadian currency exchange rate impact of approximately $0.05, including about $0.01 in the first quarter based on a modeled 2015 Canadian currency exchange rate of approximately CAD 1.25 to each U.S. dollar. 
In summary, our balance sheet and business fundamentals remain strong, and we believe with the strategic investments we are making today, we are well positioned for the future. As we said before, this is an exciting time for our company, and we continue to manage our business for long-term growth and profitability. 
And finally, we plan to report our 2015 fiscal second quarter net sales and net earnings results on Thursday, September 24. I would now like to turn the call back to Steven."

As we repeatedly say, our ability to interact with and satisfy our customers wherever, whenever and however they express their life interests and travel through their various life stages is our strategic imperative. This has been our mission for the past 44 years, and it continues to be the foundation to everything we do. In today's ever-evolving retail environment, this approach has never been more important. 
In understanding and satisfying our customers' needs and wants, we believe the whole is greater than the sum of our parts, which gives us a powerful retail model that will enable us to further refine our relationships with our customers. 
Our shared services model has been one of the foundational pieces of our organizational structure since we made our acquisition of Harmon back in 2002. The knowledge and best practices afforded us by our shared services model ultimately allows us to most efficiently drive a better and more robust customer experience. By leveraging our corporate infrastructure for many functional areas where appropriate, we are able to do more for and with our customers while optimizing efficiencies and profitability across our company.
We look to continue to leverage the capital investments we make in one area of our business across all our concepts, channels and countries in which we operate. We see this across our company in areas such as technology, analytics, marketing, logistics, real estate, product development and merchandise assortments. 
For example, as Sue mentioned, we leveraged our broad merchandise assortments by creating specialty departments within our concepts in categories such as health and beauty care, baby, specialty food and beverage. We also gain economies of scale as we optimize our store operations and market coverage, resulting in favorable advertising and real estate opportunities. This is a model that we continue to improve upon through our ongoing investments and discipline such as analytics, target marketing, logistics and information technology. 
As I said earlier, this is an exciting time for our company, and we are excited about our future. We are confident that we are making the appropriate investments to position our company for long-term profitable growth and to further enhance shareholder value. 
In closing, I would like to thank our more than 60,000 dedicated associates for their efforts which drive our company's success. It is their passion to succeed and satisfy our customers that enables us to continue to do more for and with our customers wherever, whenever and however they wish to interact with us. Thank you for listening today and for your continued interest in Bed Bath & Beyond. Sue, Janet and Ken Frankel will be here tonight to answer any questions you may have."

Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements about or references to our internal models and our long-term objectives. All such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we say during the call today.
Please refer to our most recent periodic SEC filings for more detail on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements as events or circumstances may change after this call. Our earnings press release dated June 24, 2015, can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.bedbathandbeyond.com.
Here are some highlights from the press release. Please note that our first quarter financial results were within our previously stated model range. First quarter net earnings per diluted share were $0.93. Net sales for the quarter were $2.7 billion, an increase of approximately 3.1% over the same period last year. And quarterly comparable sales increased by approximately 2.2% or 2.5% on a constant currency basis.
The company continues to model fiscal 2015 net earnings per diluted share to be between relatively flat and a mid-single-digit percentage increase. Sue will discuss our quarterly financial results and provide an update on our 2015 model later in the call.
Our first quarter performance reflects the core strength of our business across all channels and concepts. We are pleased that our ongoing investments to enhance our omni-channel shopping experience are producing meaningful benefits for our customers and associates.

I'd like to take a few minutes to review some of the highlights of our quarter and then provide an update on several of our key initiatives.
Overall, it was a good start to the fiscal year as we continue to strive to do more for and with our customers wherever, whenever and however they express their life interests and travel through their various life stages. At the same time, we continue to make the necessary investments to thrive in an ever-evolving retail environment.
Financially, our fiscal first quarter performance was on track. As Janet mentioned and consistent with our model, we generated approximately $2.7 billion in net sales and $0.93 in net earnings per diluted share. First quarter comparable sales, which includes sales transactions consummated across all of our retail channels, increased approximately 2.2%. As anticipated, year-over-year Canadian currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted our comparable sales by approximately 30 basis points in the first quarter.
As we've explained previously, it is difficult for us to reasonably track the channel in which a sale was initiated. However, as we have been doing, we can provide directional information on how the sale was completed.
During the first quarter, comparable sales consummated through customer-facing websites and mobile applications grew in excess of 35%, while comparable sales consummated in stores were relatively flat. Our digital channels have benefited from the investments made to date, and we continue to test and add new functionality to our websites and apps.
Keep in mind that we've anniversary-ed the 2013 relaunch of the buybuy BABY and Bed Bath & Beyond websites as well as the $49 free shipping threshold on bedbathandbeyond.com, which anniversary-ed earlier this calendar year. As such, for the foreseeable future, we would expect the year-over-year growth comparisons to comparable sales consummated through customer-facing websites and mobile applications, while continuing to be strong, to moderate somewhat. 
We are pleased that customer adoption of our digital channel continues to trend favorably, including visits to our websites and online orders. Not surprisingly though, orders placed via mobile devices continue to see the strongest rate of growth.
There's no doubt that digital technology is transforming retail and the way customers shop. For example, customers may now start their shopping experience with us online or through a mobile device to research an item, read customer reviews or compare price. Then they may go on to visit a store and interact with one of our associates before placing an order online or purchasing the item in the store.
The evolution of omni-channel retailing has created a more seamless and personalized shopping experience for customers. At Bed Bath & Beyond, we have been committed to creating such an experience for quite some time. For example, we have been leveraging our stores for order fulfillment for more than a decade. During the same time, our associates have been assisting customers in placing in-store orders via the Beyond store. The Beyond store is our proprietary in-store web-based channel that extends the aisles of our stores by offering customers in our store a broader selection and assortment of product that can be shipped directly to their home.
We also have a long history of accepting returns in-store without regard to the channel in which the purchase was completed. We believe these services are a natural extension of what we do to satisfy our customers.
Our omni-channel strategy is centered on the customer. We believe we have aligned our organization and our strategy to allow us to provide our customers a seamless experience. And we continue to work to improve upon this experience, whether they are interacting with us in a store, on a desktop or tablet, on a smartphone or through social media. Supporting this strategy are our key initiatives involve merchandising, marketing, analytics, fulfillment and customer service. I will touch upon a few of these during our call later today.
Our mission to do more for and with our customers starts with our merchandise and services, and our focus remains on increasing and differentiating these offerings. We do this in many different ways such as by introducing new categories; developing innovative product; offering exclusive product; developing private-label brands; being the first to introduce a new product to the market; extending the quality, value and assortment of product in existing categories; enhancing our delivery and payment options; as well as providing other services and solutions.
We currently have approximately 220,000 SKUs available both online and available for order in-store through the Beyond store. We believe our expanded offerings are part of a natural progression of the merchandise we already sell online or in our stores and extend our ability to satisfy our customers' life interests as they travel through their life stages. 
For example, earlier this year, we launched a full line of brand-name mattresses and introduced several new collections of outdoor patio furniture and accessories online at bedbathandbeyond.com. These new merchandise categories continue to be well received.
More recently, we have expanded our assortment in other important categories, including bedding and home decor. In May, we announced the launch of Lady Antebellum's Heartland home collection, featuring designs inspired and derived from the country band's lifestyle, songs and stories. This bedding collection is available exclusively at Bed Bath & Beyond stores nationwide and at bedbathandbeyond.com.
We also have a large and growing number of exclusive brands that we have licensed or internally developed. This suite of brands allows us to offer unique and differentiated product as well as a better product selection for our customers. Development of portfolio of private-label brands has become a core focus for us and is one of the many ways in which we seek to differentiate ourselves from the competition. Brands such as Wamsutta, Real Simple and Kenneth Cole Reaction Home, to name a few, enable us to provide differentiated merchandise across multiple product categories, such as bedding, bath, storage, cleaning and dining. We have also recently introduced Studio 3B by Kyle Schuneman, an exclusive line of bedding aimed at urban apartment dwellers and small-space living, designed by a creative and innovative interior designer.
We have also expanded our merchandise and service offerings over the years to become a destination for back-to-school shopping. Going away to college is an important life stage for our young customers and their parents. We have recently published both in print and online our annual back-to-school Shop For College guide and checklist, which contains products, services, checklists and decor inspiration for making any dorm room feel more warm and inviting while maximizing the functionality of the small space.
Our college checklists contain a list of the basic items needed to furnish a dorm room or apartment. Our Shop For College section on the Bed Bath & Beyond website contains specific information about hundreds of different colleges and their residential life to help students plan for what they will need while away at a particular school.
The website also contains links to social media content, including videos for additional dorm room decorating and storage tips. Through our college registry service, students can easily select the items they want for their dorm room and share their wish list with friends and family.
In addition, we continue to offer the popular Pack &
Hold service, which students can shop at the Bed Bath & Beyond closest to their hometown and then conveniently pick up everything at our store closest to their college campus. Our ""shop now ship later"" service allows students to purchase items in advance and we will ship them when directed. Students can also sign up to receive information about college moving events and other shopping events on or near their campus.
Through services and solutions such as these, coupled with our commitment to presenting exciting and increasingly differentiated product at the right value, our customers can meaningfully engage with us wherever, whenever and however they express their life interests and travel through various life stages.
In addition to our merchandising and service initiatives, our investments in marketing and analytics enable us to leverage available information and technology to further develop a 360-degree view of our customers. As we continue to evolve our target marketing capabilities, we will be able to interact in a more personalized way with our customers and can launch more focused campaigns to drive purchasing behavior.
And as digital traffic quickly shifts towards mobile, we want to continue to deliver a seamless mobile customer experience. As such, we continue to optimize our mobile touch points to further the convergence of our physical and digital channels.
Some recent mobile enhancements include Express Checkout with PayPal, the ability to ship to more than one address in a single transaction and several search and navigation improvements that continue to drive positive results. We have also leveraged the augmented reality technology we discussed on our last call available through the Bed Bath & Beyond mobile app for use with a second registry catalog called the Vowbook [ph].
In addition, we are making a number of enhancements to simplify and improve our customers' registry experience across channels. And we are developing and testing options to enable customers to further personalize their experience across our digital platforms.
To further support our mission to just take care of our customers, we are creating more flexible fulfillment options that will allow us to deliver orders more quickly and cost effectively. During the first quarter, we opened our newest Las Vegas facility, and we are assessing additional sites throughout the country to gain even greater distribution efficiencies. As you know, we already have the capability to ship from most of our stores.
Our plans to open a new customer service contact center in late fiscal 2015 are also on track. Located in Utah, this new contact center will enable us to add support to our 24/7 East Coast contact center operations as well as limit potential disruptions from weather-related events.
We also continue to make progress in other strategic initiatives, including the deployment of systems, equipment and increased bandwidth in our stores; continued investments in analytics, marketing and technology; and development of a new point-of-sale system.
Turning to our real estate activities, which, as you know, are always subject to some timing variations. We continue to actively manage our real estate portfolio in a manner that permits store sizes, layouts, locations and offerings to evolve over time, to optimize market profitability. We opened 2 new Bed Bath & Beyond stores during the first quarter, which ended on May 30. And at the same time, we closed 1 Cost Plus World Market store.
Since the start of our second quarter, we have opened 1 additional Bed Bath & Beyond store and 2 buybuy BABY stores. Including the 5 stores that we've opened to date, we are still modeling to open 30 new stores company-wide during fiscal 2015. Currently, we believe that fiscal 2015's mix of store openings by concept will be relatively comparable to that of fiscal 2014.
As the digital world and physical stores converge, the physical stores remain integral to our success. Integrated properly, we have a unique opportunity to engage with our customers in new ways and develop deeper customer relationships. In addition to our merchandising efforts, we want to give our customers more reasons to spend time in our stores. We want to encourage product discovery, create an experiential shopping environment and enhance the services we offer.
In keeping with this, we are excited about our Brooklyn project. We have leased more than 100,000 square feet at Liberty View Industrial Plaza in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Sunset Park, and development is underway to place 4 of our concepts under one roof. This location provides us with an opportunity to create a unique shopping venue to showcase our ever-increasing and evolving merchandise assortment as well as our omni-channel capabilities. We are planning to open in Brooklyn during the latter part of spring 2016.
Internationally, we have plans to continue our expansion in Canada and Mexico. In Canada, we currently operate 44 stores, including 1 buybuy BABY store and plan to open at least 3 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in Canada during fiscal 2015. Our Mexican joint venture currently operates 5 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in the Mexico City market. We continue to be excited about our growth opportunities in Mexico and, with our partners, plan to open 2 additional stores outside of the Mexico City market during fiscal 2015, the first of which is scheduled to open later this summer. 
In addition to our retail operations, we are also growing our complementary institutional business, which includes Harbor Linen and T-Y Group, by leveraging our combined expertise, product knowledge and relationships to provide products and services to hospitality, travel and other institutional customers.
This is an exciting time for our company with a thrilling pace of change. However, the one thing that has not changed is our mission to just take care of our customers. We're extremely excited about our future. We are and must remain flexible and nimble to be able to respond to the ever-changing industry landscape, and we're committed to making the necessary investments to continue to position our company for long-term success.
I'll now turn the call over to Sue to review our quarterly financial results and provide an update on our planning assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2015. Sue?"
321778,297937533,830976,"Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 24, 2015",2015-06-24,"Earnings Calls","20230930-DK-Butterfly-1, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steven. I'll start with some first quarter financial highlights. As a reminder, the first quarter typically accounts for the smallest portion of our annual net sales and earnings. So any fixed costs as a percentage of net sales are relatively m",1610,"Thank you, Steven. I'll start with some first quarter financial highlights. As a reminder, the first quarter typically accounts for the smallest portion of our annual net sales and earnings. So any fixed costs as a percentage of net sales are relatively more pronounced in the first quarter than they would be in any of the other 3 quarters.
Overall, we are pleased with our fiscal first quarter results. Net sales for the first quarter were approximately $2.7 billion, approximately 3.1% higher than net sales in the prior year period. Of this increase, approximately 70% was attributable to the increase in comp sales and the remainder was primarily from new stores.
Our comparable sales in the first quarter increased by approximately 2.2%, attributable to increases in both the average transaction amount and the number of transactions. As anticipated, year-over-year Canadian currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted our comparable sales by approximately 30 basis points in the first quarter.
Gross profit for the first quarter was approximately 38.1% of net sales compared to approximately 38.8% of net sales in the corresponding period a year ago. The primary factors contributing to this decrease in order of magnitude were: first, an increase in coupon expense due to an increase in redemptions, partially offset by a slight decrease in the average coupon amount; and second, an increase in net direct-to-customer shipping expenses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter were approximately 28.1% of net sales as compared to 27.5% of net sales in the prior year period. This increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to higher technology costs, including related depreciation and an increase in advertising expenses due in part to the growth in digital advertising. Consistent with our previous model and reflecting the movements in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the first quarter operating profit margin of 10% was approximately 130 basis points lower when compared with the same period last year.
Net interest expense of approximately $19.9 million in the first quarter relates primarily to interest associated with our $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes and the interest from our sale-leaseback obligations related to certain distribution centers. Our tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 37.5% compared to approximately 37.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2014.
The first quarter provisions included net after-tax benefits of approximately $1.5 million this year and approximately $1.8 million last year due to distinct tax events occurring during the quarters. Considering all of this activity, net earnings per diluted share were $0.93 for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 and in line with our modeled range.
Turning to the balance sheet. As of May 30, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents and investment securities were approximately $793 million. Retail inventories, which include inventory in our distribution facilities for direct-to-customer shipments, were approximately $2.8 billion at cost, an increase of approximately 5.3% compared to the end of the prior year period. This increase includes an initial investment in inventory related to our newest Las Vegas distribution facility, which opened during this quarter.
Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. Capital expenditures for the first 3 months of fiscal 2015 were approximately $72 million and included expenditures for technology enhancements, new stores, existing store improvements and other projects.
Consolidated shareholders' equity at the end of the first quarter was approximately $2.6 billion, which is net of approximately $385 million, representing about 5.3 million shares of first quarter share repurchases. The company's current $2 billion share repurchase authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $499 million at the end of the first quarter and is expected to be completed in early fiscal 2016.
As a reminder, this repurchase program may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions. Since our first share repurchase authorization back in December 2004 and through May 30, 2015, the company has returned more than $8.9 billion of cash to shareholders through repurchases, representing over 167 million shares. And we have done this during a period of significant capital investment in the future of our company while continuing to generate significant operating cash flow and maintaining a solid balance sheet.
Now I'd like to turn to our planning assumptions for the second quarter and full year, which include the following: We are modeling a 2% to 3% increase for comparable sales for the second quarter and continue to model a 2% to 3% increase for the back half of 2015. Net sales will exceed the comp sales percentage increase by approximately 70 basis points in the second quarter and by approximately 110 basis points for the back half of the year.
This modeled comp sales range of 2% to 3% includes an unfavorable impact for both the second quarter and back half of the year of about 20 to 30 basis points due to modeled year-over-year fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate related to our Canadian operations.
Assuming these sales levels, gross profit is modeled to deleverage for both the second quarter and full year. Contributing to the modeled gross profit deleverage are increases in both coupon expense and net direct-to-customer shipping expense. As we said previously, we are modeling the fiscal 2015 deleverage in gross profit as a percentage of net sales to be less than it was in 2014. 
SG&A is also modeled to deleverage for both the second quarter and full year, which includes increases in technology-related expenses and investments in compensation and benefits. Also contributing to the full year deleverage is the nonrecurring benefit relating to the credit card litigation settlement, which occurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2014.
Depreciation expense continues to be modeled in the range of approximately $255 million to $265 million for the full year. Annual interest expense is now anticipated to be approximately $81 million, primarily resulting from the interest related to the $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes and the interest from our sale-leaseback obligations related to certain distribution centers.
The second quarter and full year tax rates are estimated to be in the mid- to high-30s percent range with an expected variability as distinct tax events occur. Based on our model, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow.
Capital expenditures in 2015 are planned to be approximately $375 million to $400 million, which remains subject to the timing and composition of projects. Our technology-related projects represent nearly half of our planned capital expenditures for the year and include the deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, enhancements to our omni-channel capabilities, ongoing investment in data analytics, the continued build-out and utilization of a data center in North Carolina and the continued development of a new point-of-sale system.
In addition to our technology-related projects, capital expenditures also include the opening of approximately 30 new stores company-wide, including the 5 we have opened to date and our new customer service contact center that Steven previously mentioned.
We will also continue our program of renovating or repositioning stores within markets where appropriate. As a reminder, we anticipate an increase in the number of new stores and repositioned stores that will be self-developed this year compared to last year. As such, we will incur incremental capital expenditures for the construction and other improvements. As you may know, this is not a new strategy for us but is a decision made on a project-by-project basis to optimize our real estate occupancy expense structure.
As part of our strategy to renovate or reposition stores, we seek opportunities to leverage our broad merchandise assortments from all of our concepts. We have been creating specialty departments within our stores in categories such as health and beauty care, baby, specialty food and beverage. At Bed Bath & Beyond stores alone, we have nearly 200 locations that have one or more of these specialty departments, and we continue to model approximately 15 Bed Bath & Beyond stores to add at least 1 specialty department this fiscal year. 
And we will continue making enhancements to our distribution and e-commerce fulfillment centers to improve capacity and productivity.
Regarding our current $2 billion share repurchase program, we plan to continue to repurchase shares and estimate this program to be completed by early fiscal 2016. This repurchase program, however, may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
We are now modeling full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding for 2015 to be approximately 167 million, subject to the timing of our share repurchase program. Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.18 to $1.23 in the second quarter as compared to $1.17 in 2014.
For the full year, we are continuing to model net earnings per diluted share to be between relatively flat and a mid-single-digit percentage increase as compared to 2014. Our 2015 model incorporates an unfavorable Canadian currency exchange rate impact of approximately $0.05, including about $0.01 in the first quarter based on a modeled 2015 Canadian currency exchange rate of approximately CAD 1.25 to each U.S. dollar.
In summary, our balance sheet and business fundamentals remain strong. And we believe with the strategic investments we are making today, we are well positioned for the future. As we've said before, this is an exciting time for our company, and we continue to manage our business for long-term growth and profitability.
And finally, we plan to report our 2015 fiscal second quarter net sales and net earnings results on Thursday, September 24. I would now like to turn the call back to Steven."

This is a model that we continue to improve upon through our ongoing investments and discipline such as analytics, target marketing, logistics and information technology.
As I said earlier, this is an exciting time for our company, and we are excited about our future. We are confident that we are making the appropriate investments to position our company for long-term profitable growth and to further enhance shareholder value.
In closing, I would like to thank our more than 60,000 dedicated associates for all their efforts which drive our company's success. It is their passion to succeed and satisfy our customers that enables us to continue to do more for and with our customers wherever, whenever and however they wish to interact with us.
Thank you for listening today and for your continued interest in Bed Bath & Beyond. Sue, Janet and Ken Frankel will be here tonight to answer any questions you may have."

Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements about or references to our internal models and our long-term objectives. All such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we say during the call today.
Please refer to our most recent periodic SEC filings for more detail on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements as events or circumstances may change after this call. Our earnings press release dated June 24, 2015, can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.bedbathandbeyond.com.
Here are some highlights from the press release. Please note that our first quarter financial results were within our previously stated model range. First quarter net earnings per diluted share were $0.93. Net sales for the quarter were $2.7 billion, an increase of approximately 3.1% over the same period last year. And quarterly comparable sales increased by approximately 2.2% or 2.5% on a constant currency basis.
The company continues to model fiscal 2015 net earnings per diluted share to be between relatively flat and a mid-single-digit percentage increase. Sue will discuss our quarterly financial results and provide an update on our 2015 model later in the call.
Our first quarter performance reflects the core strength of our business across all channels and concepts. We are pleased that our ongoing investments to enhance our omni-channel shopping experience are producing meaningful benefits for our customers and associates.

I'd like to take a few minutes to review some of the highlights of our quarter and then provide an update on several of our key initiatives.Overall, it was a good start to the fiscal year as we continue to",2233,"Thank you, Janet, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to take a few minutes to review some of the highlights of our quarter and then provide an update on several of our key initiatives.
Overall, it was a good start to the fiscal year as we continue to strive to do more for and with our customers wherever, whenever and however they express their life interests and travel through their various life stages. At the same time, we continue to make the necessary investments to thrive in an ever-evolving retail environment.
Financially, our fiscal first quarter performance was on track. As Janet mentioned and consistent with our model, we generated approximately $2.7 billion in net sales and $0.93 in net earnings per diluted share. First quarter comparable sales, which includes sales transactions consummated across all of our retail channels, increased approximately 2.2%. As anticipated, year-over-year Canadian currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted our comparable sales by approximately 30 basis points in the first quarter.
As we've explained previously, it is difficult for us to reasonably track the channel in which a sale was initiated. However, as we have been doing, we can provide directional information on how the sale was completed.
During the first quarter, comparable sales consummated through customer-facing websites and mobile applications grew in excess of 35%, while comparable sales consummated in stores were relatively flat. Our digital channels have benefited from the investments made to date, and we continue to test and add new functionality to our websites and apps.
Keep in mind that we've anniversary-ed the 2013 relaunch of the buybuy BABY and Bed Bath & Beyond websites as well as the $49 free shipping threshold on bedbathandbeyond.com, which anniversary-ed earlier this calendar year. As such, for the foreseeable future, we would expect the year-over-year growth comparisons to comparable sales consummated through customer-facing websites and mobile applications, while continuing to be strong, to moderate somewhat. 
We are pleased that customer adoption of our digital channel continues to trend favorably, including visits to our websites and online orders. Not surprisingly though, orders placed via mobile devices continue to see the strongest rate of growth.
There's no doubt that digital technology is transforming retail and the way customers shop. For example, customers may now start their shopping experience with us online or through a mobile device to research an item, read customer reviews or compare price. Then they may go on to visit a store and interact with one of our associates before placing an order online or purchasing the item in the store.
The evolution of omni-channel retailing has created a more seamless and personalized shopping experience for customers. At Bed Bath & Beyond, we have been committed to creating such an experience for quite some time. For example, we have been leveraging our stores for order fulfillment for more than a decade. During the same time, our associates have been assisting customers in placing in-store orders via the Beyond store. The Beyond store is our proprietary in-store web-based channel that extends the aisles of our stores by offering customers in our store a broader selection and assortment of product that can be shipped directly to their home.
We also have a long history of accepting returns in-store without regard to the channel in which the purchase was completed. We believe these services are a natural extension of what we do to satisfy our customers.
Our omni-channel strategy is centered on the customer. We believe we have aligned our organization and our strategy to allow us to provide our customers a seamless experience. And we continue to work to improve upon this experience, whether they are interacting with us in a store, on a desktop or tablet, on a smartphone or through social media. Supporting this strategy are our key initiatives involving merchandising, marketing, analytics, fulfillment and customer service. I will touch upon a few of these during our call later today.
Our mission to do more for and with our customers starts with our merchandise and services, and our focus remains on increasing and differentiating these offerings. We do this in many different ways such as by introducing new categories; developing innovative product; offering exclusive product; developing private-label brands; being the first to introduce a new product to the market; extending the quality, value and assortment of product in existing categories; enhancing our delivery and payment options; as well as providing other services and solutions.
We currently have approximately 220,000 SKUs available both online and available for order in-store through the Beyond store. We believe our expanded offerings are part of a natural progression of the merchandise we already sell online or in our stores and extend our ability to satisfy our customers' life interests as they travel through their life stages. 
For example, earlier this year, we launched a full line of brand-name mattresses and introduced several new collections of outdoor patio furniture and accessories online at bedbathandbeyond.com. These new merchandise categories continue to be well received.
More recently, we have expanded our assortment in other important categories, including bedding and home decor. In May, we announced the launch of Lady Antebellum's Heartland home collection, featuring designs inspired and derived from the country band's lifestyle, songs and stories. This bedding collection is available exclusively at Bed Bath & Beyond stores nationwide and at bedbathandbeyond.com.
We also have a large and growing number of exclusive brands that we have licensed or internally developed. This suite of brands allows us to offer unique and differentiated product as well as a better product selection for our customers. Development of portfolio of private-label brands has become a core focus for us and is one of the many ways in which we seek to differentiate ourselves from the competition. Brands such as Wamsutta, Real Simple and Kenneth Cole Reaction Home, to name a few, enable us to provide differentiated merchandise across multiple product categories, such as bedding, bath, storage, cleaning and dining. We have also recently introduced Studio 3B by Kyle Schuneman, an exclusive line of bedding aimed at urban apartment dwellers and small-space living, designed by a creative and innovative interior designer.
We have also expanded our merchandise and service offerings over the years to become a destination for back-to-school shopping. Going away to college is an important life stage for our young customers and their parents. We have recently published both in print and online our annual back-to-school Shop For College guide and checklist, which contains products, services, checklists and decor inspiration for making any dorm room feel more warm and inviting while maximizing the functionality of the small space.
Our college checklists contain a list of the basic items needed to furnish a dorm room or apartment. Our Shop For College section on the Bed Bath & Beyond website contains specific information about hundreds of different colleges and their residential life to help students plan for what they will need while away at a particular school.
The website also contains links to social media content, including videos for additional dorm room decorating and storage tips. Through our college registry service, students can easily select the items they want for their dorm room and share their wish list with friends and family.
In addition, we continue to offer the popular Pack &
Hold service, which students can shop at the Bed Bath & Beyond closest to their hometown and then conveniently pick up everything at our store closest to their college campus. Our ""shop now ship later"" service allows students to purchase items in advance and we will ship them when directed. Students can also sign up to receive information about college moving events and other shopping events on or near their campus.
Through services and solutions such as these, coupled with our commitment to presenting exciting and increasingly differentiated product at the right value, our customers can meaningfully engage with us wherever, whenever and however they express their life interests and travel through various life stages.
In addition to our merchandising and service initiatives, our investments in marketing and analytics enable us to leverage available information and technology to further develop a 360-degree view of our customers. As we continue to evolve our target marketing capabilities, we will be able to interact in a more personalized way with our customers and can launch more focused campaigns to drive purchasing behavior.
And as digital traffic quickly shifts towards mobile, we want to continue to deliver a seamless mobile customer experience. As such, we continue to optimize our mobile touch points to further the convergence of our physical and digital channels.
Some recent mobile enhancements include Express Checkout with PayPal, the ability to ship to more than one address in a single transaction and several search and navigation improvements that continue to drive positive results. We have also leveraged the augmented reality technology we discussed on our last call available through the Bed Bath & Beyond mobile app for use with a second registry catalog called the Wowbook.
In addition, we are making a number of enhancements to simplify and improve our customers' registry experience across channels. And we are developing and testing options to enable customers to further personalize their experience across our digital platforms.
To further support our mission to just take care of our customers, we are creating more flexible fulfillment options that will allow us to deliver orders more quickly and cost effectively. During the first quarter, we opened our newest Las Vegas facility, and we are assessing additional sites throughout the country to gain even greater distribution efficiencies. As you know, we already have the capability to ship from most of our stores.
Our plans to open a new customer service contact center in late fiscal 2015 are also on track. Located in Utah, this new contact center will enable us to add support to our 24/7 East Coast contact center operations as well as limit potential disruptions from weather-related events.
We also continue to make progress in other strategic initiatives, including the deployment of systems, equipment and increased bandwidth in our stores; continued investments in analytics, marketing and technology; and development of a new point-of-sale system.
Turning to our real estate activities, which, as you know, are always subject to some timing variations. We continue to actively manage our real estate portfolio in a manner that permits store sizes, layouts, locations and offerings to evolve over time, to optimize market profitability. We opened 2 new Bed Bath & Beyond stores during the first quarter, which ended on May 30. And at the same time, we closed 1 Cost Plus World Market store.
Since the start of our second quarter, we have opened 1 additional Bed Bath & Beyond store and 2 buybuy BABY stores. Including the 5 stores that we've opened to date, we are still modeling to open 30 new stores company-wide during fiscal 2015. Currently, we believe that fiscal 2015's mix of store openings by concept will be relatively comparable to that of fiscal 2014.
As the digital world and physical stores converge, the physical stores remain integral to our success. Integrated properly, we have a unique opportunity to engage with our customers in new ways and develop deeper customer relationships. In addition to our merchandising efforts, we want to give our customers more reasons to spend time in our stores. We want to encourage product discovery, create an experiential shopping environment and enhance the services we offer.
In keeping with this, we are excited about our Brooklyn project. We have leased more than 100,000 square feet at Liberty View Industrial Plaza in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Sunset Park, and development is underway to place 4 of our concepts under one roof. This location provides us with an opportunity to create a unique shopping venue to showcase our ever-increasing and evolving merchandise assortment as well as our omni-channel capabilities. We are planning to open in Brooklyn during the latter part of spring 2016.
Internationally, we have plans to continue our expansion in Canada and Mexico. In Canada, we currently operate 44 stores, including 1 buybuy BABY store and plan to open at least 3 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in Canada during fiscal 2015. Our Mexican joint venture currently operates 5 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in the Mexico City market. We continue to be excited about our growth opportunities in Mexico and, with our partners, plan to open 2 additional stores outside of the Mexico City market during fiscal 2015, the first of which is scheduled to open later this summer. 
In addition to our retail operations, we are also growing our complementary institutional business, which includes Harbor Linen and T-Y Group, by leveraging our combined expertise, product knowledge and relationships to provide products and services to hospitality, travel and other institutional customers.
This is an exciting time for our company with a thrilling pace of change. However, the one thing that has not changed is our mission to just take care of our customers. We're extremely excited about our future. We are and must remain flexible and nimble to be able to respond to the ever-changing industry landscape, and we're committed to making the necessary investments to continue to position our company for long-term success.
I'll now turn the call over to Sue to review our quarterly financial results and provide an update on our planning assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2015. Sue?"
321778,297937533,830986,"Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 24, 2015",2015-06-24,"Earnings Calls","20230930-DK-Butterfly-1, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steven. I'll start with some first quarter financial highlights. As a reminder, the first quarter typically accounts for the smallest portion of our annual net sales and earnings. So any fixed costs as a percentage of net sales are relatively m",1610,"Thank you, Steven. I'll start with some first quarter financial highlights. As a reminder, the first quarter typically accounts for the smallest portion of our annual net sales and earnings. So any fixed costs as a percentage of net sales are relatively more pronounced in the first quarter than they would be in any of the other 3 quarters.
Overall, we are pleased with our fiscal first quarter results. Net sales for the first quarter were approximately $2.7 billion, approximately 3.1% higher than net sales in the prior year period. Of this increase, approximately 70% was attributable to the increase in comp sales and the remainder was primarily from new stores.
Our comparable sales in the first quarter increased by approximately 2.2%, attributable to increases in both the average transaction amount and the number of transactions. As anticipated, year-over-year Canadian currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted our comparable sales by approximately 30 basis points in the first quarter.
Gross profit for the first quarter was approximately 38.1% of net sales compared to approximately 38.8% of net sales in the corresponding period a year ago. The primary factors contributing to this decrease in order of magnitude were: first, an increase in coupon expense due to an increase in redemptions, partially offset by a slight decrease in the average coupon amount; and second, an increase in net direct-to-customer shipping expenses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter were approximately 28.1% of net sales as compared to 27.5% of net sales in the prior year period. This increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to higher technology costs, including related depreciation and an increase in advertising expenses due in part to the growth in digital advertising. Consistent with our previous model and reflecting the movements in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the first quarter operating profit margin of 10% was approximately 130 basis points lower when compared with the same period last year.
Net interest expense of approximately $19.9 million in the first quarter relates primarily to interest associated with our $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes and the interest from our sale-leaseback obligations related to certain distribution centers. Our tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 37.5% compared to approximately 37.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2014.
The first quarter provisions included net after-tax benefits of approximately $1.5 million this year and approximately $1.8 million last year due to distinct tax events occurring during the quarters. Considering all of this activity, net earnings per diluted share were $0.93 for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 and in line with our modeled range.
Turning to the balance sheet. As of May 30, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents and investment securities were approximately $793 million. Retail inventories, which include inventory in our distribution facilities for direct-to-customer shipments, were approximately $2.8 billion at cost, an increase of approximately 5.3% compared to the end of the prior year period. This increase includes an initial investment in inventory related to our newest Las Vegas distribution facility, which opened during this quarter.
Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. Capital expenditures for the first 3 months of fiscal 2015 were approximately $72 million and included expenditures for technology enhancements, new stores, existing store improvements and other projects.
Consolidated shareholders' equity at the end of the first quarter was approximately $2.6 billion, which is net of approximately $385 million, representing about 5.3 million shares of first quarter share repurchases. The company's current $2 billion share repurchase authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $499 million at the end of the first quarter and is expected to be completed in early fiscal 2016.
As a reminder, this repurchase program may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions. Since our first share repurchase authorization back in December 2004 and through May 30, 2015, the company has returned more than $8.9 billion of cash to shareholders through repurchases, representing over 167 million shares. And we have done this during a period of significant capital investment in the future of our company while continuing to generate significant operating cash flow and maintaining a solid balance sheet.
Now I'd like to turn to our planning assumptions for the second quarter and full year, which include the following: We are modeling a 2% to 3% increase for comparable sales for the second quarter and continue to model a 2% to 3% increase for the back half of 2015. Net sales will exceed the comp sales percentage increase by approximately 70 basis points in the second quarter and by approximately 110 basis points for the back half of the year.
This modeled comp sales range of 2% to 3% includes an unfavorable impact for both the second quarter and back half of the year of about 20 to 30 basis points due to modeled year-over-year fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate related to our Canadian operations.
Assuming these sales levels, gross profit is modeled to deleverage for both the second quarter and full year. Contributing to the modeled gross profit deleverage are increases in both coupon expense and net direct-to-customer shipping expense. As we said previously, we are modeling the fiscal 2015 deleverage in gross profit as a percentage of net sales to be less than it was in 2014. 
SG&A is also modeled to deleverage for both the second quarter and full year, which includes increases in technology-related expenses and investments in compensation and benefits. Also contributing to the full year deleverage is the nonrecurring benefit relating to the credit card litigation settlement, which occurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2014.
Depreciation expense continues to be modeled in the range of approximately $255 million to $265 million for the full year. Annual interest expense is now anticipated to be approximately $81 million, primarily resulting from the interest related to the $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes and the interest from our sale-leaseback obligations related to certain distribution centers.
The second quarter and full year tax rates are estimated to be in the mid- to high-30s percent range with an expected variability as distinct tax events occur. Based on our model, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow.
Capital expenditures in 2015 are planned to be approximately $375 million to $400 million, which remains subject to the timing and composition of projects. Our technology-related projects represent nearly half of our planned capital expenditures for the year and include the deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, enhancements to our omni-channel capabilities, ongoing investment in data analytics, the continued build-out and utilization of a data center in North Carolina and the continued development of a new point-of-sale system.
In addition to our technology-related projects, capital expenditures also include the opening of approximately 30 new stores company-wide, including the 5 we have opened to date and our new customer service contact center that Steven previously mentioned.
We will also continue our program of renovating or repositioning stores within markets where appropriate. As a reminder, we anticipate an increase in the number of new stores and repositioned stores that will be self-developed this year compared to last year. As such, we will incur incremental capital expenditures for the construction and other improvements. As you may know, this is not a new strategy for us but is a decision made on a project-by-project basis to optimize our real estate occupancy expense structure.
As part of our strategy to renovate or reposition stores, we seek opportunities to leverage our broad merchandise assortments from all of our concepts. We have been creating specialty departments within our stores in categories such as health and beauty care, baby, specialty food and beverage. At Bed Bath & Beyond stores alone, we have nearly 200 locations that have one or more of these specialty departments, and we continue to model approximately 15 Bed Bath & Beyond stores to add at least 1 specialty department this fiscal year. 
And we will continue making enhancements to our distribution and e-commerce fulfillment centers to improve capacity and productivity.
Regarding our current $2 billion share repurchase program, we plan to continue to repurchase shares and estimate this program to be completed by early fiscal 2016. This repurchase program, however, may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
We are now modeling full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding for 2015 to be approximately 167 million, subject to the timing of our share repurchase program. Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.18 to $1.23 in the second quarter as compared to $1.17 in 2014.
For the full year, we are continuing to model net earnings per diluted share to be between relatively flat and a mid-single-digit percentage increase as compared to 2014. Our 2015 model incorporates an unfavorable Canadian currency exchange rate impact of approximately $0.05, including about $0.01 in the first quarter based on a modeled 2015 Canadian currency exchange rate of approximately CAD 1.25 to each U.S. dollar.
In summary, our balance sheet and business fundamentals remain strong. And we believe with the strategic investments we are making today, we are well positioned for the future. As we've said before, this is an exciting time for our company, and we continue to manage our business for long-term growth and profitability.
And finally, we plan to report our 2015 fiscal second quarter net sales and net earnings results on Thursday, September 24. I would now like to turn the call back to Steven."

As we repeatedly say, our ability to interact with and satisfy our customers wherever, whenever and however they express their life interests and travel through their various life stages is our strategic imperative. This has been our mission for the past 44 years, and it continues to be the foundation to everything we do. In today's ever-evolving retail environment, this approach has never been more important.
In understanding and satisfying our customers' needs and wants, we believe the whole is greater than the sum of all parts, which gives us a powerful retail model that will enable us to further refine our relationships with our customers.
Our shared services model has been one of the foundational pieces of our organizational structure since we made our acquisition of Harmon back in 2002. The knowledge and best practices afforded us by our shared services model ultimately allows us to most efficiently drive a better and more robust customer experience. By leveraging our corporate infrastructure for many functional areas where appropriate, we're able to do more for and with our customers while optimizing efficiencies and profitability across our company.
We look to continue to leverage the capital investments we make in one area of our business across all our concepts, channels and countries in which we operate. We see this across our company in areas such as technology, analytics, marketing, logistics, real estate, product development and merchandise assortments.
For example, as Sue mentioned, we leverage our broad merchandise assortments by creating specialty departments within our concepts in categories such as health and beauty care, baby, specialty food and beverage. We also gain economies of scale as we optimize our store operations and market coverage, resulting in favorable advertising and real estate opportunities. This is a model that we continue to improve upon through our ongoing investments in disciplines such as analytics, target marketing, logistics and information technology.
As I said earlier, this is an exciting time for our company, and we are excited about our future. We are confident that we are making the appropriate investments to position our company for long-term profitable growth and to further enhance shareholder value.
In closing, I would like to thank our more than 60,000 dedicated associates for all their efforts which drive our company's success.

Here are some highlights from the press release. Second quarter net earnings per diluted share increased to $1.21, in line with our model. Net sales for the quarter increased approximately 1.7% over the same period last year or 2.2% higher on a constant currency basis. And comparable sales increased by approximately 0.7% or 1.1% on a constant currency basis. 
The company continues to model fiscal 2015 net earnings per diluted share to be between relatively flat and a mid-single-digit percentage increase. Today, the Board of Directors authorized a new $2.5 billion share repurchase program to commence after the completion of the existing program, which is estimated to be in early fiscal 2016. 
During our call, Steven will review some highlights from the quarter and then provide an update on the strategic investments and ongoing initiatives that we believe will continue to position our company for long-term profitable growth and further enhance shareholder value. Sue will then discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail as well as review some of our key modeling assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2015. Let me now turn the call over to Steven."
321778,297938072,872680,"Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Sep 24, 2015",2015-09-24,"Earnings Calls","20230930-DK-Butterfly-1, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Janet, and good afternoon, everyone. We reported positive growth in both sales and net earnings per share this quarter while we continued to make strategic investments in our future and return value to our shareholders through share repurchases",2209,"Thank you, Janet, and good afternoon, everyone. We reported positive growth in both sales and net earnings per share this quarter while we continued to make strategic investments in our future and return value to our shareholders through share repurchases. 
As Janet said, our fiscal 2015 second quarter net earnings per diluted share increased to $1.21 on net sales of approximately $3 billion. Net sales increased about 1.7% or 2.2% on a constant currency basis. Despite slightly lower-than-modeled top line sales growth, we are pleased to have generated net earnings per share within the midpoint of our range. Comparable sales increased approximately 0.7% or 1.1% on a constant currency basis.
Comparable sales consummated through customer-facing websites and mobile applications grew in excess of 25%, while comparable sales consummated in stores declined approximately 1%. Directionally, this follows the trend of strong comps in our customer-facing digital channels and relatively flat comps in stores. As we have previously pointed out, these numbers in and of themselves are directional on assessing the productivity of our various channels for reasons such as: when an item purchased online is return to a store results in a reduction in store sales; or when an item is being shopped for in the store and concurrently purchased on a mobile device is treated as a mobile sale; or when an item is reserved online and picked up in a store is recorded as a store sale. 
As our digital and physical channels continue to converge, the physical stores remain central to serving our customers and provide us a tremendous opportunity to be close to them. The ability to consult with our knowledgeable and solutions-oriented sales associates, coupled with our in-store services, encourage customers to visit and spend time in our stores. Options such as reserve online, pickup in store, buy online and return to store and online appointment scheduling highlight various points of interactions we have with our customers across our channels. 
During the second quarter, we opened a total of 6 new stores, including 2 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, 3 buybuy BABY stores and 1 Cost Plus World Market store. We continue to actively manage our real estate portfolio in a manner that permits to our sizes, layouts, locations and offerings to evolve over time to optimize market profitability. 
Since the start of our third quarter, we have opened 2 additional Bed Bath & Beyond stores, 1 buybuy BABY store and 1 Cost Plus World Market store. Including the 12 stores we've opened and 1 store that we closed to date, we continue to model 30 new store openings and approximately 10 store closings company-wide during fiscal 2015. Again, the combination of store openings and closings are part of our ongoing strategy to optimize both our market profitability and market coverage.
Our recent store openings included new Cost Plus World Market store that opened in Manhattan last month on 6th Avenue between 18th and 19th Street, steps away from our Bed Bath & Beyond store in the same building. This 5,000-square-foot store provides a unique venue for customers to gain insight and appreciation for our product development initiatives in urban, small space living as well as to see what's trending in home decor. The store contains a well-edited mix of World Market's home decor offerings and provides an inviting atmosphere to customers to explore, shop and make purchases in both virtual and physical environments. 
Similarly, we continue to be excited about our 2016 project in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, which is being developed to place 4 of our concepts under one roof. This location provides us with an opportunity to create another unique shopping venue to showcase our ever-increasing and evolving merchandise assortment as well as the services and solutions we offer. 
In Mexico, our joint venture currently operates 6 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, including 5 in the Mexico City market. During the second quarter, we opened in , our first store outside of the Mexico City market. And we continue to be excited about our growth opportunities in Mexico, and with our partners, plan to open 1 additional store before the end of this year.
As an organization, we remain vigilant in our mission to do more for and with our customers, wherever, whenever and however they express their life interests and travel through their various life stages. We believe we have the culture and organizational structure in place to leverage our broad knowledge and expertise in the categories for which we are best known. We strive to provide the right products, services and solutions for our customers while at the same time continue to make the necessary investments in our omnichannel capabilities to thrive in an ever-evolving retail environment.
Our customer-centric culture and commitment to customer service have been the bedrock of our company from our beginning. When Warren Isenberg and Len Feinstein founded Bed Bath & Beyond, they established a few simple tenets around our customers and our people. We will do whatever it takes to satisfy the customer, and therefore, the only unbreakable policy is that no customer should leave unhappy. 
We focus our investments on what will improve our customer's experience. We're never satisfied. For us, it's not about being the first or being the biggest. We want to be the best in providing the right products, services and solutions for our customers. And our success is, first and foremost, because of our people. We believe in a meritocracy and we significantly promote from within.
We believe our customer-centric culture with its ""never say no attitude"" is a key differentiator for Bed Bath & Beyond. We strive to exceed our customers' expectations. We invest in our people and in delivering high-quality products, services and solutions. And we also invest in the technology necessary to enable a more seamless interaction between our associates and our customers wherever, whenever and however they wish to interact with us. 
We have earned a reputation for providing high-quality service during important life stage events, such as getting married, having a baby and going to college. We remain a market leader in the gift registry space, and we continue to expand and improve our registry services to provide an even more convenient and noticeably better customer experience. 
Every day, our associates must lead by example and earn the trust and loyalty of our customers. To support their efforts, our associates receive product knowledge training on an ongoing basis to better assist and engage with our customers on the selling floor, on the phone or online to answer questions, make recommendations and provide the services and solutions they are looking for.
To further support the growth in our business, we have developed a new customer service contact center in Utah, which is expected to officially open next month. Our customer service contact centers are an essential component of the high-quality service and support we strive to provide to all of our customers, regardless of whether they are in a store, on the phone, on email or in a live chat. And we're committed to ever improving our customer experiences across all of these channels. 
Our mission to do more for and with our customers is also supported by our merchandising initiatives, which include introducing new categories, developing innovative product, offering exclusive product, developing private-label brands and extending the quality, value and assortment of product in existing categories. 
We currently have hundreds of thousands of SKUs available online and/or in store for the customer to take home or to purchase through the Beyond store, which is our proprietary in-store web-based channel that extends the aisles of our Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY stores. Our associates can access the Beyond store to offer customers a broader selection and deeper assortment of product that can be shipped directly to their home. We have steadily expanded our merchandise offerings online and will continue to do so over time. Our goal is to both increase our assortment while we curate the right assortment of product for our customers. In order to do this, we constantly review, edit and refine our offerings based on our buyers' expertise, customer feedback and purchasing trends.
Our newer merchandise categories such as furniture, mattresses, jewelry, watches and luggage are continuing to bring recognition with all our customers, and we are steadily adding new brands to the assortment. For example, we have started to add collections of baby furniture. These items can be found on both the buybuy BABY and Bed Bath & Beyond websites.
We believe these expanded product offerings are part of a natural progression of the merchandise we already sell online or in our stores and extend our ability to satisfy our customers' interests as they travel through their life stages. 
Complementing our merchandise are the various service and solutions we offer both in-store and online to assist our customers to find what they are looking for and to make purchasing decisions more quickly and efficiently. We leverage our broad knowledge and expertise to provide solutions for our customers relating to various life stage events such as going away to college, having a new baby and getting married. 
Supporting our merchandising and service efforts are our initiative in marketing and analytics. We have made significant investments in these areas and continue to do so. We are investing in the systems, the analytic capabilities and people to capture and leverage our data to develop a more in-depth 360-degree view of our customers. Our goal is to drive better customer engagement through continuously optimized marketing programs across all channels. While we are making progress, we still believe there's a tremendous opportunity for us to improve how we personalize and target our marketing.
On marketing efforts continue to be a blend of both physical and digital programs, with a continuing shift towards digital marketing such as email, paid search, SEO, social media, display and affiliate in order to communicate more efficiently and effectively with our customers. 
Consistent with the ever-increasing role of digital connections in our lives, customers' adoption of our digital channels is also improving, with solid year-over-year growth in both visits and orders in the second quarter. In particular, our mobile channel remains very strong with steady growth in traffic, ticket and conversion rates. And we continue to optimize our mobile touch points to create an even better customer experience. 
The growth in our digital channels is also driving additional means in our distribution network. While we have the capability and do ship from most of our stores, we've also utilized distribution facilities to ship merchandise to both stores and customers. We currently have 10 retail distribution centers, including our newest facility which opened last quarter in Las Vegas. We are planning to open an additional distribution facility in the southwest sometime during fiscal 2016. We will also continue to assess additional sites throughout the country for the potential to gain even greater distribution efficiencies. 
In addition to our retail operations, we continue to grow our complementary institutional business, which includes Harbor Linen and T-Y Group by leveraging our combined expertise, product knowledge and relationships to provide products and services to hospitality, travel and other institutional customers. 
Before turning the call over to Sue, I wanted to mention the recent Of a Kind acquisition. Last month, we welcomed Of a Kind and their customers and emerging designers to the Bed Bath & Beyond family. Of a Kind, founded by 2 college friends, Erica Cerulo and Claire Mazur, is an e-commerce website that introduces promising up-and-coming fashion and home designers by selling their specially commissioned limited-edition items and sharing their stories. 
Erica and Claire are talented and passionate entrepreneurs who have created a business model with a clear point of view and sophisticated level. We are pleased to have the unique abilities as part of our team, the combination of our highly talented organizations, along with the additional support now available to the Of a Kind team, will enable us to do even more for and with our collective customers. 
For now, the focus is on continuing to build the Of a Kind brand, including e-commerce platform, their popular 10 Things weekly newsletter and its accompanying podcast. As I said before, this is an exciting time for our company and we're excited about our future. We are confident that we are making the appropriate investments to position our company for long-term profitable growth and to further enhance shareholder value.
To that end, our Board of Directors has authorized today a nearly $2.5 billion share repurchase program that will commence after the completion of our current $2 billion program. Our board put this action based upon its continued confidence in our company's long-term growth potential, financial outlook and cash flow generation. 
For planning purposes, we anticipate completing the new program in fiscal 2019. It's currently anticipated that this new $2.5 billion share repurchase program will be funded from current cash and future cash flows. That said, our company's Board of Directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis. 
I'll now turn the call over to Sue to review our quarterly financial results and provide an update on some of our planning assumptions for the second half of fiscal 2015. Sue?"
321778,297938072,872680,"Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Sep 24, 2015",2015-09-24,"Earnings Calls","20230930-DK-Butterfly-1, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steven. I'll start with a review of our second quarter results and then provide an update on some of our modeling assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2015. Net sales for the second quarter were approximately $3 billion, about 1.7% higher th",1744,"Thank you, Steven. I'll start with a review of our second quarter results and then provide an update on some of our modeling assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2015. Net sales for the second quarter were approximately $3 billion, about 1.7% higher than net sales in the prior year period or approximately 2.2% higher on a constant currency basis. 
Of this increase, approximately 41% was attributable to the increase in comp sales, and the remainder was primarily from new stores and Linen Holdings. Comparable sales in the second quarter increased by approximately 0.7%, attributable to an increase in the average transaction amount, partially offset by a slight decrease in the number of transactions. Canadian currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted our comparable sales in the second quarter by approximately 40 basis points. We had originally modeled an impact of 20 to 30 basis points.
Gross profit for the second quarter was approximately 38.1% of net sales compared to approximately 38.5% of net sales in the corresponding period a year ago. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to an order of magnitude an increase in coupon expense resulting from an increase in the number of redemptions and a slight increase in the average coupon amount and an increase in inventory acquisition costs. Also contributing was an increase in net direct-to-customer shipping expense.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter were approximately 26.4% of net sales as compared to 26% of net sales in the prior year period. This increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in technology expenses and related depreciation. Reflecting this movement in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the second quarter operating profit margin of 11.7% was approximately 80 basis points lower when compared with the same period last year.
Net interest expense for the second quarter of approximately $25 million related primarily to interest associated with our $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes and from our sale-leaseback obligations related to certain distribution facilities. Also included in net interest expense this quarter was approximately $2 million of a realized loss related to the tender of certain auction rate securities as well as approximately $3 million of expense related to the reduction in the value of the nonqualified deferred compensation plan investment. This reduction was offset by a corresponding benefit in SG&A and therefore did not impact net earnings.
Our tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 38% compared to approximately 37.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. The second quarter provisions included net after-tax costs of approximately $800,000 this year as compared to net after-tax benefits of approximately $800,000 last year due to distinct tax events occurring during these quarters. Considering all of this activity, net earnings per diluted share increased to $1.21 for the second quarter of fiscal 2015, in line with our modeled range. This includes an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.01 from Canadian currency fluctuations.
Turning to the balance sheet. As of August 29, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents and investment securities were approximately $767 million. Retail inventories, which include inventory in our distribution facilities for direct-to-customer shipments, were approximately $2.8 billion at cost. Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. 
Capital expenditures for the 6 months of fiscal 2015 were approximately $161 million and included expenditures for technology enhancements, new stores, existing store improvements and other projects. Consolidated shareholders' equity at the end of the second quarter was approximately $2.6 billion, which is net of approximately $194 million, representing about 2.9 million shares repurchased during the period. 
The company's current $2 billion share repurchase authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $305 million at the end of the second quarter and is expected to be completed in early fiscal 2016. As a reminder, our quarterly share repurchase activity may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions. And as Steve mentioned earlier, our nearly authorized $2.5 billion share repurchase program will commence after the completion of the existing program.
Since our first share repurchase authorization back in December 2004 and through August 29, 2015, the company has returned more than $9.1 billion of cash to shareholders through repurchases, representing over 170 million shares. We are pleased to have been able to return such value to our shareholders while at the same time making significant investments in our people and technology to position our company for continued successful growth in the ever-evolving retail environment. 
Now I'd like to provide an update on some of our modeling assumptions for the remaining 2 quarters and the full year. These include the following: for both the third and fourth quarters, we are now modeling comparable sales to increase in the range of 1% to 3%, including an impact of about 40 to 50 basis points in the third quarter and 20 to 30 basis points in the fourth quarter due to modeled year-over-year fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate related to our Canadian operations. 
We are modeling comparable sales consummated through our customer-facing websites and mobile apps to grow approximately 25% and store comp to be relatively flat to the rest of fiscal 2015. As Steve mentioned earlier, this directionally follows the trend of strong comps in our customer-facing digital channels and relatively flat comp in stores. 
Consolidated net sales are modeled to increase by approximately 1.8% to 4% for both the third and fourth quarters. Assuming these sales levels, we continue to model deleverage gross profit for the remainder of fiscal 2015. Contributing to this deleverage are increases in coupon expense and net direct-to-customer shipping expense. As a percentage of net sales, we continue to model the full year deleverage to be less than it was in fiscal 2014.
We are also modeling SG&A deleverage for the remainder of the year, which includes increases in technology-related expenses and investments in compensation and benefits. As a reminder, SG&A in the third quarter of last year included a nonrecurring benefit relating to a credit card litigation settlement, which is equivalent to about $0.05 per diluted share based on our modeled share count for this year's third quarter.
Depreciation expense for fiscal 2015 continues to be modeled in the range of approximately $255 million to $265 million. Annual interest expense is now anticipated to be approximately $85 million, primarily resulting from the interest related to the $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes and from our sale-leaseback obligations related to certain distribution facilities.
The third and fourth quarter tax provisions are estimated to be in the mid- to high 30s percent range. Net after-tax benefits due to distinct tax events are modeled to be approximately $3.7 million for the third quarter as compared to $16.7 million last year, an unfavorable difference of approximately $0.08 per diluted share based on our modeled share count for this year's third quarter. 
We expect to continue generating positive operating cash flow. Consistent with our model, capital expenditures in 2015 are modeled to be approximately $375 million to $400 million, subject to the timing and composition of projects. Our technology-related projects continue to represent a significant portion of our planned capital expenditures for the year and include the deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, enhancements to our omnichannel capabilities, ongoing investment in data analytics, the continued build-out and utilization of a data center in North Carolina and the continued development of a new point-of-sale system. 
In addition to our technology-related projects, capital expenditures also include the opening of approximately 30 new stores company-wide, including the 12 we have opened to date and our new customer service contact center that Steven previously mentioned. We believe that fiscal 2015's mix of store openings by concept will be relatively comparable to that of fiscal 2014.
We will also continue our program of renovating or repositioning stores within markets where appropriate. And we will continue making enhancements to our distribution facilities to improve capacity and productivity. 
Regarding our current $2 billion share repurchase program, we plan to continue to repurchase shares during the second half of this year and estimate this program to be completed by early fiscal 2016. This repurchase program, however, may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
We are modeling diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 165 million for the third quarter and 166 million for the full year. We are now modeling an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of approximately $0.06 per diluted share for fiscal 2015 compared to our previous estimate of about $0.05 based on a revised model 2015 Canadian currency exchange rate of approximately CAD 1.32 to each U.S. dollar. This $0.06 represents approximately $0.01 in each of the first 2 quarters and about $0.02 in each of the remaining 2 quarters of the year.
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we continue to model fiscal 2015 net earnings per diluted share to be between relatively flat and a mid-single-digit percentage increase.
For the third quarter, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $1.14 to $1.21. This range results in year-over-year net earnings per share growth of approximately 5% to 11% after adjusting for some noncomparable items. These noncomparable items total about $0.15 based on this year's modeled share count and include approximately $0.05 due to the nonrecurring favorable credit card fee litigation settlement that occurred in the third quarter of 2014; approximately $0.08 due to the significantly lower net after-tax benefit dollars planned in the third quarter of this year as compared to last year due to distinct tax events; and approximately $0.02 due to the modeled unfavorable foreign currency rate impact in the third quarter of 2015. 
We continue to execute our mission to do more for and with our customers while making strategic investments to position our company for long-term growth and profitability. Our performance year-to-date reflects not only the health of our business and the underlying strength of our balance sheet but also the progress we've made in further enhancing our omnichannel capabilities. As we've said before, this is an exciting time for our company, and we continue to manage our business for long-term performance. Please join us again on Thursday, January 7, 2016, when we plan to report our fiscal 2015 third quarter results. I would now like to turn the call back to Steven."

We reported positive growth in both sales and net earnings per share this quarter, while we continued to make strategic investments in our future and return value to our shareholders through share repurchases. As Janet said, our fiscal 2015 second quarter net earnings per diluted share increased to $1.21 on net sales of approximately $3 billion. Net sales increased about 1.7% or 2.2% on a constant currency basis. Despite slightly lower-than-modeled top line sales growth, we are pleased to have generated net earnings per share within the midpoint of our range. Comparable sales increased approximately 0.7% or 1.1% on a constant currency basis.
Comparable sales consummated through customer-facing websites and mobile applications grew in excess of 25%, while comparable sales consummated in stores declined approximately 1%. Directionally, this follows the trend of strong comps in our customer-facing digital channels and relatively flat comps in stores. As we have previously pointed out, these numbers in and of themselves are directional on assessing the productivity of our various channels for reasons such as: When an item purchased online is returned to a store, it results in a reduction in store sales; or when an item is being shopped for in the store and concurrently purchased on a mobile device, it is treated as a mobile sale; or when an item is reserved online and picked up in a store, it's recorded as a store sale.
As our digital and physical channels continue to converge, the physical stores remain central to serving our customers and provide us a tremendous opportunity to be close to them. The ability to consult with our knowledgeable and solutions-oriented sales associates, coupled with our in-store services, encourage customers to visit and spend time in our stores. Options such as reserve online, pick up in store, buy online and return to store and online appointment scheduling highlight various points of interactions we have with our customers across our channels.
During the second quarter, we opened a total of 6 new stores, including 2 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, 3 buybuy BABY stores and 1 Cost Plus World Market store. We continue to actively manage our real estate portfolio in a manner that permits to our sizes, layouts, locations and offerings to evolve over time to optimize market profitability.
Since the start of our third quarter, we have opened 2 additional Bed Bath & Beyond stores, 1 buybuy BABY store and 1 Cost Plus World Market store. Including the 12 stores we've opened and 1 store that we've closed to date, we continue to model 30 new store openings and approximately 10 store closings company wide during fiscal 2015. Again, the combination of store openings and closings are part of our ongoing strategy to optimize both our market profitability and market coverage.
Our recent store openings included new Cost Plus World Market store that opened in Manhattan last month on Sixth Avenue between 18th and 19th Street, steps away from our Bed Bath & Beyond store in the same building. This 5,000-square-foot store provides a unique venue for customers to gain insight and appreciation for our product development initiatives in urban, small space living as well as to see what's trending in home decor. The store contains a well-edited mix of World Market's home decor offerings and provides an inviting atmosphere for customers to explore, shop and make purchases in both virtual and physical environments.
Similarly, we continue to be excited about our 2016 project in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, which is being developed to place 4 of our concepts under 1 roof. This location provides us with an opportunity to create another unique shopping venue to showcase our ever-increasing and evolving merchandise assortment as well as the services and solutions we offer.
In Mexico, our joint venture currently operates 6 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, including 5 in the Mexico City market. During the second quarter, we opened in Cuernavaca, our first store outside of the Mexico City market. And we continue to be excited about our growth opportunities in Mexico and with our partners, plan to open one additional store before the end of this year.
As an organization, we remain vigilant in our mission to do more for and with our customers wherever, whenever and however they express their life interests and travel through their various life stages. We believe we have the culture and organizational structure in place to leverage our broad knowledge and expertise in the categories for which we are best known. We strive to provide the right products, services and solutions for our customers while at the same time continue to make the necessary investments in our omni-channel capabilities to thrive in an ever-evolving retail environment.
Our customer-centric culture and commitment to customer service have been the bedrock of our company from our beginning. When Warren Eisenberg and Len Feinstein founded Bed Bath & Beyond, they established a few simple tenets around our customers and our people. We will do whatever it takes to satisfy the customer, and therefore, the only unbreakable policy is that no customer should leave unhappy.
We focus our investments on what will improve our customer's experience. We're never satisfied. For us, it's not about being the first or being the biggest. We want to be the best in providing the right products, services and solutions for our customers. And our success is, first and foremost, because of our people. We believe in a meritocracy, and we significantly promote from within.
We believe our customer-centric culture with its never-say-no attitude is a key differentiator for Bed Bath & Beyond. We strive to exceed our customers' expectations. We invest in our people and in delivering high-quality products, services and solutions, and we also invest in the technology necessary to enable a more seamless interaction between our associates and our customers wherever, whenever and however they wish to interact with us.
We have earned a reputation for providing high-quality service during important life stage events such as getting married, having a baby and going to college. We remain a market leader in the gift registry space, and we continue to expand and improve our registry services to provide an even more convenient and noticeably better customer experience. 
Every day, our associates must lead by example and earn the trust and loyalty of our customers. To support their efforts, our associates receive product knowledge training on an ongoing basis to better assist and engage with our customers on the selling floor, on the phone or online to answer questions, make recommendations and provide the services and solutions they are looking for.
To further support the growth in our business, we have developed a new customer service contact center in Layton, Utah, which is expected to officially open next month. Our customer service contact centers are an essential component of the high-quality service and support we strive to provide to all of our customers regardless of whether they are in a store, on the phone, on email or in a live chat, and we are committed to ever improving our customer experiences across all these channels.
Our mission to do more for and with our customers is also supported by our merchandising initiatives, which include introducing new categories, developing innovative product, offering exclusive product, developing private-label brands and extending the quality, value and assortment of product in existing categories. We currently have hundreds of thousands of SKUs available online and/or in-store for the customer to take home or to purchase through the Beyond store, which is our proprietary in-store, web-based channel that extends the aisles of our Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY stores. Our associates can access the Beyond store to offer customers a broader selection and deeper assortment of product that can be shipped directly to their home. We have steadily expanded our merchandise offerings online and will continue to do so over time. Our goal is to both increase our assortment, while we curate the right assortment of product for our customers. In order to do this, we constantly review, edit and refine our offerings based on our buyers' expertise, customer feedback and purchasing trends.
Our newer merchandise categories such as furniture, mattresses, jewelry, watches and luggage are continuing to gain recognition with all our customers, and we are steadily adding new brands to the assortment. For example, we have started to add collections of baby furniture. These items can be found on both the buybuy BABY and Bed Bath & Beyond websites. We believe these expanded product offerings are part of a natural progression of the merchandise we already sell online or in our stores and extend our ability to satisfy our customers' interests as they travel through their life stages.
Complementing our merchandise are the various service and solutions we offer both in-store and online to assist our customers to find what they are looking for and to make purchasing decisions more quickly and efficiently. We leverage our broad knowledge and expertise to provide solutions for our customers relating to various life stage events such as going away to college, having a new baby and getting married.
Supporting our merchandising and service efforts are our initiative in marketing and analytics. We have made significant investments in these areas and continue to do so. We are investing in the systems, the analytic capabilities and people to capture and leverage our data to develop a more in-depth 360-degree view of our customers. Our goal is to drive better customer engagement through continuously optimized marketing programs across all channels. While we are making progress, we still believe there's a tremendous opportunity for us to improve how we personalize and target our marketing. Our marketing efforts continue to be a blend of both physical and digital programs with a continuing shift towards digital marketing such as email, paid search, SEO, social media, display and affiliate in order to communicate more efficiently and effectively with our customers.
Consistent with the ever-increasing role of digital connections in our lives, customers' adoption of our digital channels is also improving with solid year-over-year growth in both visits and orders in the second quarter. In particular, our mobile channel remained very strong with steady growth in traffic, ticket and conversion rates, and we continue to optimize our mobile touch points to create an even better customer experience.
The growth in our digital channels is also driving additional needs in our distribution network. While we have the capability and do ship from most of our stores, we also utilize distribution facilities to ship merchandise to both stores and customers. We currently have 10 retail distribution centers, including our newest facility, which opened last quarter in Las Vegas. We are planning to open an additional distribution facility in the southwest sometime during fiscal 2016. We will also continue to assess additional sites throughout the country for the potential to gain even greater distribution efficiencies.
In addition to our retail operations, we continue to grow our complementary institutional business, which includes Harbor Linen and T-Y Group by leveraging our combined expertise, product knowledge and relationships to provide products and services to hospitality, travel and other institutional customers.
Before turning the call over to Sue, I wanted to mention the recent Of a Kind acquisition. Last month, we welcomed Of a Kind and their customers and emerging designers to the Bed Bath & Beyond family. Of a Kind, founded by 2 college friends, Erica Cerulo and Claire Mazur, is an e-commerce website that introduces promising up-and-coming fashion and home designers by selling their specially commissioned, limited-edition items and sharing their stories.
Erica and Claire are talented and passionate entrepreneurs, have created a business model with a clear point of view and sophisticated taste level. We are pleased to have the unique abilities as part of our team. The combination of our highly talented organizations, along with the additional support now available to the Of a Kind team, will enable us to do even more for and with our collective customers. For now the focus is on continuing to build the Of a Kind brand, including e-commerce platform, their popular 10 Things weekly newsletter and its accompanying podcast.
As I said before, this is an exciting time for our company, and we're excited about our future. We are confident that we are making the appropriate investments to position our company for long-term profitable growth and to further enhance shareholder value.
To that end, our Board of Directors has authorized today a newly $2.5 billion share repurchase program that will commence after the completion of our current $2 billion program. Our board took this action based upon its continued confidence in our company's long-term growth potential, financial outlook and cash flow generation. 
For planning purposes, we anticipate completing the new program in fiscal 2019. It's currently anticipated that this new $2.5 billion share repurchase program will be funded from current cash and future cash flows. That said, our company's Board of Directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis.
I'll now turn the call over to Sue to review our quarterly financial results and provide an update on some of our planning assumptions for the second half of fiscal 2015. Sue?"
321778,297938072,872700,"Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Sep 24, 2015",2015-09-24,"Earnings Calls","20230930-DK-Butterfly-1, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steven. I'll start with a review of our second quarter results and then provide an update on some of our modeling assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2015. Net sales for the second quarter were approximately $3 billion, about 1.7% higher th",1744,"Thank you, Steven. I'll start with a review of our second quarter results and then provide an update on some of our modeling assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2015. Net sales for the second quarter were approximately $3 billion, about 1.7% higher than net sales in the prior year period or approximately 2.2% higher on a constant currency basis. Of this increase, approximately 41% was attributable to the increase in comp sales, and the remainder was primarily from new stores and Linen Holdings.
Comparable sales in the second quarter increased by approximately 0.7%, attributable to an increase in the average transaction amount partially offset by a slight decrease in the number of transactions. Canadian currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted our comparable sales in the second quarter by approximately 40 basis points. We had originally modeled an impact of 20 to 30 basis points.
Gross profit for the second quarter was approximately 38.1% of net sales compared to approximately 38.5% of net sales in the corresponding period a year ago. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to an order of magnitude an increase in coupon expense resulting from an increase in the number of redemptions and a slight increase in the average coupon amount and an increase in inventory acquisition costs. Also contributing was an increase in net direct-to-customer shipping expense.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter were approximately 26.4% of net sales as compared to 26% of net sales in the prior year period. This increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in technology expenses and related depreciation. Reflecting these movements in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the second quarter operating profit margin of 11.7% was approximately 80 basis points lower when compared with the same period last year.
Net interest expense for the second quarter of approximately $25 million related primarily to interest associated with our $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes and from our sale-leaseback obligations related to certain distribution facilities. Also included in net interest expense this quarter was approximately $2 million of a realized loss related to the tender of certain auction rate securities as well as approximately $3 million of expense related to the reduction in the value of the non-qualified deferred compensation plan investment. This reduction was offset by a corresponding benefit in SG&A and therefore, did not impact net earnings.
Our tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 38% compared to approximately 37.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. The second quarter provisions included net after-tax cost of approximately $800,000 this year as compared to net after-tax benefits of approximately $800,000 last year due to distinct tax events occurring during these quarters. Considering all of this activity, net earnings per diluted share increased to $1.21 for the second quarter of fiscal 2015, in line with our modeled range. This includes an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.01 from Canadian currency fluctuations.
Turning to the balance sheet. As of August 29, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents and investment securities were approximately $767 million. Retail inventories, which include inventory in our distribution facilities for direct-to-customer shipments, were approximately $2.8 billion at cost. Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition.
Capital expenditures for the 6 months of fiscal 2015 were approximately $161 million and included expenditures for technology enhancements, new stores, existing store improvements and other projects. Consolidated shareholders' equity at the end of the second quarter was approximately $2.6 billion, which is net of approximately $194 million, representing about 2.9 million shares repurchased during the period.
The company's current $2 billion share repurchase authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $305 million at the end of the second quarter and is expected to be completed in early fiscal 2016. As a reminder, our quarterly share repurchase activity may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions. And as Steve mentioned earlier, our newly authorized $2.5 billion share repurchase program will commence after the completion of the existing program.
Since our first share repurchase authorization back in December 2004 and through August 29, 2015, the company has returned more than $9.1 billion of cash to shareholders through repurchases, representing over 170 million shares. We are pleased to have been able to return such value to our shareholders while at the same time making significant investments in our people and technology to position our company for continued successful growth in the ever-evolving retail environment.
Now I'd like to provide an update on some of our modeling assumptions for the remaining 2 quarters and the full year. These include the following: For both the third and fourth quarters, we are now modeling comparable sales to increase in the range of 1% to 3%, including an impact of about 40 to 50 basis points in the third quarter and 20 to 30 basis points in the fourth quarter due to modeled year-over-year fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate related to our Canadian operations; We are modeling comparable sales consummated through our customer-facing websites and mobile apps to grow approximately 25% and store comp to be relatively flat for the rest of fiscal 2015. As Steve mentioned earlier, this directionally follows the trend of strong comps in our customer-facing digital channels and relatively flat comp in stores. Consolidated net sales are modeled to increase by approximately 1.8% to 4% for both the third and fourth quarters. Assuming these sales levels, we continue to model deleverage gross profit for the remainder of fiscal 2015. Contributing to this deleverage are increases in coupon expense and net direct-to-customer shipping expense. As a percentage of net sales, we continue to model the full year deleverage to be less than it was in fiscal 2014.  We are also modeling SG&A deleverage for the remainder of the year, which includes increases in technology-related expenses and investments in compensation and benefits. As a reminder, SG&A in the third quarter of last year included a non-recurring benefit relating to a credit card litigation settlement, which is equivalent to about $0.05 per diluted share based on our modeled share count for this year's third quarter. Depreciation expense for fiscal 2015 continues to be modeled in the range of approximately $255 million to $265 million. Annual interest expense is now anticipated to be approximately $85 million, primarily resulting from the interest related to the $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes and from our sale-leaseback obligations related to certain distribution facilities.
The third and fourth quarter tax provisions are estimated to be in the mid- to high-30s percent range. Net after-tax benefits due to distinct tax events are modeled to be approximately $3.7 million for the third quarter as compared to $16.7 million last year, an unfavorable difference of approximately $0.08 per diluted share based on our modeled share count for this year's third quarter. We expect to continue generating positive operating cash flow.
Consistent with our model, capital expenditures in 2015 are modeled to be approximately $375 million to $400 million, subject to the timing and composition of projects. Our technology-related projects continue to represent a significant portion of our planned capital expenditures for the year and include the deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, enhancements to our omni-channel capabilities, ongoing investment in data analytics, the continued build-out and utilization of a data center in North Carolina and the continued development of a new point-of-sale system.
In addition to our technology-related projects, capital expenditures also include the opening of approximately 30 new stores company wide, including the 12 we have opened to date and our new customer service contact center that Steven previously mentioned. We believe that fiscal 2015's mix of store openings by concept will be relatively comparable to that of fiscal 2014.  We will also continue our program of renovating or repositioning stores within markets where appropriate, and we will continue making enhancements to our distribution facilities to improve capacity and productivity.
Regarding our current $2 billion share repurchase program, we plan to continue to repurchase shares during the second half of this year and estimate this program to be completed by early fiscal 2016. This repurchase program, however, may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
We are modeling diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 165 million for the third quarter and 166 million for the full year. We are now modeling an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of approximately $0.06 per diluted share for fiscal 2015 compared to our previous estimate of about $0.05 based on a revised model 2015 Canadian currency exchange rate of approximately CAD 1.32 to each U.S. dollar. This $0.06 represents approximately $0.01 in each of the first 2 quarters and about $0.02 in each of the remaining 2 quarters of the year. Based on these and other planning assumptions, we continue to model fiscal 2015 net earnings per diluted share to be between relatively flat and a mid-single-digit percentage increase.
For the third quarter, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $1.14 to $1.21. This range results in year-over-year net earnings per share growth of approximately 5% to 11% after adjusting for some non-comparable items. These non-comparable items total about $0.15 based on this year's modeled share count and include approximately $0.05 due to the non-recurring favorable credit card fee litigation settlement that occurred in the third quarter of 2014, approximately $0.08 due to the significantly lower net after-tax benefit dollars planned in the third quarter of this year as compared to last year due to distinct tax events and approximately $0.02 due to the modeled unfavorable foreign currency rate impact in the third quarter of 2015.
We continue to execute our mission to do more for and with our customers while making strategic investments to position our company for long-term growth and profitability. Our performance year-to-date reflects not only the health of our business and the underlying strength of our balance sheet but also the progress we've made in further enhancing our omni-channel capabilities. As we've said before, this is an exciting time for our company, and we continue to manage our business for long-term performance. Please join us again on Thursday, January 7, 2016, when we plan to report our fiscal 2015 third quarter results.
I would now like to turn the call back to Steven."

We reported positive growth in both sales and net earnings per share this quarter, while we continued to make strategic investments in our future and return value to our shareholders through share repurchase",2210,"Thank you, Janet, and good afternoon, everyone. We reported positive growth in both sales and net earnings per share this quarter, while we continued to make strategic investments in our future and return value to our shareholders through share repurchases. As Janet said, our fiscal 2015 second quarter net earnings per diluted share increased to $1.21 on net sales of approximately $3 billion. Net sales increased about 1.7% or 2.2% on a constant currency basis. Despite slightly lower-than-modeled top line sales growth, we are pleased to have generated net earnings per share within the midpoint of our range. Comparable sales increased approximately 0.7% or 1.1% on a constant currency basis.
Comparable sales consummated through customer-facing websites and mobile applications grew in excess of 25%, while comparable sales consummated in stores declined approximately 1%. Directionally, this follows the trend of strong comps in our customer-facing digital channels and relatively flat comps in stores. As we have previously pointed out, these numbers in and of themselves are directional when assessing the productivity of our various channels for reasons such as: When an item purchased online is returned to a store, it results in a reduction in store sales; or when an item is being shopped for in the store and concurrently purchased on a mobile device, it is treated as a mobile sale; or when an item is reserved online and picked up in a store, it's recorded as a store sale.
As our digital and physical channels continue to converge, the physical stores remain central to serving our customers and provide us a tremendous opportunity to be close to them. The ability to consult with our knowledgeable and solutions-oriented sales associates, coupled with our in-store services, encourage customers to visit and spend time in our stores. Options such as reserve online, pick up in store, buy online and return to store and online appointment scheduling highlight various points of interactions we have with our customers across our channels.
During the second quarter, we opened a total of 6 new stores, including 2 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, 3 buybuy BABY stores and 1 Cost Plus World Market store. We continue to actively manage our real estate portfolio in a manner that permits store sizes, layouts, locations and offerings to evolve over time to optimize market profitability.
Since the start of our third quarter, we have opened 2 additional Bed Bath & Beyond stores, 1 buybuy BABY store and 1 Cost Plus World Market store. Including the 12 stores we've opened and 1 store that we've closed to date, we continue to model 30 new store openings and approximately 10 store closings companywide during fiscal 2015. Again, the combination of store openings and closings are part of our ongoing strategy to optimize both our market profitability and market coverage.
Our recent store openings include a new Cost Plus World Market store that opened in Manhattan last month on Sixth Avenue between 18th and 19th Streets, steps away from our Bed Bath & Beyond store in the same building. This 5,000-square-foot store provides a unique venue for customers to gain insight and appreciation for our product development initiatives in urban, small space living as well as to see what's trending in home decor. The store contains a well-edited mix of World Market's home decor offerings and provides an inviting atmosphere for customers to explore, shop and make purchases in both virtual and physical environments.

In Mexico, our joint venture currently operates 6 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, including 5 in the Mexico City market. During the second quarter, we opened in Cuernavaca, our first store outside of the Mexico City market. And we continue to be excited about our growth opportunities in Mexico and, with our partners, plan to open one additional store before the end of this year.

Our goal is to both increase our assortment, while we curate the right assortment of product for our customers. In order to do this, we constantly review, edit and refine our offerings based on our buyers' expertise, customer feedback and purchasing trends.
Our newer merchandise categories such as furniture, mattresses, jewelry, watches and luggage are continuing to gain recognition with all our customers, and we are steadily adding new brands to the assortment. For example, we have started to add collections of baby furniture. These items can be found on both the buybuy BABY and Bed Bath & Beyond websites. We believe these expanded product offerings are part of a natural progression of the merchandise we already sell online or in our stores and extend our ability to satisfy our customers' interests as they travel through their life stages.
Complementing our merchandise are the various service and solutions we offer both in-store and online to assist our customers to find what they are looking for and to make purchasing decisions more quickly and efficiently. We leverage our broad knowledge and expertise to provide solutions for our customers relating to various life stage events such as going away to college, having a new baby and getting married.
Supporting our merchandising and service efforts are our initiatives in marketing and analytics. We have made significant investments in these areas and continue to do so. We are investing in the systems, the analytic capabilities and people to capture and leverage our data to develop a more in-depth 360-degree view of our customers. Our goal is to drive better customer engagement through continuously optimized marketing programs across all channels. While we are making progress, we still believe there's a tremendous opportunity for us to improve how we personalize and target our marketing. Our marketing efforts continue to be a blend of both physical and digital programs with a continuing shift towards digital marketing such as email, paid search, SEO, social media, display and affiliate in order to communicate more efficiently and effectively with our customers.
Consistent with the ever-increasing role of digital connections in our lives, customers' adoption of our digital channels is also improving with solid year-over-year growth in both visits and orders in the second quarter. In particular, our mobile channel remained very strong with steady growth in traffic, ticket and conversion rates, and we continue to optimize our mobile touch points to create an even better customer experience.
The growth in our digital channels is also driving additional needs in our distribution network. While we have the capability and do ship from most of our stores, we also utilize distribution facilities to ship merchandise to both stores and customers. We currently have 10 retail distribution centers, including our newest facility, which opened last quarter in Las Vegas. We are planning to open an additional distribution facility in the southwest sometime during fiscal 2016. We will also continue to assess additional sites throughout the country for the potential to gain even greater distribution efficiencies.
In addition to our retail operations, we continue to grow our complementary institutional business, which includes Harbor Linen and T-Y Group by leveraging our combined expertise, product knowledge and relationships to provide products and services to hospitality, travel and other institutional customers.
Before turning the call over to Sue, I wanted to mention the recent Of a Kind acquisition. Last month, we welcomed Of a Kind and their customers and emerging designers to the Bed Bath & Beyond family. Of a Kind, founded by 2 college friends, Erica Cerulo and Claire Mazur, is an e-commerce website that introduces promising up-and-coming fashion and home designers by selling their specially commissioned, limited-edition items and sharing their stories.
Erica and Claire are talented and passionate entrepreneurs, have created a business model with a clear point of view and sophisticated taste level. We are pleased to have their unique abilities as part of our team. The combination of our highly talented organizations, along with the additional support now available to the Of a Kind team, will enable us to do even more for and with our collective customers. For now the focus is on continuing to build the Of a Kind brand, including e-commerce platform, their popular 10 Things weekly newsletter and its accompanying podcast.
As I said before, this is an exciting time for our company, and we're excited about our future. We are confident that we are making the appropriate investments to position our company for long-term profitable growth and to further enhance shareholder value.
To that end, our Board of Directors has authorized today a newly $2.5 billion share repurchase program that will commence after the completion of our current $2 billion program. Our board took this action based upon its continued confidence in our company's long-term growth potential, financial outlook and cash flow generation. 
For planning purposes, we anticipate completing the new program in fiscal 2019. It's currently anticipated that this new $2.5 billion share repurchase program will be funded from current cash and future cash flows. That said, our company's Board of Directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis.
I'll now turn the call over to Sue to review our quarterly financial results and provide an update on some of our planning assumptions for the second half of fiscal 2015. Sue?"

I'll start with a review of our second quarter results and then provide an update on some of our modeling assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2015. Net sales for the second quarter were approximately $3 billion, about 1.7% higher th",1745,"Thank you, Steven. I'll start with a review of our second quarter results and then provide an update on some of our modeling assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2015. Net sales for the second quarter were approximately $3 billion, about 1.7% higher than net sales in the prior year period or approximately 2.2% higher on a constant currency basis. Of this increase, approximately 41% was attributable to the increase in comp sales, and the remainder was primarily from new stores and Linen Holdings.
Comparable sales in the second quarter increased by approximately 0.7%, attributable to an increase in the average transaction amount partially offset by a slight decrease in the number of transactions. Canadian currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted our comparable sales in the second quarter by approximately 40 basis points. We had originally modeled an impact of 20 to 30 basis points.
Gross profit for the second quarter was approximately 38.1% of net sales compared to approximately 38.5% of net sales in the corresponding period a year ago. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to, in order of magnitude: an increase in coupon expense resulting from an increase in the number of redemptions and a slight increase in the average coupon amount; and an increase in inventory acquisition costs. Also contributing was an increase in net direct-to-customer shipping expense.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter were approximately 26.4% of net sales as compared to 26% of net sales in the prior year period. This increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in technology expenses and related depreciation. Reflecting these movements in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the second quarter operating profit margin of 11.7% was approximately 80 basis points lower when compared with the same period last year.
Net interest expense for the second quarter of approximately $25 million related primarily to interest associated with our $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes and from our sale-leaseback obligations related to certain distribution facilities. Also included in net interest expense this quarter was approximately $2 million of a realized loss related to the tender of certain auction rate securities as well as approximately $3 million of expense related to the reduction in the value of the non-qualified deferred compensation plan investment. This reduction was offset by a corresponding benefit in SG&A and therefore, did not impact net earnings.
Our tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 38% compared to approximately 37.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. The second quarter provisions included net after-tax cost of approximately $800,000 this year as compared to net after-tax benefits of approximately $800,000 last year due to distinct tax events occurring during these quarters. Considering all of this activity, net earnings per diluted share increased to $1.21 for the second quarter of fiscal 2015, in line with our modeled range. This includes an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.01 from Canadian currency fluctuations.
Turning to the balance sheet. As of August 29, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents and investment securities were approximately $767 million. Retail inventories, which include inventory in our distribution facilities for direct-to-customer shipments, were approximately $2.8 billion at cost. Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition.
Capital expenditures for the 6 months of fiscal 2015 were approximately $161 million and included expenditures for technology enhancements, new stores, existing store improvements and other projects. Consolidated shareholders' equity at the end of the second quarter was approximately $2.6 billion, which is net of approximately $194 million, representing about 2.9 million shares repurchased during the period.
The company's current $2 billion share repurchase authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $305 million at the end of the second quarter and is expected to be completed in early fiscal 2016. As a reminder, our quarterly share repurchase activity may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions. And as Steve mentioned earlier, our newly authorized $2.5 billion share repurchase program will commence after the completion of the existing program.
Since our first share repurchase authorization back in December 2004 and through August 29, 2015, the company has returned more than $9.1 billion of cash to shareholders through repurchases, representing over 170 million shares. We are pleased to have been able to return such value to our shareholders while at the same time making significant investments in our people and technology to position our company for continued successful growth in the ever-evolving retail environment.
Now I'd like to provide an update on some of our modeling assumptions for the remaining 2 quarters and the full year. These include the following: For both the third and fourth quarters, we are now modeling comparable sales to increase in the range of 1% to 3%, including an impact of about 40 to 50 basis points in the third quarter and 20 to 30 basis points in the fourth quarter due to modeled year-over-year fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate related to our Canadian operations; We are modeling comparable sales consummated through our customer-facing websites and mobile apps to grow approximately 25% and store comp to be relatively flat for the rest of fiscal 2015. As Steve mentioned earlier, this directionally follows the trend of strong comps in our customer-facing digital channels and relatively flat comps in stores. Consolidated net sales are modeled to increase by approximately 1.8% to 4% for both the third and fourth quarters. Assuming these sales levels, we continue to model deleverage in gross profit for the remainder of fiscal 2015. Contributing to this deleverage are increases in coupon expense and net direct-to-customer shipping expense. As a percentage of net sales, we continue to model the full year deleverage to be less than it was in fiscal 2014.  We are also modeling SG&A deleverage for the remainder of the year, which includes increases in technology-related expenses and investments in compensation and benefits. As a reminder, SG&A in the third quarter of last year included a non-recurring benefit relating to a credit card litigation settlement, which is equivalent to about $0.05 per diluted share based on our modeled share count for this year's third quarter. Depreciation expense for fiscal 2015 continues to be modeled in the range of approximately $255 million to $265 million. Annual interest expense is now anticipated to be approximately $85 million, primarily resulting from the interest related to the $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes and from our sale-leaseback obligations related to certain distribution facilities.
The third and fourth quarter tax provisions are estimated to be in the mid- to high-30s percent range. Net after-tax benefits due to distinct tax events are modeled to be approximately $3.7 million for the third quarter as compared to $16.7 million last year, an unfavorable difference of approximately $0.08 per diluted share based on our modeled share count for this year's third quarter. We expect to continue generating positive operating cash flow.
Consistent with our model, capital expenditures in 2015 are modeled to be approximately $375 million to $400 million, subject to the timing and composition of projects. Our technology-related projects continue to represent a significant portion of our planned capital expenditures for the year and include the deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, enhancements to our omni-channel capabilities, ongoing investment in data analytics, the continued build-out and utilization of a data center in North Carolina and the continued development of a new point-of-sale system.
In addition to our technology-related projects, capital expenditures also include the opening of approximately 30 new stores company wide, including the 12 we have opened to date and our new customer service contact center that Steven previously mentioned. We believe that fiscal 2015's mix of store openings by concept will be relatively comparable to that of fiscal 2014.  We will also continue our program of renovating or repositioning stores within markets where appropriate, and we will continue making enhancements to our distribution facilities to improve capacity and productivity.
Regarding our current $2 billion share repurchase program, we plan to continue to repurchase shares during the second half of this year and estimate this program to be completed by early fiscal 2016. This repurchase program, however, may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
We are modeling diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 165 million for the third quarter and 166 million for the full year. We are now modeling an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of approximately $0.06 per diluted share for fiscal 2015 compared to our previous estimate of about $0.05 based on a revised model 2015 Canadian currency exchange rate of approximately CAD 1.32 to each U.S. dollar. This $0.06 represents approximately $0.01 in each of the first 2 quarters and about $0.02 in each of the remaining 2 quarters of the year. Based on these and other planning assumptions, we continue to model fiscal 2015 net earnings per diluted share to be between relatively flat and a mid-single-digit percentage increase.
For the third quarter, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $1.14 to $1.21. This range results in year-over-year net earnings per share growth of approximately 5% to 11% after adjusting for some non-comparable items. These non-comparable items total about $0.15 based on this year's modeled share count and include approximately $0.05 due to the non-recurring favorable credit card fee litigation settlement that occurred in the third quarter of 2014, approximately $0.08 due to the significantly lower net after-tax benefit dollars planned in the third quarter of this year as compared to last year due to distinct tax events and approximately $0.02 due to the modeled unfavorable foreign currency rate impact in the third quarter of 2015.
We continue to execute our mission to do more for and with our customers while making strategic investments to position our company for long-term growth and profitability. Our performance year-to-date reflects not only the health of our business and the underlying strength of our balance sheet but also the progress we've made in further enhancing our omni-channel capabilities. As we've said before, this is an exciting time for our company, and we continue to manage our business for long-term performance. Please join us again on Thursday, January 7, 2016, when we plan to report our fiscal 2015 third quarter results.
I would now like to turn the call back to Steven."
