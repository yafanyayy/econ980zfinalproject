We performed w",1588,"Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with our results for the quarter and for the full year, especially in light of the significant macroeconomic volatility being experienced in so many markets around the world. We performed well in this challenging environment, largely on the strength of our brand and product portfolios and diversity of our geographic footprint. 
So while certain markets were hit with political disruptions, economic downturn or significant currency devaluation, other markets in our portfolio not experiencing these issues were able to offset their impact to deliver overall strong results. We made a lot of progress in 2014, and I'd like to recap some of those achievements, starting with our financial performance. 
I'm pleased to report that we met or exceeded each of the targets we communicated at the beginning of the year. Organic revenue grew 4% for the full year and 5% in the fourth quarter. Core gross and operating margins expanded for the quarter and the full year. We delivered our productivity target for the year. Free cash flow exceeded $8 billion.
Our focus on capital allocation discipline resulted in another year of significant core net ROIC improvement. We increased our annual dividend for the 42nd consecutive year. And we returned $8.7 billion in total to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, which is a 36% increase over 2013. 
Just as importantly, we strengthened the foundations of our company. First, we continue to invest in our portfolio of iconic global brands. In 2014, we sustained our increased A&M investment and focused our spending on our biggest brands. Additionally, we increased the impact of our investment by directing more of the spending to consumer-facing activity. 
We launched our largest-ever global campaign for our 2 biggest brands, Pepsi and Lay's, with core data package graphics, use of sports and entertainment properties, point-of-sale material, ad copy and promotions. We expanded our engagement in social and digital marketing. For example, Doritos crashed the Super Bowl received nearly 5,000 consumer submissions from 29 countries around the world, and our Lay's Do Us a Flavour campaign garnered more than 14 million submissions. Programs like these drive phenomenal consumer engagement, are highly complementary to our broader marketing efforts and are extremely financially efficient. 
Our investments are translating to tangible results, with solid improvement in brand equity scores and market share performance in our priority markets for our global brands. 
Second, we continue to strengthen our innovation engine. We've built a robust and sustainable innovation pipeline, perhaps the strongest in our history. 
Over the past 2 years, innovation as a percentage of total net revenue has climbed by 150 basis points and now stands at 9%, and we're innovating across our portfolio. For example, to meet the growing demand for nutritious products, we introduced Naked Juice's Trailblazer and Gatorade's new Whey Protein Bars. 
We bolstered our foodservice business with the introduction of Pepsi Spire fountain equipment in over 30 markets, giving our customers choice of flexible and cost-effective equipment and allowing our consumers to create more than 1,000 customized beverages with just a touch of the screen. In snacks, we leveraged our global scale by lifting and shifting successful new products like Doritos JACKED and Deep Ridged Chips from the United States into a number of international markets. 
And as a testament to the durability of our innovation, a number of our recent product introductions like Tostitos Cantina, Mountain Dew Kickstart and PureLeaf generated double-digit estimated annual retail sales growth in 2014 after achieving over $100 million in their launch year. So that's innovation. 
Third, we stepped up our marketplace execution. As evidence, in 2014, we were the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth among all food and beverage manufacturers. Based on IRI data, in all measured channels, we contributed nearly $1 billion of retail sales growth, more than the combined sales growth of the next 27 largest manufacturers. 
In foodservice, we executed customized Better Together programs like the pairing of Doritos Loaded and Mountain Dew solo fair -- solo flare, and we secured attractive new businesses such as the Disney Park in Shanghai, leveraging the strength of our combined beverage and snack portfolio. 
Fourth, we've taken productivity to a new level. We successfully completed our 3-year, $3 billion productivity program launched in 2012, and we are entering our next phase of productivity with the new 5-year, $5 billion program. And we have a robust pipeline of productivity projects focused on increasing efficiencies for automation, optimizing our global manufacturing footprint, advancing the competitiveness of our go-to-market models and utilizing shared services. These programs collectively are geared to deliver our targeted savings of approximately $1 billion per year through 2019. 
At the same time, we have significantly evolved our organization structure and operating model to enable us to more fully capitalize on our scale, global presence and deep capabilities. 
And lastly, we've driven increased capital allocation discipline throughout the organization to drive higher returns of investments and increase cash returns to our shareholders. 
So that's a summary at a high level of our accomplishments. So let me comment briefly on the performance highlights by business sector, starting with the Americas. 
PepsiCo Americas Beverages had a terrific fourth quarter. 3% organic revenue growth translated to 11% core constant-currency operating profit growth. The profit growth is especially notable, given the fact that we also increased A&M in the quarter by high single digits. 
We have seen the business gain momentum beyond the efforts we've been making in marketing, innovation and execution. And this has resulted in not only improved financial results but better market-based performance, too, especially in our largest market, the United States. 
Clearly, our Latin American beverage business has had its challenges for the Mexico tax and deteriorating macro in Venezuela. Despite these challenges, our Latin American beverage business was a positive contributor to PAB's overall organic top line and core constant-currency bottom line results. 
Frito-Lay North America delivered strong performance. Frito delivered 3% organic revenue growth for the full year and 3.5% in the fourth quarter and 6% core constant-currency operating profit growth, both for the quarter and the full year. Market share results have shown steady improvement, and we gained savory snack value share in the fourth quarter. 
Latin America Foods performance, both for the quarter and full year, were solid. For the full year, Latin American Foods delivered 10% organic revenue growth and 9% core constant-currency operating profit growth. 
Quaker Foods North America performed well within some challenged categories. Despite the category challenges, core constant-currency operating profit was up 8% in the quarter, and we gained value share for the full year in each of our core categories: hot cereal, ready-to-eat cereal and snack bars. So very strong performance by our businesses based in the Americas and the U.S. in particular. 
As I mentioned earlier, our portfolio collectively was the largest contributor to retail food and beverage growth in the United States, both in the quarter and for the full year. And this is a distinction we are very proud of. 
Moving across to Europe. As you know, the majority of our European business is located in Eastern Europe and Russia, in particular. Clearly, the currency picture and macros in Russia have made operations more challenging. While the Russian consumer has been quite resilient, at least for our business, the currency situation has led to significant inflation because of the transaction ForEx on the materials we source from outside of Russia, resulting in significant input cost inflation. 
Despite the significant headwinds, Europe generated full year gains in volume, organic revenue and core constant-currency operating profit. All things considered, solid performance for Europe. 
And lastly, AMEA. Again, good result despite some political macro volatility in many parts of the region. For both the quarter and the year, we had solid volume and organic revenue gains while full year operating profit performance was impacted by efficiency investments made in 2014 and by lapping the Vietnam re-franchising gain we had in 2013. 
Most of the global volatility has been concentrated in the Developing and Emerging Markets. However, as a group, even our Developing and Emerging Markets grew organic revenue 10% in the quarter and 9% for the full year. So they continue to be major contributors to our growth. 
As I mentioned earlier, we have a terrific geographic portfolio, and this allows us to balance challenges and opportunities in a way that tends to produce consistently good results overall. And we believe the fourth quarter and full year 2014 results are a reflection of this. 
Now Hugh will take you through the financial guidance in some detail in just a minute, but I want to highlight just a few key points. As an operating company, we absolutely manage the things that are within our control: marketing, innovation, marketplace execution and productivity, and we expect to continue to perform well in these areas. However, we expect to face continued headwinds related to macros, in particular, weak currencies in a number of our key markets and the impact of lower oil prices in countries as economies are highly dependent on energy. Obviously, these are outside of our control, but we adjust the business to weather through the challenges as best as we can by controlling costs, adjusting our raw material sourcing and executing balanced pricing actions. As we balance all these factors, we've concluded that our outlook for 2014 will be within our long-term financial goals. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh?"
32854,281512292,759328,"Pepsico, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2015",2015-02-11,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Indra, and good morning, everyone.

We're pleased to report that we met or exceeded each of our financial goals for the year. We targeted mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, and we delivered 4%. We targeted core operating margin improvement, and it increased by 30 basis points. We targeted $1 billion in productivity savings, and we delivered it. We targeted 7% core constant-currency EPS growth with our initial guidance and delivered 9%, which is right in line with the increased target we communicated to you in October. 
We targeted core net ROIC improvement and delivered 110 basis points. Our core net ROIC now stands at 17.5%. We targeted free cash flow of more than $7 billion and delivered $8.3 billion. And we committed to return $8.7 billion of cash to shareholders, which is what we did. 
So overall, good performance, meeting or exceeding each of the targets we communicated at the beginning of 2014. We're particularly pleased with our cash flow management. Our free cash flow as a percent of our core net income exceeded 100% for the year and over the past 3 years. So we are converting earnings to free cash flow very efficiently. 
Two big contributors to this performance are first, the discipline and productivity we have on capital spending, where we've successfully held CapEx to less than 5% of net revenue since 2012; and second, the improvement we've driven in working capital, where we shortened the cash conversion cycle by 50% over the past 3 years and have generated cash from working capital of over $2 billion in aggregate over the past 3 years. And it's this strong cash generation that is enabling us to provide attractive shareholder cash returns. 
Let me spend a few minutes discussing our outlook for 2015, which is in line with our long-term objectives. We expect another year of mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. We expect core operating margin expansion as organic top line growth and productivity should offset negative geographic mix and cost inflation. 
Below the division operating profit line, we expect corporate cost to be down and approximately 25% core tax rate and a reduced share count. All in, we expect core constant-currency EPS growth of 7%. 
Foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact revenue and core earnings per share by approximately 7 percentage points each based on current market consensus rates. As you saw in the release, during the fourth quarter of 2014, we adopted the SICAD I rate of VEF 12 per U.S. dollar, and we assumed this same exchange rate for 2015. The currency exchange picture in Venezuela continues to be quite volatile so I wanted to be absolutely transparent about what we have assumed in our 2015 guidance. 
Putting it all together, taking our core 2014 EPS of $4.63 and applying our guidance implies 2015 core EPS of approximately $4.63 as well. Our outlook appropriately factors in both tailwinds and headwinds. To the positive, we expect to generate approximately $1 billion of productivity savings in 2015, which will offset operating cost inflation. We feel very good about our innovation agenda, which should enable us to sustain our organic revenue growth rate. 
Our share count will benefit from continued share repurchases although we won't recognize the full benefit of 2015 repurchases within 2015 as they'll be made throughout the year with some of the impact of the share count reduction falling into 2016. Our core tax rate is estimated to come in for the full year at approximately 25%, even with 2014, and we expect to be able to sustain this rate for the foreseeable future. 
In terms of headwinds, we anticipate commodity cost inflation in the low single digits. Keep in mind that because of our forward-buying strategies, our commodity cost changes will lag what you see in the spot market. I believe our expected inflation rate is a bit higher than the number -- what a number of you have modeled, and this is because we are seeing more pronounced inflation in our nonmarket traded commodities, including certain packaging and agricultural raw materials. 
In addition, we will see an inflation impact from transaction ForEx in many of the markets whose currencies have weakened against the dollar. And foreign exchange translation will be a significant drag on our U.S. dollar earnings. 
Finally, as you model out the quarters for 2015, please note that a number of our international market's currencies significantly weakened in the back half of 2014 so the currency laps are most difficult in the first 2 quarters. 
Our long-term goals remain intact: mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, core operating margins expanding 30 to 50 basis points per year, high single-digit core constant-currency EPS growth, free cash flow growing roughly in line with earnings and core net ROIC improving 50 basis points per year. 
We intend to responsibly manage the business for top line growth, drive productivity and reinvest appropriately to position PepsiCo for sustainable growth for the long term. And we plan to remain highly disciplined toward capital allocation with the vast majority of free cash flow after capital spending being returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. 
First, we're increasing our dividends per share by 7% beginning with our June 2015 payment to $2.81 on an annualized basis. This represents the 43rd consecutive year of annual dividend increase and an approximately 60% payout ratio based on the 2014 core EPS. 
At yesterday's closing stock price, it represents a 2.9% yield and will bring our 10-year annualized dividend per share compound annual growth rate to 10%. And we expect to return an additional $4.5 billion to $5 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases. While doing so, we expect to maintain Tier 1 commercial paper access, enabling us to retain low-cost, highly accessible financing. 
So combined, these actions will result in cash returns to shareholders of $8.5 billion to $9 billion and will bring our cumulative 10-year cash returns to shareholders to $65 billion. As many of you know, we have stated disciplined capital allocation as a top priority for our management and our board, and we trust these actions will again be seen by our shareholders as tangible evidence of this commitment."

Before we open it up to questions, I want to take this opportunity to share with you how excited we are to be entering 2015 despite the challenges that we face because this year marks the 50th anniversary of the coming together of Pepsi and Frito-Lay in 1965, which set the foundation for what is today one of the world's most iconic and successful companies. 
This year, we celebrate 5 decades of growing our business and creating substantial value for our shareholders, customers, consumers and communities. It was a phenomenal vision of Don and Herman Lay, the architects of this combination, who set the stage to grow from $510 million in revenue in 1965 to almost $67 billion today. 
Of the companies in the Fortune 500 in 1965, just 79 remain today. And over this time frame, we've generated extraordinary shareholder returns. In fact, $100 investment in PepsiCo in 1965 with dividends reinvested would be worth over $42,000 today. 
But PepsiCo's success over the past 50 years has not happened by chance. It happened because throughout our history, PepsiCo has repeatedly adapted and retooled, always with an eye to the future. More importantly, we have kept integrity at the heart of all we do, running the company responsibly to generate sustainable long-term value. And this is the formula for success that our current team will continue to apply. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

When you look at 2015, is there anything you're thinking differently about how much you want to reinvest especially in sales growth in '15 just given some of the volatility you have in developing and emerging markets? And I guess related to that, given kind of the wide range of outcomes that could happen just because of the macros, you're looking for any more flexibility as you're planning in '15 in terms of reinvestment rate.

So I think between geopolitical issues, the oil price impact, other macroeconomic factors, we had our share of volatility.

Then from a capital perspective, each of the last couple of years, we've started with a budget of somewhere between 4% and 5%, and each of those years, we've landed at a little bit over 4%. The reason for that is we really do apply quite a bit of rigor to the investments that we're making. We're not afraid to invest in long-term growth, quite the opposite. I would argue both in R&D in capital, we have been investing in long-term growth. The focus here is sustainable value creation, and I think with the reinvestment rates we have right now, we will be able to deliver that sustainably."

On top of that, even a country like Russia because our categories are in juice and dairy, stuff that the Russian consumer really needs, the businesses have been quite resilient. Now we have to wait and see how 2015 shapes up, but I'd say for our categories and the nature of the products that we offer them, the portfolio has remained quite resilient even going into 2015, but let's watch and see what happens.

And the team is very good, a lot of depth of talent there, and Europe's a good performer for us, especially given the incredibly difficult environment they're all operating under. Hugh, what about Venezuela?"

First, as you know, we spent the better part of the year at 6.3 last year and then moved to 12 in November. So the average for the year was 6.84. Our planning assumption right now is to be at SICAD I, which is 12. obviously, there was news based on yesterday's press conference out of Venezuela from the government talking about exchange rates. There was a lot of information mentioned there. It still isn't really clear because the details haven't been published as to what it all means yet. In general, the fact that they seem to be going to a more market-based supply and demand currency environment, those suggest I think long-term positives for us. In terms of the implications in the short term, we did hear that SICAD I would continue to exist. We will wait till we see more details on that, and then we'll come back to investors with details as they emerge. But in the long run, it seems to me it's probably encouraging based on what we heard yesterday in terms of being able to move currency and cash around more freely."

Russia's obviously a more profound example of that, but I think the rules of thumb will generally apply in that regard.

I think of the marketing spend overall in a massive percentage of sales, we said we will hold it at 5.9% of sales, and we're staying with that number.

But more importantly, we will focus a lot, Ali, on working versus nonworking spending. We are shifting a lot more to consumer-facing programs, and that's really what we were talking about because we believe that the more we focus on shifting the spending to working A&M away from sort of G&A-type A&M, the more bang for the buck we get. So in every part of the world, we are trying to put in place playbooks and best practices to increase the A&M that's consumer facing. So overall, for the company again as we've said many times, we are holding to the A&M as a percentage of sales, but where we see an opportunity increase it, we look for ways to reallocate it in every moment we measure the return on investment on our marketing spend.

For the year, we had marketing spend equal to the rate of sales growth. So we held as we committed to at the beginning of the year. For the quarter, A&M grew faster than sales. So in them as a percent of sales went up in the quarter, and obviously, that was a bit of a margin drag in the quarter. Regarding your question comparing us to other companies in terms of our ability to equalize revenue in earnings FX impacts, I can't speak to what other companies are or aren't doing. What I can tell you is number one, we do hedge transaction out several months. It varies from country to country based on what's economic. As you know, in Developing and Emerging Markets, the hedges tend to get expensive when you go out more than a couple of months. So we make good economic decisions in that regard. Number two, I suspect the difference between us and most of our peer sent is more of our costs are likely localized because we do produce in so many countries. Our products don't ship as well as in particular HBC-type companies. So I suspect that maybe the difference, but I don't know that for a fact because I haven't studied their cost structures that closely."

In terms of the impact of gas prices, I think what we see happening is consistent with what we've seen in the past, which is it takes a number of months before the consumer fully spent that the so-called that if it from lower gas prices. I think you're going to see that over the course of 6 to 8 months rather than a immediate change in consumer behavior it just sort of assimilates over time. I am optimistic from the perspective that consumers right now there personal balance sheets are pretty healthy. Most consumers have been levered pretty well.

We are very pleased with our results for the quarter and for the full year, especially in light of the significant macroeconomic volatility being experienced in so many markets around the world. We performed well in this challenging environment, largely on the strength of our brand and product portfolios and diversity of our geographic footprint. 
So while certain markets were hit with political disruptions, economic downturn or significant currency devaluation, other markets in our portfolio not experiencing these issues were able to offset their impact to deliver overall strong results. We made a lot of progress in 2014, and I'd like to recap some of those achievements, starting with our financial performance. 
I'm pleased to report that we met or exceeded each of the targets we communicated at the beginning of the year. Organic revenue grew 4% for the full year and 5% in the fourth quarter. Core gross and operating margins expanded for the quarter and the full year. We delivered our productivity target for the year. Free cash flow exceeded $8 billion.
Our focus on capital allocation discipline resulted in another year of significant core net ROIC improvement. We increased our annual dividend for the 42nd consecutive year. And we returned $8.7 billion in total to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, which is a 36% increase over 2013. 
Just as importantly, we strengthened the foundations of our company. First, we continue to invest in our portfolio of iconic global brands. In 2014, we sustained our increased A&M investment and focused our spending on our biggest brands. Additionally, we increased the impact of our investment by directing more of the spending to consumer-facing activity. 
We launched our largest ever global campaign for our 2 biggest brands, Pepsi and Lay's, with coordinated package graphics, use of sports and entertainment properties, point-of-sale material, ad copy and promotions. We expanded our engagement in social and digital marketing. For example, Doritos crashed the Super Bowl, received nearly 5,000 consumer submissions from 29 countries around the world, and our Lay's Do Us a Flavour campaign garnered more than 14 million submissions. Programs like these drive phenomenal consumer engagement, are highly complementary to our broader marketing efforts and are extremely financially efficient. 
Our investments are translating to tangible results, with solid improvement in brand equity scores and market share performance in our priority markets for our global brands. 
Second, we continue to strengthen our innovation engine. We've built a robust and sustainable innovation pipeline, perhaps the strongest in our history. 
Over the past 2 years, innovation as a percentage of total net revenue has climbed by 150 basis points and now stands at 9%, and we're innovating across our portfolio. For example, to meet the growing demand for nutritious products, we introduced Naked Juice's Kale Blazer and Gatorade's new Whey Protein Bars. 
We bolstered our foodservice business with the introduction of Pepsi Spire fountain equipment in over 30 markets, giving our customers a choice of flexible and cost-effective equipment and allowing our consumers to create more than 1,000 customized beverages with just a touch of a screen. In snacks, we leveraged our global scale by lifting and shifting successful new products like Doritos JACKED and Deep Ridged Chips from the United States into a number of international markets. 
And as a testament to the durability of our innovation, a number of our recent product introductions like Tostitos Cantina, Mountain Dew Kickstart and Pure Leaf generated double-digit estimated annual retail sales growth in 2014 after achieving over $100 million in their launch year. So that's innovation. 
Third, we stepped up our marketplace execution. As evidenced, in 2014, we were the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth among all food and beverage manufacturers. Based on IRI data, in all measured channels, we contributed nearly $1 billion of retail sales growth, more than the combined sales growth of the next 27 largest manufacturers. 
In foodservice, we executed customized Better Together programs like the pairing of Doritos Loaded and Mountain Dew solo fare [ph]  -- Solar Flare, and we secured attractive new businesses such as the Disney Park in Shanghai, leveraging the strength of our combined beverage and snack portfolio. 
Fourth, we've taken productivity to a new level. We successfully completed our 3-year, $3 billion productivity program launched in 2012, and we're entering our next phase of productivity with the new 5-year, $5 billion program. And we have a robust pipeline of productivity projects focused on increasing efficiency through automation, optimizing our global manufacturing footprint, advancing the competitiveness of our go-to-market models and utilizing shared services. These programs collectively are geared to deliver our targeted savings of approximately $1 billion per year through 2019. 
At the same time, we have significantly evolved our organization structure and operating model to enable us to more fully capitalize on our scale, global presence and deep capabilities. 
And lastly, we've driven increased capital allocation discipline throughout the organization to drive higher returns of investment and increase cash returns to our shareholders. 
So that's a summary at a high level of our accomplishments. So let me comment briefly on the performance highlights by business sector, starting with the Americas. 
PepsiCo Americas Beverages had a terrific fourth quarter. 3% organic revenue growth translated to 11% core constant currency operating profit growth. The profit growth is especially notable, given the fact that we also increased A&M in the quarter by high single digits. 
We have seen the business gain momentum behind the efforts we've been making in marketing, innovation and execution. And this has resulted in not only improved financial results but better marketplace performance too, especially in our largest market, the United States. 
Clearly, our Latin American beverage business has had its challenges with the Mexico tax and deteriorating macros in Venezuela. Despite these challenges, our Latin American beverage business was a positive contributor to PAB's overall organic top line and core constant currency bottom line results. 
Frito-Lay North America delivered strong performance. Frito delivered 3% organic revenue growth for the full year and 3.5% in the fourth quarter and 6% core constant currency operating profit growth, both for the quarter and the full year. Market share results have shown steady improvement, and we gained savory snack value share in the fourth quarter. 
Latin America Foods performance, both for the quarter and full year, were solid. For the full year, Latin American Foods delivered 10% organic revenue growth and 9% core constant currency operating profit growth. 
Quaker Foods North America performed well within some challenged categories. Despite the category challenges, core constant currency operating profit was up 8% in the quarter, and we gained value share for the full year in each of our core categories: hot cereal, ready-to-eat cereal and snack bars. So very strong performance by our businesses based in the Americas and in the U.S., in particular. 
As I mentioned earlier, our portfolio collectively was the largest contributor to retail food and beverage growth in the United States, both in the quarter and for the full year. And this is a distinction we are very proud of. 
Moving across to Europe. As you know, the majority of our European business is located in Eastern Europe and Russia, in particular. Clearly, the currency picture and macros in Russia have made operations more challenging. While the Russian consumer has been quite resilient, at least for our business, the currency situation has led to significant inflation because of the transaction ForEx on the materials we source from outside of Russia, resulting in significant input cost inflation. 
Despite these significant headwinds, Europe generated full year gains in volume, organic revenue and core constant currency operating profit. So all things considered, solid performance for Europe. 
And lastly, AMEA. Again, good result despite some political macro volatility in many parts of the region. For both the quarter and the year, we had solid volume and organic revenue gains while full year operating profit performance was impacted by efficiency investments made in 2014 and by lapping the Vietnam re-franchising gains we had in 2013. 
Most of the global volatility has been concentrated in the developing and emerging markets. However, as a group, even our developing and emerging markets grew organic revenue 10% in the quarter and 9% for the full year. So they continue to be major contributors to our growth. 
As I mentioned earlier, we have a terrific geographic portfolio, and this allows us to balance challenges and opportunities in a way that tends to produce consistently good results overall. And we believe the fourth quarter and full year 2014 results are a reflection of this. 
Now Hugh will take you through the financial guidance in some detail in just a minute, but I want to highlight just a few key points. As an operating company, we absolutely manage the things that are within our control: marketing, innovation, marketplace execution and productivity, and we expect to continue to perform well in these areas. However, we expect to face continued headwinds related to macros, in particular, weak currencies in a number of our key markets and the impact of low oil prices in countries whose economies are highly dependent on energy. Obviously, these are outside our control, but we adjust the businesses to weather through the challenges as best as we can by controlling costs, adjusting our raw material sourcing and executing balanced pricing actions. As we balance all these factors, we've concluded that our outlook for 2014 will be within our long-term financial goals. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh?"

We're pleased to report that we met or exceeded each of our financial goals for the year. We targeted mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, and we delivered 4%. We targeted core operating margin improvement, and it increased by 30 basis points. We targeted $1 billion in productivity savings, and we delivered it. We targeted 7% core constant currency EPS growth with our initial guidance and delivered 9%, which is right in line with the increased target we communicated to you in October. 
We targeted core net ROIC improvement and delivered 110 basis points. Our core net ROIC now stands at 17.5%. We targeted free cash flow of more than $7 billion and delivered $8.3 billion. And we committed to return $8.7 billion of cash to shareholders, which is what we did. 
So overall, good performance, meeting or exceeding each of the targets we communicated at the beginning of 2014. We're particularly pleased with our cash flow management. Our free cash flow as a percent of our core net income exceeded 100% for the year and over the past 3 years. So we are converting earnings to free cash flow very efficiently. 
Two big contributors to this performance are: first, the discipline and productivity we have on capital spending, where we've successfully held CapEx to less than 5% of net revenue since 2012; and second, the improvement we've driven in working capital, where we've shortened the cash conversion cycle by 50% over the past 3 years and have generated cash from working capital of over $2 billion in aggregate over the past 3 years. And it's this strong cash generation that is enabling us to provide attractive shareholder cash returns. 
Let me spend a few minutes discussing our outlook for 2015, which is in line with our long-term objectives. We expect another year of mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. We expect core operating margin expansion, as organic top line growth and productivity should offset negative geographic mix and cost inflation. 
Below the division operating profit line, we expect corporate cost to be down and approximately 25% core tax rate and a reduced share count. All in, we expect core constant currency EPS growth of 7%. 
Foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact revenue and core earnings per share by approximately 7 percentage points each, based on current market consensus rates. As you saw in the release, during the fourth quarter of 2014, we adopted the SICAD I rate of VEF 12 per U.S. dollar, and we assumed this same exchange rate for 2015. The currency exchange picture in Venezuela continues to be quite volatile, so I wanted to be absolutely transparent about what we have assumed in our 2015 guidance. 
Putting it all together, taking our core 2014 EPS of $4.63 and applying our guidance implies 2015 core EPS of approximately $4.63 as well. Our outlook appropriately factors in both tailwinds and headwinds. To the positive, we expect to generate approximately $1 billion of productivity savings in 2015, which will offset operating cost inflation. We feel very good about our innovation agenda, which should enable us to sustain our organic revenue growth rate. 
Our share count will benefit from continued share repurchases, although we won't recognize the full benefit of 2015 repurchases within 2015, as they'll be made throughout the year with some of the impact of the share count reduction falling into 2016. Our core tax rate is estimated to come in for the full year at approximately 25%, even with 2014, and we expect to be able to sustain this rate for the foreseeable future. 
In terms of headwinds, we anticipate commodity cost inflation in the low single digits. Keep in mind that because of our forward-buying strategies, our commodity cost changes will lag what you see in the spot market. I believe our expected inflation rate is a bit higher than the number -- what a number of you have modeled, and this is because we are seeing more pronounced inflation in our nonmarket traded commodities, including certain packaging and agricultural raw materials. 
In addition, we will see an inflation impact from transaction ForEx in many of the markets whose currencies have weakened against the dollar. And foreign exchange translation will be a significant drag on our U.S. dollar earnings. 
Finally, as you model out the quarters for 2015, please note that a number of our international market's currencies significantly weakened in the back half of 2014, so the currency laps are most difficult in the first 2 quarters. 
Our long-term goals remain intact: mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, core operating margins expanding 30 to 50 basis points per year, high single-digit core constant-currency EPS growth, free cash flow growing roughly in line with earnings and core net ROIC improving 50 basis points per year. 
We intend to responsibly manage the business for top line growth, drive productivity and reinvest appropriately to position PepsiCo for sustainable growth for the long term. And we plan to remain highly disciplined toward capital allocation with the vast majority of free cash flow after capital spending being returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. 
First, we're increasing our dividend per share by 7% beginning with our June 2015 payment to $2.81 on an annualized basis. This represents the 43rd consecutive year of annual dividend increase and at approximately 60% payout ratio based on the 2014 core EPS. 
At yesterday's closing stock price, it represents a 2.9% yield and will bring our 10-year annualized dividend per share compound annual growth rate to 10%. And we expect to return an additional $4.5 billion to $5 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases. While doing so, we expect to maintain Tier 1 commercial paper access, enabling us to retain low-cost, highly accessible financing. 
So combined, these actions will result in cash returns to shareholders of $8.5 billion to $9 billion and will bring our cumulative 10-year cash returns to shareholders to $65 billion. As many of you know, we have stated disciplined capital allocation as a top priority for our management and our board, and we trust these actions will again be seen by our shareholders as tangible evidence of this commitment."

Before we open it up to questions, I want to take this opportunity to share with you how excited we are to be entering 2015 despite the challenges that we face because this year marks the 50th anniversary of the coming together of Pepsi and Frito-Lay in 1965, which set the foundation for what is today one of the world's most iconic and successful companies. 
This year, we celebrate 5 decades of growing our business and creating substantial value for our shareholders, customers, consumers and communities. It was a phenomenal vision of Don Kendall and Herman Lay, the architects of this combination, which set the stage to grow from $510 million in revenue in 1965 to almost $67 billion today. 
Of the companies in the Fortune 500 in 1965, just 79 remain today. And over this time frame, we've generated extraordinary shareholder returns. In fact, $100 investment in PepsiCo in 1965 with dividends reinvested would be worth over $42,000 today. 
But PepsiCo's success over the past 50 years has not happened by chance. It happened because throughout our history, PepsiCo has repeatedly adapted and retooled, always with an eye to the future. More importantly, we have kept integrity at the heart of all we do, running the company responsibly to generate sustainable long-term value. And this is the formula for success that our current team will continue to apply. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

Then from a capital perspective, each of the last couple of years, we've started with a budget of somewhere between 4% and 5%, and each of those years, we've landed at a little bit over 4%. The reason for that is we really do apply quite a bit of rigor to the investments that we're making. We're not afraid to invest in long-term growth, quite the opposite. I would argue both in R&D and in capital, we have been investing in long-term growth. The focus here is sustainable value creation, and I think with the reinvestment rates we have right now, we will be able to deliver that sustainably."

In fact, the playbook moved from Mexico from a few years ago to Venezuela today or Brazil from a few years ago to Venezuela, now to Russia. So this playbook is now becoming quite important, as we navigate through commodity volatility -- I'm sorry, currency volatility and economic volatility. So each country, it's the team that has to balance pricing, the elasticity in that marketplace and how much cost controls they can put in place. So that taken together, you deliver whatever we have agreed with them is the right financial profile for that market. Is there anything else you want to add, Hugh?"

And as Indra said, the rest of it we tend to handle through restructuring and productivity initiatives and things like that. Russia's obviously a more profound example of that, but I think the rules of thumb will generally apply in that regard. But what it leads you to more broadly is the power of the PepsiCo integrated food and beverage portfolio and the size of the geographic portfolio. As a few developing and emerging markets run into challenges such as Russia, such as Venezuela, we also have markets like India, markets like Turkey that are performing very well. And as a result, the PepsiCo portfolio and the scale that food and beverage brings in each of those countries actually works quite well."

What happens is that in certain regions of the world, we shift the A&M depending on what kind of return we're getting for A&M spending. But more importantly, we will focus a lot, Ali, on working versus nonworking spending. We are shifting a lot more to consumer-facing programs, and that's really what we were talking about because we believe that the more we focus on shifting the spending to working A&M away from sort of G&A-type A&M, the more bang for the buck we get. So in every part of the world, we are trying to put in place playbooks and best practices to increase the A&M that's consumer facing. So overall, for the company again, as we've said many times, we are holding to the A&M as a percentage of sales, but where we see an opportunity to increase it, we look for ways to reallocate it and at every moment we measure the return on investment on our marketing spend.

For the year, we had marketing spend equal to the rate of sales growth. So we held as we committed to at the beginning of the year. For the quarter, A&M grew faster than sales. So A&M as a percent of sales went up in the quarter, and obviously, that was a bit of a margin drag in the quarter. Regarding your question comparing us to other companies in terms of our ability to equalize revenue in earnings FX impacts, I can't speak to what other companies are or aren't doing. What I can tell you is number one, we do hedge transaction out several months. It varies from country to country based on what's economic. As you know, in developing and emerging markets, the hedges tend to get expensive when you go out more than a couple of months. So we make good economic decisions in that regard. Number two, I suspect the difference between us and most of our peer set is more of our costs are likely localized because we do produce in so many countries. Our products don't ship as well as in particular HPC-type companies. So I suspect that may be the difference, but I don't know that for a fact because I haven't studied their cost structures that closely."

One is just the fact that our products don't tend to last as long as perhaps other packaged goods companies products but the [indiscernible] off factor matters. So it's difficult for people to pre-buy very far in advance for a lot of our products. That combined with the DSD system enables us to manage that. So we didn't see -- we don't think of big impact from that perspective. Frito-Lay, obviously, we did see good performance in the quarter. We expect continued momentum out of Frito-Lay. In terms of the impact of gas prices, I think what we see happening is consistent with what we've seen in the past, which is it takes a number of months before the consumer fully spends back the so-called benefit from lower gas prices. I think you're going to see that over the course of 6 to 8 months rather than an immediate change in consumer behavior. It's just sort of assimilates over time. I am optimistic from the perspective that consumers right now, their personal balance sheets are pretty healthy. Most consumers have delevered pretty well. So as a result of that, I do think that money will make its way back into the marketplace and as a company that sells more than a small amount of products through G stores and C stores, I think we'll benefit from it."

We performed w",1597,"Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with our results for the quarter and for the full year, especially in light of the significant macroeconomic volatility being experienced in so many markets around the world. We performed well in this challenging environment, largely on the strength of our brand and product portfolios and diversity of our geographic footprint. 
So while certain markets were hit with political disruptions, economic downturn or significant currency devaluation, other markets in our portfolio not experiencing these issues were able to offset their impact to deliver overall strong results. We made a lot of progress in 2014, and I'd like to recap some of those achievements, starting with our financial performance. 
I'm pleased to report that we met or exceeded each of the targets we communicated at the beginning of the year. Organic revenue grew 4% for the full year and 5% in the fourth quarter. Core gross and operating margins expanded for the quarter and the full year. We delivered our productivity target for the year. Free cash flow exceeded $8 billion.
Our focus on capital allocation discipline resulted in another year of significant core net ROIC improvement. We increased our annual dividend for the 42nd consecutive year. And we returned $8.7 billion in total to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, which is a 36% increase over 2013. 
Just as importantly, we strengthened the foundations of our company. First, we continued to invest in our portfolio of iconic global brands. In 2014, we sustained our increased A&M investment and focused our spending on our biggest brands. Additionally, we increased the impact of our investment by directing more of the spending to consumer-facing activity. 
We launched our largest ever global campaign for our 2 biggest brands, Pepsi and Lay's, with coordinated package graphics, use of sports and entertainment properties, point-of-sale material, ad copy and promotions. We expanded our engagement in social and digital marketing. For example, Doritos Crash the Super Bowl received nearly 5,000 consumer submissions from 29 countries around the world, and our Lay's Do Us A Flavor campaign garnered more than 14 million submissions. Programs like these drive phenomenal consumer engagement, are highly complementary to our broader marketing efforts and are extremely financially efficient. 
Our investments are translating to tangible results, with solid improvement in brand equity scores and market share performance in our priority markets for our global brands. 
Second, we continue to strengthen our innovation engine. We've built a robust and sustainable innovation pipeline, perhaps the strongest in our history. 
Over the past 2 years, innovation as a percentage of total net revenue has climbed by 150 basis points and now stands at 9%, and we're innovating across our portfolio. For example, to meet the growing demand for nutritious products, we introduced Naked Juice's Kale Blazer and Gatorade's new Whey Protein Bars. 
We bolstered our foodservice business with the introduction of Pepsi Spire fountain equipment in over 30 markets, giving our customers a choice of flexible and cost-effective equipment and allowing our consumers to create more than 1,000 customized beverages with just a touch of a screen. In snacks, we leveraged our global scale by lifting and shifting successful new products like Doritos JACKED and Deep Ridged Chips from the United States into a number of international markets. 
And as a testament to the durability of our innovation, a number of our recent product introductions like Tostitos Cantina, Mountain Dew Kickstart and Pure Leaf generated double-digit estimated annual retail sales growth in 2014 after achieving over $100 million in their launch year. So that's innovation. 
Third, we stepped up our marketplace execution. As evidence: in 2014, we were the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth among all food and beverage manufacturers. Based on IRI data, in all measured channels, we contributed nearly $1 billion of retail sales growth, more than the combined sales growth of the next 27 largest manufacturers. 
In foodservice, we executed customized Better Together programs like the pairing of Doritos Loaded and Mountain Dew solo fare -- Solar Flare, and we secured attractive new businesses such as the Disney Park in Shanghai, leveraging the strength of our combined beverage and snack portfolio. 
Fourth, we've taken productivity to a new level. We successfully completed our 3-year, $3 billion productivity program launched in 2012, and we're entering our next phase of productivity with the new 5-year, $5 billion program. And we have a robust pipeline of productivity projects focused on increasing efficiency through automation, optimizing our global manufacturing footprint, advancing the competitiveness of our go-to-market models and utilizing shared services. These programs collectively are geared to deliver our targeted savings of approximately $1 billion per year through 2019. 
At the same time, we have significantly evolved our organization structure and operating model to enable us to more fully capitalize on our scale, global presence and deep capabilities. 
And lastly, we've driven increased capital allocation discipline throughout the organization to drive higher returns of investment and increase cash returns to our shareholders. 
So that's a summary at a high level of our accomplishments. So let me comment briefly on the performance highlights by business sector, starting with the Americas. 
PepsiCo Americas Beverages had a terrific fourth quarter. 3% organic revenue growth translated to 11% core constant currency operating profit growth. The profit growth is especially notable, given the fact that we also increased A&M in the quarter by high single digits. 
We have seen the business gain momentum behind the efforts we've been making in marketing, innovation and execution. And this has resulted in not only improved financial results but better marketplace performance too, especially in our largest market, the United States. 
Clearly, our Latin American beverage business has had its challenges with the Mexico tax and deteriorating macros in Venezuela. Despite these challenges, our Latin American beverage business was a positive contributor to PAB's overall organic top line and core constant currency bottom line results. 
Frito-Lay North America delivered strong performance. Frito delivered 3% organic revenue growth for the full year and 3.5% in the fourth quarter and 6% core constant currency operating profit growth, both for the quarter and the full year. Market share results have shown steady improvement, and we gained savory snack value share in the fourth quarter. 
Latin America Foods performance, both for the quarter and full year, were solid. For the full year, Latin American Foods delivered 10% organic revenue growth and 9% core constant currency operating profit growth. 
Quaker Foods North America performed well within some challenged categories. Despite the category challenges, core constant currency operating profit was up 8% in the quarter, and we gained value share for the full year in each of our core categories: hot cereal, ready-to-eat cereal and snack bars. So very strong performance by our businesses based in the Americas and in the U.S., in particular. 
As I mentioned earlier, our portfolio collectively was the largest contributor to retail food and beverage growth in the United States, both in the quarter and for the full year. And this is a distinction we are very proud of. 
Moving across to Europe. As you know, the majority of our European business is located in Eastern Europe and Russia, in particular. Clearly, the currency picture and macros in Russia have made operations more challenging. While the Russian consumer has been quite resilient, at least for our business, the currency situation has led to significant inflation because of the transaction ForEx on the materials we source from outside of Russia, resulting in significant input cost inflation. 
Despite these significant headwinds, Europe generated full year gains in volume, organic revenue and core constant currency operating profit. So all things considered, solid performance for Europe. 
And lastly, AMEA. Again, good result despite some political macro volatility in many parts of the region. For both the quarter and the year, we had solid volume and organic revenue gains while full year operating profit performance was impacted by efficiency investments made in 2014 and by lapping the Vietnam refranchising gains we had in 2013. 
Most of the global volatility has been concentrated in the developing and emerging markets. However, as a group, even our developing and emerging markets grew organic revenue 10% in the quarter and 9% for the full year. So they continue to be major contributors to our growth. 
As I mentioned earlier, we have a terrific geographic portfolio, and this allows us to balance challenges and opportunities in a way that tends to produce consistently good results overall. And we believe the fourth quarter and full year 2014 results are a reflection of this. 
Now Hugh will take you through the financial guidance in some detail in just a minute, but I want to highlight just a few key points. As an operating company, we absolutely manage the things that are within our control: marketing, innovation, marketplace execution and productivity. And we expect to continue to perform well in these areas. However, we expect to face continued headwinds related to macros, in particular, weak currencies in a number of our key markets and the impact of low oil prices in countries whose economies are highly dependent on energy. Obviously, these are outside our control, but we adjust the businesses to weather through the challenges as best as we can by controlling costs, adjusting our raw material sourcing and executing balanced pricing actions. As we balance all these factors, we've concluded that our outlook for 2014 will be within our long-term financial goals. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh?"

We targeted mid-single",1050,"Thanks, Indra, and good morning, everyone. I'll start it with a recap of the financial scorecard for 2014 and then move on to 2015 guidance. 
We're pleased to report that we met or exceeded each of our financial goals for the year. We targeted mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, and we delivered 4%. We targeted core operating margin improvement, and it increased by 30 basis points. We targeted $1 billion in productivity savings, and we delivered it. We targeted 7% core constant currency EPS growth with our initial guidance and delivered 9%, which is right in line with the increased target we communicated to you in October. 
We targeted core net ROIC improvement and delivered 110 basis points. Our core net ROIC now stands at 17.5%. We targeted free cash flow of more than $7 billion and delivered $8.3 billion. And we committed to return $8.7 billion of cash to shareholders, which is what we did. 
So overall, good performance, meeting or exceeding each of the targets we communicated at the beginning of 2014. We're particularly pleased with our cash flow management. Our free cash flow as a percent of our core net income exceeded 100% for the year and over the past 3 years. So we are converting earnings to free cash flow very efficiently. 
Two big contributors to this performance are: first, the discipline and productivity we have on capital spending, where we've successfully held CapEx to less than 5% of net revenue since 2012; and second, the improvement we've driven in working capital, where we've shortened the cash conversion cycle by 50% over the past 3 years and have generated cash from working capital of over $2 billion in aggregate over the past 3 years. And it's this strong cash generation that is enabling us to provide attractive shareholder cash returns. 
Let me spend a few minutes discussing our outlook for 2015, which is in line with our long-term objectives. We expect another year of mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. We expect core operating margin expansion, as organic top line growth and productivity should offset negative geographic mix and cost inflation. 
Below the division operating profit line, we expect corporate cost to be down, an approximately 25% core tax rate and a reduced share count. All-in, we expect core constant currency EPS growth of 7%. 
Foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact revenue and core earnings per share by approximately 7 percentage points each, based on current market consensus rates. As you saw in the release, during the fourth quarter of 2014, we adopted the SICAD I rate of VEF 12 per U.S. dollar, and we assumed this same exchange rate for 2015. The currency exchange picture in Venezuela continues to be quite volatile, so I wanted to be absolutely transparent about what we have assumed in our 2015 guidance. 
Putting it all together, taking our core 2014 EPS of $4.63 and applying our guidance implies 2015 core EPS of approximately $4.63 as well. Our outlook appropriately factors in both tailwinds and headwinds. To the positive, we expect to generate approximately $1 billion of productivity savings in 2015, which will offset operating cost inflation. We feel very good about our innovation agenda, which should enable us to sustain our organic revenue growth rate. 
Our share count will benefit from continued share repurchases, although we won't recognize the full benefit of 2015 repurchases within 2015, as they'll be made throughout the year with some of the impact of the share count reduction falling into 2016. Our core tax rate is estimated to come in for the full year at approximately 25%, even with 2014, and we expect to be able to sustain this rate for the foreseeable future. 
In terms of headwinds, we anticipate commodity cost inflation in the low single digits. Keep in mind that because of our forward-buying strategies, our commodity cost changes will lag what you see in the spot market. I believe our expected inflation rate is a bit higher than the number -- what a number of you have modeled, and this is because we are seeing more pronounced inflation in our nonmarket traded commodities, including certain packaging and agricultural raw materials. 
In addition, we will see an inflation impact from transaction ForEx in many of the markets whose currencies have weakened against the dollar. And foreign exchange translation will be a significant drag on our U.S. dollar earnings. 
Finally, as you model out the quarters for 2015, please note that a number of our international market's currencies significantly weakened in the back half of 2014, so the currency laps are most difficult in the first 2 quarters. 
Our long-term goals remain intact: mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, core operating margins expanding 30 to 50 basis points per year, high single-digit core constant-currency EPS growth, free cash flow growing roughly in line with earnings and core net ROIC improving 50 basis points per year. 
We intend to responsibly manage the business for top line growth, drive productivity and reinvest appropriately to position PepsiCo for sustainable growth for the long term. And we plan to remain highly disciplined toward capital allocation with the vast majority of free cash flow after capital spending being returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. 
First, we're increasing our dividend per share by 7% beginning with our June 2015 payment to $2.81 on an annualized basis. This represents the 43rd consecutive year of annual dividend increase and an approximately 60% payout ratio based on the 2014 core EPS. 
At yesterday's closing stock price, it represents a 2.9% yield and will bring our 10-year annualized dividend-per-share compound annual growth rate to 10%. And we expect to return an additional $4.5 billion to $5 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases. While doing so, we expect to maintain Tier 1 commercial paper access, enabling us to retain low-cost, highly accessible financing. 
So combined, these actions will result in cash returns to shareholders of $8.5 billion to $9 billion and will bring our cumulative 10-year cash returns to shareholders to $65 billion. As many of you know, we have stated disciplined capital allocation as a top priority for our management and our board, and we trust these actions will again be seen by our shareholders as tangible evidence of this commitment."

Before we open it up to questions, I want to take this opportunity to share with you how excited we are to be entering 2015, despite the challenges that we face, because this year marks the 50th anniversary of the coming together of Pepsi and Frito-Lay in 1965, which set the foundation for what is today one of the world's most iconic and successful companies. 
This year, we celebrate 5 decades of growing our business and creating substantial value for our shareholders, customers, consumers and communities. It was the phenomenal vision of Don Kendall and Herman Lay, the architects of this combination, which set the stage to grow from $510 million in revenue in 1965 to almost $67 billion today. 
Of the companies in the Fortune 500 in 1965, just 79 remain today. And over this time frame, we've generated extraordinary shareholder returns. In fact, $100 investment in PepsiCo in 1965 with dividends reinvested would be worth over $42,000 today. 
But PepsiCo's success over the past 50 years has not happened by chance. It happened because throughout our history, PepsiCo has repeatedly adapted and retooled, always with an eye to the future. More importantly, we have kept integrity at the heart of all we do, running the company responsibly to generate sustainable long-term value. And this is the formula for success that our current team will continue to apply. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

Then from a capital perspective, each of the last couple of years, we've started with a budget of somewhere between 4% and 5%, and each of those years, we've landed at a little bit over 4%. The reason for that is we really do apply quite a bit of rigor to the investments that we're making. We're not afraid to invest in long-term growth, quite the opposite. I would argue both in R&D and in capital, we have been investing in long-term growth.

The rest we'll drive through restructuring and productivity. Regarding the transaction impact on commodities inflation, we talked about the fact that we are at low single digits for commodities inflation. About 40% to 50% of that is driven by transaction FX."

I think on the marketing spend, overall, if you look at our A&M as a percentage of sales, we said we're going to hold it at 5.9% of sales, and we're staying with that number. What happens is that in certain regions of the world, we shift the A&M depending on what kind of return we're getting for A&M spending. But more importantly, we will focus a lot, Ali, on working versus nonworking spending. We are shifting a lot more to consumer-facing programs, and that's really what we were talking about. Because we believe that the more we focus on shifting the spending to working A&M away from sort of G&A-type A&M, the more bang for the buck we get. So in every part of the world, we are trying to put in place playbooks and best practices to increase the A&M that's consumer-facing. So overall, for the company again, as we've said many times, we are holding to the A&M as a percentage of sales, but where we see an opportunity to increase it, we look for ways to reallocate it and at every moment we measure the return on investment on our marketing spend.

For the year, we had marketing spend equal to the rate of sales growth. So we held as we committed to at the beginning of the year. For the quarter, A&M grew faster than sales. So A&M as a percent of sales went up in the quarter, and obviously, that was a bit of a margin drag in the quarter. Regarding your question comparing us to other companies in terms of our ability to equalize revenue and earnings FX impacts, I can't speak to what other companies are or aren't doing. What I can tell you is, number one, we do hedge transaction out several months. It varies from country to country based on what's economic. As you know, in developing and emerging markets, the hedges tend to get expensive when you go out more than a couple of months. So we make good economic decisions in that regard. Number two, I suspect the difference between us and most of our peer set is more of our costs are likely localized. Because we do produce in so many countries, our products don't ship as well as in particular HPC-type companies. So I suspect that may be the difference, but I don't know that for a fact because I haven't studied their cost structures that closely."

Two things obviously work in our favor in that regard. One is just the fact that our products don't tend to last as long as perhaps other packaged goods companies products, the stale [ph] off factor matter. So it's difficult for people to pre-buy very far in advance for a lot of our products. That combined with the DSD system enables us to manage that. So we didn't see, we don't think, a big impact from that perspective. Frito-Lay, obviously, we did see good performance in the quarter. We expect continued momentum out of Frito-Lay. In terms of the impact of gas prices, I think what we see happening is consistent with what we've seen in the past, which is it takes a number of months before the consumer fully spends back the so-called benefit from lower gas prices. I think you're going to see that over the course of 6 to 8 months rather than an immediate change in consumer behavior. It's just sort of assimilates over time. I am optimistic from the perspective that consumers right now, their personal balance sheets are pretty healthy. Most consumers have delevered pretty well. So as a result of that, I do think that money will make its way back into the marketplace and as a company that sells more than a small amount of products through G stores and C stores, I think we'll benefit from it."

We performed w",1597,"Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with our results for the quarter and for the full year, especially in light of the significant macroeconomic volatility being experienced in so many markets around the world. We performed well in this challenging environment, largely on the strength of our brand and product portfolios and diversity of our geographic footprint. 
So while certain markets were hit with political disruptions, economic downturn or significant currency devaluation, other markets in our portfolio not experiencing these issues were able to offset their impact to deliver overall strong results. We made a lot of progress in 2014, and I'd like to recap some of those achievements, starting with our financial performance. 
I'm pleased to report that we met or exceeded each of the targets we communicated at the beginning of the year. Organic revenue grew 4% for the full year and 5% in the fourth quarter. Core gross and operating margins expanded for the quarter and the full year. We delivered our productivity target for the year. Free cash flow exceeded $8 billion.
Our focus on capital allocation discipline resulted in another year of significant core net ROIC improvement. We increased our annual dividend for the 42nd consecutive year. And we returned $8.7 billion in total to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, which is a 36% increase over 2013. 
Just as importantly, we strengthened the foundations of our company. First, we continued to invest in our portfolio of iconic global brands. In 2014, we sustained our increased A&M investment and focused our spending on our biggest brands. Additionally, we increased the impact of our investment by directing more of the spending to consumer-facing activity. 
We launched our largest ever global campaign for our 2 biggest brands, Pepsi and Lay's, with coordinated package graphics, use of sports and entertainment properties, point-of-sale material, ad copy and promotions. We expanded our engagement in social and digital marketing. For example, Doritos Crash the Super Bowl received nearly 5,000 consumer submissions from 29 countries around the world, and our Lay's Do Us A Flavor campaign garnered more than 14 million submissions. Programs like these drive phenomenal consumer engagement, are highly complementary to our broader marketing efforts and are extremely financially efficient. 
Our investments are translating to tangible results, with solid improvement in brand equity scores and market share performance in our priority markets for our global brands. 
Second, we continue to strengthen our innovation engine. We've built a robust and sustainable innovation pipeline, perhaps the strongest in our history. 
Over the past 2 years, innovation as a percentage of total net revenue has climbed by 150 basis points and now stands at 9%, and we're innovating across our portfolio. For example, to meet the growing demand for nutritious products, we introduced Naked Juice's Kale Blazer and Gatorade's new Whey Protein Bars. 
We bolstered our foodservice business with the introduction of Pepsi Spire fountain equipment in over 30 markets, giving our customers a choice of flexible and cost-effective equipment and allowing our consumers to create more than 1,000 customized beverages with just a touch of a screen. In snacks, we leveraged our global scale by lifting and shifting successful new products like Doritos JACKED and Deep Ridged Chips from the United States into a number of international markets. 
And as a testament to the durability of our innovation, a number of our recent product introductions like Tostitos Cantina, Mountain Dew Kickstart and Pure Leaf generated double-digit estimated annual retail sales growth in 2014 after achieving over $100 million in their launch year. So that's innovation. 
Third, we stepped up our marketplace execution. As evidence: in 2014, we were the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth among all food and beverage manufacturers. Based on IRI data, in all measured channels, we contributed nearly $1 billion of retail sales growth, more than the combined sales growth of the next 27 largest manufacturers. 
In foodservice, we executed customized Better Together programs like the pairing of Doritos Loaded and Mountain Dew solo fare -- Solar Flare, and we secured attractive new businesses such as the Disney Park in Shanghai, leveraging the strength of our combined beverage and snack portfolio. 
Fourth, we've taken productivity to a new level. We successfully completed our 3-year, $3 billion productivity program launched in 2012, and we're entering our next phase of productivity with the new 5-year, $5 billion program. And we have a robust pipeline of productivity projects focused on increasing efficiency through automation, optimizing our global manufacturing footprint, advancing the competitiveness of our go-to-market models and utilizing shared services. These programs collectively are geared to deliver our targeted savings of approximately $1 billion per year through 2019. 
At the same time, we have significantly evolved our organization structure and operating model to enable us to more fully capitalize on our scale, global presence and deep capabilities. 
And lastly, we've driven increased capital allocation discipline throughout the organization to drive higher returns of investment and increase cash returns to our shareholders. 
So that's a summary at a high level of our accomplishments. So let me comment briefly on the performance highlights by business sector, starting with the Americas. 
PepsiCo Americas Beverages had a terrific fourth quarter. 3% organic revenue growth translated to 11% core constant currency operating profit growth. The profit growth is especially notable, given the fact that we also increased A&M in the quarter by high single digits. 
We have seen the business gain momentum behind the efforts we've been making in marketing, innovation and execution. And this has resulted in not only improved financial results but better marketplace performance too, especially in our largest market, the United States. 
Clearly, our Latin American beverage business has had its challenges with the Mexico tax and deteriorating macros in Venezuela. Despite these challenges, our Latin American beverage business was a positive contributor to PAB's overall organic top line and core constant currency bottom line results. 
Frito-Lay North America delivered strong performance. Frito delivered 3% organic revenue growth for the full year and 3.5% in the fourth quarter and 6% core constant currency operating profit growth, both for the quarter and the full year. Market share results have shown steady improvement, and we gained savory snack value share in the fourth quarter. 
Latin America Foods performance, both for the quarter and full year, were solid. For the full year, Latin American Foods delivered 10% organic revenue growth and 9% core constant currency operating profit growth. 
Quaker Foods North America performed well within some challenged categories. Despite the category challenges, core constant currency operating profit was up 8% in the quarter, and we gained value share for the full year in each of our core categories: hot cereal, ready-to-eat cereal and snack bars. So very strong performance by our businesses based in the Americas and in the U.S., in particular. 
As I mentioned earlier, our portfolio collectively was the largest contributor to retail food and beverage growth in the United States, both in the quarter and for the full year. And this is a distinction we are very proud of. 
Moving across to Europe. As you know, the majority of our European business is located in Eastern Europe and Russia, in particular. Clearly, the currency picture and macros in Russia have made operations more challenging. While the Russian consumer has been quite resilient, at least for our business, the currency situation has led to significant inflation because of the transaction ForEx on the materials we source from outside of Russia, resulting in significant input cost inflation. 
Despite these significant headwinds, Europe generated full year gains in volume, organic revenue and core constant currency operating profit. So all things considered, solid performance for Europe. 
And lastly, AMEA. Again, good result despite some political macro volatility in many parts of the region. For both the quarter and the year, we had solid volume and organic revenue gains while full year operating profit performance was impacted by efficiency investments made in 2014 and by lapping the Vietnam refranchising gains we had in 2013. 
Most of the global volatility has been concentrated in the developing and emerging markets. However, as a group, even our developing and emerging markets grew organic revenue 10% in the quarter and 9% for the full year. So they continue to be major contributors to our growth. 
As I mentioned earlier, we have a terrific geographic portfolio, and this allows us to balance challenges and opportunities in a way that tends to produce consistently good results overall. And we believe the fourth quarter and full year 2014 results are a reflection of this. 
Now Hugh will take you through the financial guidance in some detail in just a minute, but I want to highlight just a few key points. As an operating company, we absolutely manage the things that are within our control: marketing, innovation, marketplace execution and productivity. And we expect to continue to perform well in these areas. However, we expect to face continued headwinds related to macros, in particular, weak currencies in a number of our key markets and the impact of low oil prices in countries whose economies are highly dependent on energy. Obviously, these are outside our control, but we adjust the businesses to weather through the challenges as best as we can by controlling costs, adjusting our raw material sourcing and executing balanced pricing actions. As we balance all these factors, we've concluded that our outlook for 2014 will be within our long-term financial goals. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh?"

We're pleased to report that we met or exceeded each of our financial goals for the year. We targeted mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, and we delivered 4%. We targeted core operating margin improvement, and it increased by 30 basis points. We targeted $1 billion in productivity savings, and we delivered it. We targeted 7% core constant currency EPS growth with our initial guidance and delivered 9%, which is right in line with the increased target we communicated to you in October. 
We targeted core net ROIC improvement and delivered 110 basis points. Our core net ROIC now stands at 17.5%. We targeted free cash flow of more than $7 billion and delivered $8.3 billion. And we committed to return $8.7 billion of cash to shareholders, which is what we did. 
So overall, good performance, meeting or exceeding each of the targets we communicated at the beginning of 2014. We're particularly pleased with our cash flow management. Our free cash flow as a percent of our core net income exceeded 100% for the year and over the past 3 years. So we are converting earnings to free cash flow very efficiently. 
Two big contributors to this performance are: first, the discipline and productivity we have on capital spending, where we've successfully held CapEx to less than 5% of net revenue since 2012; and second, the improvement we've driven in working capital, where we've shortened the cash conversion cycle by 50% over the past 3 years and have generated cash from working capital of over $2 billion in aggregate over the past 3 years. And it's this strong cash generation that is enabling us to provide attractive shareholder cash returns. 
Let me spend a few minutes discussing our outlook for 2015, which is in line with our long-term objectives. We expect another year of mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. We expect core operating margin expansion, as organic top line growth and productivity should offset negative geographic mix and cost inflation. 
Below the division operating profit line, we expect corporate cost to be down, an approximately 25% core tax rate and a reduced share count. All-in, we expect core constant currency EPS growth of 7%. 
Foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact revenue and core earnings per share by approximately 7 percentage points each, based on current market consensus rates. As you saw in the release, during the fourth quarter of 2014, we adopted the SICAD I rate of VEF 12 per U.S. dollar, and we assumed this same exchange rate for 2015. The currency exchange picture in Venezuela continues to be quite volatile, so I wanted to be absolutely transparent about what we have assumed in our 2015 guidance. 
Putting it all together, taking our core 2014 EPS of $4.63 and applying our guidance implies 2015 core EPS of approximately $4.63 as well. Our outlook appropriately factors in both tailwinds and headwinds. To the positive, we expect to generate approximately $1 billion of productivity savings in 2015, which will offset operating cost inflation. We feel very good about our innovation agenda, which should enable us to sustain our organic revenue growth rate. 
Our share count will benefit from continued share repurchases, although we won't recognize the full benefit of 2015 repurchases within 2015, as they'll be made throughout the year with some of the impact of the share count reduction falling into 2016. Our core tax rate is estimated to come in for the full year at approximately 25%, even with 2014, and we expect to be able to sustain this rate for the foreseeable future. 
In terms of headwinds, we anticipate commodity cost inflation in the low single digits. Keep in mind that because of our forward-buying strategies, our commodity cost changes will lag what you see in the spot market. I believe our expected inflation rate is a bit higher than the number -- what a number of you have modeled, and this is because we are seeing more pronounced inflation in our nonmarket traded commodities, including certain packaging and agricultural raw materials. 
In addition, we will see an inflation impact from transaction ForEx in many of the markets whose currencies have weakened against the dollar. And foreign exchange translation will be a significant drag on our U.S. dollar earnings. 
Finally, as you model out the quarters for 2015, please note that a number of our international market's currencies significantly weakened in the back half of 2014, so the currency laps are most difficult in the first 2 quarters. 
Our long-term goals remain intact: mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, core operating margins expanding 30 to 50 basis points per year, high single-digit core constant-currency EPS growth, free cash flow growing roughly in line with earnings and core net ROIC improving 50 basis points per year. 
We intend to responsibly manage the business for top line growth, drive productivity and reinvest appropriately to position PepsiCo for sustainable growth for the long term. And we plan to remain highly disciplined toward capital allocation with the vast majority of free cash flow after capital spending being returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. 
First, we're increasing our dividend per share by 7% beginning with our June 2015 payment to $2.81 on an annualized basis. This represents the 43rd consecutive year of annual dividend increase and an approximately 60% payout ratio based on the 2014 core EPS. 
At yesterday's closing stock price, it represents a 2.9% yield and will bring our 10-year annualized dividend-per-share compound annual growth rate to 10%. And we expect to return an additional $4.5 billion to $5 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases. While doing so, we expect to maintain Tier 1 commercial paper access, enabling us to retain low-cost, highly accessible financing. 
So combined, these actions will result in cash returns to shareholders of $8.5 billion to $9 billion and will bring our cumulative 10-year cash returns to shareholders to $65 billion. As many of you know, we have stated disciplined capital allocation as a top priority for our management and our board, and we trust these actions will again be seen by our shareholders as tangible evidence of this commitment."

Before we open it up to questions, I want to take this opportunity to share with you how excited we are to be entering 2015, despite the challenges that we face, because this year marks the 50th anniversary of the coming together of Pepsi and Frito-Lay in 1965, which set the foundation for what is today one of the world's most iconic and successful companies. 
This year, we celebrate 5 decades of growing our business and creating substantial value for our shareholders, customers, consumers and communities. It was the phenomenal vision of Don Kendall and Herman Lay, the architects of this combination, which set the stage to grow from $510 million in revenue in 1965 to almost $67 billion today. 
Of the companies in the Fortune 500 in 1965, just 79 remain today. And over this time frame, we've generated extraordinary shareholder returns. In fact, $100 investment in PepsiCo in 1965 with dividends reinvested would be worth over $42,000 today. 
But PepsiCo's success over the past 50 years has not happened by chance. It happened because throughout our history, PepsiCo has repeatedly adapted and retooled, always with an eye to the future. More importantly, we have kept integrity at the heart of all we do, running the company responsibly to generate sustainable long-term value. And this is the formula for success that our current team will continue to apply. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

I think on the marketing spend, overall, if you look at our A&M as a percentage of sales, we said we're going to hold it at 5.9% of sales, and we're staying with that number. What happens is that in certain regions of the world, we shift the A&M depending on what kind of return we're getting for A&M spending. But more importantly, we will focus a lot, Ali, on working versus nonworking spending. We are shifting a lot more to consumer-facing programs, and that's really what we were talking about. Because we believe that the more we focus on shifting the spending to working A&M away from sort of G&A-type A&M, the more bang for the buck we get. So in every part of the world, we are trying to put in place playbooks and best practices to increase the A&M that's consumer-facing. So overall, for the company again, as we've said many times, we are holding to the A&M as a percentage of sales, but where we see an opportunity to increase it, we look for ways to reallocate it and at every moment we measure the return on investment on our marketing spend. So with that, let me turn to Hugh to talk about the currencies in the top and the bottom line."

For the year, we had marketing spend equal to the rate of sales growth. So we held as we committed to at the beginning of the year. For the quarter, A&M grew faster than sales. So A&M as a percent of sales went up in the quarter, and obviously, that was a bit of a margin drag in the quarter. Regarding your question comparing us to other companies in terms of our ability to equalize revenue and earnings FX impacts, I can't speak to what other companies are or aren't doing. What I can tell you is, number one, we do hedge transaction out several months. It varies from country to country based on what's economic. As you know, in developing and emerging markets, the hedges tend to get expensive when you go out more than a couple of months. So we make good economic decisions in that regard. Number two, I suspect the difference between us and most of our peer set is more of our costs are likely localized. Because we do produce in so many countries, our products don't ship as well as in particular HPC-type companies. So I suspect that may be the difference, but I don't know that for a fact because I haven't studied their cost structures that closely."

Two things obviously work in our favor in that regard. One is just the fact that our products don't tend to last as long as perhaps other packaged goods companies products, the stale [ph] off factor matter. So it's difficult for people to pre-buy very far in advance for a lot of our products. That combined with the DSD system enables us to manage that. So we didn't see, we don't think, a big impact from that perspective. Frito-Lay, obviously, we did see good performance in the quarter. We expect continued momentum out of Frito-Lay. In terms of the impact of gas prices, I think what we see happening is consistent with what we've seen in the past, which is it takes a number of months before the consumer fully spends back the so-called benefit from lower gas prices. I think you're going to see that over the course of 6 to 8 months rather than an immediate change in consumer behavior. It's just sort of assimilates over time. I am optimistic from the perspective that consumers right now, their personal balance sheets are pretty healthy. Most consumers have delevered pretty well. So as a result of that, I do think that money will make its way back into the marketplace and as a company that sells more than a small amount of products through G stores and C stores, I think we'll benefit from it."

I'm pleased with our performance in the first quarter of 2015.

I'm pleased with our performance in the first quarter of 2015. Our focus on innovation, brand-building and market-based execution, funded in part by our productivity initiatives, continues to drive solid fundamental business performance. 
In the first quarter, organic revenue grew 4.4%, with global snacks up 7% and global beverages up 1.5%. And core gross margins improved by 150 basis points. 
Excluding the impairment charge and gains Jamie mentioned, core operating margin improved by 65 basis points, core constant-currency operating profit grew 11%, and core constant-currency EPS grew 16%. However, foreign exchange headwinds persist. We have and we'll continue to take actions to manage to the current volatile macroeconomic environment by taking responsible pricing actions, tightly controlling costs and optimizing our global sourcing to minimize and mitigate the impacts of the current foreign exchange challenges. 
I am particularly pleased with the level of effective pricing we're achieving especially in global beverages, where we realized 3 points of effective net pricing. At the same time, we will not let cyclical macroeconomic issues divert us from our focus to drive sustainable shareholder value creation. We intend to continue to invest across our markets and brands to generate organic revenue growth, drive greater efficiency and productivity, deliver attractive free cash flow and cash returns to shareholders and enhance our returns on invested capital. 
The power of our portfolio of products and brands and the strength of our geographic footprint have enabled us to consistently meet or exceed our financial goals and more importantly, give us confidence in the future prospects for our business. 
As you know, in June this year, we celebrate the 50th anniversary of PepsiCo, which is a coming together of Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay. As we celebrate this milestone, we look back on our journey with pride. 
In 1965, our annual revenue was $510 million. Today, it stands over $66 billion. The $100 investment in PepsiCo stock in 1965 was worth nearly $43,000 at the end of 2014, a compound annual total shareholder return of over 13%, far outpacing the S&P 500. 
And the reason we perform so well is that throughout our history, we have delivered short-term performance with a keen eye on the long-term sustainability of our results. We've done this because throughout the past half-century, PepsiCo has made bold moves to reshape our portfolio, build new capabilities and broaden our geographic footprint. 
So today, our portfolio is positioned well. Our annual net revenues nearly split evenly between the U.S. and countries outside the U.S., and just over half of our global revenues derived from snacks with the remainder from beverages. 
In aggregate, carbonated soft drinks comprise less than 25% of our 2014 total global revenue. And while we are proud to have the Pepsi name on the door, colas represented less than 15% of our total revenue mix, and this speaks exactly to how we transformed and will continue to transform our portfolio to address ever-changing consumer needs and preferences. 
And as you know, we've also developed new capabilities to compete in a rapidly evolving global business environment. For example, we transformed our operating model to blend global scale leverage with low key focused execution, and this has increased our ability to capture efficiencies, lift and shift the best ideas and capabilities from PepsiCo teams around the world and win at the point-of-sale. 
We embrace design as a core building block of our new product pipeline with innovation representing over 9% of our net revenue in 2014, and we're very proud to report that 3 PepsiCo products have received the 2015 Nielsen Breakthrough Innovation awards. This award recognizes the most successful and enduring new CPG products launched in the U.S. in 2013, and PepsiCo's also the only company to receive multiple awards this year. 
Lastly, productivity is now part of our DNA with $1 billion in annual savings projected till 2019. These savings enable us to maintain or increase necessary investments in the business to drive strong organic revenue growth. And we're always looking to reconceptualize our business to unlock even more productivity. 
We're proud of the legacy results we're building this company on. So with that backdrop, let's take a look at how our businesses performed starting with North America, which again delivered strong results in an otherwise sluggish packaged food and beverage environment. 
In fact, in Q1 2015, PepsiCo was the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth among all food and beverage manufacturers, with over $300 million of retail sales growth in all measured channels. This was nearly 3x the next largest contributor to growth and represented more growth than the next 19 largest manufacturers combined. 
Notably, North American Beverages was the key driver of U.S. retail sales growth within PepsiCo and the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth on a standalone basis. 
Turning now to PepsiCo Americas Beverages. We delivered organic revenue and core constant-currency operating profit growth while holding U.S. LRB value share. Our strategy has not wavered as we continue to manage the business responsibly with consistent positive price realization across the portfolio. 
Within the U.S., we gained value share across important subcategories, including sport drinks and ready-to-drink teas, and we grew retail sales and measured channels in the U.S. for regular colas and Mountain Dew within CSDs and for Gatorade, Lipton Tea and Naked Juice within our non-carbonated portfolio. 
We were proud of PepsiCo's execution at this year's Super Bowl. We had over 60,000 integrated food and beverage displays merchandise at retail, up nearly 70% from the prior year. 
We also continue to invest in R&D to drive sustainable innovation. For example, we rolled out a newly designed Gatorade 28-ounce bottle, which is a sleek, contemporary design bottle that was built with improved ergonomics informed by athletes' insights. Early results are promising with this packaging innovation contributing to double-digit retail sales growth in regions that have converged with the new packaging. 
We're also focused on health and wellness innovation. We recently introduced new Naked Juice flavors including chia cherry lime, chia tree peach and which offer delicious fruit and vegetable smoothies that pack a nutritional punch. 
And we launched Tropicana Farmstand Tropical Green, which is a great-tasting green juice that has a full serving of fruits and vegetables in each 8-ounce glass with no added sugar. 
Additionally, we recently launched Mountain Dew Dew Shine, a craft premium soda inspired by the brand roots in the backwoods of Tennessee. It is a clear citrus juice made with real cane sugar and packaged in clear glass bottles. 
We're also excited to report the new foodservice partnership with umami burger, which will serve Pepsi cola, Mountain Dew, all made with real sugar at its 24 locations. 
In addition, we entered into a new multiyear dear with Live Nation. We're the music company's official carbonated soft drink and bottle water partner and have exclusive pouring rights at 75 of Live Nation's newest event spaces. 
And we're also pleased about our new multiyear food and beverage partnership with the National Basketball Association, Women's National Basketball Association, NBA Development League and USA Basketball beginning next season. 
As part of its expansive food and beverage partnership with the league, PepsiCo will leverage its Mountain Dew, Aquafina, Brisk, Doritos and Ruffles brands to engage NBA fans through PepsiCo's world-class sports marketing and high-profile activation. The partnership between the NBA and PepsiCo builds upon the league's relationship with Gatorade, which is the NBA's longest-standing partner. 
Turning now to Frito-Lay North America, delivered another quarter very strong results. Organic revenue grew 4%, and core constant-currency operating profit rose 7%. 
The U.S. salty-snacks category continued to show solid growth, and Frito market share again posted steady sequential improvement, supported by both volume growth and price realization. 
Our key brands led revenue growth, including particularly good performance from Lay's, Doritos and Cheetos, and we continue to innovate. We launched Cheetos Sweetos, the first-ever Sweet Cheetos in the U.S. as well as Tostitos, Doritos JACKED 3D and pretzel. Additionally, our Lay's Do Us A Flavor winner in 2014, Lay's Kettle Wasabi Ginger returned to the shelves. 
We're also excited about the return of our highly successful Lay's Do Us A Flavor consumer contest. Fans nationwide have submitted their ideas for the next great potato chip flavor for a chance to win $1 million grand prize, and we will announce the 4 delicious finalist flavors this summer. 
Quaker Foods North America delivered commendable results despite continued challenges across central store food categories. During the quarter, we gained or held value share in the U.S. in all 3 of our key categories: hot, ready-to-eat cereals and snack bars while expanding gross margin at the same time. 
These value share gains are driven by innovation, which includes the launch of Quaker 3-minute steel cup oats in the quarter. This product has the same hearty texture and nutty flavor as traditional steel cut oats but caters to the consumer's needs for convenient products as the cook time is cut from 30 minutes to just 3 minutes. 
We also launched gluten-free varieties of Quaker pops rice crisps. 
And then turning to developing and emerging markets. Our businesses delivered 10% organic revenue growth in the quarter despite all of the ongoing volatility in many regions of the world. 
Looking across some of our key DNE markets, our business continue to prove resilient with double-digit organic revenue growth in China and Turkey and mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in Mexico, Egypt and India. 
So before I turn it over to Hugh, I want to highlight a few key points. As an operating company, we absolutely manage the things that are within our control: marketing, innovation, marketplace execution and productivity, and we expect to continue perform well in these areas. 
However, we expect to face continued headwinds related to macros, in particular weak currencies in number of our key markets and the impact of lower oil prices in countries as economies are highly dependent in energy. Obviously, these are outside our control, but we adjust the business to weather through the challenges as best as we can by controlling cost, adjusting our raw material sourcing and executing pricing actions, and these steps contributed to our strong fundamental performance in Q1. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh?"
32854,289283698,792547,"Pepsico, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Turning to guidance. For the full year 2015, we expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, core operating margin expansion as organic top line growth and productivity should offset negative geographic mix",662,"Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Turning to guidance. For the full year 2015, we expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, core operating margin expansion as organic top line growth and productivity should offset negative geographic mix and commodity inflation, which incorporates the impact of higher-than-previously expected transaction-related foreign exchange headwinds and approximately $1 billion of productivity savings. 
Below the division operating profit line, we continue to expect corporate cost to be lower, our core tax rate of approximately 25% and to reduce share count. As a result, we continue to expect 7% core constant earnings per share growth in 2015. 
However, given the continued strength in the U.S. dollar, we now expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact net revenue and core earnings per share growth by approximately 10 and 11 percentage points, respectively, based on current consensus market rates. That compares to our initial outlook of 7 percentage points for each back in February. 
Keep in mind that while spot rates have shown improvement, we use consensus rates in calculating our expected foreign exchange impacts, and consensus rates have worsened for all of our key foreign currencies including the Russian ruble, the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso and the British pound. 
Our outlook for the year assumes continued translation of our Venezuela results at the SICAD rate of VEF 12 per U.S. dollar. Should circumstances dictate use of a higher rate, this would also negatively impact our U.S. dollar results. 
Taking our 2014 core EPS of $4.63 and applying our guidance in current market consensus of foreign exchange impact implies 2015 core EPS of approximately $4.44. 
As you model out the second quarter, I'd ask you to consider the following. Foreign exchange translation should have an approximate 11-point unfavorable impact in the second quarter net revenue and approximate 12-point unfavorable impact on second quarter core EPS based on current market consensus rates, and we expect a profit decline in Europe driven by the volatility associated with transaction and translation currency related headwinds. 
Below the division operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to increase in the second quarter versus last year, primarily reflecting increased debt balances. And our tax rate for the second quarter is expected to be sequentially higher than the first quarter 2015. 
Finally, our stepped-up share repurchase activity will occur throughout the year but is expected to have a more pronounced impact in the second half of 2015. 
From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect full year free cash flow of more than $7 billion. I want to emphasize that despite the expected incremental foreign exchange headwinds this year, our original $7 billion free cash flow target remains intact. This is the result of stringent working capital management and capital spending discipline. 
We've shortened our cash conversion cycle by over 50% since Q1 2012 and continue to manage capital spending with great efficiency, holding capital spending below 5% of sales. 
We expect our capital allocation discipline to continue to drive core ROIC improvements. This is building on the steady progress we've made in our ROIC over the past 2 years, with core net ROIC up 220 basis points to 17.5% from 2012 to 2014. And we expect to return between approximately $8.5 billion and $9 billion to shareholders in 2015 through both dividends and share repurchases, again consistent with our original target. 
As a reminder, our previously announced 7% dividend per share increase will commence with the June payment. This represents the 43rd consecutive year of annual dividend increases and an approximate 60% payout ratio based on 2014 core EPS. And our annualized dividends per share grew at low double-digit compound annual growth rate over the past 10 years. 
To summarize, our core constant currency outlook for 2015 is unchanged from our last call, and free cash flow disciplined capital allocation and returning cash to our shareholders remain top priorities for the company.

It looks like it's been pretty muted with the solid organic sales growth. So I'm just wondering where demand elasticities are coming in versus your expectations, particularly in Latin America and Russia given some of the macro difficulties there. And then as we look going forward as FX pressure continues to worsen, do you plan to take incremental pricing internationally because I imagine at some point you don't want to push too far from a consumer standpoint. And then last just a detailed question the pricing number was very strong in Latin America Foods, and I suspect in the Latin piece of PAB, how much of that was driven by Venezuela versus other geographies?"

And what we do in most cases is that we try to push through as much of the inflation as we can raw material inflation as we can to pricing. In many cases, we cannot cover all of it, but we try to price through about 75% of the inflation, and then we manage very judiciously the revenue outlook and make sure that our volume decline is not significant. For example, let me take Russia. And Russia we have pushed through a lot of pricing, and we've managed it up with a lot of productivity also, and so as a result, Russia business is doing very well. The real issue is yes, there's some volume drop off, but I think in these times we have to judiciously manage revenue and volume, and then as the economies recover, we go back to the volume growth. If we don't push pricing through now, it'll be very hard to push it all through later on to cover all of these costs. So at every point in time in each of these countries, that's what we do. And in terms of ongoing FX, the spot rates are slightly better than consensus we have to watch and see how this thing evolves but in every country, again every country's not moving exactly the same way, but country-by-country as FX most especially transactional FX impacts our country performance, we do take pricing at least to cover 75% of that and the rest of it we try to cover through productivity. And as far as Venezuela's concerned, I mean, we have footnotes in the Q would indicate exactly what the impact of Venezuela, and I think it'll speak for itself."

We bought it back because we want to improve efficiency in the system, and most importantly, we wanted to serve our customers in a seamless way and be able to put in a lot of innovation through our bottling system, which had to move from huge monolithic products to highly fragmented set of products.

I'm pleased with our performance in the first quarter of 2015. Our focus on innovation, brand-building and market-based execution, funded in part by our productivity initiatives, continues to drive solid fundamental business performance. In the first quarter, organic revenue grew 4.4% with global snacks up 7% and global beverages up 1.5%. And core gross margins improved by 150 basis points. 
Excluding the impairment charge and gains Jamie mentioned, core operating margin improved by 65 basis points, core constant currency operating profit grew 11% and core constant currency EPS grew 16%. However, foreign exchange headwinds persist. We have and will continue to take actions to manage to the current volatile macroeconomic environment by taking responsible pricing actions, tightly controlling costs and optimizing our global sourcing to minimize and mitigate the impacts of the current foreign exchange challenges. 
I am particularly pleased with the level of effective pricing we're achieving especially in global beverages, where we realized 3 points of effective net pricing. At the same time, we will not let cyclical macroeconomic issues divert us from our focus to drive sustainable shareholder value creation. We intend to continue to invest across our markets and brands to generate organic revenue growth, drive greater efficiency and productivity, deliver attractive free cash flow and cash returns to shareholders and enhance our returns on invested capital. The power of our portfolio of products and brands and the strength of our geographic footprint have enabled us to consistently meet or exceed our financial goals and more importantly, give us confidence in the future prospects of our business. 
As you know, in June this year, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of PepsiCo, which is a coming together of Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay. As we celebrate this milestone, we look back on our journey with pride. In 1965, our annual revenue was $510 million. Today, it stands over $66 billion. A $100 investment in PepsiCo stock in 1965 was worth nearly $43,000 at the end of 2014, a compound annual total shareholder return of over 13%, far outpacing the S&P 500. And the reason we've performed so well is that throughout our history, we have delivered short-term performance with a keen eye on the long-term sustainability of our results. We've done this because throughout the past half century, PepsiCo has made bold moves to reshape our portfolio, build new capabilities and broaden our geographic footprint. 
So today, our portfolio is positioned well. Our annual net revenue is nearly split evenly between the U.S. and countries outside the U.S. And just over half of our global revenue is derived from snacks with the remainder from beverages. In aggregate, carbonated soft drinks comprise less than 25% of our 2014 total global revenue. And while we are proud to have the Pepsi name on the door, colas represented less than 15% of our total revenue mix. And this speaks exactly to how we've transformed and will continue to transform our portfolio to address ever-changing consumer needs and preferences. And as you know, we have also developed new capabilities to compete in a rapidly evolving global business environment. For example, we transformed our operating model to blend global scale leverage with locally focused execution. And this has increased our ability to capture efficiencies, lift and shift the best ideas and capabilities from PepsiCo teams around the world and win at the point-of-sale. 
We embrace design as a core building block of our new product pipeline with innovation representing over 9% of our net revenue in 2014. And we're very proud to report that 3 PepsiCo products have received the 2015 Nielsen Breakthrough Innovation Award. This award recognizes the most successful and enduring new CPG products launched in the U.S. in 2013. And PepsiCo is also the only company to receive multiple awards this year. Lastly, productivity is now part of our DNA with $1 billion in annual savings projected through 2019. These savings enable us to maintain or increase necessary investments in the business to drive strong organic revenue growth. And we're always looking to reconceptualize our business to unlock even more productivity. We're proud of the legacy results we're building this company on. 
So with that backdrop, let's take a look at how our businesses performed starting with North America, which again delivered strong results in an otherwise sluggish packaged food and beverage environment. In fact, in Q1 2015, PepsiCo was the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth among all food and beverage manufacturers with over $300 million of retail sales growth in all measured channels. This was nearly 3x the next largest contributor to growth and represented more growth than the next 19 largest manufacturers combined. Notably, North American Beverages was the key driver of U.S. retail sales growth within PepsiCo and the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth on a stand-alone basis. 
Turning now to PepsiCo Americas Beverages, delivered organic revenue and core constant currency operating profit growth while holding U.S. LRB value share. Our strategy has not wavered as we continue to manage the business responsibly with consistent positive price realization across the portfolio. Within the U.S., we gained value share across important subcategories, including sport drinks and ready-to-drink teas. And we grew retail sales in measured channels in the U.S. for regular colas and Mountain Dew within CSDs and for Gatorade, Lipton Tea and Naked Juice within our non-carbonated portfolio. 
We were proud of PepsiCo's execution at this year's Super Bowl. We had over 60,000 integrated food and beverage displays merchandised at retail, up nearly 70% from the prior year. We also continue to invest in R&D to drive sustainable innovation. For example, we rolled out a newly designed Gatorade 28-ounce bottle, which is a sleek, contemporary designed bottle that was built with improved ergonomics informed by athlete insights. Early results are promising with this packaging innovation contributing to double-digit retail sales growth in regions that have converted to the new packaging. 
We're also focused on health and wellness innovation. We recently introduced new Naked Juice flavors, including Chia Cherry Lime, Chia Sweet Peach and Bright Beets, which offer delicious fruit and vegetable smoothies that pack a nutritional punch. And we launched Tropicana Farmstand Tropical Green, which is a great-tasting green juice that has a full serving of fruits and vegetables in each 8-ounce glass with no added sugar. Additionally, we recently launched Mountain Dew DEWshine, a craft premium soda inspired by the brand roots in the backwoods of Tennessee. It is a clear citrus DEW made with real cane sugar and packaged in clear glass bottles. We're also excited to report a new foodservice partnership with Umami Burger, which will serve Pepsi-Cola, Mountain Dew and Sierra Mist, all made with real sugar at its 24 locations. 
In addition, we entered into a new multiyear dear with Live Nation. We are the music company's official carbonated soft drink and bottled water partner and have exclusive pouring rights at 75 of Live Nation's newest event spaces. And we're also pleased about our new multiyear food and beverage partnership with the National Basketball Association, Women's National Basketball Association, NBA Development League and U.S.A. Basketball beginning next season. As part of this expansive food and beverage partnership with the league, PepsiCo will leverage its Mountain Dew, Aquafina, Brisk, Doritos and Ruffles brands to engage NBA fans through PepsiCo's world-class sports marketing and high-profile activation. The partnership between the NBA and PepsiCo builds upon the league's relationship with Gatorade, which is the NBA's longest-standing partner. 
Turning now to Frito-Lay North America, delivered another quarter very strong results. Organic revenue grew 4% and core constant currency operating profit rose 7%. The U.S. salty-snacks category continued to show solid growth and Frito market share again posted steady sequential improvement, supported by both volume growth and price realization. Our key brands led revenue growth, including particularly good performance from Lay's, Doritos and Cheetos, and we continue to innovate. 
We launched Cheetos Sweetos, the first-ever sweet Cheetos in the U.S. as well as Tostitos Dip-etizers, Doritos JACKED 3D and ROLD GOLD Pretzel Dippers. Additionally, our Lay's Do Us A Flavor winner in 2014, Lay's Kettle Wasabi Ginger, returned to the shelves. We're also excited about the return of our highly successful Lay's Do Us A Flavor consumer contest. Fans nationwide have submitted their ideas for the next great potato chip flavor for a chance to win $1 million grand prize. And we will announce the 4 delicious finalist flavors this summer. 
Quaker Foods North America delivered commendable results despite continued challenges across central store food categories. During the quarter, we gained or held value share in the U.S. in all 3 of our key categories, hot, ready-to-eat cereals and snack bars while expanding gross margin at the same time. These value share gains are driven by innovation, which includes the launch of Quaker 3-Minute Steel Cut Oats in the quarter. This product has the same hearty texture and nutty flavor as traditional steel cut oats but caters to the consumers' needs for convenient products as the cook time is cut from 30 minutes to just 3 minutes. We also launched gluten-free varieties of Quaker Popped Rice Crisps. 
And then turning to developing and emerging markets. Our businesses delivered 10% organic revenue growth in the quarter despite all of the ongoing volatility in many regions of the world. Looking across some of our key D&E markets, our business continued to prove resilient with double-digit organic revenue growth in China and Turkey and mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in Mexico, Egypt and India. 
So before I turn it over to Hugh, I want to highlight a few key points. As an operating company, we absolutely manage the things that are within our control: marketing, innovation, marketplace execution and productivity. And we expect to continue to perform well in these areas. However, we expect to face continued headwinds related to macros, in particular weak currencies in a number of our key markets and the impact of low oil prices in countries as economies are highly dependent on energy. Obviously, these are outside our control. But we adjust the business to weather through the challenges as best as we can by controlling costs, adjusting our raw material sourcing and executing pricing actions. And these steps contributed to a strong fundamental performance in Q1. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh?"
32854,289283698,792687,"Pepsico, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Turning to guidance. For the full year 2015, we expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, core operating margin expansion as organic top line growth and productivity should offset negative geographic mix",664,"Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Turning to guidance. For the full year 2015, we expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, core operating margin expansion as organic top line growth and productivity should offset negative geographic mix and commodity inflation, which incorporates the impact of higher-than-previously-expected, transaction-related foreign exchange headwinds and approximately $1 billion of productivity savings. Below the division operating profit line, we continue to expect corporate cost to be lower, a core tax rate of approximately 25% and to reduce share count. As a result, we continue to expect 7% core constant currency earnings per share growth in 2015. 
However, given the continued strength in the U.S. dollar, we now expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact net revenue and core earnings per share growth by approximately 10 and 11 percentage points, respectively, based on current consensus market rates. That compares to our initial outlook of 7 percentage points for each back in February. Keep in mind that while spot rates have shown improvement, we use consensus rates in calculating our expected foreign exchange impacts. And consensus rates have worsened for all of our key foreign currencies, including the Russian ruble, the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso and the British pound. Our outlook for the year assumes continued translation of our Venezuela results at the SICAD rate of VEF 12 per U.S. dollar. Should circumstances dictate use of a higher rate, this would also negatively impact our U.S. dollar results. 
Taking our 2014 core EPS of $4.63 and applying our guidance in current market consensus of foreign exchange impact implies 2015 core EPS of approximately $4.44. As you model out the second quarter, I'd ask you to consider the following. Foreign exchange translation should have an approximate 11 point unfavorable impact in the second quarter net revenue and approximate 12 point unfavorable impact on second quarter core EPS based on current market consensus rates. And we expect a profit decline in Europe driven by the volatility associated with transaction and translation currency-related headwinds. 
Below the division operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to increase in the second quarter versus last year, primarily reflecting increased debt balances. And our tax rate for the second quarter is expected to be sequentially higher than the first quarter of 2015. Finally, our stepped-up share repurchase activity will occur throughout the year but is expected to have a more pronounced impact in the second half of 2015. 
From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect full year free cash flow of more than $7 billion. I want to emphasize that despite the expected incremental foreign exchange headwinds this year, our original $7 billion free cash flow target remains intact. This is the result of stringent working capital management and capital spending discipline. We've shortened our cash conversion cycle by over 50% since Q1 2012 and continue to manage capital spending with great efficiency, holding capital spending below 5% of sales. 
We expect our capital allocation discipline to continue to drive core ROIC improvement. This is building on the steady progress we've made in our ROIC over the past 2 years with core net ROIC up 220 basis points to 17.5% from 2012 to 2014. And we expect to return between approximately $8.5 billion and $9 billion to shareholders in 2015 through both dividends and share repurchases, again consistent with our original target. 
As a reminder, our previously announced 7% dividend per share increase will commence with the June payment. This represents the 43rd consecutive year of annual dividend increases and an approximate 60% payout ratio based on 2014 core EPS. And our annualized dividends per share grew at low double-digit compound annual growth rate over the past 10 years. 
To summarize, our core constant currency outlook for 2015 is unchanged from our last call and free cash flow, disciplined capital allocation and returning cash to our shareholders remain top priorities for the company. With that, operator, we'll take the first question."

It looks like it's been pretty muted with the solid organic sales growth. So I'm just wondering where demand elasticities are coming in versus your expectations, particularly in Latin America and Russia, given some of the macro difficulties there. And then as we look going forward as FX pressure continues to worsen, do you plan to take incremental pricing internationally because I imagine at some point you don't want to push too far from a consumer standpoint? And then last, just a detailed question, the pricing number was very strong in Latin American Foods and I suspect in the Latin piece of PAB. How much of that was driven by Venezuela versus other geographies?"
32854,289283698,792687,"Pepsico, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Dara, overall, I tell you demand elasticity in these times, when you've got high inflation and you've got transactional FX hitting countries which require us to take pricing, the challenge is to balance volume and revenue. And what we do in most cases is",317,"Dara, overall, I tell you demand elasticity in these times, when you've got high inflation and you've got transactional FX hitting countries which require us to take pricing, the challenge is to balance volume and revenue. And what we do in most cases is that we try to push through as much of the inflation as we can, raw material inflation as we can to pricing. In many cases, we cannot cover all of it. But we try to price through about 75% of the inflation. And then we manage very judiciously the revenue output and make sure that our volume decline is not significant. For example, let me take Russia. In Russia, we have pushed through a lot of pricing, and we've married it up with a lot of productivity also. And so as a result in Russia, our business is doing very well. The real issue is yes, there's some volume dropoff, but I think in these times, we have to judiciously manage revenue and volume, and then as the economies recover, go back to volume growth. If we don't push pricing through now, it would be very hard to push it all through later on to cover all of these costs. So at every point in time in each of these countries, that's what we do. And in terms of ongoing FX, spot rates are slightly better than consensus. We have to watch and see how this thing evolves. But in every country again, every country is not moving exactly the same way. But country-by-country, as FX moves, especially transactional FX, impacts country performance, we do take pricing at least to cover 75% of that. And the rest of it, we try to cover through productivity. And as far as Venezuela is concerned, I mean, the footnotes in the Qs will indicate exactly the impact of Venezuela. And I think it'll speak for itself."

You've seen us over the last few years come down from the mid-5s in terms of CapEx as a percent of revenue to we've been operating in the low 4s. And then third, we've managed working capital from what had previously been about 21 days down to about 3 days. In all candor, I still think we have more opportunity in that regard, particularly on inventory. And we're going to continue to work that as quickly as we can in order to mitigate if there are further downsides. Right now, we're giving you market consensus, it's our best guess. So definitionally, that's a 50-50 as to which way it's going to go. But I do think we can continue to do more from an inventory perspective in order to continue to cover if we have further downsides from an FX perspective."

And I think it's also giving an opportunity for all companies operating in Russia to look and see how to tighten their belts and work with each other to lower each other's costs. So except for the overall macro geopolitical issues in Russia, on the ground, the business in Russia looks okay. In terms of Mexico again, we've operated in Mexico for decades and we've operated through massive volatility. At this point, we're not seeing that kind of volatility at all in Mexico. We have pockets of security issues, but overall, Mexico is just fine. Brazil did see a slowdown coming off the real weakening, and then on top of that, the draft issues happening in Brazil. Yes, we did see some turmoil -- I'm sorry, in Brazil. And our business is still holding, Caroline.

But believe me, once we change the operating model of the company to really look across the company as opposed to allowing each country and region to just operate independently, there are more opportunities for efficiency. So that's what we're working on. And in terms of the Coke refranchising its bottling operations, let's not forget why we bought back the bottling assets. We bought it back because we wanted to improve efficiency in the system. And most importantly, we wanted to serve our customers in a seamless way and be able to put in a lot of innovation through our bottling system, which had to move from huge monolithic products to highly fragmented set of products. That original proposition has not changed. What we are seeing today is disciplined pricing in the market.

So I think we have a challenge these days to really think about what is definition of Good-for-You from a consumer perspective. And this is unprecedented. And the old of definition of Good-for-You is being challenged right now. So I think the best way to think about this is to think about the food and vegetable corridor, a protein corridor, a grains corridor, and then sort of predominantly carb corridor. And then within that, just vary our strategy based on what the consumer is thinking about. Because especially millennials today have got very different definitions of Good-for-You versus Fun-for-You. They don't really make the definition. And the difference is that they're look much more to ingredients. So we are also going through a little change in our thinking.

I'm pleased with our performance in the first quarter of 2015. Our focus on innovation, brand-building and marketplace execution, funded in part by our productivity initiatives, continues to drive solid fundamental business performance. In the first quarter, organic revenue grew 4.4% with global snacks up 7% and global beverages up 1.5%. And core gross margins improved by 150 basis points. 
Excluding the impairment charge and gains Jamie mentioned, core operating margin improved by 65 basis points, core constant currency operating profit grew 11% and core constant currency EPS grew 16%. However, foreign exchange headwinds persist. We have and will continue to take actions to manage through the current volatile macroeconomic environment by taking responsible pricing actions, tightly controlling costs and optimizing our global sourcing to minimize and mitigate the impacts of the current foreign exchange challenges. 
I am particularly pleased with the level of effective pricing we're achieving especially in global beverages, where we realized 3 points of effective net pricing. At the same time, we will not let cyclical macroeconomic issues divert us from our focus to drive sustainable shareholder value creation. We intend to continue to invest across our markets and brands to generate organic revenue growth, drive greater efficiency and productivity, deliver attractive free cash flow and cash returns to shareholders and enhance our returns on invested capital. The power of our portfolio of products and brands and the strength of our geographic footprint have enabled us to consistently meet or exceed our financial goals and more importantly, give us confidence in the future prospects for our business. 
As you know, in June this year, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of PepsiCo, which is a coming together of Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay. As we celebrate this milestone, we look back on our journey with pride. In 1965, our annual revenue was $510 million. Today, it stands over $66 billion. A $100 investment in PepsiCo stock in 1965 was worth nearly $43,000 at the end of 2014, a compound annual total shareholder return of over 13%, far outpacing the S&P 500. And the reason we've performed so well is that throughout our history, we have delivered short-term performance with a keen eye on the long-term sustainability of our results. We've done this because throughout the past half century, PepsiCo has made bold moves to reshape our portfolio, build new capabilities and broaden our geographic footprint. 
So today, our portfolio is positioned well. Our annual net revenue is nearly split evenly between the U.S. and countries outside the U.S. And just over half of our global revenue is derived from snacks with the remainder from beverages. In aggregate, carbonated soft drinks comprise less than 25% of our 2014 total global revenue. And while we are proud to have the Pepsi name on the door, colas represented less than 15% of our total revenue mix. And this speaks exactly to how we've transformed and will continue to transform our portfolio to address ever-changing consumer needs and preferences. And as you know, we have also developed new capabilities to compete in the rapidly evolving global business environment. For example, we transformed our operating model to blend global scale leverage with locally focused execution. And this has increased our ability to capture efficiencies, lift and shift the best ideas and capabilities from PepsiCo teams around the world and win at the point-of-sale. 
We embrace design as a core building block of our new product pipeline with innovation representing over 9% of our net revenue in 2014. And we're very proud to report that 3 PepsiCo products have received the 2015 Nielsen Breakthrough Innovation Award. This award recognizes the most successful and enduring new CPG products launched in the U.S. in 2013. And PepsiCo is also the only company to receive multiple awards this year. Lastly, productivity is now part of our DNA with $1 billion in annual savings projected through 2019. These savings enable us to maintain or increase necessary investments in the business to drive strong organic revenue growth. And we're always looking to reconceptualize our business to unlock even more productivity. We're proud of the legacy results we're building this company on. 
So with that backdrop, let's take a look at how our businesses performed starting with North America, which again delivered strong results in an otherwise sluggish packaged food and beverage environment. In fact, in Q1 2015, PepsiCo was the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth among all food and beverage manufacturers with over $300 million of retail sales growth in all measured channels. This was nearly 3x the next largest contributor to growth and represented more growth than the next 19 largest manufacturers combined. Notably, North American Beverages was the key driver of U.S. retail sales growth within PepsiCo and the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth on a stand-alone basis. 
Turning now to PepsiCo Americas Beverages, delivered organic revenue and core constant currency operating profit growth while holding U.S. LRB value share. Our strategy has not wavered as we continue to manage the business responsibly with consistent positive price realization across the portfolio. Within the U.S., we gained value share across important subcategories, including sports drinks and ready-to-drink teas. And we grew retail sales in measured channels in the U.S. for regular colas and Mountain Dew within CSDs and for Gatorade, Lipton Tea and Naked Juice within our non-carbonated portfolio. 
We were proud of PepsiCo's execution at this year's Super Bowl. We had over 60,000 integrated food and beverage displays merchandised at retail, up nearly 70% from the prior year. We also continue to invest in R&D to drive sustainable innovation. For example, we rolled out a newly designed Gatorade 28-ounce bottle, which is a sleek, contemporary designed bottle that was built with improved ergonomics informed by athlete insights. Early results are promising with this packaging innovation contributing to double-digit retail sales growth in regions that have converted to the new packaging. 
We're also focused on health and wellness innovation. We recently introduced new Naked Juice flavors, including Chia Cherry Lime, Chia Sweet Peach and Bright Beets, which offer delicious fruit and vegetable smoothies that pack a nutritional punch. And we launched Tropicana Farmstand Tropical Green, which is a great-tasting green juice that has a full serving of fruits and vegetables in each 8-ounce glass with no added sugar. Additionally, we recently launched Mountain Dew DEWshine, a craft premium soda inspired by the brands roots in the backwoods of Tennessee. It is a clear citrus DEW made with real cane sugar and packaged in clear glass bottles. We're also excited to report a new foodservice partnership with Umami Burger, which will serve Pepsi-Cola, Mountain Dew and Sierra Mist, all made with real sugar at its 24 locations. 
In addition, we entered into a new multiyear dear with Live Nation. We are the music company's official carbonated soft drink and bottled water partner and have exclusive pouring rights at 75 of Live Nation's newest event spaces. And we're also pleased about our new multiyear food and beverage partnership with the National Basketball Association, Women's National Basketball Association, NBA Development League and U.S.A. Basketball beginning next season. As part of this expansive food and beverage partnership with the league, PepsiCo will leverage its Mountain Dew, Aquafina, Brisk, Doritos and Ruffles brands to engage NBA fans through PepsiCo's world-class sports marketing and high-profile activation. The partnership between the NBA and PepsiCo builds upon the league's relationship with Gatorade, which is the NBA's longest-standing partner. 
Turning now to Frito-Lay North America, delivered another quarter very strong results. Organic revenue grew 4% and core constant currency operating profit rose 7%. The U.S. salty-snacks category continued to show solid growth and Frito market share again posted steady sequential improvement, supported by both volume growth and price realization. Our key brands led revenue growth, including particularly good performance from Lay's, Doritos and Cheetos, and we continue to innovate. 
We launched Cheetos Sweetos, the first-ever sweet Cheetos in the U.S. as well as Tostitos Dip-etizers, Doritos JACKED 3D and ROLD GOLD Pretzel Dippers. Additionally, our Lay's Do Us A Flavor winner in 2014, Lay's Kettle Wasabi Ginger, returned to the shelves. We're also excited about the return of our highly successful Lay's Do Us A Flavor consumer contest. Fans nationwide have submitted their ideas for the next great potato chip flavor for a chance to win $1 million grand prize. And we will announce the 4 delicious finalist flavors this summer. 
Quaker Foods North America delivered commendable results despite continued challenges across central store food categories. During the quarter, we gained or held value share in the U.S. in all 3 of our key categories, hot, ready-to-eat cereals and snack bars while expanding gross margin at the same time. These value share gains were driven by innovation, which includes the launch of Quaker 3-Minute Steel Cut Oats in the quarter. This product has the same hearty texture and nutty flavor as traditional steel cut oats but caters to the consumers' need for convenient products as the cook time is cut from 30 minutes to just 3 minutes. We also launched gluten-free varieties of Quaker Popped Rice Crisps. 
And then turning to developing and emerging markets. Our businesses delivered 10% organic revenue growth in the quarter despite all of the ongoing volatility in many regions of the world. Looking across some of our key D&E markets, our business continued to prove resilient with double-digit organic revenue growth in China and Turkey and mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in Mexico, Egypt and India. 
So before I turn it over to Hugh, I want to highlight a few key points. As an operating company, we absolutely manage the things that are within our control: marketing, innovation, marketplace execution and productivity. And we expect to continue to perform well in these areas. However, we expect to face continued headwinds related to macros, in particular weak currencies in a number of our key markets and the impact of low oil prices in countries whose economies are highly dependent on energy. Obviously, these are outside our control. But we adjust the business to weather through the challenges as best as we can by controlling costs, adjusting our raw material sourcing and executing pricing actions. And these steps contributed to our strong fundamental performance in Q1. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh?"
32854,289283698,792866,"Pepsico, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Turning to guidance. For the full year 2015, we expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, core operating margin expansion as organic top line growth and productivity should offset negative geographic mix",663,"Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Turning to guidance. For the full year 2015, we expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, core operating margin expansion as organic top line growth and productivity should offset negative geographic mix and commodity inflation, which incorporates the impact of higher-than-previously-expected, transaction-related foreign exchange headwinds and approximately $1 billion of productivity savings. Below the division operating profit line, we continue to expect corporate costs to be lower, a core tax rate of approximately 25% and a reduced share count. As a result, we continue to expect 7% core constant currency earnings per share growth in 2015. 
However, given the continued strength in the U.S. dollar, we now expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact net revenue and core earnings per share growth by approximately 10 and 11 percentage points, respectively, based on current consensus market rates. That compares to our initial outlook of 7 percentage points for each back in February. Keep in mind that while spot rates have shown improvement, we use consensus rates in calculating our expected foreign exchange impacts. And consensus rates have worsened for all of our key foreign currencies, including the Russian ruble, the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso and the British pound. Our outlook for the year assumes continued translation of our Venezuela results at the SICAD rate of VEF 12 per U.S. dollar. Should circumstances dictate use of a higher rate, this would also negatively impact our U.S. dollar results. 
Taking our 2014 core EPS of $4.63 and applying our guidance in current market consensus of foreign exchange impact implies 2015 core EPS of approximately $4.44. As you model out the second quarter, I'd ask you to consider the following. Foreign exchange translation should have an approximate 11 point unfavorable impact on the second quarter net revenue and approximate 12 point unfavorable impact on second quarter core EPS based on current market consensus rates. And we expect a profit decline in Europe driven by the volatility associated with transaction and translation currency-related headwinds. 
Below the division operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to increase in the second quarter versus last year, primarily reflecting increased debt balances. And our tax rate in the second quarter is expected to be sequentially higher than the first quarter of 2015. Finally, our stepped-up share repurchase activity will occur throughout the year but is expected to have a more pronounced impact in the second half of 2015. 
From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect full year free cash flow of more than $7 billion. I want to emphasize that despite the expected incremental foreign exchange headwinds this year, our original $7 billion free cash flow target remains intact. This is the result of stringent working capital management and capital spending discipline. We've shortened our cash conversion cycle by over 50% since Q1 2012 and continue to manage capital spending with great efficiency, holding capital spending below 5% of sales. 
We expect our capital allocation discipline to continue to drive core ROIC improvement. This is building on the steady progress we've made in ROIC over the past 2 years with core net ROIC up 220 basis points to 17.5% from 2012 to 2014. And we expect to return between approximately $8.5 billion and $9 billion to shareholders in 2015 through both dividends and share repurchases, again consistent with our original target. 
As a reminder, our previously announced 7% dividend per share increase will commence with the June payment. This represents the 43rd consecutive year of annual dividend increases and an approximate 60% payout ratio based on 2014 core EPS. And our annualized dividends per share grew at low double-digit compound annual growth rate over the past 10 years. 
To summarize, our core constant currency outlook for 2015 is unchanged from our last call and free cash flow, disciplined capital allocation and returning cash to our shareholders remain top priorities for the company. With that, operator, we'll take the first question."

It looks like it's been pretty muted with the solid organic sales growth. So I'm just wondering where demand elasticities are coming in versus your expectations, particularly in Latin America and Russia, given some of the macro difficulties there. And then as we look going forward as FX pressure continues to worsen, do you plan to take incremental pricing internationally because I imagine at some point you don't want to push too far from a consumer standpoint? And then last, just a detail question, the pricing number was very strong in Latin American Foods and I suspect in the Latin piece of PAB. How much of that was driven by Venezuela versus other geographies?"

And what we do in most cases is",317,"Dara, overall, I tell you demand elasticity in these times, when you've got high inflation and you've got transactional FX hitting countries which require us to take pricing, the challenge is to balance volume and revenue. And what we do in most cases is that we try to push through as much of the inflation as we can, raw material inflation as we can through pricing. In many cases, we cannot cover all of it. But we try to price through about 75% of the inflation. And then we manage very judiciously the revenue output and make sure that our volume decline is not significant. For example, let me take Russia. In Russia, we have pushed through a lot of pricing, and we've married it up with a lot of productivity also. And so our results in Russia, and our business is doing very well. The real issue is yes, there's some volume dropoff, but I think in these times, we have to judiciously manage revenue and volume, and then as the economies recover, go back to volume growth. If we don't push pricing through now, it would be very hard to push it all through later on to cover all of these costs. So at every point in time in each of these countries, that's what we do. And in terms of ongoing FX, spot rates are slightly better than consensus. We have to watch and see how this thing evolves. But in every country again, every country is not moving exactly the same way. But country-by-country, as FX moves, especially transactional FX, impacts country performance, we do take pricing at least to cover 75% of that. And the rest of it, we try to cover through productivity. And as far as Venezuela is concerned, I mean, the footnotes in the Qs will indicate exactly the impact of Venezuela. And I think it'll speak for itself."

And we have a very, very good team that's doing all the right things in terms of productivity, taking pricing, adjusting the product line to make sure it is suited for a Russian consumer that's shopping differently now. And so I'd say that on the ground in Russia, the business is doing well. And I think it's also giving an opportunity for all companies operating in Russia to look and see how to tighten their belts and work with each other to lower each other's costs. So except for the overall macro geopolitical issues in Russia, on the ground, the business in Russia looks okay. In terms of Mexico again, we've operated in Mexico for decades and we've operated through massive volatility. At this point, we're not seeing that kind of volatility at all in Mexico. We have pockets of security issues, but overall, Mexico is just fine. Brazil did see a slowdown coming off the real weakening, and then on top of that, the draft issues happening in Brazil. Yes, we did see some turmoil -- I'm sorry, in Brazil. And our business is still holding, Caroline. But I'd say of the 3 countries that you mentioned, probably in the last quarter, Brazil is where we saw some on-the-ground action that we are watching very carefully at this point."

As I mentioned in my script, Ali, we talked about the $1 billion per year for the next 5 years.

And we'll come back and talk to you about it when we're ready to talk about it. But believe me, once we changed the operating model of the company to really look across the company as opposed to allowing each country and region to just operate independently, there are more opportunities for efficiency. So that's what we're working on. And in terms of the Coke refranchising its bottling operations, let's not forget why we bought back the bottling assets. We bought it back because we wanted to improve efficiency in the system. And most importantly, we wanted to serve our customers in a seamless way and be able to put in a lot of innovation through our bottling system, which had to move from huge monolithic products to a highly fragmented set of products. That original proposition has not changed. What we are seeing today is disciplined pricing in the market.

They're willing to go to organic, non-GMO products even if it has high salt, high sugar, high fat. So I think we have a challenge these days to really think about what is definition of Good-for-You from a consumer perspective. And this is unprecedented. And the old of definition of Good-for-You is being challenged right now. So I think the best way to think about this is to think about the fruit and vegetable corridor, a protein corridor, a grains corridor, and then sort of a predominantly carb corridor. And then within that, just vary our strategy based on what the consumer is thinking about. Because especially millennials today have got very different definitions of Good-for-You versus Fun-for-You. They don't really make the definition. And the difference that way they're look much more at ingredients. So we are also going through a little change in our thinking. The good news is whatever the segmentation is, our portfolio is still balanced and we can actually flex to either definition. So we are managing the business by watching both."

Our focus on innovation, brand-building and marketplace execution, funded in part by our productivity initiatives, continues to drive solid fundamental business performance. In the first quarter, organic revenue grew 4.4% with global snacks up 7% and global beverages up 1.5%. And core gross margins improved by 150 basis points.
Excluding the impairment charge and gains Jamie mentioned, core operating margin improved by 65 basis points, core constant currency operating profit grew 11% and core constant currency EPS grew 16%. However, foreign exchange headwinds persist. We have and will continue to take actions to manage through the current volatile macroeconomic environment by taking responsible pricing actions, tightly controlling costs and optimizing our global sourcing to minimize and mitigate the impacts of the current foreign exchange challenges.
I am particularly pleased with the level of effective pricing we're achieving especially in global beverages, where we realized 3 points of effective net pricing. At the same time, we will not let cyclical macroeconomic issues divert us from our focus to drive sustainable shareholder value creation. We intend to continue to invest across our markets and brands to generate organic revenue growth, drive greater efficiency and productivity, deliver attractive free cash flow and cash returns to shareholders and enhance our returns on invested capital. The power of our portfolio of products and brands and the strength of our geographic footprint have enabled us to consistently meet or exceed our financial goals and more importantly, give us confidence in the future prospects for our business.
As you know, in June this year, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of PepsiCo, which is a coming together of Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay. As we celebrate this milestone, we look back on our journey with pride. In 1965, our annual revenue was $510 million. Today, it stands over $66 billion. A $100 investment in PepsiCo stock in 1965 was worth nearly $43,000 at the end of 2014, a compound annual total shareholder return of over 13%, far outpacing the S&P 500. And the reason we've performed so well is that throughout our history, we have delivered short-term performance with a keen eye on the long-term sustainability of our results. We've done this because throughout the past half century, PepsiCo has made bold moves to reshape our portfolio, build new capabilities and broaden our geographic footprint.
So today, our portfolio is positioned well. Our annual net revenue is nearly split evenly between the U.S. and countries outside the U.S. And just over half of our global revenue is derived from snacks with the remainder from beverages. In aggregate, carbonated soft drinks comprise less than 25% of our 2014 total global revenue. And while we are proud to have the Pepsi name on the door, colas represented less than 15% of our total revenue mix. And this speaks exactly to how we've transformed and will continue to transform our portfolio to address ever-changing consumer needs and preferences. And as you know, we have also developed new capabilities to compete in the rapidly evolving global business environment. For example, we transformed our operating model to blend global scale leverage with locally focused execution. And this has increased our ability to capture efficiencies, lift and shift the best ideas and capabilities from PepsiCo teams around the world and win at the point-of-sale.
We embrace design as a core building block of our new product pipeline with innovation representing over 9% of our net revenue in 2014. And we're very proud to report that 3 PepsiCo products have received the 2015 Nielsen Breakthrough Innovation Award. This award recognizes the most successful and enduring new CPG products launched in the U.S. in 2013. And PepsiCo is also the only company to receive multiple awards this year. Lastly, productivity is now part of our DNA with $1 billion in annual savings projected through 2019. These savings enable us to maintain or increase necessary investments in the business to drive strong organic revenue growth. And we're always looking to reconceptualize our business to unlock even more productivity. We're proud of the legacy results we're building this company on.
So with that backdrop, let's take a look at how our businesses performed starting with North America, which again delivered strong results in an otherwise sluggish packaged food and beverage environment. In fact, in Q1 2015, PepsiCo was the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth among all food and beverage manufacturers with over $300 million of retail sales growth in all measured channels. This was nearly 3x the next largest contributor to growth and represented more growth than the next 19 largest manufacturers combined. Notably, North American Beverages was the key driver of U.S. retail sales growth within PepsiCo and the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth on a stand-alone basis.
Turning now to PepsiCo Americas Beverages, delivered organic revenue and core constant currency operating profit growth while holding U.S. LRB value share. Our strategy has not wavered as we continue to manage the business responsibly with consistent positive price realization across the portfolio. Within the U.S., we gained value share across important subcategories, including sports drinks and ready-to-drink teas. And we grew retail sales in measured channels in the U.S. for regular colas and Mountain Dew within CSDs and for Gatorade, Lipton Tea and Naked Juice within our non-carbonated portfolio.
We were proud of PepsiCo's execution at this year's Super Bowl. We had over 60,000 integrated food and beverage displays merchandised at retail, up nearly 70% from the prior year. We also continue to invest in R&D to drive sustainable innovation. For example, we rolled out a newly designed Gatorade 28-ounce bottle, which is a sleek, contemporary designed bottle that was built with improved ergonomics informed by athlete insights. Early results are promising with this packaging innovation contributing to double-digit retail sales growth in regions that have converted to the new packaging.
We're also focused on health and wellness innovation. We recently introduced new Naked Juice flavors, including Chia Cherry Lime, Chia Sweet Peach and Bright Beets, which offer delicious fruit and vegetable smoothies that pack a nutritional punch. And we launched Tropicana Farmstand Tropical Green, which is a great-tasting green juice that has a full serving of fruits and vegetables in each 8-ounce glass with no added sugar. Additionally, we recently launched Mountain Dew DEWshine, a craft premium soda inspired by the brands roots in the backwoods of Tennessee. It is a clear citrus DEW made with real cane sugar and packaged in clear glass bottles. We're also excited to report a new foodservice partnership with Umami Burger, which will serve Pepsi-Cola, Mountain Dew and Sierra Mist, all made with real sugar at its 24 locations.
In addition, we entered into a new multiyear dear with Live Nation. We are the music company's official carbonated soft drink and bottled water partner and have exclusive pouring rights at 75 of Live Nation's newest event spaces. And we're also pleased about our new multiyear food and beverage partnership with the National Basketball Association, Women's National Basketball Association, NBA Development League and U.S.A. Basketball beginning next season. As part of this expansive food and beverage partnership with the league, PepsiCo will leverage its Mountain Dew, Aquafina, Brisk, Doritos and Ruffles brands to engage NBA fans through PepsiCo's world-class sports marketing and high-profile activation. The partnership between the NBA and PepsiCo builds upon the league's relationship with Gatorade, which is the NBA's longest-standing partner.
Turning now to Frito-Lay North America, delivered another quarter very strong results. Organic revenue grew 4% and core constant currency operating profit rose 7%. The U.S. salty-snacks category continued to show solid growth and Frito market share again posted steady sequential improvement, supported by both volume growth and price realization. Our key brands led revenue growth, including particularly good performance from Lay's, Doritos and Cheetos, and we continue to innovate.
We launched Cheetos Sweetos, the first-ever sweet Cheetos in the U.S. as well as Tostitos Dip-etizers, Doritos JACKED 3D and ROLD GOLD Pretzel Dippers. Additionally, our Lay's Do Us A Flavor winner in 2014, Lay's Kettle Wasabi Ginger, returned to the shelves. We're also excited about the return of our highly successful Lay's Do Us A Flavor consumer contest. Fans nationwide have submitted their ideas for the next great potato chip flavor for a chance to win $1 million grand prize. And we will announce the 4 delicious finalist flavors this summer.
Quaker Foods North America delivered commendable results despite continued challenges across central store food categories. During the quarter, we gained or held value share in the U.S. in all 3 of our key categories, hot, ready-to-eat cereals and snack bars while expanding gross margin at the same time. These value share gains were driven by innovation, which includes the launch of Quaker 3-Minute Steel Cut Oats in the quarter. This product has the same hearty texture and nutty flavor as traditional steel cut oats but caters to the consumers' need for convenient products as the cook time is cut from 30 minutes to just 3 minutes. We also launched gluten-free varieties of Quaker Popped Rice Crisps.
And then turning to developing and emerging markets. Our businesses delivered 10% organic revenue growth in the quarter despite all of the ongoing volatility in many regions of the world. Looking across some of our key D&E markets, our business continued to prove resilient with double-digit organic revenue growth in China and Turkey and mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in Mexico, Egypt and India.
So before I turn it over to Hugh, I want to highlight a few key points. As an operating company, we absolutely manage the things that are within our control: marketing, innovation, marketplace execution and productivity. And we expect to continue to perform well in these areas. However, we expect to face continued headwinds related to macros, in particular weak currencies in a number of our key markets and the impact of low oil prices in countries whose economies are highly dependent on energy. Obviously, these are outside our control. But we adjust the business to weather through the challenges as best as we can by controlling costs, adjusting our raw material sourcing and executing pricing actions. And these steps contributed to our strong fundamental performance in Q1.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh?"
32854,289283698,793745,"Pepsico, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Turning to guidance. For the full year 2015, we expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, core operating margin expansion as organic top line growth and productivity should offset negative geographic mix",663,"Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Turning to guidance. For the full year 2015, we expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, core operating margin expansion as organic top line growth and productivity should offset negative geographic mix and commodity inflation, which incorporates the impact of higher-than-previously-expected, transaction-related foreign exchange headwinds and approximately $1 billion of productivity savings. Below the division operating profit line, we continue to expect corporate costs to be lower, a core tax rate of approximately 25% and a reduced share count. As a result, we continue to expect 7% core constant currency earnings per share growth in 2015.
However, given the continued strength in the U.S. dollar, we now expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact net revenue and core earnings per share growth by approximately 10 and 11 percentage points, respectively, based on current consensus market rates. That compares to our initial outlook of 7 percentage points for each back in February. Keep in mind that while spot rates have shown improvement, we use consensus rates in calculating our expected foreign exchange impacts. And consensus rates have worsened for all of our key foreign currencies, including the Russian ruble, the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso and the British pound. Our outlook for the year assumes continued translation of our Venezuela results at the SICAD rate of VEF 12 per U.S. dollar. Should circumstances dictate use of a higher rate, this would also negatively impact our U.S. dollar results.
Taking our 2014 core EPS of $4.63 and applying our guidance in current market consensus of foreign exchange impact implies 2015 core EPS of approximately $4.44. As you model out the second quarter, I'd ask you to consider the following. Foreign exchange translation should have an approximate 11 point unfavorable impact on the second quarter net revenue and approximate 12 point unfavorable impact on second quarter core EPS based on current market consensus rates. And we expect a profit decline in Europe driven by the volatility associated with transaction and translation currency-related headwinds.
Below the division operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to increase in the second quarter versus last year, primarily reflecting increased debt balances. And our tax rate in the second quarter is expected to be sequentially higher than the first quarter of 2015. Finally, our stepped-up share repurchase activity will occur throughout the year but is expected to have a more pronounced impact in the second half of 2015.
From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect full year free cash flow of more than $7 billion. I want to emphasize that despite the expected incremental foreign exchange headwinds this year, our original $7 billion free cash flow target remains intact. This is the result of stringent working capital management and capital spending discipline. We've shortened our cash conversion cycle by over 50% since Q1 2012 and continue to manage capital spending with great efficiency, holding capital spending below 5% of sales.
We expect our capital allocation discipline to continue to drive core ROIC improvement. This is building on the steady progress we've made in ROIC over the past 2 years with core net ROIC up 220 basis points to 17.5% from 2012 to 2014. And we expect to return between approximately $8.5 billion and $9 billion to shareholders in 2015 through both dividends and share repurchases, again consistent with our original target.
As a reminder, our previously announced 7% dividend per share increase will commence with the June payment. This represents the 43rd consecutive year of annual dividend increases and an approximate 60% payout ratio based on 2014 core EPS. And our annualized dividends per share grew at low double-digit compound annual growth rate over the past 10 years.
To summarize, our core constant currency outlook for 2015 is unchanged from our last call and free cash flow, disciplined capital allocation and returning cash to our shareholders remain top priorities for the company. With that, operator, we'll take the first question."

It looks like it's been pretty muted with the solid organic sales growth. So I'm just wondering where demand elasticities are coming in versus your expectations, particularly in Latin America and Russia, given some of the macro difficulties there. And then as we look going forward as FX pressure continues to worsen, do you plan to take incremental pricing internationally because I imagine at some point you don't want to push too far from a consumer standpoint? And then last, just a detail question, the pricing number was very strong in Latin American Foods and I suspect in the Latin piece of PAB. How much of that was driven by Venezuela versus other geographies?"

And what we do in most cases is",317,"Dara, overall, I tell you demand elasticity in these times, when you've got high inflation and you've got transactional FX hitting countries which require us to take pricing, the challenge is to balance volume and revenue. And what we do in most cases is that we try to push through as much of the inflation as we can, raw material inflation as we can through pricing. In many cases, we cannot cover all of it. But we try to price through about 75% of the inflation. And then we manage very judiciously the revenue output and make sure that our volume decline is not significant. For example, let me take Russia. In Russia, we have pushed through a lot of pricing, and we've married it up with a lot of productivity also. And so our results in Russia, and our business is doing very well. The real issue is yes, there's some volume dropoff, but I think in these times, we have to judiciously manage revenue and volume, and then as the economies recover, go back to volume growth. If we don't push pricing through now, it would be very hard to push it all through later on to cover all of these costs. So at every point in time in each of these countries, that's what we do. And in terms of ongoing FX, spot rates are slightly better than consensus. We have to watch and see how this thing evolves. But in every country again, every country is not moving exactly the same way. But country-by-country, as FX moves, especially transactional FX, impacts country performance, we do take pricing at least to cover 75% of that. And the rest of it, we try to cover through productivity. And as far as Venezuela is concerned, I mean, the footnotes in the Qs will indicate exactly the impact of Venezuela. And I think it'll speak for itself."

And then third, we've managed working capital from what had previously been about 21 days down to about 3 days. In all candor, I still think we have more opportunity in that regard, particularly on inventory. And we're going to continue to work that as quickly as we can in order to mitigate if there are further downsides. Right now, we're giving you market consensus, it's our best guess.

And so I'd say that on the ground in Russia, the business is doing well. And I think it's also giving an opportunity for all companies operating in Russia to look and see how to tighten their belts and work with each other to lower each other's costs. So except for the overall macro geopolitical issues in Russia, on the ground, the business in Russia looks okay. In terms of Mexico again, we've operated in Mexico for decades and we've operated through massive volatility. At this point, we're not seeing that kind of volatility at all in Mexico. We have pockets of security issues, but overall, Mexico is just fine. Brazil did see a slowdown coming off the real weakening, and then on top of that, the draft issues happening in Brazil. Yes, we did see some turmoil -- I'm sorry, in Brazil. And our business is still holding, Caroline. But I'd say of the 3 countries that you mentioned, probably in the last quarter, Brazil is where we saw some on-the-ground action that we are watching very carefully at this point."

One is just to zoom in on costs a little bit, please. I want to understand a little bit more of what's driving some of the commodity inflation being higher for the year, why for FL and PAB, you had an operating cost inflation. Is that wages? And then importantly also, just as you continue to cut the $1 billion of costs, you have a few more years of that, but what happens after that? So that's the cost question. And the other one is I know it's early days, but you're seeing Coca-Cola refranchise more and more of its U.S. bottling operations. Are you seeing anything that shows a change in pattern of their activity in the marketplace?"

As I mentioned in my script, Ali, we talked about the $1 billion per year for the next 5 years. But when we announced the $1 billion a year for the next 5 years, we started working on the next round of ideas to think about even more productivity opportunities. And we'll come back and talk to you about it when we're ready to talk about it. But believe me, once we changed the operating model of the company to really look across the company as opposed to allowing each country and region to just operate independently, there are more opportunities for efficiency. So that's what we're working on. And in terms of the Coke refranchising its bottling operations, let's not forget why we bought back the bottling assets. We bought it back because we wanted to improve efficiency in the system. And most importantly, we wanted to serve our customers in a seamless way and be able to put in a lot of innovation through our bottling system, which had to move from huge monolithic products to a highly fragmented set of products. That original proposition has not changed. What we are seeing today is disciplined pricing in the market. And from our perspective, the integrated operating system is very valuable and we intend to continue to operate that way. So on the commodity inflation, Hugh, quickly?"

And so what we're going to do is just manage those businesses steadily as long as they don't distract us from our core mission of growing the rest of the portfolio. And that's what we're focused on.

And I use the word confused in a neutral way, not a negative way. If you'd asked me a few years ago, people were moving to diet sodas. Now they view real sugar as Good-for-You. They're willing to go to organic, non-GMO products even if it has high salt, high sugar, high fat. So I think we have a challenge these days to really think about what is definition of Good-for-You from a consumer perspective. And this is unprecedented. And the old of definition of Good-for-You is being challenged right now. So I think the best way to think about this is to think about the fruit and vegetable corridor, a protein corridor, a grains corridor, and then sort of a predominantly carb corridor. And then within that, just vary our strategy based on what the consumer is thinking about. Because especially millennials today have got very different definitions of Good-for-You versus Fun-for-You. They don't really make the definition. And the difference that way they're look much more at ingredients. So we are also going through a little change in our thinking. The good news is whatever the segmentation is, our portfolio is still balanced and we can actually flex to either definition. So we are managing the business by watching both."

Then we judiciously manage through pricing, productivity, revenue management to see how best to insulate the portfolio.

Our businesses are performing well, both in the top line and bottom line. PepsiCo Americas Beverages had an outstanding quarter. 3% organic revenue growth translated to 10% core currency operating profit growth.
Frito-Lay North America delivered another quarter of very strong results with organic revenue up 3%, and core constant currency operating profit up 7%.

Now I assume you had a chance to  read the release this morning. So rather than go through the numbers in detail by segment or country, what we will do on this call and going forward is to give you an update and provide a bit more detail on each of our big initiatives to drive performance, namely innovation supported by brand management, flawless execution, self-sustaining productivity, prudent capital allocation and talented new management.
So today we will focus primarily on innovation and touch briefly on the others. And on future calls, we'll highlight one of each of the other initiatives. So let me begin with innovation.
Our innovation success to date is the result of significant investments in and changes to our innovation, research and development capabilities and processes that began about 8 years ago. At that time, we were an extremely decentralized organization, operating as a loose confederation of geographic business units with each largely driving its own development agenda and establishing their own processes.
Development is focused largely on product line extension, and that structure while effective in its time led to  less efficient use of resources with redundant projects often being undertaken in different parts of the world and suboptimal resource allocation to the most promising ideas.
As a result, much of our innovation lack staying power. In part, this has to do with the quality of our innovation, but it also had to do with the inability to appropriately incubate innovation in the marketplace. And to advance these opportunities, we undertook a major transformation to improve our R&D function and innovation capabilities.
Specifically, we established global category groups charged with coordinating global innovation. This resulted in a more focused innovation agenda, a greater emphasis on development platforms rather than product line extensions only and more efficient allocation of development resources as we have significantly reduced redundant efforts through better coordination.
Two, we globally adopted the proprietary demand moment framework originally developed at Frito-Lay North America. The framework focuses on the triggers of consumption by examining consumer needs based on the context of the occasion. This created a much stronger linkage between consumer and shopper insights in the R&D function and has led to renovation being more incremental to top line growth.
Three, we implemented a common discipline stage process to gain better visibility into marketing pipeline of R&D projects, to allocate resources of the more promising ideas and new platforms and to ensure better balance of refresh, reframe and breakthrough innovation.
Four, to facilitate more rapid lift and shift of our most successful innovation launches from one market to another. We provided our businesses with better visibility of new products and their performance around the globe. 
Five, we increased our investment in R&D starting in 2008. In fact, from 2011 to 2014 alone, our investment in R&D has increased almost 40%.
Next, more recently, we established a design capability start world-class design balance. Increasingly, we're involving design in early stages of innovation, taking to account the entire content consumption cycle to create truly memorable experiences for our consumers.
And lastly, we are using reverse engineering century, leveraging our learnings in emerging markets to the benefits of thinking realistically about low-cost design of new products, packaging and equipment without sacrificing quality.
We are pleased with the progress we have made across all these fronts and the tangible results we have seen. Innovation as a percent of total revenue reached 9% in 2014, an improvement of 150 basis points compared to 2 years ago.
3 PepsiCo products received the 2015 Nielsen Breakthrough Innovation Award. This award recognizes the most successful and enduring new CPG products launched in the U.S. in 2013. PepsiCo was the only company to receive multiple awards this year.
And over the past 3 years, we've introduced a number of new products that have achieved our own pace to achieve more than $100 million each in annual retail sales, including Tostitos Cantina, Mountain Dew Kickstart, Doritos, Cheetos fun mix and Gatorade Fierce Blue Cherry and Frost Laser Cherry.
More recently, we have successfully using premium innovation within key categories to capture more price realizations, to relaunch [ph] and launch DEWshine, a craft premium soda inspired by Mountain Dew brand roots in the backwoods of Tennessee.
We're also innovating on packaging, capitalizing on the success of our consumer-engaging Lay's Do Us A Flavor campaign, we launched Lay's summer days campaign, encouraging fans to create custom of Lay's potato chips, featuring photos of their favorite summer moments to share with friends and family on social media.
Adding excitement to this experience, 10,000 lucky fans will receive a real-life customized bag of Lay's classic potato chips featuring the photo they digitally submitted, offering consumers personalized packaging for the first time in the brand's history.
We're also capitalizing on consumer health and wellness demand. As consumers are embracing almond milk and other plant-based proteins as an alternative to traditional dairy milk, Naked Juice has launched 2 new nut milks, dairy almond nut milk and peachy almond nut milk.
And in Quaker Foods North America, our new quick-cook, steel-cut innovation has propelled us to the #1 market position in the on-trend and growing Steel Cut Oatmeal segment by making preparation much more convenient.
Channel-focused innovation is advancing our full service business, and we're launching new line of craft soft drinks called soda in the summer. The lineup includes unique and contemporary takes of traditional craft labels. Flavors include black cherry paragon, lemon Berry asai, vanilla cream and pineapple cream. They contain no high fructose corn syrup and are made with certified cane sugar and natural flavors.
And of course, we continue to refresh and refrain our key brands to maintain a high level of consumer engagement and excitement.
Now innovation has also contributed to good market share performance in the second quarter in the United States. And I believe our results are impressive. We held LRB value share while delivering strong net price realization. We gained value share across important subcategories, including sport drinks and ready-to-drink teas.
Gatorade share of sports drinks surpassed 80%. Mountain Dew gained 40 basis points of value share within the CSD the category in Q2. In fact, if you add Kickstart, DEWshine and Baja and together, this represents more than 2 points of CSD value share in the most recent 4-week period, placing our recent Mountain Dew innovation by itself as the fourth-largest flavored CSD behind Mountain Dew, Dr. Pepper and Sprite.
In Q2, we grew retail sales in measured channels in the U.S. for regular colas and Mountain Dew within CSDs, for Gatorade, Lipton Tea and Naked Juice within our noncarb portfolio. And Frito-Lay, we held value share in savory snacks, and in Quaker Foods, we gained value share in key categories hot and ready-to-eat cereals while expanding gross margin and stepping up advertising and marketing at the same time.
And our innovation is driving growth for our retail partners as well. In the second quarter, PepsiCo was once again the largest contributor to the U.S. retail sales growth among all food and beverage manufacturers with over $400 million of retail sales growth in all measured channels. This was more than 2x the next largest contributor to growth and represented more growth than the next 14 largest manufacturers combined. Notably, North America Beverages was the key driver of U.S. retail sales growth within PepsiCo and the largest contributor to the U.S. retail sales growth on a standalone basis.
Our intention is to continue to invest in innovation, build upon our already strong capability base and further sharpen our holistic innovation process to drive greater for customers, create compelling products for our consumers and ultimately increase the contribution of new products to our total revenue.
So that's the story on innovation. Turning now to execution. We ramped up our execution focus across the value chain from to shelf. We established clear consistent performance metrics to track and benchmark the effectiveness and efficiency of everyone of our core value-driving activities from safety to manufacturing utilization, to transport efficiency to promotional display execution.
Execution is never-ending journey as it will always be opportunity to raise the game of the below-average performers, either manufacturing lines but we're seeing solidification and steady improvement across the enterprise, and this is translating into good market performance and financial results.
Turning now to productivity and disciplined capital allocation. As you know, we have a goal of delivering $5 billion in productivity savings over 5 years from 2015 to 2019 just approximately $1 billion per year. Our current program follows a similarly aggressive 3-year, $3 billion program that we successfully concluded in 2014. And overall, our productivity initiatives are driving meaningful results.
Over the 3 years ending in 2014, despite adverse ForEx, we've realized $1 billion of annual activity savings, net revenue per employees up 10% and EBIT per employee's up 9%. And since 2012, gross margins have consistently expanded.
Similarly, our capital allocation discipline is yielding full results. From year-end 2011 to the second quarter of 2015, net CapEx as a percent of revenue has improved from 4.9% to 4.1% on a rolling 4-quarter basis. And this 80 basis points reduction equates to approximately $500 million in incremental annual free cash flow.
And since 2012 through the second quarter of 2015, core net ROIC has improved by 310 basis points to 18.4% on a rolling 4-quarter basis.
And finally, people renewal in development. This is an area that I and the Board spent a lot of time on. Our focus is twofold here: making sure we have the right leaders in place leaders in place today and that we're developing the next 2 generations of leadership for the company. And as you also know, good management does not happen in short term.
It requires taking a long-term view and very detailed analytical planning. At the core of our people renewal and management plan, we have to focus on the 200 critical leadership roles in our company. These are the roles that are most important to our success and that provide the greatest experiential development for our executives.
For each of these roles, we have developed the pipeline that ensures we have one immediate successor candidates, 2 people in 1- to 3-year time frame and then another 3 people ready 4 to 6 years out.
As a result of these process, we have deliberately developing top talent by giving them multiple category, geography and job experiences and ensuring we have well-developed succession plan. The other priority we have is ensuring we have the right balance of homegrown talent that we augment our talent pool from time-to-time with exception of executives referred from outside the company. And I believe our plans are working. And we've had executive transitions, both planned and unplanned, have been smooth and coordinated. And as you look at our current leadership, you will find that executives have a very broad critical experiences within PepsiCo over many years across functions, geographies and categories, people like Tom Greco, Al Carey, Sanjeev Chadha, Ramon Laguarta and Hugh Johnston, and folks have been brought into PepsiCo later in their careers to augment our skill base and stretch our thinking people like Mehmood Khan,  Laxman Narasimhan and Tony West.
And we are grooming our next generation of leadership by giving them critical experiences, people like Mike who runs our Russia -- I mean, I'm sorry, our China operation, and Brian Newman, whose promotions we announced last night.
So to conclude, we have are pleased with our financial performance for the first half of 2015 and the progress well with across our value driving initiatives. Clearly, there are a number of macro changes around the world, but we believe we have the right strategies and programs in place to enable us to continue to navigate successfully to the current environment.
The construction of our products and geographic portfolios enable us to continue to deliver strong results, in part because our balanced portfolio rates in natural hedge against the global macro and political volatility that has become the new normal. And all of these boosts our confidence in our ability to continue to achieve our financial targets.
So with that, let me turn it over to Hugh."
32854,303797938,832496,"Pepsico, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 09, 2015",2015-07-09,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thank you, Indra. Good morning, everyone. Turning to our guidance. As Indra mentioned, based on the strength of our first half results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we've increased full year core constant currency EPS growth target",538,"Great. Thank you, Indra. Good morning, everyone. Turning to our guidance. As Indra mentioned, based on the strength of our first half results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we've increased full year core constant currency EPS growth target to 8% from 7% previously. Our other targets remain unchanged. .
For the full year 2015, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, core operating margin expansion as organic top line growth and productivity should offset negative geographic mix and commodity inflation, which incorporates the impact of transaction-related foreign exchange headwinds and approximately $1 billion of productivity savings.
Below the division operating line, we continue to expect corporate costs to be lower, a core tax rate of approximately 25% and a reduced share count. We expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact net revenue and core earnings per share growth by approximately 9 and 11 percentage points, respectively, based on current market consensus rates.
Our outlook for the year assumes translation of our Venezuela results at a SICAD rate of VEF 12.8 per U.S. dollar. Should circumstances dictate use of higher rate, this would also negatively impact our U.S. dollar results.
Taking our 2014 core EPS of $4.63 and applying our guidance and current market consensus of foreign exchange impact implies 2015 core EPS of approximately $4.49.
As you model out the third quarter, I'd ask you to consider the following: Foreign exchange translation should have an approximate 11-point unfavorable impact on the third quarter, net revenue growth an approximate 12-point unfavorable impact on third quarter core EPS growth based on current market consensus rates. And we expect a profit decline in QFNA as we lap last year's gain on the sale of the cereal business.
Below the division operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to continue to increase in the third quarter versus last year, driven by higher interest rates and net debt balances, and our tax rate in the third quarter is expected to be higher than the third quarter of 2014.
From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect full year free cash flow of more than $7 billion. We expect our capital allocation discipline to continue to drive core ROIC improvement. This is building on the steady progress we have made in ROIC with core net ROIC up 310 basis points from 2012 to 18.4% through the second quarter of 2015 on a rolling 4-quarter basis.
And consistent with prior outlook, we expect to return between approximately $8.5 billion and $9 billion to shareholders in 2015, through both dividends and share repurchases. As a reminder, our previously announced 7% dividend per share increase commenced with the June payment. Our annualized dividend is now $2.81, an approximate 60% payout ratio based on 2014 core EPS. This represents the 43rd consecutive year of annual dividend increases, and our annualized dividends per share have grown at 10% compound annual rate over the past 10 years.
So to summarize, our core constant currency earnings per share outlook for 2015 has improved from our last call. And free cash flow, disciplined capital allocation and returning cash to our shareholders remain top priorities for the company. 
With that, operator, we'll take the first question."

We are seeing success in Europe and AMEA with all of the part of one management of those regions. We're able to get more productive -- more productivity, take out costs and, especially with the volatile economies, we have to get more and more agile and more creative about how to take out costs. And it's not just costs within our systems, John, I think even with our bottling partners, there's an opportunity to operate figure out how not to duplicate efforts between the 2 companies, and we are seeing those initiatives payoff in AMEA and Europe. And we decided now to do that in Latin America. We're in the middle of a major productivity program in Latin American Foods, and integrating Latin American beverages with food gives us that much more of a cost base to work with. Lastly, given the volatility of these economies there, I think it's very important to be very become a lean mean machine there in order to and reinvest to grow the top line. So that's Latin America. Second is on the Frito volume, again, we watched the Frito performance very carefully as Tom Greco and the Frito team. In our potato chip business, we were going through a revenue management program, and that revenue management program is actually yielding good revenue growth and improving top line growth and profitability for our retailers. And one of the results of the revenue management program is that it is going to impact volume because the price that architecture shifts some of the volume to certain excesses, which impacts volume in the short term but over the long term, it's the right thing for the business. So I'd rather play up to balance of the year then look at our results in 2016."

As you all know we have provided read the extensive disclosures in our 10-Qs and 10-K on the question. In the Q that we intend to file after today market's close, and consistent with past Qs, you will see Venezuela represents approximately 2% of our revenue and operating profit. We also have met monetary assets of approximately $335 million and nonmonetary assets of approximately $725 million. Now if we were to take all of that and go to, Venezuela would then represent 0% or very slightly above 0% of our revenue and operating profits. So it's roughly a 2% hit on both revenue and operating profit. We have a charge of approximately $325 million related to the net monetary assets. It also likely lead to an impairment of our nonmonetary assets. The one thing for investors to consider on this is from an economic standpoint is really would not represent a big impact on ethical given that been as well as largely a self-sufficient, self-funding operation.

Again, I think in these environments, the focus should be on revenue and profit, not necessarily on volume growth. We focus more on unit growth, revenue and profit in these environments because a chase for volume results in the whole business hurricane. So I think with revenue management, unit growth, value growth and profit is what we focus on. And that's what our innovation efforts are yielding to date, the almost 10% I think the high 9s, our innovation performances, something that is a significant step-up.

But we're also in constructive conversations with governments to make sure that there aren't any discriminatory taxes or discriminatory action on any of our categories. Having said that, in Russia in particular, it is perhaps the most diverse portfolio of any part of our company between dairy and juices and snacks ranging from Fun-for-You to Good-for-You and beverages to CSDs actually a small portion of our business in Russia. And so if you want to use an example of the most diverse portfolio of Fun-for-You, Better-for-You and Good-for-You skewing towards Good-for-You, I think it's our Russia portfolio. So we feel good about Russia so far. And we always want any geopolitical issues to deal with from the Russian perspective, but our business is doing well, and the economy has been good to us, and the Russian business environment has been good for us. So we like it."

We don't include procurement savings as part of productivity. Productivity is focused on the operating cost structure, not on the commodity and procurement cost structure. The way we report procurement savings is we share with you on a net commodity inflation number. So that includes gross commodity inflation, less whatever we can do in terms of managing what we call value engineering. So managing our commodities two a lower cost through more efficient packaging, trading different types of juices and things like that. So the $5 billion number does not include any savings from procurement at all. That's all captured in net commodity inflation."

Steve, I'd tell you, one of the things we did a while ago is really sit back and say how should we think about groups of countries and clusters of operations that make sense? And based on all the work we did, basically the world broke out into 8 clusters. North America's cluster 1, Western Europe is the next developed market was cluster 2, 3 was Latin America, 4 was Russia and Eastern Europe, 5 was Middle East and North Africa, cluster 6 was the Indian subcontinent, 7 was China and the whole Pacific Rim, and cluster 8 was Sub-Saharan Africa. So those were the 8 clusters. And North America was so big that grouping it together and not providing visibility into the pieces didn't make sense. So we kept North America separate in terms of North American Beverages and Frito-Lay and Quaker being so different but all other clusters, we just clean it up. Cluster 3 is Latin America, we put it together. And Sub-Saharan Africa, we have the snack business of South Africa and some reporting into Europe and beverages reporting to our Asian, Middle East sector, we just cleaned it up. So the segment changes that we reported were the cleanup of these clusters so that we can think of cluster strategies. So that's the first one and more and more our strategic thinking and designs for the future are based on how do we establish and grow our positions in each of these clusters. And more importantly, how do we get more productive working across our partners within each of the clusters? That's what we've been focused on. So the last 2 got cleaned up. In terms of personnel changes, as I talked to you earlier in my script, Talent Management is something that the Board and I are focused on a lot. I mean,, our board, the phenomenal board spends a lot of time thinking through succession for the top couple of hundred jobs. And one of the things we always look at is to see the bright talent across the company and that should be lifted up so that they can be part of a succession process in the company. And every time we get an opportunity, we figure out ways to lift him up in order to stretch people in order to really build exciting talent for the future. And that's what's the most recent changes enabled us to do. And just to give you an idea, let me talk about Brian Newman. And I have worked with Brian now for 20 years off and on. Brian started in corporate strategy but then went to China, he went to Russia, he went to Spain, worked in Europe and headquarters into Canada, was the Treasurer of the Pepsi bottling group. And both Hugh and I has been mentoring him now for 20 years, Hugh?"

And Eugene, likewise, come he's been running the T partnership but again a Dutch national who's worked in multiple countries and truly global executive. He travels 60%, 70% of his time in every part of the world. I remember when he was running Turkey, he learned Turkish. Everywhere he goes, he becomes a national. And again, a very exciting executive. And you all get a chance to see these people in action as we move along. And all of the people we are elevating, whether it's Laxman running Latin America, Ramon got additional responsibilities in Europe, Sanjeev was running a gigantic geography, you will see all of them over the next few quarters and, of course, you all know Al Carey and Tom Greco and so very, very well. So I think at you will find that what PepsiCo is doing is just reinforcing the fact that we're a talent academy. And as a company that's looking for that always PepsiCo. So we have the constantly make sure that our best and brightest will move up and we keep them engaged and excited about the company.

And then second question is just really talking about your global e-commerce efforts. It's not an easy I guess opportunity for CPG companies. So can you just give us some perspective on what efforts you've made are really the and what are some of the other opportunities us to think over the next few years?"

Interesting question because I think in global snacks, we got an interesting position because our is savory snacks. And we are very, very strong player in savory snacks. First of all, globally, we still have a lot of growth within savory snack",476,"Sure, Judy. Interesting question because I think in global snacks, we got an interesting position because our is savory snacks. And we are very, very strong player in savory snacks. First of all, globally, we still have a lot of growth within savory snacks. We came from a salty, crisp snack background. And we are expanding more and more into other savory snacks, be it crackers, be it nuts and seeds. We're expanding to those areas. There's a lot of opportunity there. I see growth in global snacks along 2 dimensions. Dimension 1 is a company wins throughout snacks and that's what going to be it's because many of our snacks are consumed by themselves. Other times our snacks serve as sort of substrate upon which you can put on the products like cyber humus, dips. So that's one vector to grow, and we still haven't scratched the surface, and we've got lots of growth. The other area is taking away eating occasions from other macro snacks category. It's interesting, unlike beverages, in the case of snacks, we can go often take eating occasions from other macro snacks be it cookies or confectionary or chocolate. And our goal is to focus on what we're doing but looking at our signs of demand spaces, which I talked about refleet, look at each eating occasion, our cohort group and figure out how we can leverage our salty-snack platform to go after other macro snacks, be it replace salty occasion or do some sort of salty sweet domination, for example, spaces with cinnamon sugar. It's based on a pita chip but certainly sweet when you taste it and has a much better mouth feel and experience than if you eat something totally sweet by itself. That's my perspective. So I think that our growth is all about growing the core and then leveraging all of the other eating occasions, taking share away from other macro snacks and other savory snacks. In addition, I think it's leveraging the beverage location to really figure out how to go into all retail outlets of beverages that are in already because beverage retail, our penetration is much higher than stocks. If you leverage that retail base, it gives you a lot more opportunities for growth. And internationally, we are leveraging in-store promotional displays a lot more. I mean, I was in the Middle East a few months ago, and I was just amazed to see the in-store displays of Lays and Pepsi. And again with the shares of Pepsi that we have it there, it is really a powerful in-store promotion that results in tremendous lift. So the opportunities for growth by itself and in combination beverages are pretty significant. So with that, let me turn to Hugh to talk about global e-commerce because he's the leader of the global e-commerce activities. Hugh?"

I guess I'd make just a couple of quick comments to start a dialogue on that. Number one, global e-commerce means can mean so many things, anywhere from just changing the way the product is ordered and paid, the so-called click-and-collect model, where people order online and they'll pick up products at their local retail outlet all the way through to in China, where the product is delivered significantly to door and in more and more proportions of the overall stand. Clearly, one of the leading areas to the U.K., where you see retailers also doing a lot more delivery to store, all the way through to new emerging players like the blue aprons of the world war as we sort of designing meal solutions and fill in the sign moments for consumers by giving them an entire repackaged millage you see in some markets in the U.S. and starting to expand outside the U.S. as well. From the perspective of PepsiCo, really be happy 2 ways. Number one is that the existing products going through the existing channels come either current retailers or the traditional online retailers, and then second, really looking hard the demand moments of designing products that fit the e-commerce types of distribution channels and e-commerce types of consumers in a more tailored way. So that sort of a very brief view towards what's happening in the e-commerce world. The biggest opportunity obviously these to be able to have one-on-one relationship with those consumers than we've ever had in the past through traditionally the linear TV advertising. I expect you'll see a lot more from us in this regard but that's probably the best 2 minutes that I can give in terms of what it is that we're doing right now."

Europe is a difficult economy between East and the West. There's some sort of volatility there all that time. I think today, year-to-date, we are the best performing European CPG company based on all the numbers we've looked at. If you combine East and West, if you look at them individually, both from the top line and the profit performance, we're performing the best. The challenge in Europe is, especially with Russia there, the high street battle in the U.K. and going on, it's very important to play a very judicious game between revenue and profits. And we've been playing that game very, very carefully. And if you look at our year-to-date numbers, I wouldn't look at it on a quarterly basis, I'll look at it on a year-to-date basis.

And we feel comfortable of what the team is doing and that's what we intend to keep doing for the balance of the year.

I think we're one of those companies that are doing a wonderful balance of growing the top line and delivering productivity. And that's what we want to focus on. Swinging the pendulum too much cost-cutting I don't think is a good idea at all because it just jeopardizes the future of the company. So we look at opportunities for in shrink the cost base and get more lean and mean but without sacrificing our ability to innovate and grow. And that's really all I have to say in this matter.

China, Egypt and the Philippines achieved high single-digit organic revenue growth. And Mexico achieved mid-single-digit organic revenue growth.

So today, we'll focus primarily on innovation and touch briefly on the others. And on future calls, we'll highlight one of each of the other initiatives. So let me begin with innovation.
Our innovation success to date is the result of significant investments in and changes to our innovation, research and development capabilities and processes that began about 8 years ago. At that time, we were an extremely decentralized organization, operating as a loose confederation of geographic business units with each largely driving its own development agenda and establishing their own processes. Development was focused largely on product line extensions, and that structure, while effective in its time, led to less efficient use of resources with redundant projects often being undertaken in different parts of the world and suboptimal resource allocation to the most promising ideas.
As a result, much of our innovation lacked staying power. In part, this had to do with the quality of our innovation, but it also had to do with the inability to appropriately incubate innovation in the marketplace. And to advance these opportunities, we undertook a major transformation to improve our R&D function and innovation capabilities. Specifically, we established global category groups charged with coordinating global innovation. This resulted in a more focused innovation agenda, a greater emphasis on development platforms rather than product line extensions only and more efficient allocation of development resources as we have significantly reduced redundant efforts through better coordination.
Two, we globally adopted the proprietary demand moment framework originally developed at Frito-Lay North America. The framework focuses on the triggers of consumption by examining consumer needs based on the context of the occasion. This created a much stronger linkage between consumer and shopper insights in the R&D function and has led to our innovation being more incremental to top line growth. Three, we implemented a common disciplined stage-gate process to gain better visibility into multiyear pipeline of R&D projects to allocate resources to the most promising ideas and new platforms and to ensure a better balance of refresh, reframe and breakthrough innovations.
Four, to facilitate more rapid lift and shift of our most successful innovation launches from one market to another, we provided our businesses with better visibility into new products and their performance around the globe. Five, we increased our investment in R&D starting in 2008. In fact, from 2011 to 2014 alone, our investment in R&D has increased almost 40%.
Next, more recently, we established a design capability topped with world-class design talent. Increasingly, we are involving design in the early stages of innovation, taking into account the entire purchase-to-consumption cycle to create truly memorable experiences for our consumers. And lastly, we are using reverse engineering, leveraging our learnings in developing and emerging markets to yield the benefits of thinking more holistically about low-cost design of new products, packaging and equipment without sacrificing quality.
We are pleased with the progress we've made across all these fronts and the tangible results we have seen. Innovation as a percentage of total revenue reached 9% in 2014, an improvement of 150 basis points compared to 2 years ago. Three PepsiCo products received the 2015 Nielsen Breakthrough Innovation Award. This award recognizes the most successful and enduring new CPG products launched in the U.S. in 2013. PepsiCo was the only company to receive multiple awards this year.
And over the past 3 years, we have introduced a number of new products that have achieved or are on pace to achieve more than $100 million each in annual retail sales, including Tostitos Cantina, Mountain Dew Kickstart, Doritos/Cheetos fun multipack mix and Gatorade Fierce Blue Cherry and Frost Glacier Cherry. More recently, we are successfully using premium innovation within key categories to capture more price realizations. We relaunched Caleb's Kola and launched DEWshine, a craft premium soda inspired by Mountain Dew's brand roots in the backwoods of Tennessee. 
We're also innovating on packaging. Capitalizing on the success of our consumer-engaging Lay's Do Us A Flavor campaign, we launched Lay's Summer Days campaign, encouraging fans to create custom digital bags of Lay's potato chips featuring photos of their favorite summer moments to share with friends and family on social media. Adding excitement to this experience, 10,000 lucky fans will receive a real-life customized bag of Lay's classic potato chips featuring the photo they digitally submitted, offering consumers personalized packaging for the first time in the brand's history.
We're also capitalizing on consumer health and wellness demand. As consumers are embracing almond milk and other plant-based proteins as an alternative to traditional dairy milk, Naked Juice has launched 2 new nut milks, dairy almond nut milk and peachy almond nut milk. And in Quaker Foods North America, our new quick-cook, steel-cut innovation has propelled us to the #1 market position in the on-trend and growing steel-cut oatmeal segment by making preparation much more convenient.
Channel-focused innovation is advancing our foodservice business. We are launching a new line of craft soft drinks called Stubborn Soda in fountain  this summer. The Stubborn lineup includes unique and contemporary takes on traditional craft flavors. Flavors include black cherry tarragon, lemon berry acai, agave vanilla cream and pineapple cream. They contain no high-fructose corn syrup and are made with fair-trade-certified cane sugar and natural flavors. And of course, we continue to refresh and reframe our key brands to maintain a high level of consumer engagement and excitement.
Now innovation has also contributed to good market share performance in the second quarter in the United States, and I believe our results are impressive. We held LRB value share while delivering strong net price realization. We gained value share across important subcategories, including sport drinks and ready-to-drink teas. Gatorade share of sports drinks surpassed 80%. 
Mountain Dew gained 40 basis points of value share within the CSD category in Q2. In fact, if you add Kickstart, DEWshine and BAJA and Sangrita Blast together, it represents more than 2 points of CSD value share in the most recent 4-week period, placing our recent Mountain Dew innovation by itself as the fourth-largest flavored CSD behind basic Mountain Dew, Dr. Pepper and Sprite.
In Q2, we grew retail sales in measured channels in the U.S. for regular colas and Mountain Dew within CSDs; for Gatorade, Lipton Tea and Naked Juice within our noncarb portfolio. And in Frito-Lay, we held value share in savory snacks, and in Quaker Foods, we gained value share in key categories, hot and ready-to-eat cereals, while expanding gross margin and stepping up advertising and marketing at the same time.
And our innovation is driving growth for our retail partners as well. In the second quarter, PepsiCo was once again the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth among all food and beverage manufacturers, with over $400 million of retail sales growth in all measured channels. This was more than 2x the next largest contributor to growth and represented more growth than the next 14 largest manufacturers combined. 
Notably, North America Beverages was the key driver of U.S. retail sales growth within PepsiCo and the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth on a stand-alone basis. Our intention is to continue to invest in innovation, build upon our already strong capability base and further sharpen our holistic innovation process to drive greater growth for our customers, create compelling products for our consumers and ultimately increase the contribution of new products to our total revenue.
So that's the story on innovation. Turning now to execution. We have ramped up our execution focus across the value chain from seed to shelf. We have established clear, consistent performance metrics to track and benchmark the effectiveness and efficiency of everyone of our core value-driving activities from safety to manufacturing utilization to transport efficiency to promotional display execution. Execution is a never-ending journey, and there will always be an opportunity to raise the game of the below-average performers, in either manufacturing lines or DSD routes. But we are seeing solid execution and steady improvement across the enterprise, and this is translating into good market-based performance and financial results.
Turning now to productivity and disciplined capital allocation. As you know, we have a goal of delivering $5 billion in productivity savings over 5 years from 2015 to 2019, which is approximately $1 billion per year. Our current program follows a similarly aggressive 3-year $3 billion program that we successfully concluded in 2014. And overall, our productivity initiatives are driving meaningful results. Over the 3 years ending in 2014, despite adverse ForEx, we have realized $1 billion of annual productivity savings, net revenue per employee is up 10% and EBIT per employee is up 9%. And since 2012, gross margins have consistently expanded.
Similarly, our capital allocation discipline is yielding meaningful results. From year-end 2011 to the second quarter of 2015, net CapEx as a percentage of revenue has improved from 4.9% to 4.1% on a rolling 4-quarter basis. And this 80 basis point reduction equates to approximately $500 million in incremental annual free cash flow. And since 2012 through the second quarter of 2015, core net ROIC has improved by 310 basis points to 18.4% on a rolling 4-quarter basis.
And finally, people renewal and development. This is an area that I and the board spend a lot of time on. Our focus is twofold here: making sure we have the right leaders in place today and that we are developing the next 2 generations of leadership for the company. And as all of you know, good talent management does not happen in short bursts. It requires taking a long-term view and very detailed analytical planning. 
At the core of our people renewal and management plan is the focus on the 200 critical leadership roles in our company. These are the roles that are most important to our success and that provide the greatest experiential development for our executives. For each of these roles, we have developed a pipeline that ensures that we have at least one immediate successor candidates, 2 people in a 1- to 3-year time frame and then another 3 people ready 4 to 6 years out. As a result of this process, we are deliberately developing top talent by giving them multiple category, geography and job experiences and ensuring we have well-developed succession plans. 
The other priority we have is ensuring that we have the right balance of homegrown talent and that we augment our talent pool from time to time with exceptional executives that were referred from outside the company. And I believe our plans are working. When we've had executive transitions, both planned and unplanned, they have been smooth and well coordinated. And as you look at our current leadership, you will find that executives had very broad critical experiences within PepsiCo over many years across functions, geographies and categories, people like Tom Greco, Al Carey, Sanjeev Chadha, Ramon Laguarta and Hugh Johnston; and folks that we brought into PepsiCo later in their careers to augment our skill base and stretch our thinking, people like Mehmood Khan, Laxman Narasimhan and Tony West.
And we are grooming our next generation of leadership by giving them critical experiences, people like Mike Spanos, who runs our Russia -- I mean, I'm sorry, our China operation; or Eugene Willemsen and Brian Newman, whose promotions we announced last night.
So to conclude, we are pleased with our financial performance for the first half of 2015 and with the progress we've made across our value-driving initiatives. Clearly, there are a number of macro challenges around the world, but we believe we have the right strategies and programs in place to enable us to continue to navigate successfully through the current environment. The construction of our products and geographic portfolios enable us to continue to deliver strong results, in part because our balanced portfolio creates a natural hedge against the global macro and political volatility that has become the new normal. And all of this bolsters our confidence in our ability to continue to achieve our financial targets.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Hugh."
32854,303797938,832558,"Pepsico, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 09, 2015",2015-07-09,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Turning directly to guidance. As Indra mentioned, based on the strength of our first half results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we've increased our full year core constant-currency EPS",538,"Great. Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Turning directly to guidance. As Indra mentioned, based on the strength of our first half results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we've increased our full year core constant-currency EPS growth target to 8% from 7% previously. Our other targets remain unchanged. 
For the full year 2015, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, core operating margin expansion as organic top line growth and productivity should offset negative geographic mix and commodity inflation, which incorporates the impact of transaction-related foreign exchange headwinds and approximately $1 billion of productivity savings.
Below the division operating line, we continue to expect corporate costs to be lower, a core tax rate of approximately 25% and a reduced share count. 
We expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact net revenue and core earnings per share growth by approximately 9 and 11 percentage points, respectively, based on current market consensus rates. Our outlook for the year assumes translation of our Venezuela results at the SICAD rate of VEF 12.8 per U.S. dollar. Should circumstances dictate use of a higher rate, this would also negatively impact our U.S. dollar results. Taking our 2014 core EPS of $4.63 and applying our guidance and current market consensus of foreign exchange impact implies 2015 core EPS of approximately $4.49.
As you model out the third quarter, I'd ask you to consider the following. Foreign exchange translation should have an approximate 11-point unfavorable impact on the third quarter net revenue growth and an approximate 12-point unfavorable impact on third quarter core EPS growth based on current market consensus rates, and we expect a profit decline in QFNA as we lap last year's gain on the sale of its cereal business. Below the division operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to continue to increase in the third quarter versus last year, driven by higher interest rates and net debt balances, and our tax rate in the third quarter is expected to be higher than the third quarter of 2014.
From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect full year free cash flow of more than $7 billion. We expect our capital allocation discipline to continue to drive core ROIC improvement. This is building on the steady progress we've made in ROIC, with core net ROIC up 310 basis points from 2012 to 18.4% through the second quarter of 2015 on a rolling 4-quarter basis.
And consistent with prior outlook, we expect to return between approximately $8.5 billion and $9 billion to shareholders in 2015 through both dividends and share repurchases. As a reminder, our previously announced 7% dividend per share increase commenced with the June payment. Our annualized dividend is now $2.81, an approximate 60% payout ratio based on 2014 core EPS. This represents the 43rd consecutive year of annual dividend increases, and our annualized dividends per share have grown at 10% compound annual rate over the past 10 years. So to summarize, our core constant-currency earnings per share outlook for 2015 has improved from our last call, and free cash flow, disciplined capital allocation and returning cash to our shareholders remain top priorities for the company. 
With that, operator, we'll take the first question."

We are seeing success in Europe and AMEA with all of the power of one management of those regions. We're able to get more productivity, take out costs. And especially with volatile economies, we have to get more and more agile and more creative about how to take out costs, and it's not just costs within our systems, John. I think even with our bottling partners, there's an opportunity to cooperate and figure out how not to duplicate efforts between the 2 companies. And we are seeing those initiatives pay off in AMEA and Europe, and we decided now is the time to do it in Latin America. We're in the middle of a major productivity program in Latin American foods, and integrating Latin American beverages with foods gives us that much more of a cost base to work with. Lastly, given the volatility of those economies there, I think it's very important to be -- really become a lean, mean machine there in order to take the savings and reinvest it to grow the top line. So that's Latin America. Second is on the Frito volume. Again, we watched the Frito performance very carefully, as does Tom Greco and the Frito team. In our potato chip business, we were going through a revenue management program, and that revenue management program is actually yielding good revenue growth and improving top line growth and profitability for our retailers. And one of the results of the revenue management program is that it is going to impact volume because the price-pack architecture shifts some of the volume to certain bag sizes, which impacts volume in the short term, but over the long term, it's the right thing for the business. So those play out through balance of the year, then look at our results in 2016."

As you all know, we have provided pretty extensive disclosures in our 10-Qs and 10-K on the question. In the Q that we intend to file after today's market close, and consistent with past Qs, you'll see that Venezuela represents approximately 2% of our revenue and operating profit. We also have net monetary assets of approximately $335 million and nonmonetary assets of approximately $725 million. Now if we were to take all of that and go to SIMADI, Venezuela would then represent 0% or very slightly above 0% of our revenue and operating profits, so it's roughly a 2% hit on both revenue and operating profit. We'd have a charge of approximately $325 million related to the net monetary assets. It would also likely lead to an impairment of our nonmonetary assets. The one thing for investors to consider on this is from an economic standpoint this really would not represent a big impact on PepsiCo given that Venezuela is largely a self-sufficient, self-funding operation. We're not putting any capital to speak of in the country, and we've not been able to redeploy any of our Venezuela cash outside of Venezuela. So from the perspective of cash flow and cash management, it would not have a meaningful impact on cash returns."

Is there -- the flow of productivity savings? Just something that sort of raises that flag for the back half of the year that you won't continue to kind of see this -- the current growth."

We have big businesses in Russia. And as we model things out, we obviously try to ensure that we give investors appropriate guidance at least incorporating some of that volatility.

First, with respect to North American carbonated soft drinks and broadly in the industry, given more recent pricing discipline, which is taking hold. My question is, given this dynamic, how material does this change your view with respect to North American carbonated soft drink profit pool? And do you see mid-single-digit growth now as sort of more sustainable as you're looking out not just this year but longer term? And then as sort of a follow-up, sticking with North America Beverages, can you give us an update, Indra, on Diet Pepsi and the change to the formulation there your competitors are not following and how you're thinking about that? How are you defining success there with that product?"

I'm glad that there is disciplined pricing in the marketplace right now, and there's also innovation in CSD market basically from our end. And look, we will keep playing our game. We will focus on disciplined pricing, good revenue management, put CSD innovation out into the marketplace. And ultimately, it depends on the competitive situation, what the profit pool is in this whole CSD business or the North American beverage business in totality. But we believe this is the right way to participate and play in this very, very important and large segment. In terms of the Diet Pepsi, big business, and I think for some reason which we can't really explain, aspartame fell out of favor with some consumers. And from our perspective, we just want to make sure we have an offering for all of the consumers who want to switch out of aspartame, and we formulated a very, very good product which is aspartame-free and will be available in the market starting in late August. So for all of those consumers who are looking for an alternative to an aspartame-sweetened diet product, we will have a product. And for those consumers who still love Diet Pepsi with aspartame, we'll figure out how to make it available online. So I think this is a consumer-driven strategy, to offer all of the diet lovers a diet cola that's aspartame-free."

And it's product packaging, process innovation, but we're also spending a lot of time on revenue management, I mean really thinking through portion sizes, pack sizes.  And I think this combination of interesting products coming into the marketplace and interesting packages and interesting combinations of packages is what's resulting in incrementality on the revenue side and actually resulting in higher profit flow-through, and we are seeing it across carbonated soft drinks, I mean, whether it's DEWshine or BAJA BLAST or any of those products. And we are seeing it even in Europe and Russia and Latin America and AMEA, where, I'd say, creative revenue management tactics, coupled with innovation that cuts through the clutter, is resulting in flow-through to the bottom line. Again, I think in these environments, the focus should be on revenue and profit, not necessarily on volume growth. We focus more on unit growth, revenue and profit in these environments because a chase for volume results in the whole business hurting. So I think with revenue management, unit growth, value growth and profit is what we focus on. And that's what our innovation efforts are yielding to date, the almost 10%, I think the high 9s. Our innovation performance is something that is a significant step up, and we keep watching that metric very, very carefully."

Steve, I'd tell you, one of the things we did some time ago is really sit back from the world and say, ""How do we -- how should we think about groups of countries and clusters of operations that make sense?"" And based on all the work we did, basically, the world broke out into 8 clusters: North America is cluster 1, Western Europe as the next developed market was cluster 2, 3 was Latin America, 4 was Russia and Eastern Europe, 5 was Middle East and North Africa, cluster 6 was the Indian subcontinent, 7 was China and the whole Pacific Rim and cluster 8 was Sub-Sahara Africa. So those were the 8 clusters. And North America was so big that grouping it together and not providing visibility into the pieces didn't make sense, so we've kept North America separate in terms of North American beverages and Frito-Lay and Quaker being so different. But all other clusters, we just cleaned it up. Cluster 3 is Latin America, we put it together. And Sub-Sahara Africa, we had the snacks business of South Africa and Simba  reporting into Europe and beverages reporting to our Asia, Middle East sector. We just cleaned it up. So the segment changes that we reported were a cleanup of these clusters so that we can think of cluster strategies. So that's the first one. And more and more, our strategic thinking and designs for the future are based on how do we establish and grow our positions in each of these clusters and more importantly, how do we get more productive working across our partners within each of the clusters. That's what we've been focused on. So the last 2 got cleaned up. In terms of personnel changes, as I talked to you earlier in my script, talent management is something that the board and I are focused on a lot. I mean, our board, the phenomenal board, spends a lot of time thinking through succession for the top couple of hundred jobs. And one of the things we always look at to see is, well, there are bright talent across the company that should be lifted up so that they can be part of a succession process in the company. And every time we get an opportunity, we figure out ways to lift them up in order to stretch people in order to really build exciting talent for the future, and that's what's the most recent changes enabled us to do. And just to give you an idea, let me talk about Brian Newman. And I have worked with Brian now for 20 years, off and on. Brian started in corporate strategy but then went to China. He went to Russia. He went to Spain, worked in European headquarters, then to Canada, was the treasurer of the Pepsi bottling group. And both Hugh and I have been mentoring him now for 20 years, Hugh?"

And he is a person that speaks Mandarin Chinese, speaks multiple other languages and just a very great executive to lift up. And we're looking for opportunities to do that, and the departure of Enderson gave us that opportunity. And Eugene, likewise, he's been running the tea partnership, but again, a Dutch national who's worked in multiple countries and a truly global executive. He travels 60%, 70% of his time in every part of the world. I remember when he was running Turkey, he started to learn Turkish. Everywhere he goes, he becomes a national and again, a very exciting executive. And you all get a chance to see these people in action as we move along. And all of the people we are elevating, whether it's Laxman who is now going to be running Latin America, Ramon who's got additional responsibilities in Europe, Sanjeev who's running a gigantic geography, you'll see all of them over the next few quarters. And of course, you all know Al Carey and Tom Greco and Hugh very, very well. So I think that you'll find that what PepsiCo is doing is just reinforcing the fact that we're a talent academy, and any company that's looking for talent always raids PepsiCo. So we have to constantly make sure that our best and brightest will move up, and we keep them engaged and excited about the company. And that's my job and the job of the board, and that's what we're doing."

And then second question is just really talking about your global e-commerce efforts. It's not an easy, I guess, opportunity for CPG companies.

Interesting question because I think in global snacks, we're in an interesting position because our base is savory snacks, and we are very, very strong player in savory snacks. First of all, globally, we still have a lot of growth within savor",489,"Sure, Judy. Interesting question because I think in global snacks, we're in an interesting position because our base is savory snacks, and we are very, very strong player in savory snacks. First of all, globally, we still have a lot of growth within savory snacks. We came from a salty, crisp snack background, and we are expanding more and more into other savory snacks. Be it crackers, be it nuts and seeds, we're expanding into those areas. There's a lot of opportunity there. I see growth in global snacks along 2 dimensions. Dimension 1 is accompaniments to our snacks, and that's what made us go into dips. Because many of our snacks are consumed by themselves. Other times, our snacks serve as sort of substrate upon which you can put on meal-like products like our Sabra humus or our Tostitos dips. So that's one vector to grow. And we still haven't scratched the surface, and we've got lots of growth. The other area is taking away eating occasions from other macro snacks category. It's interesting, unlike beverages, in the case of snacks, we can go off and take eating occasions from other macro snacks, be it cookies or confectionary or chocolate. And our goal is to focus on what we are doing, but looking at our science of demand spaces, which I talked about briefly, look at each eating occasion by cohort group and figure out how we can leverage our salty-snack platform to go after other macro snacks, be it replace it with a salty occasion or do some sort of a salty-sweet combination, for example, Stacy's with cinnamon sugar. It is based on a pita chip but it's certainly sweet when you taste it and has a much better mouth feel and experience than if you eat something totally sweet by itself. That's my perspective. So I think that our growth is all about growing the core and then leveraging all of the other eating occasions, taking share away from other macro snacks and other savory snacks. In addition, I think it's leveraging the beverage occasion to really figure out how to go into all retail outlets of beverages are in already because beverages' retail outlet penetration is much higher than snacks. And so if you leverage that retail base, it gives you a lot more opportunities for growth. And internationally, we are leveraging in-store promotional displays a lot more. I mean, I was in the Middle East a few months ago, and I was just amazed to see the in-store displays of Lay's and Pepsi. And again, with the shares of Pepsi that we have there, it is really a powerful in-store promotion that results in tremendous lift. So the opportunities for growth, by itself and in combination with beverages, are pretty significant. So with that, let me turn to Hugh to talk about global e-commerce because he's the leader of the global e-commerce activities. Hugh?"

I guess I'd make just a couple of quick comments to start the dialogue on that. Number one, global e-commerce mean -- can mean so many things, anywhere from just changing the way the product is ordered and picked, the so-called click-and-collect model, where people order online and then they'll pick up products at their local retail outlet, all the way through to, in China, where the product is delivered significantly to door in more and more proportions of the overall spend. Clearly, one of the leading areas is to the U.K., where you see retailers also doing a lot more delivery to store, all the way through to new emerging players like the Blue Aprons of the world, who are actually sort of designing meal solutions, in effect filling demand moments for consumers by giving them an entire prepackaged meal, which you see in some urban markets in the U.S. and starting to expand outside the U.S. as well. From the perspective of PepsiCo, we're looking at it 2 ways. Number one is the existing products going through the existing channels, either current retailers or the traditional online retailers, and then second, really looking hard at demand moments and designing products that fit the e-commerce types of distribution channels and e-commerce types of consumers in a more tailored way. So that's sort of a very brief view towards what's happening in the e-commerce world. The biggest opportunity obviously is to be able to have durable [ph] one-on-one relationship with those consumers than we've ever had in the past through traditional linear TV advertising. I expect you'll see a lot more from us in this regard, but that's probably the best 2 minutes that I can give in terms of what it is that we're doing right now."

As I have said earlier and as Hugh reiterated, Nik, we are balancing top line and bottom line growth very, very judiciously. When you embark on a zero-based budgeting program that cuts cost to the bone and jeopardizes your ability to grow the top line, I think that's a formula for disaster. We believe on sort of smart spending initiatives where we look across all of our cost structure and see where we can selectively reduce cost intelligently, not for the short term but find a way to make sure it does not affect top line growth initiatives. So rest assured that we look at every possible way to make our company more efficient, and I think we are, as Hugh said, in the sweet spot of balancing investments against top line growth and figuring out ways to -- through automation, shared services, taking out work that's not needed, simplifying our processes, coordinating across the company, reducing our costs. And that's what we are focused on. 
And with that, let me reiterate that we are pleased with our results for the first half. We are confident that our plans are working and believe we are on the track to deliver our financial targets for 2015. I want to thank you, all, for your time and questions this morning and more importantly, for the confidence you've placed in us. Have a wonderful day."

Core constant-currency operating profit grew 8%, and core constant-currency EPS grew 11%. Based on the strength of the quarter, our overall first half results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year core constant-currency 2015 EPS growth outlook to 8%.
Our businesses are performing well, both on the top line and bottom line. PepsiCo Americas Beverages had an outstanding quarter. 3% organic revenue growth translated to 10% core currency operating profit growth. Frito-Lay North America delivered another quarter of very strong results, with organic revenue up 3% and core constant-currency operating profit up 7%. And our developing and emerging markets delivered 11% organic growth in the quarter, revenue growth, despite the ongoing volatility in many regions of the world.
Looking across some of our key D&E markets. Our businesses continued to prove resilient. Turkey and Saudi Arabia achieved double-digit organic revenue growth. China, Egypt and the Philippines achieved high single-digit organic revenue growth. And Mexico achieved mid-single-digit organic revenue growth.
Now I assume you've had a chance to read the release this morning. So rather than go through the numbers in detail by segment or country, what we will do on this call and going forward is to give you an update and provide a bit more detail on each of our big initiatives to drive performance, namely: innovation supported by sensible brand management, flawless execution, self-sustaining productivity, prudent capital allocation; and talent renewal and management.
So today, we'll focus primarily on innovation and touch briefly on the others. And on future calls, we'll highlight one of each of the other initiatives. So let me begin with innovation.
Our innovation success to date is the result of significant investments in and changes to our innovation, research and development capabilities and processes that began about 8 years ago. At that time, we were an extremely decentralized organization, operating as a loose confederation of geographic business units with each largely driving its own development agenda and establishing their own processes. Development was focused largely on product line extensions, and that structure, while effective in its time, led to less efficient use of resources with redundant projects often being undertaken in different parts of the world and suboptimal resource allocation to the most promising ideas.
As a result, much of our innovation lacked staying power. In part, this had to do with the quality of our innovation, but it also had to do with the inability to appropriately incubate innovation in the marketplace. And to advance these opportunities, we undertook a major transformation to improve our R&D function and innovation capabilities. Specifically, we established global category groups charged with coordinating global innovation. This resulted in a more focused innovation agenda, a greater emphasis on development platforms rather than product line extensions only and more efficient allocation of development resources, as we have significantly reduced redundant efforts through better coordination.
Two, we globally adopted the proprietary demand moment framework originally developed at Frito-Lay North America. The framework focuses on the triggers of consumption by examining consumer needs based on the context of the occasion. This created a much stronger linkage between consumer and shopper insights in the R&D function and has led to our innovation being more incremental to top line growth. Three, we implemented a common disciplined stage-gate process to gain better visibility into multiyear pipeline of R&D projects, to allocate resources to the most promising ideas and new platforms and to ensure a better balance of refresh, reframe and breakthrough innovations.
Four, to facilitate more rapid lift and shift of our most successful innovation launches from one market to another, we provided our businesses with better visibility into new products and their performance around the globe. Five, we increased our investment in R&D starting in 2008. In fact, from 2011 to 2014 alone, our investment in R&D has increased almost 40%.
Next, more recently, we established a design capability staffed with world-class design talent. Increasingly, we are involving design in the early stages of innovation, taking into account the entire purchase-to-consumption cycle to create truly memorable experiences for our consumers. And lastly, we are using reverse engineering, leveraging our learnings in developing and emerging markets to yield the benefits of thinking more holistically about low-cost design of new products, packaging and equipment without sacrificing quality.
We are pleased with the progress we've made across all these fronts and the tangible results we have seen. Innovation as a percentage of total revenue reached 9% in 2014, an improvement of 150 basis points compared to 2 years ago. Three PepsiCo products received the 2015 Nielsen Breakthrough Innovation Award. This award recognizes the most successful and enduring new CPG products launched in the U.S. in 2013. PepsiCo was the only company to receive multiple awards this year.
And over the past 3 years, we have introduced a number of new products that have achieved or are on pace to achieve more than $100 million each in annual retail sales, including Tostitos Cantina, Mountain Dew Kickstart, Doritos/Cheetos fun multipack mix and Gatorade Fierce Blue Cherry and Frost Glacier Cherry. More recently, we are successfully using premium innovation within key categories to capture more price realizations. We relaunched Caleb's Kola and launched DEWshine, a craft premium soda inspired by Mountain Dew's brand roots in the backwoods of Tennessee. 
We're also innovating on packaging. Capitalizing on the success of our consumer-engaging Lay's Do Us A Flavor campaign, we launched Lay's Summer Days campaign, encouraging fans to create custom digital bags of Lay's potato chips featuring photos of their favorite summer moments to share with friends and family on social media. Adding excitement to this experience, 10,000 lucky fans will receive a real-life customized bag of Lay's classic potato chips featuring the photo they digitally submitted, offering consumers personalized packaging for the first time in the brand's history.
We're also capitalizing on consumer health and wellness demand. As consumers are embracing almond milk and other plant-based proteins as an alternative to traditional dairy milk, Naked Juice has launched 2 new nut milks: Berry Almond Nutmilk and Peachy Almond Nutmilk. And in Quaker Foods North America, our new quick-cook, steel-cut innovation has propelled us to the #1 market position in the on-trend and growing steel-cut oatmeal segment by making preparation much more convenient.
Channel-focused innovation is advancing our foodservice business. We are launching a new line of craft soft drinks called Stubborn Soda in fountains this summer. The Stubborn lineup includes unique and contemporary takes on traditional craft flavors. Flavors include black cherry tarragon, lemon berry acai, agave vanilla cream and pineapple cream. They contain no high-fructose corn syrup and are made with fair-trade-certified cane sugar and natural flavors. And of course, we continue to refresh and reframe our key brands to maintain a high level of consumer engagement and excitement.
Now innovation has also contributed to good market share performance in the second quarter in the United States, and I believe our results are impressive. We held LRB value share while delivering strong net price realization. We gained value share across important subcategories, including sports drinks and ready-to-drink teas. Gatorade's share of sports drinks surpassed 80%. 
Mountain Dew gained 40 basis points of value share within the CSD category in Q2. In fact, if you add Kickstart, DEWshine and BAJA and Sangrita Blast together, it represents more than 2 points of CSD value share in the most recent 4-week period, placing our recent Mountain Dew innovation by itself as the fourth-largest flavored CSD behind basic Mountain Dew, Dr. Pepper and Sprite.
In Q2, we grew retail sales in measured channels in the U.S. for regular colas and Mountain Dew within CSDs; for Gatorade, Lipton Tea and Naked Juice within our noncarb portfolio. And in Frito-Lay, we held value share in savory snacks, and in Quaker Foods, we gained value share in key categories, hot and ready-to-eat cereals, while expanding gross margin and stepping up advertising and marketing at the same time.
And our innovation is driving growth for our retail partners as well. In the second quarter, PepsiCo was once again the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth among all food and beverage manufacturers, with over $400 million of retail sales growth in all measured channels. This was more than 2x the next largest contributor to growth and represented more growth than the next 14 largest manufacturers combined. 
Notably, North American Beverages was the key driver of U.S. retail sales growth within PepsiCo and the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth on a standalone basis. Our intention is to continue to invest in innovation, build upon our already strong capability base and further sharpen our holistic innovation process to drive greater growth for our customers, create compelling products for our consumers and ultimately increase the contribution of new products to our total revenue.
So that's the story on innovation. Turning now to execution. We have ramped up our execution focus across the value chain from seed to shelf. We have established clear, consistent performance metrics to track and benchmark the effectiveness and efficiency of every one of our core value-driving activities, from safety to manufacturing utilization, to transport efficiency, to promotional display execution. Execution is a never-ending journey, and there will always be an opportunity to raise the game of the below-average performers in either manufacturing lines or DSD routes. But we are seeing solid execution and steady improvement across the enterprise, and this is translating into good market-based performance and financial results.
Turning now to productivity and disciplined capital allocation. As you know, we have a goal of delivering $5 billion in productivity savings over 5 years from 2015 to 2019, which is approximately $1 billion per year. Our current program follows a similarly aggressive 3-year $3 billion program that we successfully concluded in 2014. And overall, our productivity initiatives are driving meaningful results. Over the 3 years ending in 2014, despite adverse ForEx, we have realized $1 billion of annual productivity savings, net revenue per employee is up 10% and EBIT per employee is up 9%. And since 2012, gross margins have consistently expanded.
Similarly, our capital allocation discipline is yielding meaningful results. From year-end 2011 to the second quarter of 2015, net CapEx as a percentage of net revenue has improved from 4.9% to 4.1% on a rolling 4-quarter basis. And this 80-basis-point reduction equates to approximately $500 million in incremental annual free cash flow. And since 2012 through the second quarter of 2015, core net ROIC has improved by 310 basis points to 18.4% on a rolling 4-quarter basis.
And finally, people renewal and development. This is an area that I and the board spend a lot of time on. Our focus is twofold here: making sure we have the right leaders in place today and that we are developing the next 2 generations of leadership for the company. And as all of you know, good talent management does not happen in short bursts. It requires taking a long-term view and very detailed analytical planning. 
At the core of our people renewal and management plan is the focus on the 200 critical leadership roles in our company. These are the roles that are most important to our success and that provide the greatest experiential development for our executives. For each of these roles, we have developed a pipeline that ensures that we have at least one immediate successor candidate, 2 people in a 1- to 3-year time frame and then another 3 people ready 4 to 6 years out. As a result of this process, we are deliberately developing top talent by giving them multiple category, geography and job experiences and ensuring we have well developed succession plans. 
The other priority we have is ensuring that we have the right balance of homegrown talent and that we augment our talent pool from time to time with exceptional executives that were referred from outside the company. And I believe our plans are working. When we've had executive transitions, both planned and unplanned, they have been smooth and well-coordinated. And as you look at our current leadership, you will find that executives have had very broad critical experiences within PepsiCo over many years across functions, geographies and categories, people like Tom Greco, Al Carey, Sanjeev Chadha, Ramon Laguarta and Hugh Johnston; and folks that we brought into PepsiCo later in their careers to augment our skill base and stretch our thinking, people like Mehmood Khan, Laxman Narasimhan and Tony West.
And we are grooming our next generation of leadership by giving them critical experiences, people like Mike Spanos, who runs our Russia -- I mean, I'm sorry, our China operation; or Eugene Willemsen and Brian Newman, whose promotions we announced last night.
So to conclude, we are pleased with our financial performance for the first half of 2015 and with the progress we've made across our value-driving initiatives. Clearly, there are a number of macro challenges around the world, but we believe we have the right strategies and programs in place to enable us to continue to navigate successfully through the current environment. The construction of our products and geographic portfolios enable us to continue to deliver strong results, in part because our balanced portfolio creates a natural hedge against the global macro and political volatility that has become the new normal. And all of this bolsters our confidence in our ability to continue to achieve our financial targets.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Hugh."
32854,303797938,832571,"Pepsico, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 09, 2015",2015-07-09,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Turning directly to guidance. As Indra mentioned, based on the strength of our first half results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we've increased our full year core constant-currency EPS",536,"Great. Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Turning directly to guidance. As Indra mentioned, based on the strength of our first half results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we've increased our full year core constant-currency EPS growth target to 8% from 7% previously. Our other targets remain unchanged. 
For the full year 2015, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth; core operating margin expansion, as organic top line growth and productivity should offset negative geographic mix and commodity inflation, which incorporates the impact of transaction-related foreign exchange headwinds; and approximately $1 billion of productivity savings.
Below the division operating line, we continue to expect corporate costs to be lower, a core tax rate of approximately 25% and a reduced share count. 
We expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact net revenue and core earnings per share growth by approximately 9 and 11 percentage points, respectively, based on current market consensus rates. Our outlook for the year assumes translation of our Venezuela results at the SICAD rate of VEF 12.8 per U.S. dollar. Should circumstances dictate use of a higher rate, this would also negatively impact our U.S. dollar results. Taking our 2014 core EPS of $4.63 and applying our guidance and current market consensus of foreign exchange impact implies 2015 core EPS of approximately $4.49.
As you model out the third quarter, I'd ask you to consider the following. Foreign exchange translation should have an approximate 11-point unfavorable impact on the third quarter net revenue growth and an approximate 12-point unfavorable impact on third quarter core EPS growth based on current market consensus rates. And we expect a profit decline in QFNA as we lap last year's gain on the sale of the cereal business. Below the division operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to continue to increase in the third quarter versus last year, driven by higher interest rates and net debt balances, and our tax rate in the third quarter is expected to be higher than the third quarter of 2014.
From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect full year free cash flow of more than $7 billion. We expect our capital allocation discipline to continue to drive core ROIC improvement. This is building on the steady progress we've made in ROIC, with core net ROIC up 310 basis points from 2012 to 18.4% through the second quarter of 2015 on a rolling 4-quarter basis.
And consistent with prior outlook, we expect to return between approximately $8.5 billion and $9 billion to shareholders in 2015 through both dividends and share repurchases. As a reminder, our previously announced 7% dividend-per-share increase commenced with the June payment. Our annualized dividend is now $2.81, an approximate 60% payout ratio based on 2014 core EPS. This represents the 43rd consecutive year of annual dividend increases, and our annualized dividends per share have grown at 10% compound annual rate over the past 10 years. So to summarize, our core constant-currency earnings per share outlook for 2015 has improved from our last call, and free cash flow, disciplined capital allocation and returning cash to our shareholders remain top priorities for the company. 
With that, operator, we'll take the first question."

We are seeing success in Europe and AMEA with all of the Power of One management of those regions. We're able to get more productivity, take out costs. And especially with volatile economies, we have to get more and more agile and more creative about how to take out costs, and it's not just costs within our systems, John. I think even with our bottling partners, there's an opportunity to cooperate and figure out how not to duplicate efforts between the 2 companies. And we are seeing those initiatives pay off in AMEA and Europe, and we decided now is the time to do it in Latin America. We're in the middle of a major productivity program in Latin American foods, and integrating Latin American beverages with foods gives us that much more of a cost base to work with. Lastly, given the volatility of those economies there, I think it's very important to be -- really become a lean, mean machine there in order to take the savings and reinvest it to grow the top line. So that's Latin America. Second is on the Frito volume. Again, we watch the Frito performance very carefully, as does Tom Greco and the Frito team. In our potato chip business, we were going through a revenue management program, and that revenue management program is actually yielding good revenue growth and improving top line growth and profitability for our retailers. And one of the results of the revenue management program is that it is going to impact volume because the price-pack architecture shifts some of the volume to certain bag sizes, which impacts volume in the short term, but over the long term, it's the right thing for the business. So I'd let it play out through balance of the year, then look at our results in 2016."

As you all know, we have provided pretty extensive disclosures in our 10-Qs and 10-K on the question. In the Q that we intend to file after today's market close, and consistent with past Qs, you'll see that Venezuela represents approximately 2% of our revenue and operating profit. We also have net monetary assets of approximately $335 million and nonmonetary assets of approximately $725 million. Now if we were to take all of that and go to SIMADI, Venezuela would then represent 0% or very slightly above 0% of our revenue and operating profits, so it's roughly a 2% hit on both revenue and operating profit. We'd have a charge of approximately $325 million related to the net monetary assets. It would also likely lead to an impairment of our nonmonetary assets. The one thing for investors to consider on this is, from an economic standpoint, this really would not represent a big impact on PepsiCo given that Venezuela is largely a self-sufficient, self-funding operation. We're not putting any capital to speak of in the country, and we've not been able to redeploy any of our Venezuela cash outside of Venezuela. So from the perspective of cash flow and cash management, it would not have a meaningful impact on cash returns."

Number two, you're correct, commodities are more of a headwind in the back half of the year than they were in the first half of the year. And number three, again, recall, certainly based on what we're seeing in the news these days, the world remains a very volatile place. We have big businesses in the Middle East. We have big businesses in Russia. And as we model things out, we obviously try to ensure that we give investors appropriate guidance, at least incorporating some of that volatility. So we're not assuming the perfect sunny day going forward as well. So that's what goes into our thinking as you look at the so-called squeeze chart between the first half and the second half of the year."

And ultimately, it depends on the competitive situation, what the profit pool is in this whole CSD business or the North American beverage business in totality. But we believe this is the right way to participate and play in this very, very important and large segment. In terms of Diet Pepsi, big business, and I think for some reason which we can't really explain, aspartame fell out of favor with some consumers. And from our perspective, we just want to make sure we have an offering for all of the consumers who want to switch out of aspartame. And we formulated a very, very good product which is aspartame-free and will be available in the market starting in late August. So for all of those consumers who are looking for an alternative to an aspartame-sweetened diet product, we will have a product. And for those consumers who still love Diet Pepsi with aspartame, we'll figure out how to make it available online.

And it's product packaging, process innovation, but we're also spending a lot of time on revenue management, I mean, really thinking through portion sizes, pack sizes.

And we are seeing it across carbonated soft drinks, I mean, whether it's DEWshine or BAJA BLAST or any of those products. And we are seeing it even in Europe and Russia and Latin America and AMEA, where, I'd say, creative revenue management tactics, coupled with innovation that cuts through the clutter, is resulting in flow-through to the bottom line. Again, I think in these environments, the focus should be on revenue and profit, not necessarily on volume growth. We focus more on unit growth, revenue and profit in these environments because a chase for volume results in the whole business hurting. So I think with revenue management, unit growth, value growth and profit is what we focus on. And that's what our innovation efforts are yielding to date, the almost 10%, I think the high 9s. Our innovation performance is something that is a significant step up, and we keep watching that metric very, very carefully."

Steve, I'd tell you, one of the things we did some time ago is really sit back from the world and say, ""How do we -- how should we think about groups of countries and clusters of operations that make sense?"" And based on all the work we did, basically, the world broke out into 8 clusters: North America is cluster 1, Western Europe as the next developed market was cluster 2, 3 was Latin America, 4 was Russia and Eastern Europe, 5 was Middle East and North Africa, cluster 6 was the Indian subcontinent, 7 was China and the whole Pacific Rim and cluster 8 was Sub-Saharan Africa. So those were the 8 clusters. And North America is so big that grouping it together and not providing visibility into the pieces didn't make sense, so we've kept North America separate in terms of North American beverages and Frito-Lay and Quaker being so different. But all other clusters, we just cleaned it up. Cluster 3 is Latin America, we put it together. And Sub-Saharan Africa, we had the snacks business of South Africa and Simba reporting into Europe and beverages reporting to our Asia, Middle East sector. We just cleaned it up. So the segment changes that we reported were a cleanup of these clusters so that we can think of cluster strategies. So that's the first one. And more and more, our strategic thinking and designs for the future are based on how do we establish and grow our positions in each of these clusters, and more importantly, how do we get more productive working across our partners within each of the clusters. That's what we've been focused on. So the last 2 got cleaned up. In terms of personnel changes, as I talked to you earlier in my script, talent management is something that the board and I are focused on a lot. I mean, our board, the phenomenal board, spends a lot of time thinking through succession for the top couple of hundred jobs. And one of the things we always look at to see is, well, there are bright talent across the company that should be lifted up so that they can be part of a succession process in the company. And every time we get an opportunity, we figure out ways to lift them up in order to stretch people, in order to really build exciting talent for the future, and that's what the most recent changes enabled us to do. And just to give you an idea, let me talk about Brian Newman. And I have worked with Brian now for 20 years, off and on. Brian started in corporate strategy but then went to China. He went to Russia. He went to Spain, worked in European headquarters, then to Canada, was the treasurer of the Pepsi bottling group. And both Hugh and I have been mentoring him now for 20 years, Hugh?"

And he is a person that speaks Mandarin Chinese, speaks multiple other languages and just a very great executive to lift up. And we're looking for opportunities to do that, and the departure of Enderson gave us that opportunity. And Eugene, likewise, he's been running the tea partnership, but again, a Dutch national who's worked in multiple countries and a truly global executive. He travels 60%, 70% of his time in every part of the world. I remember when he was running Turkey, he started to learn Turkish. Everywhere he goes, he becomes a national and again, a very exciting executive. And you'll all get a chance to see these people in action as we move along. And all of the people we are elevating, whether it's Laxman who is now going to be running Latin America, Ramon who's got additional responsibilities in Europe, Sanjeev who's running a gigantic geography, you'll see all of them over the next few quarters. And of course, you all know Al Carey and Tom Greco and Hugh very, very well. So I think that you'll find that what PepsiCo is doing is just reinforcing the fact that we're a talent academy, and any company that's looking for talent always raids PepsiCo. So we have to constantly make sure that our best and brightest will move up, and we keep them engaged and excited about the company.

First of all, globally, we still have a lot of growth within sav",490,"Sure, Judy. Interesting question because I think in global snacks, we're in an interesting position because our base is savory snacks, and we are a very, very strong player in savory snacks. First of all, globally, we still have a lot of growth within savory snacks. We came from a salty, crisp snack background, and we are expanding more and more into other savory snacks. Be it crackers, be it nuts and seeds, we're expanding into those areas. There's a lot of opportunity there. I see growth in global snacks along 2 dimensions. Dimension 1 is accompaniments to our snacks, and that's what made us go into dips. Because many of our snacks are consumed by themselves. Other times, our snacks serve as sort of substrate upon which you can put on meal-like products like our Sabra hummus or our Tostitos dips. So that's one vector to grow. And we still haven't scratched the surface, and we've got lots of growth. The other area is taking away eating occasions from other macro snacks category. It's interesting, unlike beverages, in the case of snacks, we can go off and take eating occasions from other macro snacks, be it cookies or confectionary or chocolate. And our goal is to focus on what we are doing, but looking at our science of demand spaces, which I talked about briefly, look at each eating occasion by cohort group and figure out how we can leverage our salty-snack platform to go after other macro snacks, be it replace it with a salty occasion or do some sort of a salty-sweet combination, for example, Stacy's with cinnamon sugar. It is based on a pita chip but it's certainly sweet when you taste it and has a much better mouth feel and experience than if you eat something totally sweet by itself. That's my perspective. So I think that our growth is all about growing the core and then leveraging all of the other eating occasions, taking share away from other macro snacks and other savory snacks. In addition, I think it's leveraging the beverage occasion to really figure out how to go into all retail outlets our beverages are in already because beverages' retail outlet penetration is much higher than snacks. And so if you leverage that retail base, it gives you a lot more opportunities for growth. And internationally, we are leveraging in-store promotional displays a lot more. I mean, I was in the Middle East a few months ago, and I was just amazed to see the in-store displays of Lay's and Pepsi. And again, with the shares of Pepsi that we have there, it is really a powerful in-store promotion that results in tremendous lift. So the opportunities for growth, by itself and in combination with beverages, are pretty significant. So with that, let me turn to Hugh to talk about global e-commerce because he's the leader of the global e-commerce activities. Hugh?"

I guess I'd make just a couple of quick comments to start the dialogue on that. Number one, global e-commerce mean -- can mean so many things, anywhere from just changing the way the product is ordered and picked, the so-called click-and-collect model, where people order online and then they'll pick up products at their local retail outlet, all the way through to, in China, where the product is delivered significantly to door in more and more proportions of the overall spend. Clearly, one of the leading areas is to the U.K., where you see retailers also doing a lot more delivery to store, all the way through to new emerging players like the Blue Aprons of the world, who are actually sort of designing meal solutions, in effect filling demand moments for consumers by giving them an entire prepackaged meal, which you see in some urban markets in the U.S. and starting to expand outside the U.S. as well. From the perspective of PepsiCo, we're looking at it 2 ways. Number one is the existing products going through the existing channels, either current retailers or the traditional online retailers. And then second, really looking hard at demand moments and designing products that fit the e-commerce types of distribution channels and e-commerce types of consumers in a more tailored way. So that's sort of a very brief view towards what's happening in the e-commerce world. The biggest opportunity, obviously, is to be able to have durable [ph] one-on-one relationship with those consumers than we've ever had in the past through traditional linear TV advertising. I expect you'll see a lot more from us in this regard, but that's probably the best 2 minutes that I can give in terms of what it is that we're doing right now."

I think today, year-to-date, we are the best-performing European CPG company based on all the numbers we've looked at. If you combine East and West or whether you look at them individually, both on the top line and the profit performance, we are performing the best. The challenge in Europe is, especially with Russia there -- the High Street battle in the U.K. going on, I think it's very important we play a very judicious game between revenue and profits. And we've been playing that game very, very carefully. And if you look at our year-to-date numbers -- I wouldn't look at it on a quarterly basis, I'd look at it on a year-to-date basis. I think on a year-to-date basis, we are performing at or above our expectations in Europe. And we feel comfortable with what the team is doing, and that's what we intend to keep doing the balance of the year. And in terms of cost-cutting opportunities, Hugh recently talked about what other opportunities exist. But in terms of employees, look, nobody likes cost cutting. Everybody likes growth. I think we're one of those companies that are doing a wonderful balance of growing the top line and delivering productivity, and that's what we want to focus on. Swinging the pendulum too much to cost cutting I don't think is a good idea at all because it just jeopardizes the future of the company. So we look at opportunities to shrink the cost base and get more lean and mean, but without sacrificing our ability to innovate and grow. And that's really all I have to say in this matter. Do you want to add anything, Hugh?"

As I have said earlier and as Hugh reiterated, Nik, we are balancing top line and bottom line growth very, very judiciously. When you embark on a zero-based budgeting program that cuts cost to the bone and jeopardizes your ability to grow the top line, I think that's a formula for disaster. We believe in sort of smart spending initiatives, where we look across all of our cost structure and see where we can selectively reduce costs intelligently, not for the short term, but find a way to make sure it does not affect top line growth initiatives. So rest assured that we look at every possible way to make our company more efficient, and I think we are, as Hugh said, in the sweet spot of balancing investments against top line growth and figuring out ways to -- through automation, shared services, taking out work that's not needed, simplifying our processes, coordinating across the company, reducing our costs. And that's what we are focused on. 
And with that, let me reiterate that we are pleased with our results for the first half.

Our businesses are performing well, both on the top line and bottom line. PepsiCo Americas Beverages had an outstanding quarter. 3% organic revenue growth translated to 10% core currency operating profit growth. Frito-Lay North America delivered another quarter of very strong results, with organic revenue up 3% and core constant-currency operating profit up 7%. And our developing and emerging markets delivered 11% organic growth in the quarter, revenue growth, despite the ongoing volatility in many regions of the world.
Looking across some of our key D&E markets. Our businesses continued to prove resilient. Turkey and Saudi Arabia achieved double-digit organic revenue growth. China, Egypt and the Philippines achieved high single-digit organic revenue growth. And Mexico achieved mid-single-digit organic revenue growth.
Now I assume you've had a chance to read the release this morning. So rather than go through the numbers in detail by segment or country, what we will do on this call and going forward is to give you an update and provide a bit more detail on each of our big initiatives to drive performance, namely: innovation supported by sensible brand management, flawless execution, self-sustaining productivity, prudent capital allocation; and talent renewal and management.
So today, we'll focus primarily on innovation and touch briefly on the others. And on future calls, we'll highlight one of each of the other initiatives. So let me begin with innovation.
Our innovation success to date is the result of significant investments in and changes to our innovation, research and development capabilities and processes that began about 8 years ago. At that time, we were an extremely decentralized organization, operating as a loose confederation of geographic business units with each largely driving its own development agenda and establishing their own processes. Development was focused largely on product line extensions, and that structure, while effective in its time, led to less efficient use of resources with redundant projects often being undertaken in different parts of the world and suboptimal resource allocation to the most promising ideas.
As a result, much of our innovation lacked staying power. In part, this had to do with the quality of our innovation, but it also had to do with the inability to appropriately incubate innovation in the marketplace. And to advance these opportunities, we undertook a major transformation to improve our R&D function and innovation capabilities. Specifically, we established global category groups charged with coordinating global innovation. This resulted in a more focused innovation agenda, a greater emphasis on development platforms rather than product line extensions only and more efficient allocation of development resources, as we have significantly reduced redundant efforts through better coordination.
Two, we globally adopted the proprietary demand moment framework originally developed at Frito-Lay North America. The framework focuses on the triggers of consumption by examining consumer needs based on the context of the occasion. This created a much stronger linkage between consumer and shopper insights in the R&D function and has led to our innovation being more incremental to top line growth. Three, we implemented a common disciplined stage-gate process to gain better visibility into multiyear pipeline of R&D projects, to allocate resources to the most promising ideas and new platforms and to ensure a better balance of refresh, reframe and breakthrough innovations.
Four, to facilitate more rapid lift and shift of our most successful innovation launches from one market to another, we provided our businesses with better visibility into new products and their performance around the globe. Five, we increased our investment in R&D starting in 2008. In fact, from 2011 to 2014 alone, our investment in R&D has increased almost 40%.
Next, more recently, we established a design capability staffed with world-class design talent. Increasingly, we are involving design in the early stages of innovation, taking into account the entire purchase-to-consumption cycle to create truly memorable experiences for our consumers. And lastly, we are using reverse engineering, leveraging our learnings in developing and emerging markets to yield the benefits of thinking more holistically about low-cost design of new products, packaging and equipment without sacrificing quality.
We are pleased with the progress we've made across all these fronts and the tangible results we have seen. Innovation as a percentage of total revenue reached 9% in 2014, an improvement of 150 basis points compared to 2 years ago. Three PepsiCo products received the 2015 Nielsen Breakthrough Innovation Award. This award recognizes the most successful and enduring new CPG products launched in the U.S. in 2013. PepsiCo was the only company to receive multiple awards this year.
And over the past 3 years, we have introduced a number of new products that have achieved or are on pace to achieve more than $100 million each in annual retail sales, including Tostitos Cantina, Mountain Dew Kickstart, Doritos/Cheetos fun multipack mix and Gatorade Fierce Blue Cherry and Frost Glacier Cherry. More recently, we are successfully using premium innovation within key categories to capture more price realizations. We relaunched Caleb's Kola and launched DEWshine, a craft premium soda inspired by Mountain Dew's brand roots in the backwoods of Tennessee. 
We're also innovating on packaging. Capitalizing on the success of our consumer-engaging Lay's Do Us A Flavor campaign, we launched Lay's Summer Days campaign, encouraging fans to create custom digital bags of Lay's potato chips featuring photos of their favorite summer moments to share with friends and family on social media. Adding excitement to this experience, 10,000 lucky fans will receive a real-life customized bag of Lay's classic potato chips featuring the photo they digitally submitted, offering consumers personalized packaging for the first time in the brand's history.
We're also capitalizing on consumer health and wellness demand. As consumers are embracing almond milk and other plant-based proteins as an alternative to traditional dairy milk, Naked Juice has launched 2 new nut milks: Berry Almond Nutmilk and Peachy Almond Nutmilk. And in Quaker Foods North America, our new quick-cook, steel-cut innovation has propelled us to the #1 market position in the on-trend and growing steel-cut oatmeal segment by making preparation much more convenient.
Channel-focused innovation is advancing our foodservice business. We are launching a new line of craft soft drinks called Stubborn Soda in fountains this summer. The Stubborn lineup includes unique and contemporary takes on traditional craft flavors. Flavors include black cherry tarragon, lemon berry acai, agave vanilla cream and pineapple cream. They contain no high-fructose corn syrup and are made with fair-trade-certified cane sugar and natural flavors. And of course, we continue to refresh and reframe our key brands to maintain a high level of consumer engagement and excitement.
Now innovation has also contributed to good market share performance in the second quarter in the United States, and I believe our results are impressive. We held LRB value share while delivering strong net price realization. We gained value share across important subcategories, including sports drinks and ready-to-drink teas. Gatorade's share of sports drinks surpassed 80%. 
Mountain Dew gained 40 basis points of value share within the CSD category in Q2. In fact, if you add Kickstart, DEWshine and BAJA and Sangrita Blast together, it represents more than 2 points of CSD value share in the most recent 4-week period, placing our recent Mountain Dew innovation by itself as the fourth-largest flavored CSD behind basic Mountain Dew, Dr. Pepper and Sprite.
In Q2, we grew retail sales in measured channels in the U.S. for regular colas and Mountain Dew within CSDs; for Gatorade, Lipton Tea and Naked Juice within our noncarb portfolio. And in Frito-Lay, we held value share in savory snacks, and in Quaker Foods, we gained value share in key categories, hot and ready-to-eat cereals, while expanding gross margin and stepping up advertising and marketing at the same time.
And our innovation is driving growth for our retail partners as well. In the second quarter, PepsiCo was once again the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth among all food and beverage manufacturers, with over $400 million of retail sales growth in all measured channels. This was more than 2x the next largest contributor to growth and represented more growth than the next 14 largest manufacturers combined. 
Notably, North American Beverages was the key driver of U.S. retail sales growth within PepsiCo and the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth on a standalone basis. Our intention is to continue to invest in innovation, build upon our already strong capability base and further sharpen our holistic innovation process to drive greater growth for our customers, create compelling products for our consumers and ultimately increase the contribution of new products to our total revenue.
So that's the story on innovation. Turning now to execution. We have ramped up our execution focus across the value chain from seed to shelf. We have established clear, consistent performance metrics to track and benchmark the effectiveness and efficiency of every one of our core value-driving activities, from safety to manufacturing utilization, to transport efficiency, to promotional display execution. Execution is a never-ending journey, and there will always be an opportunity to raise the game of the below-average performers in either manufacturing lines or DSD routes. But we are seeing solid execution and steady improvement across the enterprise, and this is translating into good market-based performance and financial results.
Turning now to productivity and disciplined capital allocation. As you know, we have a goal of delivering $5 billion in productivity savings over 5 years from 2015 to 2019, which is approximately $1 billion per year. Our current program follows a similarly aggressive 3-year $3 billion program that we successfully concluded in 2014. And overall, our productivity initiatives are driving meaningful results. Over the 3 years ending in 2014, despite adverse ForEx, we have realized $1 billion of annual productivity savings, net revenue per employee is up 10% and EBIT per employee is up 9%. And since 2012, gross margins have consistently expanded.
Similarly, our capital allocation discipline is yielding meaningful results. From year-end 2011 to the second quarter of 2015, net CapEx as a percentage of net revenue has improved from 4.9% to 4.1% on a rolling 4-quarter basis. And this 80 basis point reduction equates to approximately $500 million in incremental annual free cash flow. And since 2012 through the second quarter of 2015, core net ROIC has improved by 310 basis points to 18.4% on a rolling 4-quarter basis.
And finally, people renewal and development. This is an area that I and the board spend a lot of time on. Our focus is twofold here: making sure we have the right leaders in place today and that we are developing the next 2 generations of leadership for the company. And as all of you know, good talent management does not happen in short bursts. It requires taking a long-term view and very detailed analytical planning. 
At the core of our people renewal and management plan is the focus on the 200 critical leadership roles in our company. These are the roles that are most important to our success and that provide the greatest experiential development for our executives. For each of these roles, we have developed a pipeline that ensures that we have at least one immediate successor candidate, 2 people in a 1- to 3-year time frame and then another 3 people ready 4 to 6 years out. As a result of this process, we are deliberately developing top talent by giving them multiple category, geography and job experiences and ensuring we have well developed succession plans. 
The other priority we have is ensuring that we have the right balance of homegrown talent and that we augment our talent pool from time to time with exceptional executives that were referred from outside the company. And I believe our plans are working. When we've had executive transitions, both planned and unplanned, they have been smooth and well-coordinated. And as you look at our current leadership, you will find that executives have had very broad critical experiences within PepsiCo over many years across functions, geographies and categories, people like Tom Greco, Al Carey, Sanjeev Chadha, Ramon Laguarta and Hugh Johnston; and folks that we brought into PepsiCo later in their careers to augment our skill base and stretch our thinking, people like Mehmood Khan, Laxman Narasimhan and Tony West.
And we are grooming our next generation of leadership by giving them critical experiences, people like Mike Spanos, who runs our Russia -- I mean, I'm sorry, our China operation; or Eugene Willemsen and Brian Newman, whose promotions we announced last night.
So to conclude, we are pleased with our financial performance for the first half of 2015 and with the progress we've made across our value-driving initiatives. Clearly, there are a number of macro challenges around the world, but we believe we have the right strategies and programs in place to enable us to continue to navigate successfully through the current environment. The construction of our products and geographic portfolios enable us to continue to deliver strong results, in part because our balanced portfolio creates a natural hedge against the global macro and political volatility that has become the new normal. And all of this bolsters our confidence in our ability to continue to achieve our financial targets.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Hugh."
32854,303797938,832671,"Pepsico, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 09, 2015",2015-07-09,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Turning directly to guidance. As Indra mentioned, based on the strength of our first half results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we've increased our full year core constant-currency EPS",538,"Great. Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Turning directly to guidance. As Indra mentioned, based on the strength of our first half results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we've increased our full year core constant-currency EPS growth target to 8% from 7% previously. Our other targets remain unchanged. 
For the full year 2015, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth; core operating margin expansion, as organic top line growth and productivity should offset negative geographic mix and commodity inflation, which incorporates the impact of transaction-related foreign exchange headwinds; and approximately $1 billion of productivity savings.
Below the division operating line, we continue to expect corporate costs to be lower, a core tax rate of approximately 25% and a reduced share count. 
We expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact net revenue and core earnings per share growth by approximately 9 and 11 percentage points, respectively, based on current market consensus rates. Our outlook for the year assumes translation of our Venezuela results at the SICAD rate of VEF 12.8 per U.S. dollar. Should circumstances dictate use of a higher rate, this would also negatively impact our U.S. dollar results. Taking our 2014 core EPS of $4.63 and applying our guidance and current market consensus of foreign exchange impact implies 2015 core EPS of approximately $4.49.
As you model out the third quarter, I'd ask you to consider the following. Foreign exchange translation should have an approximate 11-point unfavorable impact on the third quarter net revenue growth and an approximate 12-point unfavorable impact on third quarter core EPS growth based on current market consensus rates. And we expect a profit decline in QFNA as we lap last year's gain on the sale of the cereal business. Below the division operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to continue to increase in the third quarter versus last year, driven by higher interest rates and net debt balances, and our tax rate in the third quarter is expected to be higher than the third quarter of 2014.
From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect full year free cash flow of more than $7 billion. We expect our capital allocation discipline to continue to drive core ROIC improvement. This is building on the steady progress we've made in ROIC, with core net ROIC up 310 basis points from 2012 to 18.4% through the second quarter of 2015 on a rolling 4-quarter basis.
And consistent with prior outlook, we expect to return between approximately $8.5 billion and $9 billion to shareholders in 2015 through both dividends and share repurchases. As a reminder, our previously announced 7% dividend per share increase commenced with the June payment. Our annualized dividend is now $2.81, an approximate 60% payout ratio based on 2014 core EPS. This represents the 43rd consecutive year of annual dividend increases, and our annualized dividends per share have grown at 10% compound annual rate over the past 10 years. So to summarize, our core constant-currency earnings per share outlook for 2015 has improved from our last call, and free cash flow, disciplined capital allocation and returning cash to our shareholders remain top priorities for the company. 
With that, operator, we'll take the first question."

We are seeing success in Europe and AMEA with all of the Power of One management of those regions. We're able to get more productivity, take out costs. And especially with volatile economies, we have to get more and more agile and more creative about how to take out costs, and it's not just costs within our systems, John. I think even with our bottling partners, there's an opportunity to cooperate and figure out how not to duplicate efforts between the 2 companies. And we are seeing those initiatives pay off in AMEA and Europe, and we decided now is the time to do it in Latin America. We're in the middle of a major productivity program in Latin American foods, and integrating Latin American beverages with foods gives us that much more of a cost base to work with. Lastly, given the volatility of those economies there, I think it's very important to be -- really become a lean, mean machine there in order to take the savings and reinvest it to grow the top line. So that's Latin America. Second is on the Frito volume. Again, we watch the Frito performance very carefully, as does Tom Greco and the Frito team. In our potato chip business, we were going through a revenue management program, and that revenue management program is actually yielding good revenue growth and improving top line growth and profitability for our retailers. And one of the results of the revenue management program is that it is going to impact volume because the price-pack architecture shifts some of the volume to certain bag sizes, which impacts volume in the short term, but over the long term, it's the right thing for the business. So I'd let it play out through balance of the year, then look at our results in 2016."

As you all know, we have provided pretty extensive disclosures in our 10-Qs and 10-K on the question. In the Q that we intend to file after today's market close, and consistent with past Qs, you'll see that Venezuela represents approximately 2% of our revenue and operating profit. We also have net monetary assets of approximately $335 million and nonmonetary assets of approximately $725 million. Now if we were to take all of that and go to SIMADI, Venezuela would then represent 0% or very slightly above 0% of our revenue and operating profits, so it's roughly a 2% hit on both revenue and operating profit. We'd have a charge of approximately $325 million related to the net monetary assets. It would also likely lead to an impairment of our nonmonetary assets. The one thing for investors to consider on this is, from an economic standpoint, this really would not represent a big impact on PepsiCo given that Venezuela is largely a self-sufficient, self-funding operation. We're not putting any capital to speak of in the country, and we've not been able to redeploy any of our Venezuela cash outside of Venezuela. So from the perspective of cash flow and cash management, it would not have a meaningful impact on cash returns."

And ultimately, it depends on the competitive situation, what the profit pool is in this whole CSD business or the North American beverage business in totality. But we believe this is the right way to participate and play in this very, very important and large segment. In terms of Diet Pepsi, big business, and I think for some reason which we can't really explain, aspartame fell out of favor with some consumers. And from our perspective, we just want to make sure we have an offering for all of the consumers who want to switch out of aspartame. And we formulated a very, very good product which is aspartame-free and will be available in the market starting in late August. So for all of those consumers who are looking for an alternative to an aspartame-sweetened diet product, we will have a product.

And it's product packaging, process innovation, but we're also spending a lot of time on revenue management, I mean, really thinking through portion sizes, pack sizes.

And we are seeing it across carbonated soft drinks, I mean, whether it's DEWshine or BAJA BLAST or any of those products. And we are seeing it even in Europe and Russia and Latin America and AMEA, where, I'd say, creative revenue management tactics, coupled with innovation that cuts through the clutter, is resulting in flow-through to the bottom line. Again, I think in these environments, the focus should be on revenue and profit, not necessarily on volume growth. We focus more on unit growth, revenue and profit in these environments because a chase for volume results in the whole business hurting. So I think with revenue management, unit growth, value growth and profit is what we focus on. And that's what our innovation efforts are yielding to date, the almost 10%, I think the high 9s.

Steve, I'd tell you, one of the things we did some time ago is really sit back from the world and say, ""How do we -- how should we think about groups of countries and clusters of operations that make sense?"" And based on all the work we did, basically, the world broke out into 8 clusters: North America is cluster 1, Western Europe as the next developed market was cluster 2, 3 was Latin America, 4 was Russia and Eastern Europe, 5 was Middle East and North Africa, cluster 6 was the Indian subcontinent, 7 was China and the whole Pacific Rim and cluster 8 was Sub-Saharan Africa. So those were the 8 clusters. And North America is so big that grouping it together and not providing visibility into the pieces didn't make sense, so we've kept North America separate in terms of North American beverages and Frito-Lay and Quaker being so different. But all other clusters, we just cleaned it up. Cluster 3 is Latin America, we put it together. And Sub-Saharan Africa, we had the snacks business of South Africa and Simba reporting into Europe and beverages reporting to our Asia, Middle East sector. We just cleaned it up. So the segment changes that we reported were a cleanup of these clusters so that we can think of cluster strategies. So that's the first one. And more and more, our strategic thinking and designs for the future are based on how do we establish and grow our positions in each of these clusters, and more importantly, how do we get more productive working across our partners within each of the clusters. That's what we've been focused on. So the last 2 got cleaned up. In terms of personnel changes, as I talked to you earlier in my script, talent management is something that the board and I are focused on a lot. I mean, our board, the phenomenal board, spends a lot of time thinking through succession for the top couple of hundred jobs. And one of the things we always look at to see is, well, there are bright talent across the company that should be lifted up so that they can be part of a succession process in the company. And every time we get an opportunity, we figure out ways to lift them up in order to stretch people, in order to really build exciting talent for the future, and that's what the most recent changes enabled us to do. And just to give you an idea, let me talk about Brian Newman. And I have worked with Brian now for 20 years, off and on. Brian started in corporate strategy but then went to China. He went to Russia.

And Eugene, likewise, he's been running the tea partnership, but again, a Dutch national who's worked in multiple countries and a truly global executive. He travels 60%, 70% of his time in every part of the world. I remember when he was running Turkey, he started to learn Turkish. Everywhere he goes, he becomes a national and again, a very exciting executive. And you'll all get a chance to see these people in action as we move along. And all of the people we are elevating, whether it's Laxman who is now going to be running Latin America, Ramon who's got additional responsibilities in Europe, Sanjeev who's running a gigantic geography, you'll see all of them over the next few quarters. And of course, you all know Al Carey and Tom Greco and Hugh very, very well. So I think that you'll find that what PepsiCo is doing is just reinforcing the fact that we're a talent academy, and any company that's looking for talent always raids PepsiCo. So we have to constantly make sure that our best and brightest will move up, and we keep them engaged and excited about the company. And that's my job and the job of the board, and that's what we're doing."

As you think about your global snack business, you obviously have a very good business there. But in a world where scale is becoming increasingly important and you've got other macro snacking categories that perhaps you may not be participating as actively, how do you think about accelerating really top line as well as the profit growth as you think about the global snack platform? Is really looking at integrated beverage and snack nationally is the answer? Or can you really do something more with the platform? And then second question is just really talking about your global e-commerce efforts. It's not an easy, I guess, opportunity for CPG companies. So can you just give us some perspective on what efforts you've made already? And what are some of the opportunities that you think about over the next few years?"

First of all, globally, we still have a lot of growth within sav",490,"Sure, Judy. Interesting question because I think in global snacks, we're in an interesting position because our base is savory snacks, and we are a very, very strong player in savory snacks. First of all, globally, we still have a lot of growth within savory snacks. We came from a salty, crisp snack background, and we are expanding more and more into other savory snacks. Be it crackers, be it nuts and seeds, we're expanding into those areas. There's a lot of opportunity there. I see growth in global snacks along 2 dimensions. Dimension 1 is accompaniments to our snacks, and that's what made us go into dips. Because many of our snacks are consumed by themselves. Other times, our snacks serve as sort of substrate upon which you can put on meal-like products like our Sabra hummus or our Tostitos dips. So that's one vector to grow. And we still haven't scratched the surface, and we've got lots of growth. The other area is taking away eating occasions from other macro snacks category. It's interesting, unlike beverages, in the case of snacks, we can go off and take eating occasions from other macro snacks, be it cookies or confectionary or chocolate. And our goal is to focus on what we are doing, but looking at our science of demand spaces, which I talked about briefly, look at each eating occasion by cohort group and figure out how we can leverage our salty-snack platform to go after other macro snacks, be it replace it with a salty occasion or do some sort of a salty-sweet combination, for example, Stacy's with cinnamon sugar. It is based on a pita chip but it's certainly sweet when you taste it and has a much better mouth feel and experience than if you eat something totally sweet by itself. That's my perspective. So I think that our growth is all about growing the core and then leveraging all of the other eating occasions, taking share away from other macro snacks and other savory snacks. In addition, I think it's leveraging the beverage occasion to really figure out how to go into all retail outlets our beverages are in already because beverages' retail outlet penetration is much higher than snacks. And so if you leverage that retail base, it gives you a lot more opportunities for growth. And internationally, we are leveraging in-store promotional displays a lot more. I mean, I was in the Middle East a few months ago, and I was just amazed to see the in-store displays of Lay's and Pepsi. And again, with the shares of Pepsi that we have there, it is really a powerful in-store promotion that results in tremendous lift. So the opportunities for growth, by itself and in combination with beverages, are pretty significant. So with that, let me turn to Hugh to talk about global e-commerce because he's the leader of the global e-commerce activities. Hugh?"

I guess I'd make just a couple of quick comments to start the dialogue on that. Number one, global e-commerce mean -- can mean so many things, anywhere from just changing the way the product is ordered and picked, the so-called click-and-collect model, where people order online and then they'll pick up products at their local retail outlet, all the way through to, in China, where the product is delivered significantly to door in more and more proportions of the overall spend. Clearly, one of the leading areas is to the U.K., where you see retailers also doing a lot more delivery to store, all the way through to new emerging players like the Blue Aprons of the world, who are actually sort of designing meal solutions, in effect filling demand moments for consumers by giving them an entire prepackaged meal, which you see in some urban markets in the U.S. and starting to expand outside the U.S. as well. From the perspective of PepsiCo, we're looking at it 2 ways. Number one is the existing products going through the existing channels, either current retailers or the traditional online retailers. And then second, really looking hard at demand moments and designing products that fit the e-commerce types of distribution channels and e-commerce types of consumers in a more tailored way. So that's sort of a very brief view towards what's happening in the e-commerce world. The biggest opportunity, obviously, is to be able to have durable [ph] one-on-one relationship with those consumers than we've ever had in the past through traditional linear TV advertising. I expect you'll see a lot more from us in this regard, but that's probably the best 2 minutes that I can give in terms of what it is that we're doing right now."

I think today, year-to-date, we are the best-performing European CPG company based on all the numbers we've looked at. If you combine East and West or whether you look at them individually, both on the top line and the profit performance, we are performing the best. The challenge in Europe is, especially with Russia there -- the High Street battle in the U.K. going on, I think it's very important we play a very judicious game between revenue and profits. And we've been playing that game very, very carefully. And if you look at our year-to-date numbers -- I wouldn't look at it on a quarterly basis, I'd look at it on a year-to-date basis.

And we feel comfortable with what the team is doing, and that's what we intend to keep doing the balance of the year. And in terms of cost-cutting opportunities, Hugh recently talked about what other opportunities exist. But in terms of employees, look, nobody likes cost cutting. Everybody likes growth. I think we're one of those companies that are doing a wonderful balance of growing the top line and delivering productivity, and that's what we want to focus on. Swinging the pendulum too much to cost cutting I don't think is a good idea at all because it just jeopardizes the future of the company. So we look at opportunities to shrink the cost base and get more lean and mean, but without sacrificing our ability to innovate and grow. And that's really all I have to say in this matter. Do you want to add anything, Hugh?"

Despite a continued choppy global macroenvironment, we are happy to report another great quarter at PepsiCo. 
In the third quarter, organic revenue grew 7.4% with global snacks up 10%, and global beverages up 5%. Core gross margin improved by 120 basis points. Core constant currency operating profit increased 12%, and core constant currency EPS increased 14%. Based on our year-to-date performance and our outlook for the balance of the year, we are increasing our full year 2015 core constant currency EPS growth outlook to 9%. Also, we now plan to return approximately $9 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks with share buybacks at the high end of the range that we guided to. Hugh will go into additional details on our guidance later. 
So let me now comment briefly on our results. We again had very strong results in North America, and this comprises of a 60% of our net revenue and approximately 2/3 of our core division operating profit year-to-date. 
North American Beverages had a terrific quarter in which we grew our organic volume by 3%, organic revenue by 5% and core constant currency operating profit by 10%. During the quarter, we held value share in liquid refreshment beverages and gained value share across important subcategories including ready-to-drink teas and water. 
Frito-Lay North America delivered another quarter of solid results with the organic revenue growth of 2% and core constant currency operating profit growth of 7%. Core operating margins increased by 155 basis points, reflecting execution of price pack architecture management and ongoing productivity initiatives across the value chain. 
In Quaker Foods North America, organic revenue increased 2%, and core constant currency operating profit increased 1.5%, and also profit performance is noteworthy given the fact that we're lapping a divestiture gain in the prior year. Quaker has gained value share in both hot and ready-to-eat cereals, both in the quarter and year-to-date, and we're proud to report that during the third quarter, PepsiCo was the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth among all food and beverage manufacturers with over $400 million of retail sales growth in all measured channels. This was double the next largest contributor to growth. 
Notably, North American Beverages was the key driver of U.S. retail sales growth within PepsiCo and the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth on a stand-alone basis. 
On a year-to-date basis, PepsiCo has contributed over $1.1 billion of retail sales growth in all measured channels, which again was the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth among all food and beverage manufacturers. And this was nearly 2.5x the next largest contributor to growth. 
Now turning to our international markets. In our developing and emerging markets, we continue to face volatile and challenging macros in a number of these markets. We are managing both control to stay competitive in this marketplace, and we continue to see good growth in a number of these markets. 
For example, our business in Turkey achieved double-digit organic revenue growth. Mexico achieved high single-digit organic revenue growth, and Egypt achieved mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. 
Now as we mentioned last quarter, in each of our earnings calls, we will provide an update on our big initiatives to drive our operating and financial performance: brand-building, innovation, execution, productivity and cash return to shareholders. On our Q2 earnings call, we talked about innovation. Today, we're focused on productivity, which is critical to succeed in today's challenging environment. 
With volatile macros globally and increasingly competitive landscape with digital technologies disrupting many aspects of our business, productivity has never been more important. And as all of you know well, productivity enables current financial performance and provides investment funding to sustain growth into the future. 
When we think of productivity, we think both in terms of efficiency of just getting the same result using fewer resources; and effectiveness, getting a greater result using the same resources. Our productivity initiatives to date have been largely focused on efficiency, and we've had pretty good results. 
We delivered $3 billion in productivity between 2012 and 2014, and we're on track to deliver the first year of our current 5-year, $5 billion program that we started in 2015. And this productivity has been supported in large part by investments we made in technology, starting with our implementation of SAP in the early 2000, and this allows us to establish a common operating language and to standardize operating metrics across the globe. 
We also adopted an operating model that has reduced lines in the organization and has promoted the sharing of best practices around the world. We also established truly global functions in operations, procurement, IT, HR and finance as well as very lean category horizontals that are driving greater capability building, harmonization efficiency in new product development and global brand management. 
Together, our technology investments and operating model are allowing us to leverage our global scale to a much greater extent. With these foundational elements in place, we have made progress in multiple areas. 
First, increased automation. We've installed packaging automation across approximately 1/3 of our snacks plants worldwide, enabling us to reduce packaging labor cost in these facilities by at least 50%. In Frito-Lay North America, for example, approximately 65% of all production utilizes fully automated packaging. 
In Mexico, we updated the majority of our packaging tubes with high-speed equipment over the last few years, enabling us to increase throughput by approximately 40%. Across the Middle East, we installed automated palletizing and warehousing technologies in many key markets, resulting in improvement in labor productivity since 2013. 
Second, we are restructuring our go-to-market systems. Since the success of our Peri Georgia pilots in 2009, we have expanded our geographic Enterprise Solutions or GES as we call them at Frito-Lay North America to a total of 11 projects, which are now at various stages of deployment across locations in both the U.S. and Canada. The consolidation of these plants and distribution networks will result in scale that enables economic implementation of automated order picking, the reduction of distribution centers and a highly efficient direct-to-store delivery system directly from our plant. This model is also being applied to the North American Beverages business, where we're combining large-format and small format to the same trucks, the plan to eliminate geographic overlap resulting in 15% fewer laps. 
Third, we're optimizing our global manufacturing footprint. Since 2010, we have reduced the number of company-owned beverage plants in North America by 23%. At the same time, we've increased our capacity utilization by 20%. 
In Europe in the past 3 years, we closed 6 plants across our beverage and dairy businesses, decreasing our footprint by 7% and generating more than $20 million of annual savings and further increasing our capacity utilization. 
Finally, in shared services. We are increasingly leveraging shared service centers and selectively outsourcing financial transaction processing, accounting, reporting other back-office tasks. To date, the program has been executed in 18 countries, reducing costs while improving analytical capabilities and service levels streamlining IT infrastructure. 
Our efficiency journey is in no way done. In addition to these major supply chain productivity initiatives, we have also embarked on our version of zero-based budgeting, something we call smart spending. We tally tell ZBB in great detail, and we realize that implementing it as currently designed ran the risk of starving resources to drive top line growth initiatives. Our version of ZBB or smart spending as we call it focuses on rightsizing our operating expenses now that we are beginning to see benefits from our technology investments and global coordination while top line driving resources to focus more on deriving additional effectiveness from them, and this is the balanced approach, one that focuses both on a relentless drive for efficiency but preserves investments to drive top line growth, which brings me to our focus on increasing effectiveness of our spend. 
We have expanded our view of productivity to ensure greater effectiveness across every element of spending. Just to give you a few examples, we are sharpening our capabilities in revenue management to drive greater effectiveness of promotional and other trade spending. We're building the required tools and training to realize a greater return on our advertising and marketing investment, and we're developing new product platforms that can scale across multiple countries rapidly, and all of this is being enabled and accelerated by our lean global category structures. 
We believe our approach is working and driving meaningful, tangible results. Over the past 3 years ending in 2014, we have realized an average of $1 billion of annual productivity savings. Net revenue per employee is up 10%. Operating profit per employee is up 9%. 
This quarter marks our 13th consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion. And from year-end 2011, CapEx as a percent of net revenue went down from 4.9% to 4.1% on a rolling 4-quarter basis. 
Importantly, these achievements have contributed to strong free cash flow productivity and core net ROIC improvement. Since the beginning of 2013 to the third quarter of 2015, we have generated cumulative core free cash flow, excluding certain items, of more than $22 billion, which represents 115% of core net income over the same time period. And core net ROIC has increased by 380 basis points to 19.1% at the end of the third quarter 2015 compared to 15.3% at year-end 2012. 
Ultimately, we believe our approach creates a virtuous cycle with productivity fueling the reinvestment and transformation necessary for sustainable top and bottom line growth and shareholder value creation. 
With this, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?"
32854,310960528,874640,"Pepsico, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 06, 2015",2015-10-06,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. First, let's discuss guidance. As Indra mentioned, based on the strength of our year-to-date performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we've increased our full year core constant currency EPS",537,"Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. First, let's discuss guidance. As Indra mentioned, based on the strength of our year-to-date performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we've increased our full year core constant currency EPS growth target to 9% from 8% previously, which includes the expected fourth quarter impact of the Venezuela accounting change. Additional details regarding the change in accounting for Venezuela can be found in our third quarter earnings release and in the soon-to-be released 10-Q. 
Our other targets remain unchanged. For the full year 2015, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth; core operating margin expansion as organic top line growth and productivity should offset negative geographic mix and commodity inflation, which incorporates the impact of transaction-related foreign exchange headwinds; and approximately $1 billion in productivity savings. Below the division operating line, we continue to expect corporate cost to be lower, a core tax rate of approximately 25% and a reduced share count. 
We now expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact net revenue and core earnings per share growth by approximately 10 and 11 percentage points, respectively, based on current market consensus rates. 
Taking our 2014 core EPS of $4.63 and applying our guidance and current market consensus of foreign exchange impact implies 2015 core EPS of approximately $4.54. 
As you model out the fourth quarter, I'd ask you to consider the following. First, we expect foreign exchange translation to have an approximate 8-point unfavorable impact on fourth quarter net revenue growth and an approximate 8-point unfavorable impact on fourth quarter core EPS growth based on current market consensus rates. Venezuelan operations contributed $0.03 to core EPS in the prior year quarter. 
Second, the North America Beverages business will face a difficult core constant currency operating profit growth comparison. Below the division operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to increase in the fourth quarter versus last year driven by higher interest rates and higher debt balances. 
From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect full year free cash flow, excluding certain items, of more than $7 billion. We expect our capital allocation discipline to continue to drive core ROIC improvement. This is building on the steady progress we've made in ROIC with core net ROIC up 380 basis points from 2012 to 19.1% through the third quarter of 2015 on a rolling 4-quarter basis. 
We expect shareholder cash returns to be very strong. We now expect to return approximately $9 billion to shareholders in 2015, approximately $4 billion in dividends and $5 billion in share repurchases. Our current share repurchase outlook is at the high end of the range we provided last quarter. 
Our annualized dividend is now $2.81, an approximate 60% payout ratio based on 2014 core EPS. This represents the 43rd consecutive year of annual dividend increases, and our annualized dividends per share have grown at a 10% compound annual rate over the past 10 years. 
So to summarize, our core constant currency earnings per share outlook for 2015 has improved from our last call, and free cash flow, disciplined capital allocation and returning cash to our shareholders remain top priorities for the company. 
With that, operator, we'll take the first question."

From a value perspective because of good revenue management and good pricing in the industry, the value numbers are way better than the volume numbers. But clearly, the big story here is non-carbs, and the non-carbs are really was driving all of the growth in the whole industry. And again, in non-carbs, profitability varies. I mean, it ranges all the way from bottled water to other products that have higher profitability. So I think the challenge at every point in the North American Beverage business is really twofold if you want to think about it. How do you play the game across the portfolio between CSDs and non-carbs? And within CSDs, how do you alternate between a Mountain Dew versus a Pepsi versus a Kickstart. So there's one balancing game that we have to go through, but the second part is also channel-wise. How much emphasis do play on single-serve and driving single-serve sales, which have got a different profit profile than large pack or multi-serve products. So the challenge in this industry, it's a very complex, very big industry. It's how do you play this whole game intelligently. Now I will tell you one thing. The fact that we own the bulk of our bottling system and the fact that most of our borrowers are very aligned with us, a very good set of bottling partners actually allows us to be a lot more nimble and effect in the market the right pricing strategies, revenue management strategies and get the right innovations to the marketplace."

So how is it different this time? Is it more evolutionary versus revolutionary? And then some of the categories that you think are kind of right for this to continue within your portfolio. And then, Hugh, just on -- just a follow-up on Venezuela. So it seems like Venezuela probably added about 1 to 2 points to revenue growth. So just -- can you just clarify or quantify the revenue impact? And then in the fourth quarter as you deconsolidate Venezuela, how much of the organic revenue growth is at risk in terms of taking that out of your P&L."

But I just roughly tell you that you have to look at trade spending management and revenue management together because in a way, the 2 of them are how we manage the shelf. And as the digital tools get better and better and more tools are available to get more visibility into consumer interaction with different packages, the way we do revenue management improves. So if you look at Frito-Lay's recent program on project drive, that was a trade spending and revenue management program because in a way, the way we manage the packaging there improved the profitability of the retailers in addition to improving the whole spending effectiveness. So I think the pace at which we move in this area is a function of the tools available for us to have more visibility into consumer buying decisions and how we do shelf assortment. It's a journey. We are investing more and more in tools, training, capabilities, and we are making sure everybody gets trained in these tools. So developing markets tools, emerging market tools, developed market tools, what we do with modern trade, what we do with traditional trade. We're rolling out the training. It's a journey, Judy, and it's going to take a few years before we're fully done. But as these tools rollout, we start to see the benefits roll into the P&L, and that's what you saw in Frito-Lay. The project drive was a great example of it. And even in North American Beverage profitability in a way is a function of how do we intelligently managing multiple portfolio and trade spending.

I think on productivity going forward the next 4 years, again year by year, it varies. As with all of these programs, you can measure the efficiency programs more directly on productivity and the effectiveness, you see it more in the top line, and you see it in pricing because how you get the pricing is a function of how we implement all of the effectiveness program. So it's much harder to isolate the effectiveness part of productivity, but it will tell you the way we measure it is in top line growth and the kind of pricing we get. That manifest itself, and our algorithms we're talking about mid-single-digit revenue growth. And given today's extremely turbulent environment, I think effectiveness OEMs productivity programs is what's going to allow us deliver that mid-single-digit growth.

Absolutely, we did see volumes in Frito-Lay a little bit stronger than I think what analysts were generally expecting and than what they're interpolating based off of the scan data.

We saw volume growth in C stores for the quarter of 4.5% and that channels tend to be track a little bit less closely. It's about 20% of Frito's business. So I think that probably accounts for the data difference. More broadly, I think the important point here is project drive, which is obviously suppressed volumes, to some degree, is going on very successfully as Indra mentioned, from a revenue model perspective is yielding the results we expected in addition to that and strategically more importantly, the household penetration on Lay's is going up and frankly, that was the goal of project drive than it is working quite successfully. Obviously, we've got a couple of more quarters of overlaps to work through in terms of the volume impacts, but we feel very, very good about project drive right now."

Despite a continued choppy global macro environment, we're happy to report another great quarter at PepsiCo. In the third quarter, organic revenue grew 7.4% with global snacks up 10% and global beverages up 5%",1612,"Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Despite a continued choppy global macro environment, we're happy to report another great quarter at PepsiCo. In the third quarter, organic revenue grew 7.4% with global snacks up 10% and global beverages up 5%. Core gross margin improved by 120 basis points. Core constant currency operating profit increased 12% and core constant currency EPS increased 14%. Based on our year-to-date performance and our outlook for the balance of the year, we are increasing our full year 2015 core constant currency EPS growth outlook to 9%. Also we now plan to return approximately $9 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks with share buybacks at the high end of the range we had guided to. Hugh will go into additional details of our guidance later. 
So let me now comment briefly on our results. We again had very strong results in North America. And this comprises over 60% of our net revenue and approximately 2/3 of our core division operating profit year-to-date. North America Beverages had a terrific quarter in which we grew our organic volume by 3%, organic revenue by 5% and core constant currency operating profit by 10%. During the quarter, we held value share in liquid refreshment beverages and gained value share across important subcategories, including ready-to-drink tea and water. Frito-Lay North America delivered another quarter of solid results with an organic revenue growth of 2% and core constant currency operating profit growth of 7%. Core operating margins increased by 155 basis points, reflecting execution of price-pack architecture management and ongoing productivity initiatives across the value chain. 
In Quaker Foods North America, organic revenue increased 2% and core constant currency operating profit increased 1.5%. And operating profit performance is noteworthy given the fact that they're lapping a divestiture gain in the prior year. Quaker has gained value share in both hot and ready-to-eat cereals both in the quarter and year-to-date. And we are proud to report that during the third quarter, PepsiCo was the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth among all food and beverage manufacturers with over $400 million of retail sales growth in all measured channels. This was double the next largest contributor to growth. Notably, North American Beverages was the key driver of U.S. retail sales growth within PepsiCo and the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth on a stand-alone basis. On a year-to-date basis, PepsiCo has contributed over $1.1 billion of retail sales growth in all measured channels, which again was the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth among all food and beverage manufacturers. And this was nearly 2.5x the next largest contributor to growth. 
Now turning to our international markets. In our developing and emerging markets, although we continue to face volatile and challenging macros in a number of these markets, we are managing what we can control to stay competitive in this marketplace, and we continue to see good growth in a number of these markets. For example, our business in Turkey achieved double-digit organic revenue growth, Mexico achieved high single-digit organic revenue growth and Egypt achieved mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. 
Now as we mentioned last quarter, in each of our earnings calls, we will provide an update on our big initiatives that drive our operating and financial performance: brand-building, innovation, execution, productivity and cash return to shareholders. On our Q2 earnings call, we talked about innovation. Today, we are focused on productivity, which is critical to succeed in today's challenging environment. With volatile macros globally and increasingly competitive landscape with digital technologies disrupting many aspects of our business, productivity has never been more important. And as all of you know well, productivity enables current financial performance and provides investment funding to sustain growth into the future. When we think of productivity, we think both in terms of efficiency, which is getting the same result using fewer resources; and effectiveness, getting a greater result using the same resources. Our productivity initiatives to date have been largely focused on efficiency, and we have had pretty good results. 
We delivered $3 billion in productivity between 2012 and 2014, and we're on track to deliver the first year of our current 5-year, $5 billion program that we started in 2015. And this productivity has been supported in large part by investments we made in technology, starting with our implementation of SAP in the early 2000s. And this allowed us to establish a common operating language and to standardize operating metrics across the globe. We also adopted an operating model that has reduced spans and layers in the organization and has promoted the sharing of best practices around the world. We also established truly global functions in operations, procurement, IT, HR and finance as well as very lean category horizontals that are driving greater capability building, harmonization and efficiency in new product development and global brand management. Together, our technology investments and operating model are allowing us to leverage our global scale to a much greater extent. 
With these foundational elements in place, we have made progress in multiple areas. First, increased automation. We have installed packaging automation across approximately 1/3 of our snacks plants worldwide, enabling us to reduce packaging labor costs in these facilities by at least 50%. In Frito-Lay North America, for example, approximately 65% of all production utilizes fully automated packaging. In Mexico, we updated a majority of our packaging tubes with high-speed equipment over the last few years, enabling us to increase throughput by approximately 40%. Across the Middle East, we installed automated palletizing and warehousing technologies in many key markets, resulting in improvement in labor productivity since 2013. 
Second, we are restructuring our go-to-market systems. Since the success of our Perry, Georgia pilots in 2009, we have expanded our Geographic Enterprise Solutions or GES as we call them at Frito-Lay North America to a total of 11 projects, which are now at various stages of deployment across locations in both the U.S. and Canada. The consolidation of these plants and distribution networks will result in scale that enables economic implementation of automated order-picking, the reduction of distribution centers and a highly efficient direct-to-store delivery system directly from our plant. This model is also being applied to the North American Beverages business, where we're combining large format and small format routes from the same trucks, with plans to eliminate geographic overlap resulting in 15% fewer routes. 
Third, we are optimizing our global manufacturing footprint. Since 2010, we have reduced the number of company-owned beverage plants in North America by 23%. At the same time, we've increased our capacity utilization by 20%. In Europe in the past 3 years, we closed 6 plants across our beverage and dairy businesses, decreasing our footprint by 7% and generating more than $20 million of annual savings and further increasing our capacity utilization. 
Finally, in shared services. We are increasingly leveraging shared service centers and selectively outsourcing financial transaction processing, accounting, reporting and other back-office tasks. To date, the program has been executed in 18 countries, reducing costs while improving analytical capabilities and service levels and streamlining IT infrastructure. 
Our efficiency journey is in no way done. In addition to these major supply chain productivity initiatives, we have also embarked on our version of zero-based budgeting, something we call Smart Spending. We tally ZBB in great detail. And we realize that implementing it as currently designed ran the risk of starving resources to drive top line growth initiatives. Our version of ZBB or Smart Spending as we call it focuses on right-sizing our operating expenses now that we are beginning to see benefits from our technology investments and global coordination while ring-fencing top line-driving resources to focus more on deriving additional effectiveness from them. And this is the balanced approach, one that focuses both on a relentless drive for efficiency but preserves investments to drive top line growth, which brings me to our focus on increasing effectiveness of our spend. 
We have expanded our view of productivity to ensure greater effectiveness across every element of spending. Just to give you a few examples, we are sharpening our capabilities in revenue management to drive greater effectiveness of promotion and other trade spending. We are building the required tools and training to realize a greater return on our advertising and marketing investments. And we are developing new product platforms that can scale across multiple countries rapidly. And all of this is being enabled and accelerated by our lean global category structures. 
We believe our approach is working and driving meaningful, tangible results. Over the past 3 years ending in 2014, we have realized an average of $1 billion of annual productivity savings. Net revenue per employee is up 10%. Operating profit per employee is up 9%. This quarter marks our 13th consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion. And from year-end 2011, CapEx as a percent of net revenue went down from 4.9% to 4.1% on a rolling 4-quarter basis. Importantly, these achievements have contributed to strong free cash flow productivity and core net ROIC improvement. Since the beginning of 2013 through the third quarter of 2015, we have generated cumulative core free cash flow, excluding certain items, of more than $22 billion, which represents 115% of core net income over the same time period. And core net ROIC has increased by 380 basis points to 19.1% at the end of the third quarter 2015 compared to 15.3% at year-end 2012. 
Ultimately, we believe our approach creates a virtuous cycle with productivity fueling the reinvestment and transformation necessary for sustainable top and bottom line growth and shareholder value creation. With this, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?"
32854,310960528,874688,"Pepsico, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 06, 2015",2015-10-06,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. First, let's discuss guidance. As Indra mentioned, based on the strength of our year-to-date performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we've increased our full year core constant currency EPS",538,"Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. First, let's discuss guidance. As Indra mentioned, based on the strength of our year-to-date performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we've increased our full year core constant currency EPS growth target to 9% from 8% previously, which includes the expected fourth quarter impact of the Venezuela accounting change. Additional details regarding the change in accounting for Venezuela can be found in our third quarter earnings release and in the soon-to-be-released 10-Q. 
Our other targets remain unchanged. For the full year 2015, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth; core operating margin expansion as organic top line growth and productivity should offset negative geographic mix and commodity inflation, which incorporates the impact of transaction-related foreign exchange headwinds; and approximately $1 billion in productivity savings. Below the division operating line, we continue to expect corporate cost to be lower, a core tax rate of approximately 25% and a reduced share count. We now expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact net revenue and core earnings per share growth by approximately 10 and 11 percentage points, respectively, based on current market consensus rates. 
Taking our 2014 core EPS of $4.63 and applying our guidance and current market consensus of foreign exchange impact implies 2015 core EPS of approximately $4.54. As you model out the fourth quarter, I'd ask you to consider the following. First, we expect foreign exchange translation to have an approximate 8 point unfavorable impact on fourth quarter net revenue growth and an approximate 8 point unfavorable impact on fourth quarter core EPS growth based on current market consensus rates. Venezuelan operations contributed $0.03 to core EPS in the prior year quarter. Second, the North American Beverages business will face a difficult core constant currency operating profit growth comparison. 
Below the division operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to increase in the fourth quarter versus last year driven by higher interest rates and higher debt balances. From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect full year free cash flow, excluding certain items, of more than $7 billion. We expect our capital allocation discipline to continue to drive core ROIC improvement. This is building on the steady progress we've made in ROIC with core net ROIC up 380 basis points from 2012 to 19.1% through the third quarter of 2015 on a rolling 4-quarter basis. 
We expect shareholder cash returns to be very strong. We now expect to return approximately $9 billion to shareholders in 2015, approximately $4 billion in dividends and $5 billion in share repurchases. Our current share repurchase outlook is at the high end of the range we provided last quarter. Our annualized dividend is now $2.81, an approximate 60% payout ratio based on 2014 core EPS. This represents the 43rd consecutive year of annual dividend increases, and our annualized dividends per share have grown at a 10% compound annual rate over the past 10 years. 
So to summarize, our core constant currency earnings per share outlook for 2015 has improved from our last call. And free cash flow, disciplined capital allocation and returning cash to our shareholders remain top priorities for the company. 
With that, operator, we'll take the first question."

And I'd say that the CSD market continues to be under pressure from a volume perspective. From a value perspective, because of good revenue management and good pricing in the industry, the value numbers are way better than the volume numbers. But clearly, the big story here is non-carbs. And the non-carbs are really what's driving all of the growth in the whole industry. And again, in non-carbs, profitability varies. I mean, it ranges all the way from bottled water to other products that have higher profitability. So I think the challenge at every point in the North American Beverage business is really twofold if you want to think about it. How do you play the game across the portfolio between CSDs and non-carbs? And within CSDs, how do you alternate between a Mountain Dew versus a Pepsi versus a Kickstart? So there's one balancing game that we have to go through, but the second part is also channel-wise. How much emphasis you play on single-serve and driving single-serve sales, which have got a different profit profile than large-pack or multi-serve products. So the challenge in this industry, it's a very complex, very big industry. It's how do you play this whole game intelligently. Now I will tell you one thing. The fact that we own the bulk of our bottling system and the fact that most of our bottlers are very aligned with us, very good set of bottling partners, actually allows us to be a lot more nimble and effect in the market the right pricing strategies, revenue management strategies and get the right innovations to the marketplace."

And then some of the categories that you think are kind of right for this to continue within your portfolio. And then, Hugh, just on -- just a follow-up on Venezuela. So it seems like Venezuela probably added about 1 to 2 points to revenue growth. So just -- can you just clarify or quantify the revenue impact? And then in the fourth quarter, as you deconsolidate Venezuela, how much of the organic revenue growth is at risk in terms of taking that out of your P&L?"

But I'd just roughly tell you that you have to look at trade spending management and revenue management together because in a way, the 2 of them are how we manage the shelf. And as the digital tools get better and better and more tools are available to get more visibility into consumer interaction with different packages, the way we do revenue management improves. So if you look at Frito-Lay's recent program on Project Drive, that was a trade spending and revenue management program because in a way, the way we manage the packaging there improved the profitability of the retailers, in addition to improving the whole spending effectiveness. So I think the pace at which we move in this area is a function of the tools available for us to have more visibility into consumer buying decisions and how we do shelf assortment. It's a journey. We are investing more and more in tools, training, capabilities. And we're making sure everybody gets trained in these tools, developing markets tools, emerging market tools, developed market tools, what we do with modern trade, what we do with traditional trade. We're rolling out the training. It's a journey, Judy, and it's going to take a few years before we're fully done. But as these tools roll out, we start to see the benefits roll into the P&L, and that's what you saw in Frito-Lay. The Project Drive was a great example of it. And even the North American Beverage profitability in a way is a function of how do we intelligently managing multiple portfolio and trade spending. So then let me turn to Hugh to talk about your second question, Venezuela."

So I think these bottling assets are strategic. And as I said earlier, this is a journey. As the marketplace evolves, we have to keep evolving and optimizing our bottling assets. We've done a lot to the manufacturing assets. As we mentioned, the capacity -- we've taken out 23% of the capacity. Utilization is up. We are looking at consolidating large-format and small-format routes and reducing the number of routes by 15%.

Is it split? Is it skewed one way or another? And then within the efficiency bucket, do the drivers remain supply chain restructuring and smart spending? Or are there other initiatives on the horizon that we should be thinking about?"

I think on productivity, going forward, the next 4 years, again, year by year, it varies. As with all of these programs, you can measure the efficiency programs more directly on productivity, and the effectiveness, you see it more in the top line, and you see it in the pricing because how you get the pricing is a function of how we implement all of the effectiveness program. So it's much harder to isolate the effectiveness part of productivity. But I will tell you, the way we measure it is in top line growth and the kind of pricing we get. So that's the way it should manifest itself. And our algorithm is, talking about mid-single-digit revenue growth. And given today's extremely turbulent environment, I think effectiveness, OEMs' productivity programs, is what's going to allow us to deliver that mid-single-digit growth. Let's talk about Frito-Lay volumes. So, Hugh, if you want to take that one."

Absolutely, we did see volumes in Frito-Lay a little bit stronger than I think what analysts were generally expecting and than what they're interpolating based off of the scan data. I think the reason for that is convenient stores. We're particularly strong in Frito-Lay. We saw volume growth in C stores for the quarter of 4.5%, and that channel tends to be tracked a little bit less closely. It's about 20% of Frito's business. So I think that probably accounts for the data difference. More broadly, I think the important point here is Project Drive, which is obviously suppressed volumes to some degree is going on very successfully. As Indra mentioned earlier, from a revenue management perspective, it's yielding the results we expected. And in addition to that, and strategically more importantly, the household penetration on Lay's is going up. And frankly, that was the goal of Project Drive, and it is working quite successfully. Obviously, we've got a more -- a couple of more quarters of overlaps to work through in terms of the volume impacts, but we feel very, very good about Project Drive right now."

Despite a continued choppy global macro environment, we're happy to report another great quarter at PepsiCo. In the third quarter, organic revenue grew 7.4% with global snacks up 10% and global beverages up 5%",1611,"Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Despite a continued choppy global macro environment, we're happy to report another great quarter at PepsiCo. In the third quarter, organic revenue grew 7.4% with global snacks up 10% and global beverages up 5%. Core gross margin improved by 120 basis points. Core constant currency operating profit increased 12% and core constant currency EPS increased 14%. Based on our year-to-date performance and our outlook for the balance of the year, we are increasing our full year 2015 core constant currency EPS growth outlook to 9%. Also we now plan to return approximately $9 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks with share buybacks at the high end of the range we had guided to. Hugh will go into additional details of our guidance later. 
So let me now comment briefly on our results. We again had very strong results in North America. And this comprises over 60% of our net revenue and approximately 2/3 of our core division operating profit year-to-date. North America Beverages had a terrific quarter in which we grew our organic volume by 3%, organic revenue by 5% and core constant currency operating profit by 10%. During the quarter, we held value share in liquid refreshment beverages and gained value share across important subcategories, including ready-to-drink tea and water. Frito-Lay North America delivered another quarter of solid results with organic revenue growth of 2% and core constant currency operating profit growth of 7%. Core operating margins increased by 155 basis points, reflecting execution of price-pack architecture management and ongoing productivity initiatives across the value chain. 
In Quaker Foods North America, organic revenue increased 2% and core constant currency operating profit increased 1.5%. And operating profit performance is noteworthy given the fact that they're lapping a divestiture gain in the prior year. Quaker has gained value share in both hot and ready-to-eat cereal both in the quarter and year-to-date. And we are proud to report that during the third quarter, PepsiCo was the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth among all food and beverage manufacturers with over $400 million of retail sales growth in all measured channels. This was double the next largest contributor to growth. Notably, North American Beverages was the key driver of U.S. retail sales growth within PepsiCo and the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth on a stand-alone basis. On a year-to-date basis, PepsiCo has contributed over $1.1 billion of retail sales growth in all measured channels, which again was the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth among all food and beverage manufacturers. And this was nearly 2.5x the next largest contributor to growth. 
Now turning to our international markets. In our developing and emerging markets, although we continue to face volatile and challenging macros in a number of these markets, we are managing what we can control to stay competitive in this marketplace, and we continue to see good growth in a number of these markets. For example, our business in Turkey achieved double-digit organic revenue growth, Mexico achieved high single-digit organic revenue growth and Egypt achieved mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. 
Now as we mentioned last quarter, in each of our earnings calls, we will provide an update on our big initiatives that drive our operating and financial performance: brand-building, innovation, execution, productivity and cash return to shareholders. On our Q2 earnings call, we talked about innovation. Today, we are focused on productivity, which is critical to succeed in today's challenging environment. With volatile macros globally and increasingly competitive landscape with digital technologies disrupting many aspects of our business, productivity has never been more important. And as all of you know well, productivity enables current financial performance and provides investment funding to sustain growth into the future. When we think of productivity, we think both in terms of efficiency, which is getting the same result using fewer resources; and effectiveness, getting a greater result using the same resources. Our productivity initiatives to date have been largely focused on efficiency, and we have had pretty good results. 
We delivered $3 billion in productivity between 2012 and 2014, and we're on track to deliver the first year of our current 5-year, $5 billion program that we started in 2015. And this productivity has been supported in large part by investments we made in technology, starting with our implementation of SAP in the early 2000s. And this allowed us to establish a common operating language and to standardize operating metrics across the globe. We also adopted an operating model that has reduced spans and layers in the organization and has promoted the sharing of best practices around the world. We also established truly global functions in operations, procurement, IT, HR and finance as well as very lean category horizontals that are driving greater capability building, harmonization and efficiency in new product development and global brand management. Together, our technology investments and operating model are allowing us to leverage our global scale to a much greater extent. 
With these foundational elements in place, we have made progress in multiple areas. First, increased automation. We have installed packaging automation across approximately 1/3 of our snacks plants worldwide, enabling us to reduce packaging labor costs in these facilities by at least 50%. In Frito-Lay North America, for example, approximately 65% of all production utilizes fully automated packaging. In Mexico, we updated the majority of our packaging tubes with high-speed equipment over the last few years, enabling us to increase throughput by approximately 40%. Across the Middle East, we installed automated palletizing and warehousing technologies in many key markets, resulting in improvement in labor productivity since 2013. 
Second, we are restructuring our go-to-market systems. Since the success of our Perry, Georgia pilots in 2009, we have expanded our Geographic Enterprise Solutions or GES as we call them at Frito-Lay North America to a total of 11 projects, which are now at various stages of deployment across locations in both the U.S. and Canada. The consolidation of these plants and distribution networks will result in scale that enables economic implementation of automated order-picking, the reduction of distribution centers and a highly efficient direct-to-store delivery system directly from our plant. This model is also being applied to the North American Beverages business, where we're combining large format and small format routes from the same trucks, with plans to eliminate geographic overlap resulting in 15% fewer routes. 
Third, we are optimizing our global manufacturing footprint. Since 2010, we have reduced the number of company-owned beverage plants in North America by 23%. At the same time, we've increased our capacity utilization by 20%. In Europe in the past 3 years, we closed 6 plants across our beverage and dairy businesses, decreasing our footprint by 7% and generating more than $20 million of annual savings and further increasing our capacity utilization. 
Finally, in shared services. We are increasingly leveraging shared service centers and selectively outsourcing financial transaction processing, accounting, reporting and other back-office tasks. To date, the program has been executed in 18 countries, reducing costs while improving analytical capabilities and service levels and streamlining IT infrastructure. 
Our efficiency journey is in no way done. In addition to these major supply chain productivity initiatives, we have also embarked on our version of zero-based budgeting, something we call Smart Spending. We tally ZBB in great detail. And we realize that implementing it as currently designed ran the risk of starving resources to drive top line growth initiatives. Our version of ZBB or Smart Spending as we call it focuses on right-sizing our operating expenses now that we are beginning to see benefits from our technology investments and global coordination while ring-fencing top line-driving resources to focus more on deriving additional effectiveness from them. And this is the balanced approach, one that focuses both on a relentless drive for efficiency but preserves investments to drive top line growth, which brings me to our focus on increasing effectiveness of our spend. 
We have expanded our view of productivity to ensure greater effectiveness across every element of spending. Just to give you a few examples, we are sharpening our capabilities in revenue management to drive greater effectiveness of promotion in other trade spending. We are building the required tools and training to realize a greater return on our advertising and marketing investments. And we are developing new product platforms that can scale across multiple countries rapidly. And all of this is being enabled and accelerated by our lean global category structures. 
We believe our approach is working and driving meaningful, tangible results. Over the past 3 years ending in 2014, we have realized an average of $1 billion of annual productivity savings. Net revenue per employee is up 10%. Operating profit per employee is up 9%. This quarter marks our 13th consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion. And from year-end 2011, CapEx as a percent of net revenue went down from 4.9% to 4.1% on a rolling 4-quarter basis. Importantly, these achievements have contributed to strong free cash flow productivity and core net ROIC improvement. Since the beginning of 2013 through the third quarter of 2015, we have generated cumulative core free cash flow, excluding certain items, of more than $22 billion, which represents 115% of core net income over the same time period. And core net ROIC has increased by 380 basis points to 19.1% at the end of the third quarter 2015 compared to 15.3% at year-end 2012. 
Ultimately, we believe our approach creates a virtuous cycle with productivity fueling the reinvestment and transformation necessary for sustainable top and bottom line growth and shareholder value creation. With this, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?"

First, let's discuss guidance. As Indra mentioned, based on the strength of our year-to-date performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we've increased our full year core constant currency EPS",538,"Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. First, let's discuss guidance. As Indra mentioned, based on the strength of our year-to-date performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we've increased our full year core constant currency EPS growth target to 9% from 8% previously, which includes the expected fourth quarter impact of the Venezuela accounting change. Additional details regarding the change in accounting for Venezuela can be found in our third quarter earnings release and in the soon-to-be-released 10-Q. 
Our other targets remain unchanged. For the full year 2015, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth; core operating margin expansion as organic top line growth and productivity should offset negative geographic mix and commodity inflation, which incorporates the impact of transaction-related foreign exchange headwinds; and approximately $1 billion in productivity savings. Below the division operating line, we continue to expect corporate cost to be lower, a core tax rate of approximately 25% and a reduced share count. We now expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact net revenue and core earnings per share growth by approximately 10 and 11 percentage points, respectively, based on current market consensus rates. 
Taking our 2014 core EPS of $4.63 and applying our guidance and current market consensus of foreign exchange impact implies 2015 core EPS of approximately $4.54. As you model out the fourth quarter, I'd ask you to consider the following. First, we expect foreign exchange translation to have an approximate 8 point unfavorable impact on fourth quarter net revenue growth and an approximate 8 point unfavorable impact on fourth quarter core EPS growth based on current market consensus rates. Venezuelan operations contributed $0.03 to core EPS in the prior year quarter. Second, the North American Beverages business will face a difficult core constant currency operating profit growth comparison. 
Below the division operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to increase in the fourth quarter versus last year driven by higher interest rates and higher debt balances. From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect full year free cash flow, excluding certain items, of more than $7 billion. We expect our capital allocation discipline to continue to drive core ROIC improvement. This is building on the steady progress we've made in ROIC with core net ROIC up 380 basis points from 2012 to 19.1% through the third quarter of 2015 on a rolling 4-quarter basis. 
We expect shareholder cash returns to be very strong. We now expect to return approximately $9 billion to shareholders in 2015, approximately $4 billion in dividends and $5 billion in share repurchases. Our current share repurchase outlook is at the high end of the range we provided last quarter. Our annualized dividend is now $2.81, an approximate 60% payout ratio based on 2014 core EPS. This represents the 43rd consecutive year of annual dividend increases, and our annualized dividends per share have grown at a 10% compound annual rate over the past 10 years. 
So to summarize, our core constant currency earnings per share outlook for 2015 has improved from our last call. And free cash flow, disciplined capital allocation and returning cash to our shareholders remain top priorities for the company. 
With that, operator, we'll take the first question."

And I'd say that the CSD market continues to be under pressure from a volume perspective. From a value perspective, because of good revenue management and good pricing in the industry, the value numbers are way better than the volume numbers. But clearly, the big story here is non-carbs. And the non-carbs are really what's driving all of the growth in the whole industry. And again, in non-carbs, profitability varies. I mean, it ranges all the way from bottled water to other products that have higher profitability. So I think the challenge at every point in the North American Beverage business is really twofold if you want to think about it. How do you play the game across the portfolio between CSDs and non-carbs? And within CSDs, how do you alternate between a Mountain Dew versus a Pepsi versus a Kickstart? So that's one balancing game that we have to go through, but the second part is also channel-wise. How much emphasis do you play on single-serve and driving single-serve sales, which have got a different profit profile than large-pack or multi-serve products. So the challenge in this industry, it's a very complex, very big industry. It's how do you play this whole game intelligently. Now I will tell you one thing. The fact that we own the bulk of our bottling system and the fact that most of our bottlers are very aligned with us, very good set of bottling partners, actually allows us to be a lot more nimble and effect in the market the right pricing strategies, revenue management strategies and get the right innovations to the marketplace."

I was hoping to get a little bit more color just in terms of where do you think PepsiCo is in the context of what the industry is doing. We've been hearing this trade spend effectiveness programs for a while. So how is it different this time? Is it more evolutionary versus revolutionary? And then some of the categories that you think are kind of right for this to continue within your portfolio. And then, Hugh, just on -- just a follow-up on Venezuela. So it seems like Venezuela probably added about 1 to 2 points to revenue growth. So just -- can you just clarify or quantify the revenue impact? And then in the fourth quarter, as you deconsolidate Venezuela, how much of the organic revenue growth is at risk in terms of taking that out of your P&L?"

But I'd just roughly tell you that you have to look at trade spending management and revenue management together because in a way, the 2 of them are how we manage the shelf. And as the digital tools get better and better and more tools are available to get more visibility into consumer interaction with different packages, the way we do revenue management improves. So if you look at Frito-Lay's recent program on Project Drive, that was a trade spending and revenue management program because in a way, the way we manage the packaging there improved the profitability of the retailers, in addition to improving the whole spending effectiveness. So I think the pace at which we move in this area is a function of the tools available for us to have more visibility into consumer buying decisions and how we do shelf assortment. It's a journey. We are investing more and more in tools, training, capabilities. And we're making sure everybody gets trained in these tools, developing markets tools, emerging market tools, developed market tools, what we do with modern trade, what we do with traditional trade. We're rolling out the training. It's a journey, Judy, and it's going to take a few years before we're fully done. But as these tools roll out, we start to see the benefits roll into the P&L, and that's what you saw in Frito-Lay. The Project Drive was a great example of it. And even the North American Beverage profitability in a way is a function of how to intelligently managing both the product portfolio and trade spending. So then let me turn to Hugh to talk about your second question, Venezuela."

In France, Germany, Turkey, we had very good beverage strength. And in our countries like Russia, because of inflation, the market was tough.

In today's volatile environment, the biggest capability we as a company have to develop, and we have, is how we manage the portfolio intelligently to deliver a set of numbers for the company overall.

And then we have independent bottlers, having them aligned is even more critical. And I'd tell you, based on our recent North American bottling meeting, Al Carey and the team did a brilliant job, and the system is more aligned than I've ever seen before. So I think these bottling assets are strategic. And as I said earlier, this is a journey. As the marketplace evolves, we have to keep evolving and optimizing our bottling assets. We've done a lot with the manufacturing assets. As we've mentioned, the capacity -- we've taken out 23% of the capacity. Utilization is up. We are looking at consolidating large-format and small-format routes and reducing the number of routes by 15%. As the equivalent of GES, or geo box as our beverage guys call it, get implemented, we do start thinking about different ways to leverage our distribution systems. So it's a journey and -- but it's a very, very good team, and they're doing the right things to focus on revenue management, trade spending effectiveness, marketing, innovation, playing the portfolio, intelligent pricing.

I think on productivity, going forward, the next 4 years, again, year by year, it varies. As with all of these programs, you can measure the efficiency programs more directly on productivity, and the effectiveness, you see it more in the top line, and you see it in pricing because how you get the pricing is a function of how we implement all of the effectiveness program. So it's much harder to isolate the effectiveness part of productivity. But I will tell you, the way we measure it is in top line growth and the kind of pricing we get. So that's the way it should manifest itself. And our algorithm is, talking about mid-single-digit revenue growth. And given today's extremely turbulent environment, I think effectiveness, OEMs' productivity programs, is what's going to allow us to deliver that mid-single-digit growth.

Absolutely, we did see volumes in Frito-Lay a little bit stronger than I think what analysts were generally expecting and -- than what they were interpolating based off of the scan data. I think the reason for that is convenient stores were particularly strong in Frito-Lay. We saw volume growth in C stores for the quarter of 4.5%, and that channel tends to be tracked a little bit less closely. It's about 20% of Frito's business. So I think that probably accounts for the data difference. More broadly, I think the important point here is Project Drive, which has obviously suppressed volumes to some degree, is going on very successfully. As Indra mentioned earlier, from a revenue management perspective, it's yielding the results we expected. And in addition to that, and strategically more importantly, the household penetration on Lay's is going up. And frankly, that was the goal of Project Drive, and it is working for it quite successfully. Obviously, we've got a more -- a couple more quarters of overlaps to work through in terms of the volume impacts, but we feel very, very good about Project Drive right now."

As we begin the call, it's important to note the following. We will make forward-looking statements on this call. Any forward-looking statement inherently involves risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the current predictions and expectations. Information on such risks can be found in today's earnings release and our most recent Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss results using non-GAAP measures. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations on our website under the Investors section under Investors -- under Events and Presentations tab. 
As a reminder, beginning this quarter, PepsiCo reported its realigned segments. We provided retrospectively revised summary segment results reflecting the company's new organization structure in early August. As we cover in this morning's release, we have changed the accounting for our Venezuela operations and consequently will no longer consolidate their operating results beginning in the fourth quarter. Further details on this can be found in today's earnings release and the soon-to-be-released third quarter Form 10-Q filing. 
And now it is my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi."
32854,310960528,874870,"Pepsico, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 06, 2015",2015-10-06,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Despite a continued choppy global macro environment, we're happy to report another great quarter at PepsiCo. In the third quarter, organic revenue grew 7.4% with global snacks up 10% and global beverages up 5%",1611,"Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Despite a continued choppy global macro environment, we're happy to report another great quarter at PepsiCo. In the third quarter, organic revenue grew 7.4% with global snacks up 10% and global beverages up 5%. Core gross margin improved by 120 basis points. Core constant currency operating profit increased 12% and core constant currency EPS increased 14%. Based on our year-to-date performance and our outlook for the balance of the year, we are increasing our full year 2015 core constant currency EPS growth outlook to 9%. Also we now plan to return approximately $9 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks with share buybacks at the high end of the range we had guided to. Hugh will go into additional details of our guidance later. 
So let me now comment briefly on our results. We again had very strong results in North America. And this comprises over 60% of our net revenue and approximately 2/3 of our core division operating profit year-to-date. North America Beverages had a terrific quarter in which we grew our organic volume by 3%, organic revenue by 5% and core constant currency operating profit by 10%. During the quarter, we held value share in liquid refreshment beverages and gained value share across important subcategories, including ready-to-drink tea and water. Frito-Lay North America delivered another quarter of solid results with organic revenue growth of 2% and core constant currency operating profit growth of 7%. Core operating margins increased by 155 basis points, reflecting execution of price-pack architecture management and ongoing productivity initiatives across the value chain. 
In Quaker Foods North America, organic revenue increased 2% and core constant currency operating profit increased 1.5%. And operating profit performance is noteworthy given the fact that they're lapping a divestiture gain in the prior year. Quaker has gained value share in both hot and ready-to-eat cereal both in the quarter and year-to-date. And we are proud to report that during the third quarter, PepsiCo was the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth among all food and beverage manufacturers with over $400 million of retail sales growth in all measured channels. This was double the next largest contributor to growth. Notably, North American Beverages was the key driver of U.S. retail sales growth within PepsiCo and the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth on a stand-alone basis. On a year-to-date basis, PepsiCo has contributed over $1.1 billion of retail sales growth in all measured channels, which again was the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth among all food and beverage manufacturers. And this was nearly 2.5x the next largest contributor to growth. 
Now turning to our international markets. In our developing and emerging markets, although we continue to face volatile and challenging macros in a number of these markets, we are managing what we can control to stay competitive in this marketplace, and we continue to see good growth in a number of these markets. For example, our business in Turkey achieved double-digit organic revenue growth, Mexico achieved high single-digit organic revenue growth and Egypt achieved mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. 
Now as we mentioned last quarter, in each of our earnings calls, we will provide an update on our big initiatives that drive our operating and financial performance: brand-building, innovation, execution, productivity and cash return to shareholders. On our Q2 earnings call, we talked about innovation. Today, we are focused on productivity, which is critical to succeed in today's challenging environment. With volatile macros globally and increasingly competitive landscape with digital technologies disrupting many aspects of our business, productivity has never been more important. And as all of you know well, productivity enables current financial performance and provides investment funding to sustain growth into the future. When we think of productivity, we think both in terms of efficiency, which is getting the same result using fewer resources; and effectiveness, getting a greater result using the same resources. Our productivity initiatives to date have been largely focused on efficiency, and we have had pretty good results. 
We delivered $3 billion in productivity between 2012 and 2014, and we're on track to deliver the first year of our current 5-year, $5 billion program that we started in 2015. And this productivity has been supported in large part by investments we made in technology, starting with our implementation of SAP in the early 2000s. And this allowed us to establish a common operating language and to standardize operating metrics across the globe. We also adopted an operating model that has reduced spans and layers in the organization and has promoted the sharing of best practices around the world. We also established truly global functions in operations, procurement, IT, HR and finance as well as very lean category horizontals that are driving greater capability building, harmonization and efficiency in new product development and global brand management. Together, our technology investments and operating model are allowing us to leverage our global scale to a much greater extent. 
With these foundational elements in place, we have made progress in multiple areas. First, increased automation. We have installed packaging automation across approximately 1/3 of our snacks plants worldwide, enabling us to reduce packaging labor costs in these facilities by at least 50%. In Frito-Lay North America, for example, approximately 65% of all production utilizes fully automated packaging. In Mexico, we updated the majority of our packaging tubes with high-speed equipment over the last few years, enabling us to increase throughput by approximately 40%. Across the Middle East, we installed automated palletizing and warehousing technologies in many key markets, resulting in improvement in labor productivity since 2013. 
Second, we are restructuring our go-to-market systems. Since the success of our Perry, Georgia pilots in 2009, we have expanded our Geographic Enterprise Solutions or GES as we call them at Frito-Lay North America to a total of 11 projects, which are now at various stages of deployment across locations in both the U.S. and Canada. The consolidation of these plants and distribution networks will result in scale that enables economic implementation of automated order-picking, the reduction of distribution centers and a highly efficient direct-to-store delivery system directly from our plant. This model is also being applied to the North American Beverages business, where we're combining large format and small format routes from the same trucks, with plans to eliminate geographic overlap resulting in 15% fewer routes. 
Third, we are optimizing our global manufacturing footprint. Since 2010, we have reduced the number of company-owned beverage plants in North America by 23%. At the same time, we've increased our capacity utilization by 20%. In Europe in the past 3 years, we closed 6 plants across our beverage and dairy businesses, decreasing our footprint by 7% and generating more than $20 million of annual savings and further increasing our capacity utilization. 
Finally, in shared services. We are increasingly leveraging shared service centers and selectively outsourcing financial transaction processing, accounting, reporting and other back-office tasks. To date, the program has been executed in 18 countries, reducing costs while improving analytical capabilities and service levels and streamlining IT infrastructure. 
Our efficiency journey is in no way done. In addition to these major supply chain productivity initiatives, we have also embarked on our version of zero-based budgeting, something we call Smart Spending. We tally ZBB in great detail. And we realize that implementing it as currently designed ran the risk of starving resources to drive top line growth initiatives. Our version of ZBB or Smart Spending as we call it focuses on right-sizing our operating expenses now that we are beginning to see benefits from our technology investments and global coordination while ring-fencing top line-driving resources to focus more on deriving additional effectiveness from them. And this is the balanced approach, one that focuses both on a relentless drive for efficiency but preserves investments to drive top line growth, which brings me to our focus on increasing effectiveness of our spend. 
We have expanded our view of productivity to ensure greater effectiveness across every element of spending. Just to give you a few examples, we are sharpening our capabilities in revenue management to drive greater effectiveness of promotion in other trade spending. We are building the required tools and training to realize a greater return on our advertising and marketing investments. And we are developing new product platforms that can scale across multiple countries rapidly. And all of this is being enabled and accelerated by our lean global category structures. 
We believe our approach is working and driving meaningful, tangible results. Over the past 3 years ending in 2014, we have realized an average of $1 billion of annual productivity savings. Net revenue per employee is up 10%. Operating profit per employee is up 9%. This quarter marks our 13th consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion. And from year-end 2011, CapEx as a percent of net revenue went down from 4.9% to 4.1% on a rolling 4-quarter basis. Importantly, these achievements have contributed to strong free cash flow productivity and core net ROIC improvement. Since the beginning of 2013 through the third quarter of 2015, we have generated cumulative core free cash flow, excluding certain items, of more than $22 billion, which represents 115% of core net income over the same time period. And core net ROIC has increased by 380 basis points to 19.1% at the end of the third quarter 2015 compared to 15.3% at year-end 2012. 
Ultimately, we believe our approach creates a virtuous cycle with productivity fueling the reinvestment and transformation necessary for sustainable top and bottom line growth and shareholder value creation. With this, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?"
32854,310960528,874870,"Pepsico, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 06, 2015",2015-10-06,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. First, let's discuss guidance. As Indra mentioned, based on the strength of our year-to-date performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we've increased our full year core constant currency EPS",538,"Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. First, let's discuss guidance. As Indra mentioned, based on the strength of our year-to-date performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we've increased our full year core constant currency EPS growth target to 9% from 8% previously, which includes the expected fourth quarter impact of the Venezuela accounting change. Additional details regarding the change in accounting for Venezuela can be found in our third quarter earnings release and in the soon-to-be-released 10-Q. 
Our other targets remain unchanged. For the full year 2015, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth; core operating margin expansion as organic top line growth and productivity should offset negative geographic mix and commodity inflation, which incorporates the impact of transaction-related foreign exchange headwinds; and approximately $1 billion in productivity savings. Below the division operating line, we continue to expect corporate cost to be lower, a core tax rate of approximately 25% and a reduced share count. We now expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact net revenue and core earnings per share growth by approximately 10 and 11 percentage points, respectively, based on current market consensus rates. 
Taking our 2014 core EPS of $4.63 and applying our guidance and current market consensus of foreign exchange impact implies 2015 core EPS of approximately $4.54. As you model out the fourth quarter, I'd ask you to consider the following. First, we expect foreign exchange translation to have an approximate 8 point unfavorable impact on fourth quarter net revenue growth and an approximate 8 point unfavorable impact on fourth quarter core EPS growth based on current market consensus rates. Venezuelan operations contributed $0.03 to core EPS in the prior year quarter. Second, the North American Beverages business will face a difficult core constant currency operating profit growth comparison. 
Below the division operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to increase in the fourth quarter versus last year driven by higher interest rates and higher debt balances. From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect full year free cash flow, excluding certain items, of more than $7 billion. We expect our capital allocation discipline to continue to drive core ROIC improvement. This is building on the steady progress we've made in ROIC with core net ROIC up 380 basis points from 2012 to 19.1% through the third quarter of 2015 on a rolling 4-quarter basis. 
We expect shareholder cash returns to be very strong. We now expect to return approximately $9 billion to shareholders in 2015, approximately $4 billion in dividends and $5 billion in share repurchases. Our current share repurchase outlook is at the high end of the range we provided last quarter. Our annualized dividend is now $2.81, an approximate 60% payout ratio based on 2014 core EPS. This represents the 43rd consecutive year of annual dividend increases, and our annualized dividends per share have grown at a 10% compound annual rate over the past 10 years. 
So to summarize, our core constant currency earnings per share outlook for 2015 has improved from our last call. And free cash flow, disciplined capital allocation and returning cash to our shareholders remain top priorities for the company. 
With that, operator, we'll take the first question."

And I'd say that the CSD market continues to be under pressure from a volume perspective. From a value perspective, because of good revenue management and good pricing in the industry, the value numbers are way better than the volume numbers. But clearly, the big story here is non-carbs. And the non-carbs are really what's driving all of the growth in the whole industry. And again, in non-carbs, profitability varies. I mean, it ranges all the way from bottled water to other products that have higher profitability. So I think the challenge at every point in the North American Beverage business is really twofold if you want to think about it. How do you play the game across the portfolio between CSDs and non-carbs? And within CSDs, how do you alternate between a Mountain Dew versus a Pepsi versus a Kickstart? So that's one balancing game that we have to go through, but the second part is also channel-wise. How much emphasis do you play on single-serve and driving single-serve sales, which have got a different profit profile than large-pack or multi-serve products. So the challenge in this industry, it's a very complex, very big industry. It's how do you play this whole game intelligently. Now I will tell you one thing. The fact that we own the bulk of our bottling system and the fact that most of our bottlers are very aligned with us, very good set of bottling partners, actually allows us to be a lot more nimble and effect in the market the right pricing strategies, revenue management strategies and get the right innovations to the marketplace."

But I'd just roughly tell you that you have to look at trade spending management and revenue management together because in a way, the 2 of them are how we manage the shelf. And as the digital tools get better and better and more tools are available to get more visibility into consumer interaction with different packages, the way we do revenue management improves. So if you look at Frito-Lay's recent program on Project Drive, that was a trade spending and revenue management program because in a way, the way we manage the packaging there improved the profitability of the retailers, in addition to improving the whole spending effectiveness. So I think the pace at which we move in this area is a function of the tools available for us to have more visibility into consumer buying decisions and how we do shelf assortment. It's a journey. We are investing more and more in tools, training, capabilities. And we're making sure everybody gets trained in these tools, developing markets tools, emerging market tools, developed market tools, what we do with modern trade, what we do with traditional trade. We're rolling out the training. It's a journey, Judy, and it's going to take a few years before we're fully done. But as these tools roll out, we start to see the benefits roll into the P&L, and that's what you saw in Frito-Lay. The Project Drive was a great example of it. And even the North American Beverage profitability in a way is a function of how to intelligently managing both the product portfolio and trade spending. So then let me turn to Hugh to talk about your second question, Venezuela."

In France, Germany, Turkey, we had very good beverage strength. And in our countries like Russia, because of inflation, the market was tough. But overall, again, I come back to this notion of the portfolio management. In today's volatile environment, the biggest capability we as a company have to develop, and we have, is how we manage the portfolio intelligently to deliver a set of numbers for the company overall. And again, managing the company for value share within a volume corridor, and that's what we've been doing globally at this point."

And then we have independent bottlers, having them aligned is even more critical. And I'd tell you, based on our recent North American bottling meeting, Al Carey and the team did a brilliant job, and the system is more aligned than I've ever seen before. So I think these bottling assets are strategic. And as I said earlier, this is a journey. As the marketplace evolves, we have to keep evolving and optimizing our bottling assets. We've done a lot with the manufacturing assets. As we've mentioned, the capacity -- we've taken out 23% of the capacity. Utilization is up. We are looking at consolidating large-format and small-format routes and reducing the number of routes by 15%. As the equivalent of GES, or geo box as our beverage guys call it, get implemented, we do start thinking about different ways to leverage our distribution systems. So it's a journey and -- but it's a very, very good team, and they're doing the right things to focus on revenue management, trade spending effectiveness, marketing, innovation, playing the portfolio, intelligent pricing.

I think on productivity, going forward, the next 4 years, again, year by year, it varies. As with all of these programs, you can measure the efficiency programs more directly on productivity, and the effectiveness, you see it more in the top line, and you see it in pricing because how you get the pricing is a function of how we implement all of the effectiveness program. So it's much harder to isolate the effectiveness part of productivity. But I will tell you, the way we measure it is in top line growth and the kind of pricing we get. So that's the way it should manifest itself. And our algorithm is, talking about mid-single-digit revenue growth. And given today's extremely turbulent environment, I think effectiveness, OEMs' productivity programs, is what's going to allow us to deliver that mid-single-digit growth.

Absolutely, we did see volumes in Frito-Lay a little bit stronger than I think what analysts were generally expecting and -- than what they were interpolating based off of the scan data. I think the reason for that is convenient stores were particularly strong in Frito-Lay. We saw volume growth in C stores for the quarter of 4.5%, and that channel tends to be tracked a little bit less closely. It's about 20% of Frito's business. So I think that probably accounts for the data difference. More broadly, I think the important point here is Project Drive, which has obviously suppressed volumes to some degree, is going on very successfully. As Indra mentioned earlier, from a revenue management perspective, it's yielding the results we expected. And in addition to that, and strategically more importantly, the household penetration on Lay's is going up. And frankly, that was the goal of Project Drive, and it is working for it quite successfully. Obviously, we've got a more -- a couple more quarters of overlaps to work through in terms of the volume impacts, but we feel very, very good about Project Drive right now."
