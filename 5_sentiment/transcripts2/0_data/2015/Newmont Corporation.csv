I'm pleased to report that we made great progress delivering on our plans in 2014. Specifically, we significantly improved our safety, cost and productivity performance while achieving our production plans. We raised nearly $800 million by selling noncore assets and began construction on our new mine in Suriname. We optimized our project pipeline to create a suite of near-term opportunities for profitable growth in Nevada, Ghana and Australia. And finally, we significantly strengthened our balance sheet while generating value for our shareholders. I'll turn to Slide 4 to review more details.
Strong safety performance is essential to running an efficient business. In 2014, we reduced our injury rates another 17% to historic lows, ending the year with one of the lowest rates in the mining industry. Our people are recognized for their leadership in this area. Most recently, our team at Waihi took first place in the New Zealand Mines Rescue competition, and at Akyem, they received the Best Safe Mine in Ghana award. 
As proud as we are of these accomplishments, we still have work to do to make Newmont a safer business. We mourn the loss of Brian Holmes, a contractor who died in January while working at our Leeville operations in Nevada. Our thoughts are with his family as we renew our commitment to eliminating all injuries at Newmont.
Turning to Slide 5, I'll focus on our performance in each of the 3 pillars of our strategy. The first part of our strategy is to improve our underlying business. During 2014, we lowered our all-in sustaining costs by more than $500 million or more than $100 per ounce and met our plans to produce more than 4.8 million ounces of gold. We also kept our all-in sustaining costs under $1,000 an ounce for the second quarter in a row. 
The second part of our strategy is to strengthen our gold portfolio. During 2014, we made significant progress on our Turf Vent Shaft in Nevada and broke ground on our new mine in Suriname, both of which will add lower-cost production and stable jurisdictions. We also continued to optimize our project pipeline, and I'll talk more about that later in the call. 
Finally, we streamlined our portfolio by selling assets that no longer fit our strategy of operating low-cost long-life mines, and as a result, have generated $1.4 billion over the past 2 years. 
The third part of our strategy is to generate value for our shareholders while improving financial flexibility and balance sheet strength. During 2014, we generated $2.1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $341 million in free cash flow, an improvement of nearly $700 million over 2013. At the end of the year, we had $2.4 billion in cash on our balance sheet, a 50% improvement from 2013. 
We also made an early payment of $100 million toward our existing term loan and returned $114 million in dividends to our shareholders during the year. Summing up our 2014 performance, we remain focused on our strategic priorities while controlling what we could control and ended the year with a much stronger and healthier business as a result.
Turning to Slide 6 and a look at our 2014 production. You will recall that we sold Midas, Jundee and La Herradura in 2014. Absent the impact of these divestments, our 2014 gold production was in line with our 2013 levels, and we are positioned to deliver steady gold production over the next several years as well. I'll discuss this more when we review our guidance.
We increased our gold production outlook twice in 2014 and finished the year near the top end of our original guidance even without adjusting for divestments. Our priority is still to deliver value over volume and I'll turn to our cost performance on Slide 7.
You can see the progress we have made over the last 3 years, lowering our all-in sustaining costs by 15% since 2012. In 2014, we improved our gold all-in sustaining cost guidance twice as a result of steadily exceeding our savings targets. We finished the year 2% below the bottom of our final published range and 10% below our 2013 cost. This adds up to more than $500 million in adjusted savings as we see on Slide 8.
We want to provide a clear view of our cost savings from 2013 to 2014 and to demonstrate how much of that amount resulted from improved technical and operational fundamentals. Our consolidated all-in sustaining costs decreased by $1.2 billion from 2013 to 2014. Of that decrease, $243 million was the result of portfolio changes, including divestments, the Akyem startup and the 4-month shutdown of Batu Hijau due to the export issues. A further $50 million was related to favorable oil and exchange rate movements. And finally, we took out $386 million related to inventory valuation changes. After excluding these items, we generated savings of $524 million in 2014.
Let's turn to the main components of those savings on Slide 9. As you can see, more than half of Newmont's savings stem from improvements to our cost applicable to sales, which we reduced by almost 6% compared to 2013. I'll point out that this is the first time we've reduced our cost applicable to sales since 2009. 
We also stabilized our sustaining capital spend at lower and sustainable levels. Some of the work we did to achieve these operational improvements included reducing truck cycle times and improving payloads at Carlin, Twin Creeks, Yanacocha and Tanami; realigning mining and milling rates at Ahafo; reducing supplier and contractor cost by self-performing mining and maintenance activities and negotiating better rates at Boddington, Carlin and our operations in Ghana; and improving equipment reliability entire life at Ahafo, Boddington, Twin Creeks and Yanacocha. 
Another 23% of our savings came from lowering advanced projects and exploration costs by 27% to focus on our highest margin opportunities. Finally, we lowered general and administrative costs across the portfolio. 
Turning to our exploration efforts, our latest reserves and resources statement reflects our ongoing focus on value and quality as summarized on Slide 10. We added 3.3 million ounces to our gold reserve base last year, partially offsetting 5.5 million ounces of depletion. Our total gold reserves decreased from 88.4 million ounces in 2013 to 82.2 million ounces as of the end of 2014. About 40% of our net year-over-year reduction or 2.5 million ounces was associated with divesting noncore assets. 
Another 25% or 1.5 million ounces was due to model revisions and mine design changes primarily at Turquoise Ridge and Boddington. Our most significant gold reserve additions were made near existing operations in favorable jurisdictions. These include about 700,000 ounces each at Tanami and the Carlin underground mines, 300,000 ounces at Waihi and 200,000 ounces at Long Canyon. 
We also had notable additions at Merian. Turning to Slide 11. We added almost 600,000 ounces of gold reserves at Merian in 2014. half of which is soft saprolite ore, bringing our total reserves to 4.8 million ounces on a 100% basis. As you know, the government of Suriname invested just over $100 million in a 25% stake in Merian late last year. The government is managing its interest through its state-owned oil company, which has been operating in country for 33 years and brings a wealth of development experience to the partnership. 
I visited Suriname in December to meet our new partners and to visit the team. We are making good progress on all fronts. About 900 people are trained and working. works are advancing well and community agreements and environmental controls are in place. The project remains on budget and on schedule to begin production in late 2016. 
Before I hand it over to Laurie to talk about our financial performance, I also want to touch briefly on Indonesia and Ghana. You will recall that PTNNT received a 6-month export permit late last September. We're very proud of the team's performance in executing a safe and efficient ramp-up to full capacity at Batu Hijau in October. The mine is just getting into the higher-grade portion of the ore body now. 
The new Indonesian administration is getting settled, and our initial meetings to renew our export permit and Contract of Work have been constructive. I'll keep you informed as we work through the details.
Turning to Ghana. In late January, the government imposed load shedding requirements on all businesses. We are in discussions with the government, along with other large companies, to explore power conservation alternatives that minimize disruptions to our operations. Our team is also developing contingency plans to maintain steady power generation through other sources and I'll keep you posted on our progress.
With that, I'll hand it over to Laurie to cover our financial results."

It was a strong quarter and year for Newmont as our focus on cost and efficiency improvements continues to pay off.

It was a strong quarter and year for Newmont as our focus on cost and efficiency improvements continues to pay off. Let's turn to Slide 13 to review recent financial highlights.
We worked hard to drive down costs in 2014 and the results speak for themselves. Fourth quarter gold costs applicable to sales per ounce was down 18% from 1 year ago and gold all-in sustaining costs per ounce was down nearly 11% from the year-ago quarter. The global cost reductions we achieved in 2014 helped us to expand free cash flow generation despite a 10% drop in the gold price year-over-year.
Turning to Slide 14. We delivered $218 million in consolidated free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2014 and generated a 46% improvement in cash from continuing operations compared to the year-ago quarter despite the 10% drop in gold price.
We reported adjusted net income of $86 million in the most recent quarter or $0.17 per share compared to $143 million or $0.28 per share last year. We added adjusted EBITDA to our release this quarter and are including it in our performance metrics going forward. I am pleased to report that adjusted EBITDA was up 26% from the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA benefited from lower cost applicable to sales, lower exploration and advanced projects expense and lower stockpile adjustments compared to Q4 of 2013. 
We continue to fund dividends from free cash flow, and earlier this week, our board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.025 per share in line with our gold price-linked dividend. 
Turning to Slide 15. Let's walk through Q4 net income adjustments. The primary adjustments to our GAAP net income include a $23 million gain, net of tax, related to the sale of La Herradura; a $10 million reclamation settlement; a $14 million impairment primarily on our marketable securities; and a $43 million tax valuation allowance, of which $32 million was related to asset sales. 
Adjusted net income also excludes a $24 million loss from discontinued operations. This is a noncash mark-to-market adjustment to our royalty obligation. After reconciling for these items, we reported adjusted net income of $86 million or $0.17 per share for the most recent quarter. 
Now turning to Slide 16. In 2014, we strengthened our balance sheet with increased cash from operation and almost $800 million in net proceeds from the sale of noncore assets. At the end of the fourth quarter, our investment-grade balance sheet had approximately $2.4 billion in cash and equivalents, a $3 billion revolver that is essentially undrawn and $250 million in marketable securities. That's total liquidity of nearly $6 billion that Newmont can mobilize to invest in our projects, repay debt or return cash to our shareholders.
Slide 17 illustrates our scheduled debt maturities and potential prepayments. As you can see, we do not have any significant debt due until 2019 and have maintained an investment-grade rating and metrics. Our revolver has just 1 financial covenant, maximum net debt to book capital of 62.5% and we stood at 24.7% as of December 31. 
Our net debt at year-end was approximately $4 billion. We continue to analyze potential opportunities to pay our liabilities in advance as we did last quarter when we made a $100 million payment on our term loan. The term loan has no prepayment penalty and allows us to prepay near-term maturities first so it's a preferred way to delever the balance sheet.
We plan to potentially repay $750 million in 2015. That would include our PTNNT project debt as well as additional payments toward our 2019 term loan. Certainly, any prepayment of debt would be analyzed in the context of the company's cash position, operating performance and business environment. However, even assuming lower gold prices, we have adequate financial flexibility to repay more than the $166 million of scheduled 2015 debt payments. 
And now I'd like to turn the call back over to Gary."

Now I'll walk you through our near-term outlook, which features steady and profitable production, ongoing cost and efficiency improvements and stable sustaining capital expenditures.Turning you to Slide 19. We expect to produce between 4",1101,"Thanks, Laurie. Now I'll walk you through our near-term outlook, which features steady and profitable production, ongoing cost and efficiency improvements and stable sustaining capital expenditures.
Turning you to Slide 19. We expect to produce between 4.6 million and 4.9 million ounces of gold in 2015, rising to between 4.7 million and 5.1 million ounces by 2017. In North America, we expect gold production to increase slightly over the 3-year period as we complete the Turf Vent Shaft and enter a period of lower stripping at Carlin. Potential development of Long Canyon Phase 1 represents additional upside, and I'll talk about that shortly.
We're managing our Australia, New Zealand and Indonesian assets as a single Asia Pacific region in 2015. At Batu Hijau, we forecast steady gold and copper production increases through higher-grade Phase 6 ore and higher gold grades and productivity at Tanami. In Africa, we expect production to decline, primarily due to lower-grade ore at Ahafo. However, a potential Ahafo Mill Expansion would help offset the impact of lower grades and I'll touch on that.
In South America, production is forecast to decline in 2015 and 2016 before rising in 2017 as new production at Merian offsets the impact to maturing operations at Yanacocha. We're also working on an integrated approach to developing oxide and sulfide deposits to extend profitable production at Yanacocha. Our guidance calls for continuous improvement and cost as well.
Turning to Slide 20. In 2015, we expect our gold all-in sustaining costs to come in between $960 and $1,020 per ounce, in line with our 2014 performance. By 2017, our gold all-in sustaining costs are expected to range from $925 to $1,025 per ounce. Our overarching goal is to keep all-in sustaining costs below $1,000 per ounce at each of our operations through ongoing cost and efficiency improvements. 
Our cost could further benefit from lower energy prices and improving foreign exchange rates. Our current outlook assumes the Australian dollar at $0.85 [ph] to the U.S. dollar and oil at $75 per barrel. We have contingency plans in place to ensure that we remain free cash flow positive if there are further fluctuations in metal prices.
We are also holding [indiscernible] sustaining capital, turning you to Slide 21. Over the last few years, we've improved our capital discipline through a stringent value assurance program that I've discussed before and achievable -- or achieving sustainable savings through ongoing improvement initiatives. 
Looking forward, our outlook calls for holding our sustaining capital costs at between $850 million and $950 million from 2015 through 2017. Note that only our fully funded projects at Turf Vent Shaft, Merian and Correnso are included in our outlook, but we are planning to reach decisions on other projects as the year continues. 
I'll walk you through some of our most prospective projects now on Slide 22. We improved the value and viability of our project pipeline significantly over the last year. Our projects' focus on extending mine life, improving our cost portfolio are opening perspective new mining districts. I'll take a minute to update you on those that are in the execution phase and those that will come up for funding consideration in 2015.
Turning to Slide 23. In Nevada, the Turf Vent Shaft reached its full depth of just over 2,000 feet during the fourth quarter of 2014. The shaft will increase high-grade ore to Mill 6, adding 100,000 to 150,000 ounces annually while improving cost and efficiency. We expect to be fully operational later this year. 
As I mentioned, construction at Merian is progressing on budget and on schedule. The mine is expected to be operational in late 2016 and will deliver gold production of between 400,000 and 500,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of between $650 and $750 per ounce for the first 5 years of operation, excluding escalation. As a reminder, our share of this project is 75%.
Finally in New Zealand, we're extending the life of our Waihi operation through our new Correnso mine and will achieve commercial production during this first quarter of 2015. In addition to adding near-term ounces, Correnso provides a drilling platform to explore for other high-grade veins.
Turning to Slide 24 and the next projects we will consider developing in 2015. Long Canyon represents a new high-potential mining district in Nevada, and we're approaching development as an extension of existing operations in order to leverage our expertise and the infrastructure. The product has been optimized to lower capital, generate stronger returns and reduce the payback period. We expect to reach a decision to proceed with the first phase of development at an investment of between $250 million and $300 million in the first quarter of 2015. The project would add between 100,000 and 150,000 ounces of gold annually at competitive costs beginning in early 2017.
In Australia, we're advancing our Tanami Expansion Project, which includes constructing a second decline in the mine and building incremental capacity in the plant. We anticipate reaching a decision on investing between $100 million and $120 million to fund this project in the first half of 2015. The Tanami Expansion Project would add between 50,000 and 60,000 ounces of lower-cost production beginning in 2017 and increase mine life by 4 years.
In Ghana, we're evaluating an expansion in the existing Ahafo Mill, which should help offset the impact of lower-grade ore. We anticipate reaching a decision on the mill expansion later this year and see the potential to bring on 100,000 to 125,000 ounces of production at competitive costs beginning in 2017.
I'll wrap up my comments with a look at where we are taking the company in the future. Turning to Slide 25. We advanced our strategy to create a more focused and profitable gold mining business in 2014 and made substantial progress toward our goal to lead the gold sector in creating value for shareholders. Our performance is the result of more than 13,700 employees delivering on their commitments. And I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank our team for a job well done.
Looking forward, we will continue to execute our strategy, which is to improve our underlying business by continuously raising our safety, cost and technical performance; to strengthen our portfolio by building a longer life, lower-cost asset-base; and finally, to create shareholder value by generating cash and continuing to strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet. In short we're not aiming to be a better gold company, we're aiming to be the best. 
Thank you for your time. I'll turn the call back to the operator now to open the line for questions."

And I was just wondering, given that some of your competitors have made statements about reaffirming their commitment to gold and even threatening to put some other operations into care and maintenance, what your view is at stressed copper prices on how to deal with some of those operations? In other words, are you willing to run the risk operations of cash flow loss for a certain period? Or are you going to take a harder line and put them on care and maintenance if they're not cash flow positive?"

I'm pleased to report that we made great progress delivering on our plans in 2014. Specifically, we significantly improved our safety, cost and productivity performance while achieving our production plans. We raised nearly $800 million by selling noncore assets and began construction on our new mine in Suriname. We optimized our project pipeline to create a suite of near-term opportunities for profitable growth in Nevada, Ghana and Australia. And finally, we significantly strengthened our balance sheet while generating value for our shareholders. 
I'll turn to Slide 4 to review more details.
Strong safety performance is essential to running an efficient business. In 2014, we reduced our injury rates another 17% to historic lows, ending the year with one of the lowest rates in the mining industry. Our people are recognized for their leadership in this area. Most recently, our team at Waihi took first place in the New Zealand Mines Rescue Competition. And at Akyem, they received the Best Safe Mine in Ghana award. 
As proud as we are of these accomplishments, we still have work to do to make Newmont a safer business. We mourn the loss of Brian Holmes, a contractor who died in January while working at our Leeville operations in Nevada. Our thoughts are with his family as we renew our commitment to eliminating all injuries at Newmont.
Turning to Slide 5. I'll focus on our performance in each of the 3 pillars of our strategy. The first part of our strategy is to improve our underlying business. During 2014, we lowered our all-in sustaining costs by more than $500 million or more than $100 per ounce and met our plans to produce more than 4.8 million ounces of gold. We also kept our all-in sustaining costs under $1,000 an ounce for the second quarter in a row.
The second part of our strategy is to strengthen our gold portfolio. During 2014, we made significant progress on our Turf Vent Shaft in Nevada and broke ground on our new mine in Suriname, both of which will add lower-cost production and stable jurisdictions. We also continued to optimize our project pipeline, and I'll talk more about that later in the call.
Finally, we streamlined our portfolio by selling assets that no longer fit our strategy of operating low-cost long-life mines, and as a result, have generated $1.4 billion over the past 2 years.
The third part of our strategy is to generate value for our shareholders while improving financial flexibility and balance sheet strength. During 2014, we generated $2.1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $341 million in free cash flow, an improvement of nearly $700 million over 2013. At the end of the year, we had $2.4 billion in cash on our balance sheet, a 50% improvement from 2013.
We also made an early payment of $100 million toward our existing term loan and returned $114 million in dividends to our shareholders during the year.
Summing up our 2014 performance, we remained focused on our strategic priorities while controlling what we could control and ended the year with a much stronger and healthier business as a result.
Turning to Slide 6 and a look at our 2014 production. You will recall that we sold Midas, Jundee and La Herradura in 2014. Absent the impact of these divestments, our 2014 gold production was in line with our 2013 levels, and we are positioned to deliver steady gold production over the next several years as well. I'll discuss this more when we review our guidance.
We increased our gold production outlook twice in 2014 and finished the year near the top end of our original guidance, even without adjusting for divestments. Our priority is still to deliver value over volume, and I'll turn to our cost performance on Slide 7.
You can see the progress we have made over the last 3 years, lowering our all-in sustaining costs by 15% since 2012. In 2014, we improved our gold all-in sustaining cost guidance twice as a result of steadily exceeding our savings targets. We finished the year 2% below the bottom of our final published range and 10% below our 2013 cost. This adds up to more than $500 million in adjusted savings as we see on Slide 8.
We want to provide a clear view of our cost savings from 2013 to 2014 and to demonstrate how much of that amount resulted from improved technical and operational fundamentals. Our consolidated all-in sustaining costs decreased by $1.2 billion from 2013 to 2014. Of that decrease, $243 million was the result of portfolio changes, including divestments, the Akyem start-up and the 4-month shutdown of Batu Hijau due to the export issues. A further $50 million was related to favorable oil and exchange rate movements. And finally, we took out $386 million related to inventory valuation changes. After excluding these items, we generated savings of $524 million in 2014.
Let's turn to the main components of those savings on Slide 9. As you can see, more than half of Newmont's savings stemmed from improvements to our cost applicable to sales, which we reduced by almost 6% compared to 2013. I'll point out that this is the first time we've reduced our cost applicable to sales since 2009.
We also stabilized our sustaining capital spend at lower and sustainable levels. Some of the work we did to achieve these operational improvements included reducing truck cycle times and improving payloads at Carlin, Twin Creeks, Yanacocha and Tanami; realigning mining and milling rates at Ahafo; reducing supplier and contractor costs by self-performing mining and maintenance activities and negotiating better rates at Boddington, Carlin and our operations in Ghana; and improving equipment reliability entire life at Ahafo, Boddington, Twin Creeks and Yanacocha.
Another 23% of our savings came from lowering advanced projects and exploration costs by 27% to focus on our highest margin opportunities.
Finally, we lowered general and administrative costs across the portfolio.
Turning to our exploration efforts. Our latest reserves and resources statement reflects our ongoing focus on value and quality, as summarized on Slide 10. We added 3.3 million ounces to our gold reserve base last year, partially offsetting 5.5 million ounces of depletion. Our total gold reserves decreased from 88.4 million ounces in 2013 to 82.2 million ounces as of the end of 2014. About 40% of our net year-over-year reduction or 2.5 million ounces was associated with divesting noncore assets.
Another 25% or 1.5 million ounces was due to model revisions and mine design changes, primarily at Turquoise Ridge and Boddington. Our most significant gold reserve additions were made near existing operations in favorable jurisdictions. These include about 700,000 ounces each at Tanami and the Carlin underground mines, 300,000 ounces at Waihi and 200,000 ounces at Long Canyon. We also had notable additions at Merian. 
Turning to Slide 11. We added almost 600,000 ounces of gold reserves at Merian in 2014, half of which is soft saprolite ore, bringing our total reserves to 4.8 million ounces on a 100% basis. As you know, the government of Suriname invested just over $100 million in a 25% stake in Merian late last year. The government is managing its interest through its state-owned oil company, which has been operating in country for 33 years and brings a wealth of development experience to the partnership.
I visited Suriname in December to meet our new partners and to visit the team. We are making good progress on all fronts. About 900 people are trained and working. Earthworks are advancing well and community agreements and environmental controls are in place. The project remains on budget and on schedule to begin production in late 2016.
Before I hand it over to Laurie to talk about our financial performance, I also want to touch briefly on Indonesia and Ghana. You will recall that PTNNT received a 6-month export permit late last September. We're very proud of the team's performance in executing a safe and efficient ramp-up to full capacity at Batu Hijau in October. The mine is just getting into the higher-grade portion of the orebody now.
The new Indonesian administration is getting settled, and our initial meetings to renew our export permit and Contract of Work have been constructive. I'll keep you informed as we work through the details.
Turning to Ghana. In late January, the government imposed load-shedding requirements on all businesses. We are in discussions with the government, along with other large companies, to explore power conservation alternatives that minimize disruptions to our operations. Our team is also developing contingency plans to maintain steady power generation through other sources, and I'll keep you posted on our progress.
With that, I'll hand it over to Laurie to cover our financial results."

It was a strong quarter and year for Newmont as our focus on cost and efficiency improvements continues to pay off.Let's turn to Slide 13 to review recent financial highlights.We worked hard t",664,"Thanks, Gary, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. It was a strong quarter and year for Newmont as our focus on cost and efficiency improvements continues to pay off.
Let's turn to Slide 13 to review recent financial highlights.
We worked hard to drive down costs in 2014, and the results speak for themselves. Fourth quarter gold cost applicable to sales per ounce was down 18% from a year ago and gold all-in sustaining cost per ounce was down nearly 11% from the year-ago quarter. The global cost reductions we achieved in 2014 helped us to expand free cash flow generation despite a 10% drop in the gold price year-over-year.
Turning to Slide 14. We delivered $218 million in consolidated free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2014 and generated a 46% improvement in cash from continuing operation compared to the year-ago quarter despite the 10% drop in gold price.
We reported adjusted net income of $86 million in the most recent quarter or $0.17 per share compared to $143 million or $0.28 per share last year. We added adjusted EBITDA to our release this quarter and are including it in our performance metrics going forward. I am pleased to report that adjusted EBITDA was up 26% from the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA benefited from lower cost applicable to sales, lower exploration and advanced projects expense and lower stockpile adjustments compared to Q4 of 2013.
We continue to fund dividends from free cash flow. And earlier this week, our board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.025 per share, in line with our gold price-linked dividend.
Turning to Slide 15. Let's walk through Q4 net income adjustments. The primary adjustments to our GAAP net income include a $23 million gain, net of tax, related to the sale of La Herradura; a $10 million reclamation settlement; a $14 million impairment primarily on our marketable securities; and a $43 million tax valuation allowance, of which $32 million was related to asset sales.
Adjusted net income also excludes a $24 million loss from discontinued operations. This is a noncash mark-to-market adjustment to our royalty obligation. After reconciling for these items, we reported adjusted net income of $86 million or $0.17 per share for the most recent quarter. 
Now turning to Slide 16. In 2014, we strengthened our balance sheet with increased cash from operation and almost $800 million in net proceeds from the sale of noncore assets. At the end of the fourth quarter, our investment-grade balance sheet had approximately $2.4 billion in cash and equivalents, a $3 billion revolver that is essentially undrawn and $250 million in marketable securities. That's total liquidity of nearly $6 billion that Newmont can mobilize to invest in our projects, repay debt or return cash to our shareholders.
Slide 17 illustrates our scheduled debt maturities and potential prepayments. As you can see, we do not have any significant debt due until 2019 and have maintained an investment-grade rating and metrics. Our revolver has just one financial covenant, maximum net debt to book capital of 62.5%, and we stood at 24.7% as of December 31.
Our net debt at year-end was approximately $4 billion. We continue to analyze potential opportunities to pay our liabilities in advance as we did last quarter when we made a $100 million payment on our term loan. The term loan has no prepayment penalty and allows us to prepay near-term maturities first, so it's a preferred way to delever the balance sheet.
We plan to potentially repay $750 million in 2015. That would include our PTNNT project debt as well as additional payments toward our 2019 term loan. Certainly, any prepayment of debt would be analyzed in the context of the company's cash position, operating performance and business environment. However, even assuming lower gold prices, we have adequate financial flexibility to repay more than the $166 million of scheduled 2015 debt payments.
And now I'd like to turn the call back over to Gary."

We expect to produce between",1106,"Thanks, Laurie. Now I'll walk you through our near-term outlook, which features steady and profitable production, ongoing cost and efficiency improvements and stable, sustaining capital expenditures.
Turning you to Slide 19. We expect to produce between 4.6 million and 4.9 million ounces of gold in 2015, rising to between 4.7 million and 5.1 million ounces by 2017. In North America, we expect gold production to increase slightly over the 3-year period as we complete the Turf Vent Shaft and enter a period of lower stripping at Carlin. Potential development of Long Canyon Phase 1 represents additional upside, and I'll talk about that shortly.
We're managing our Australia, New Zealand and Indonesian assets as a single Asia Pacific region in 2015. At Batu Hijau, we forecast steady gold and copper production increases through higher-grade Phase 6 ore and higher gold grades and productivity at Tanami. In Africa, we expect production to decline, primarily due to lower-grade ore at Ahafo. However, a potential Ahafo Mill Expansion would help offset the impact of lower grades, and I'll touch on that.
In South America, production is forecast to decline in 2015 and 2016 before rising in 2017 as new production at Merian offsets the impact of maturing operations at Yanacocha. We're also working on an integrated approach to developing oxide and sulfide deposits to extend profitable production at Yanacocha. Our guidance calls for continuous improvement in costs as well.
Turning to Slide 20. In 2015, we expect our gold all-in sustaining costs to come out -- come in between $960 and $1,020 per ounce, in line with our 2014 performance. By 2017, our gold all-in sustaining costs are expected to range from $925 to $1,025 per ounce. Our overarching goal is to keep all-in sustaining costs below $1,000 per ounce at each of our operations through ongoing cost and efficiency improvements.
Our costs could further benefit from lower energy prices and improving foreign exchange rates. Our current outlook assumes the Australian dollar at 0.85 to the U.S. dollar and oil at $75 per barrel. We have contingency plans in place to ensure that we remain free cash flow positive if there are further fluctuations in metal prices.
We are also holding the line [ph] on sustaining capital. Turning you to Slide 21. Over the last few years, we've improved our capital discipline through a stringent value assurance program that I've discussed before and achievable -- or achieving sustainable savings through ongoing improvement initiatives.
Looking forward, our outlook calls for holding our sustaining capital costs at between $850 million and $950 million from 2015 through 2017. Note that only our fully funded projects, the Turf Vent Shaft, Merian and Correnso, are included in our outlook, but we are planning to reach decisions on other projects as the year continues.
I'll walk you through some of our most prospective projects now on Slide 22. We improved the value and viability of our project pipeline significantly over the last year. Our projects' focus on extending mine life, improving our cost portfolio are opening prospective new mining districts. I'll take a minute to update you on those that are in the execution phase and those that will come up for funding consideration in 2015.
Turning to Slide 23. In Nevada, the Turf Vent Shaft reached its full depth of just over 2,000 feet during the fourth quarter of 2014. The shaft will increase high-grade ore to Mill 6, adding 100,000 to 150,000 ounces annually while improving cost and efficiency. We expect to be fully operational later this year.
As I mentioned, construction at Merian is progressing on budget and on schedule. The mine is expected to be operational in late 2016 and will deliver gold production of between 400,000 and 500,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of between $650 and $750 per ounce for the first 5 years of operation, excluding escalation. As a reminder, our share of this project is 75%.
Finally in New Zealand, we're extending the life of our Waihi operation through our new Correnso mine and will achieve commercial production during this first quarter of 2015. In addition to adding near-term ounces, Correnso provides a drilling platform to explore for other high-grade veins.
Turning to Slide 24, and the next projects we will consider developing in 2015. Long Canyon represents a new high-potential mining district in Nevada, and we're approaching development as an extension of existing operations in order to leverage our expertise and the infrastructure. The project has been optimized to lower capital, generate stronger returns and reduce the payback period. We expect to reach a decision to proceed with the first phase of development at an investment of between $250 million and $300 million in the first quarter of 2015. The project would add between 100,000 and 150,000 ounces of gold annually at competitive costs beginning in early 2017.
In Australia, we're advancing our Tanami Expansion project, which includes constructing a second decline in the mine and building incremental capacity in the plant. We anticipate reaching a decision on investing between $100 million and $120 million to fund this project in the first half of 2015. The Tanami Expansion project would add between 50,000 and 60,000 ounces of lower-cost production beginning in 2017 and increase mine life by 4 years.
In Ghana, we're evaluating an expansion in the existing Ahafo Mill, which should help offset the impact of lower-grade ore. We anticipate reaching a decision on the mill expansion later this year and see the potential to bring on 100,000 to 125,000 ounces of production at competitive costs beginning in 2017.
I'll wrap up my comments with a look at where we are taking the company in the future. Turning to Slide 25. We advanced our strategy to create a more focused and profitable gold mining business in 2014 and made substantial progress toward our goal to lead the gold sector in creating value for shareholders. Our performance is the result of more than 13,700 employees delivering on their commitments. And I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank our team for a job well done.
Looking forward, we will continue to execute our strategy, which is to improve our underlying business by continuously raising our safety, cost and technical performance; to strengthen our portfolio by building a longer-life, lower-cost asset base; and finally, to create shareholder value by generating cash and continuing to strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet. In short, we're not aiming to be a better gold company; we're aiming to be the best.
Thank you for your time. I'll turn the call back to the operator now to open the line for questions."

I'm pleased to report that we made great progress delivering on our plans in 2014. Specifically, we significantly improved our safety, cost and productivity performance while achieving our production plans. We raised nearly $800 million by selling noncore assets and began construction on our new mine in Suriname. We optimized our project pipeline to create a suite of near-term opportunities for profitable growth in Nevada, Ghana and Australia. And finally, we significantly strengthened our balance sheet while generating value for our shareholders. 
I'll turn to Slide 4 to review more details.
Strong safety performance is essential to running an efficient business. In 2014, we reduced our injury rates another 17% to historic lows, ending the year with one of the lowest rates in the mining industry. Our people are recognized for their leadership in this area. Most recently, our team at Waihi took first place in the New Zealand Mines Rescue Competition. And at Akyem, they received the Best Safe Mine in Ghana award. 
As proud as we are of these accomplishments, we still have work to do to make Newmont a safer business. We mourn the loss of Brian Holmes, a contractor who died in January while working at our Leeville operations in Nevada. Our thoughts are with his family as we renew our commitment to eliminating all injuries at Newmont.
Turning to Slide 5. I'll focus on our performance in each of the 3 pillars of our strategy. The first part of our strategy is to improve our underlying business. During 2014, we lowered our all-in sustaining costs by more than $500 million or more than $100 per ounce and met our plans to produce more than 4.8 million ounces of gold. We also kept our all-in sustaining costs under $1,000 an ounce for the second quarter in a row.
The second part of our strategy is to strengthen our gold portfolio. During 2014, we made significant progress on our Turf Vent Shaft in Nevada and broke ground on our new mine in Suriname, both of which will add lower-cost production in stable jurisdictions. We also continued to optimize our project pipeline, and I'll talk more about that later in the call.
Finally, we streamlined our portfolio by selling assets that no longer fit our strategy of operating low-cost long-life mines, and as a result, have generated $1.4 billion over the past 2 years.
The third part of our strategy is to generate value for our shareholders while improving financial flexibility and balance sheet strength. During 2014, we generated $2.1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $341 million in free cash flow, an improvement of nearly $700 million over 2013. At the end of the year, we had $2.4 billion in cash on our balance sheet, a 50% improvement from 2013.
We also made an early payment of $100 million toward our existing term loan and returned $114 million in dividends to our shareholders during the year.
Summing up our 2014 performance, we remained focused on our strategic priorities while controlling what we could control and ended the year with a much stronger and healthier business as a result.
Turning to Slide 6 and a look at our 2014 production. You will recall that we sold Midas, Jundee and La Herradura in 2014. Absent the impact of these divestments, our 2014 gold production was in line with our 2013 levels, and we are positioned to deliver steady gold production over the next several years as well. I'll discuss this more when we review our guidance.
We increased our gold production outlook twice in 2014 and finished the year near the top end of our original guidance, even without adjusting for divestments. Our priority is still to deliver value over volume, and I'll turn to our cost performance on Slide 7.
You can see the progress we have made over the last 3 years, lowering our all-in sustaining costs by 15% since 2012. In 2014, we improved our gold all-in sustaining cost guidance twice as a result of steadily exceeding our savings targets. We finished the year 2% below the bottom of our final published range and 10% below our 2013 costs. This adds up to more than $500 million in adjusted savings as we see on Slide 8.
We want to provide a clear view of our cost savings from 2013 to 2014 and to demonstrate how much of that amount resulted from improved technical and operational fundamentals. Our consolidated all-in sustaining costs decreased by $1.2 billion from 2013 to 2014. Of that decrease, $243 million was the result of portfolio changes, including divestments, the Akyem start-up and the 4-month shutdown of Batu Hijau due to the export issues. A further $50 million was related to favorable oil and exchange rate movements. And finally, we took out $386 million related to inventory valuation changes. After excluding these items, we generated savings of $524 million in 2014.
Let's turn to the main components of those savings on Slide 9. As you can see, more than half of Newmont's savings stem from improvements to our cost applicable to sales, which we reduced by almost 6% compared to 2013. I'll point out that this is the first time we've reduced our cost applicable to sales since 2009.
We also stabilized our sustaining capital spend at lower and sustainable levels. Some of the work we did to achieve these operational improvements included reducing truck cycle times and improving payloads at Carlin, Twin Creeks, Yanacocha and Tanami; realigning mining and milling rates at Ahafo; reducing supplier and contractor costs by self-performing mining and maintenance activities and negotiating better rates at Boddington, Carlin and our operations in Ghana; and improving equipment reliability entire life at Ahafo, Boddington, Twin Creeks and Yanacocha.
Another 23% of our savings came from lowering advanced projects and exploration costs by 27% to focus on our highest margin opportunities.
Finally, we lowered general and administrative costs across the portfolio.
Turning to our exploration efforts. Our latest reserves and resources statement reflects our ongoing focus on value and quality, as summarized on Slide 10. We added 3.3 million ounces to our gold reserve base last year, partially offsetting 5.5 million ounces of depletion. Our total gold reserves decreased from 88.4 million ounces in 2013 to 82.2 million ounces as of the end of 2014. About 40% of our net year-over-year reduction or 2.5 million ounces was associated with divesting noncore assets.
Another 25% or 1.5 million ounces was due to model revisions and mine design changes, primarily at Turquoise Ridge and Boddington. Our most significant gold reserve additions were made near existing operations in favorable jurisdictions. These include about 700,000 ounces each at Tanami and the Carlin underground mines, 300,000 ounces at Waihi and 200,000 ounces at Long Canyon. We also had notable additions at Merian. 
Turning to Slide 11. We added almost 600,000 ounces of gold reserves at Merian in 2014, half of which is soft saprolite ore, bringing our total reserves to 4.8 million ounces on a 100% basis. As you know, the government of Suriname invested just over $100 million in a 25% stake in Merian late last year. The government is managing its interest through its state-owned oil company, which has been operating in-country for 33 years and brings a wealth of development experience to the partnership.
I visited Suriname in December to meet our new partners and to visit the team. We are making good progress on all fronts. About 900 people are trained and working. Earthworks are advancing well and community agreements and environmental controls are in place. The project remains on budget and on schedule to begin production in late 2016.
Before I hand it over to Laurie to talk about our financial performance, I also want to touch briefly on Indonesia and Ghana. You will recall that PTNNT received a 6-month export permit late last September. We're very proud of the team's performance in executing a safe and efficient ramp-up to full capacity at Batu Hijau in October. The mine is just getting into the higher-grade portion of the orebody now.
The new Indonesian administration is getting settled, and our initial meetings to renew our export permit and Contract of Work have been constructive. I'll keep you informed as we work through the details.
Turning to Ghana. In late January, the government imposed load-shedding requirements on all businesses. We are in discussions with the government, along with other large companies, to explore power conservation alternatives that minimize disruptions to our operations. Our team is also developing contingency plans to maintain steady power generation through other sources, and I'll keep you posted on our progress.
With that, I'll hand it over to Laurie to cover our financial results."

It was a strong quarter and year for Newmont as our focus on cost and efficiency improvements continues to pay off.
Let's turn to Slide 13 to review recent financial highlights.
We worked hard to drive down costs in 2014, and the results speak for themselves. Fourth quarter gold cost applicable to sales per ounce was down 18% from a year ago and gold all-in sustaining cost per ounce was down nearly 11% from the year-ago quarter. The global cost reductions we achieved in 2014 helped us to expand free cash flow generation despite a 10% drop in the gold price year-over-year.
Turning to Slide 14. We delivered $218 million in consolidated free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2014 and generated a 46% improvement in cash from continuing operation compared to the year-ago quarter despite the 10% drop in gold price.
We reported adjusted net income of $86 million in the most recent quarter or $0.17 per share compared to $143 million or $0.28 per share last year. We added adjusted EBITDA to our release this quarter and are including it in our performance metrics going forward. I am pleased to report that adjusted EBITDA was up 26% from the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA benefited from lower costs applicable to sales, lower exploration and advanced projects expense and lower stockpile adjustments compared to Q4 of 2013.
We continue to fund dividends from free cash flow. And earlier this week, our board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.025 per share, in line with our gold price-linked dividend.
Turning to Slide 15. Let's walk through Q4 net income adjustments. The primary adjustments to our GAAP net income include a $23 million gain, net of tax, related to the sale of La Herradura; a $10 million reclamation settlement; a $14 million impairment primarily on our marketable securities; and a $43 million tax valuation allowance, of which $32 million was related to asset sales.
Adjusted net income also excludes a $24 million loss from discontinued operations. This is a noncash mark-to-market adjustment to a royalty obligation. After reconciling for these items, we reported adjusted net income of $86 million or $0.17 per share for the most recent quarter. 
Now turning to Slide 16. In 2014, we strengthened our balance sheet with increased cash from operations and almost $800 million in net proceeds from the sale of noncore assets. At the end of the fourth quarter, our investment-grade balance sheet had approximately $2.4 billion in cash and equivalents, a $3 billion revolver that is essentially undrawn and $250 million in marketable securities. That's total liquidity of nearly $6 billion that Newmont can mobilize to invest in our projects, repay debt or return cash to our shareholders.
Slide 17 illustrates our scheduled debt maturities and potential prepayments. As you can see, we do not have any significant debt due until 2019 and have maintained an investment-grade rating and metrics. Our revolver has just one financial covenant, maximum net debt to book capital of 62.5%, and we stood at 24.7% as of December 31.
Our net debt at year-end was approximately $4 billion. We continue to analyze potential opportunities to pay our liabilities in advance as we did last quarter when we made a $100 million payment on our term loan. The term loan has no prepayment penalty and allows us to prepay near-term maturities first, so it's a preferred way to delever the balance sheet.
We plan to potentially repay $750 million in 2015. That would include our PTNNT project debt as well as additional payments toward our 2019 term loan. Certainly, any prepayment of debt would be analyzed in the context of the company's cash position, operating performance and business environment. However, even assuming lower gold prices, we have adequate financial flexibility to repay more than the $166 million of scheduled 2015 debt payments.
And now I'd like to turn the call back over to Gary."

Now I'll walk you through our near-term outlook, which features steady and profitable production, ongoing cost and efficiency improvements and stable, sustaining capital expenditures.Turning you to Slide 19. We expect to produce between",1106,"Thanks, Laurie. Now I'll walk you through our near-term outlook, which features steady and profitable production, ongoing cost and efficiency improvements and stable, sustaining capital expenditures.
Turning you to Slide 19. We expect to produce between 4.6 million and 4.9 million ounces of gold in 2015, rising to between 4.7 million and 5.1 million ounces by 2017. In North America, we expect gold production to increase slightly over the 3-year period as we complete the Turf Vent Shaft and enter a period of lower stripping at Carlin. Potential development of Long Canyon Phase 1 represents additional upside, and I'll talk about that shortly.
We're managing our Australia, New Zealand and Indonesian assets as a single Asia Pacific region in 2015. At Batu Hijau, we forecast steady gold and copper production increases through higher-grade Phase 6 ore and higher gold grades and productivity at Tanami. In Africa, we expect production to decline, primarily due to lower-grade ore at Ahafo. However, a potential Ahafo Mill Expansion would help offset the impact of lower grades, and I'll touch on that.
In South America, production is forecast to decline in 2015 and 2016 before rising in 2017 as new production at Merian offsets the impact of maturing operations at Yanacocha. We're also working on an integrated approach to developing oxide and sulfide deposits to extend profitable production at Yanacocha. Our guidance calls for continuous improvement in costs as well.
Turning to Slide 20. In 2015, we expect our gold all-in sustaining costs to come out -- come in between $960 and $1,020 per ounce, in line with our 2014 performance. By 2017, our gold all-in sustaining costs are expected to range from $925 to $1,025 per ounce. Our overarching goal is to keep all-in sustaining costs below $1,000 per ounce at each of our operations through ongoing cost and efficiency improvements.
Our costs could further benefit from lower energy prices and improving foreign exchange rates. Our current outlook assumes the Australian dollar at $0.85 to the U.S. dollar and oil at $75 per barrel. We have contingency plans in place to ensure that we remain free cash flow positive if there are further fluctuations in metal prices.
We are also holding the line [ph] on sustaining capital. Turning you to Slide 21. Over the last few years, we've improved our capital discipline through a stringent value assurance program that I've discussed before and achievable -- or achieving sustainable savings through ongoing improvement initiatives.
Looking forward, our outlook calls for holding our sustaining capital costs at between $850 million and $950 million from 2015 through 2017. Note that only our fully funded projects, the Turf Vent Shaft, Merian and Correnso, are included in our outlook, but we are planning to reach decisions on other projects as the year continues.
I'll walk you through some of our most prospective projects now on Slide 22. We improved the value and viability of our project pipeline significantly over the last year. Our projects' focus on extending mine life, improving our cost portfolio are opening prospective new mining districts. I'll take a minute to update you on those that are in the execution phase and those that will come up for funding consideration in 2015.
Turning to Slide 23. In Nevada, the Turf Vent Shaft reached its full depth of just over 2,000 feet during the fourth quarter of 2014. The shaft will increase high-grade ore to Mill 6, adding 100,000 to 150,000 ounces annually while improving cost and efficiency. We expect to be fully operational later this year.
As I mentioned, construction at Merian is progressing on budget and on schedule. The mine is expected to be operational in late 2016 and will deliver gold production of between 400,000 and 500,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of between $650 and $750 per ounce for the first 5 years of operation, excluding escalation. As a reminder, our share of this project is 75%.
Finally in New Zealand, we're extending the life of our Waihi operation through our new Correnso mine and will achieve commercial production during this first quarter of 2015. In addition to adding near-term ounces, Correnso provides a drilling platform to explore for other high-grade veins.
Turning to Slide 24, and the next projects we will consider developing in 2015. Long Canyon represents a new high-potential mining district in Nevada, and we're approaching development as an extension of existing operations in order to leverage our expertise and the infrastructure. The project has been optimized to lower capital, generate stronger returns and reduce the payback period. We expect to reach a decision to proceed with the first phase of development at an investment of between $250 million and $300 million in the first quarter of 2015. The project would add between 100,000 and 150,000 ounces of gold annually at competitive costs beginning in early 2017.
In Australia, we're advancing our Tanami Expansion project, which includes constructing a second decline in the mine and building incremental capacity in the plant. We anticipate reaching a decision on investing between $100 million and $120 million to fund this project in the first half of 2015. The Tanami Expansion project would add between 50,000 and 60,000 ounces of lower-cost production beginning in 2017 and increase mine life by 4 years.
In Ghana, we're evaluating an expansion in the existing Ahafo Mill, which should help offset the impact of lower-grade ore. We anticipate reaching a decision on the mill expansion later this year and see the potential to bring on 100,000 to 125,000 ounces of production at competitive costs beginning in 2017.
I'll wrap up my comments with a look at where we are taking the company in the future. Turning to Slide 25. We advanced our strategy to create a more focused and profitable gold mining business in 2014 and made substantial progress toward our goal to lead the gold sector in creating value for shareholders. Our performance is the result of more than 13,700 employees delivering on their commitments. And I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank our team for a job well done.
Looking forward, we will continue to execute our strategy, which is to improve our underlying business by continuously raising our safety, cost and technical performance; to strengthen our portfolio by building a longer-life, lower-cost asset base; and finally, to create shareholder value by generating cash and continuing to strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet. In short, we're not aiming to be a better gold company; we're aiming to be the best.
Thank you for your time. I'll turn the call back to the operator now to open the line for questions."

I'm pleased to report that we made great progress delivering on our plans in 2014. Specifically, we significantly improved our safety, cost and productivity performance while achieving our production plans. We raised nearly $800 million by selling noncore assets and began construction on our new mine in Suriname. We optimized our project pipeline to create a suite of near-term opportunities for profitable growth in Nevada, Ghana and Australia. And finally, we significantly strengthened our balance sheet while generating value for our shareholders.
I'll turn to Slide 4 to review more details.
Strong safety performance is essential to running an efficient business. In 2014, we reduced our injury rates another 17% to historic lows, ending the year with one of the lowest rates in the mining industry. Our people are recognized for their leadership in this area. Most recently, our team at Waihi took first place in the New Zealand Mines Rescue Competition. And at Akyem, they received the Best Safe Mine in Ghana award.
As proud as we are of these accomplishments, we still have work to do to make Newmont a safer business. We mourn the loss of Brian Holmes, a contractor who died in January while working at our Leeville operations in Nevada. Our thoughts are with his family as we renew our commitment to eliminating all injuries at Newmont.
Turning to Slide 5. I'll focus on our performance in each of the 3 pillars of our strategy. The first part of our strategy is to improve our underlying business. During 2014, we lowered our all-in sustaining costs by more than $500 million or more than $100 per ounce and met our plans to produce more than 4.8 million ounces of gold. We also kept our all-in sustaining costs under $1,000 an ounce for the second quarter in a row.
The second part of our strategy is to strengthen our gold portfolio. During 2014, we made significant progress on our Turf Vent Shaft in Nevada and broke ground on our new mine in Suriname, both of which will add lower-cost production in stable jurisdictions. We also continued to optimize our project pipeline, and I'll talk more about that later in the call.
Finally, we streamlined our portfolio by selling assets that no longer fit our strategy of operating low-cost long-life mines, and as a result, have generated $1.4 billion over the past 2 years.
The third part of our strategy is to generate value for our shareholders while improving financial flexibility and balance sheet strength. During 2014, we generated $2.1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $341 million in free cash flow, an improvement of nearly $700 million over 2013. At the end of the year, we had $2.4 billion in cash on our balance sheet, a 50% improvement from 2013.
We also made an early payment of $100 million toward our existing term loan and returned $114 million in dividends to our shareholders during the year.
Summing up our 2014 performance, we remained focused on our strategic priorities while controlling what we could control and ended the year with a much stronger and healthier business as a result.
Turning to Slide 6 and a look at our 2014 production. You will recall that we sold Midas, Jundee and La Herradura in 2014. Absent the impact of these divestments, our 2014 gold production was in line with our 2013 levels, and we are positioned to deliver steady gold production over the next several years as well. I'll discuss this more when we review our guidance.
We increased our gold production outlook twice in 2014 and finished the year near the top end of our original guidance, even without adjusting for divestments. Our priority is still to deliver value over volume, and I'll turn to our cost performance on Slide 7.
You can see the progress we have made over the last 3 years, lowering our all-in sustaining costs by 15% since 2012. In 2014, we improved our gold all-in sustaining cost guidance twice as a result of steadily exceeding our savings targets. We finished the year 2% below the bottom of our final published range and 10% below our 2013 costs. This adds up to more than $500 million in adjusted savings as we see on Slide 8.
We want to provide a clear view of our cost savings from 2013 to 2014 and to demonstrate how much of that amount resulted from improved technical and operational fundamentals. Our consolidated all-in sustaining costs decreased by $1.2 billion from 2013 to 2014. Of that decrease, $243 million was the result of portfolio changes, including divestments, the Akyem start-up and the 4-month shutdown of Batu Hijau due to the export issues. A further $50 million was related to favorable oil and exchange rate movements. And finally, we took out $386 million related to inventory valuation changes. After excluding these items, we generated savings of $524 million in 2014.
Let's turn to the main components of those savings on Slide 9. As you can see, more than half of Newmont's savings stem from improvements to our cost applicable to sales, which we reduced by almost 6% compared to 2013. I'll point out that this is the first time we've reduced our cost applicable to sales since 2009.
We also stabilized our sustaining capital spend at lower and sustainable levels. Some of the work we did to achieve these operational improvements included reducing truck cycle times and improving payloads at Carlin, Twin Creeks, Yanacocha and Tanami; realigning mining and milling rates at Ahafo; reducing supplier and contractor costs by self-performing mining and maintenance activities and negotiating better rates at Boddington, Carlin and our operations in Ghana; and improving equipment reliability entire life at Ahafo, Boddington, Twin Creeks and Yanacocha.
Another 23% of our savings came from lowering advanced projects and exploration costs by 27% to focus on our highest margin opportunities.
Finally, we lowered general and administrative costs across the portfolio.
Turning to our exploration efforts. Our latest reserves and resources statement reflects our ongoing focus on value and quality, as summarized on Slide 10. We added 3.3 million ounces to our gold reserve base last year, partially offsetting 5.5 million ounces of depletion. Our total gold reserves decreased from 88.4 million ounces in 2013 to 82.2 million ounces as of the end of 2014. About 40% of our net year-over-year reduction or 2.5 million ounces was associated with divesting noncore assets.
Another 25% or 1.5 million ounces was due to model revisions and mine design changes, primarily at Turquoise Ridge and Boddington. Our most significant gold reserve additions were made near existing operations in favorable jurisdictions. These include about 700,000 ounces each at Tanami and the Carlin underground mines, 300,000 ounces at Waihi and 200,000 ounces at Long Canyon. We also had notable additions at Merian.
Turning to Slide 11. We added almost 600,000 ounces of gold reserves at Merian in 2014, half of which is soft saprolite ore, bringing our total reserves to 4.8 million ounces on a 100% basis. As you know, the government of Suriname invested just over $100 million in a 25% stake in Merian late last year. The government is managing its interest through its state-owned oil company, which has been operating in-country for 33 years and brings a wealth of development experience to the partnership.
I visited Suriname in December to meet our new partners and to visit the team. We are making good progress on all fronts. About 900 people are trained and working. Earthworks are advancing well and community agreements and environmental controls are in place. The project remains on budget and on schedule to begin production in late 2016.
Before I hand it over to Laurie to talk about our financial performance, I also want to touch briefly on Indonesia and Ghana. You will recall that PTNNT received a 6-month export permit late last September. We're very proud of the team's performance in executing a safe and efficient ramp-up to full capacity at Batu Hijau in October. The mine is just getting into the higher-grade portion of the orebody now.
The new Indonesian administration is getting settled, and our initial meetings to renew our export permit and Contract of Work have been constructive. I'll keep you informed as we work through the details.
Turning to Ghana. In late January, the government imposed load-shedding requirements on all businesses. We are in discussions with the government, along with other large companies, to explore power conservation alternatives that minimize disruptions to our operations. Our team is also developing contingency plans to maintain steady power generation through other sources, and I'll keep you posted on our progress.
With that, I'll hand it over to Laurie to cover our financial results."

It was a strong quarter and year for Newmont as our focus on cost and efficiency improvements continues to pay off.Let's turn to Slide 13 to review recent financial highlights.We worked hard t",664,"Thanks, Gary, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. It was a strong quarter and year for Newmont as our focus on cost and efficiency improvements continues to pay off.
Let's turn to Slide 13 to review recent financial highlights.
We worked hard to drive down costs in 2014, and the results speak for themselves. Fourth quarter gold cost applicable to sales per ounce was down 18% from a year ago and gold all-in sustaining cost per ounce was down nearly 11% from the year-ago quarter. The global cost reductions we achieved in 2014 helped us to expand free cash flow generation despite a 10% drop in the gold price year-over-year.
Turning to Slide 14. We delivered $218 million in consolidated free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2014 and generated a 46% improvement in cash from continuing operation compared to the year-ago quarter despite the 10% drop in gold price.
We reported adjusted net income of $86 million in the most recent quarter or $0.17 per share compared to $143 million or $0.28 per share last year. We added adjusted EBITDA to our release this quarter and are including it in our performance metrics going forward. I am pleased to report that adjusted EBITDA was up 26% from the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA benefited from lower costs applicable to sales, lower exploration and advanced projects expense and lower stockpile adjustments compared to Q4 of 2013.
We continue to fund dividends from free cash flow. And earlier this week, our board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.025 per share, in line with our gold price-linked dividend.
Turning to Slide 15. Let's walk through Q4 net income adjustments. The primary adjustments to our GAAP net income include a $23 million gain, net of tax, related to the sale of La Herradura; a $10 million reclamation settlement; a $14 million impairment primarily on our marketable securities; and a $43 million tax valuation allowance, of which $32 million was related to asset sales.
Adjusted net income also excludes a $24 million loss from discontinued operations. This is a noncash mark-to-market adjustment to a royalty obligation. After reconciling for these items, we reported adjusted net income of $86 million or $0.17 per share for the most recent quarter.
Now turning to Slide 16. In 2014, we strengthened our balance sheet with increased cash from operations and almost $800 million in net proceeds from the sale of noncore assets. At the end of the fourth quarter, our investment-grade balance sheet had approximately $2.4 billion in cash and equivalents, a $3 billion revolver that is essentially undrawn and $250 million in marketable securities. That's total liquidity of nearly $6 billion that Newmont can mobilize to invest in our projects, repay debt or return cash to our shareholders.
Slide 17 illustrates our scheduled debt maturities and potential prepayments. As you can see, we do not have any significant debt due until 2019 and have maintained an investment-grade rating and metrics. Our revolver has just one financial covenant, maximum net debt to book capital of 62.5%, and we stood at 24.7% as of December 31.
Our net debt at year-end was approximately $4 billion. We continue to analyze potential opportunities to pay our liabilities in advance as we did last quarter when we made a $100 million payment on our term loan. The term loan has no prepayment penalty and allows us to prepay near-term maturities first, so it's a preferred way to delever the balance sheet.
We plan to potentially repay $750 million in 2015. That would include our PTNNT project debt as well as additional payments toward our 2019 term loan. Certainly, any prepayment of debt would be analyzed in the context of the company's cash position, operating performance and business environment. However, even assuming lower gold prices, we have adequate financial flexibility to repay more than the $166 million of scheduled 2015 debt payments.
And now I'd like to turn the call back over to Gary."

Now I'll walk you through our near-term outlook, which features steady and profitable production, ongoing cost and efficiency improvements and stable, sustaining capital expenditures.
Turning you to Slide 19. We expect to produce between 4.6 million and 4.9 million ounces of gold in 2015, rising to between 4.7 million and 5.1 million ounces by 2017. In North America, we expect gold production to increase slightly over the 3-year period as we complete the Turf Vent Shaft and enter a period of lower stripping at Carlin. Potential development of Long Canyon Phase 1 represents additional upside, and I'll talk about that shortly.
We're managing our Australia, New Zealand and Indonesian assets as a single Asia Pacific region in 2015. At Batu Hijau, we forecast steady gold and copper production increases through higher-grade Phase 6 ore and higher gold grades and productivity at Tanami. In Africa, we expect production to decline, primarily due to lower-grade ore at Ahafo. However, a potential Ahafo Mill Expansion would help offset the impact of lower grades, and I'll touch on that.
In South America, production is forecast to decline in 2015 and 2016 before rising in 2017 as new production at Merian offsets the impact of maturing operations at Yanacocha. We're also working on an integrated approach to developing oxide and sulfide deposits to extend profitable production at Yanacocha. Our guidance calls for continuous improvement in costs as well.
Turning to Slide 20. In 2015, we expect our gold all-in sustaining costs to come out -- come in between $960 and $1,020 per ounce, in line with our 2014 performance. By 2017, our gold all-in sustaining costs are expected to range from $925 to $1,025 per ounce. Our overarching goal is to keep all-in sustaining costs below $1,000 per ounce at each of our operations through ongoing cost and efficiency improvements.
Our costs could further benefit from lower energy prices and improving foreign exchange rates. Our current outlook assumes the Australian dollar at $0.85 to the U.S. dollar and oil at $75 per barrel. We have contingency plans in place to ensure that we remain free cash flow positive if there are further fluctuations in metal prices.
We are also holding the line [ph] on sustaining capital. Turning you to Slide 21. Over the last few years, we've improved our capital discipline through a stringent value assurance program that I've discussed before and achievable -- or achieving sustainable savings through ongoing improvement initiatives.
Looking forward, our outlook calls for holding our sustaining capital costs at between $850 million and $950 million from 2015 through 2017. Note that only our fully funded projects, the Turf Vent Shaft, Merian and Correnso, are included in our outlook, but we are planning to reach decisions on other projects as the year continues.
I'll walk you through some of our most prospective projects now on Slide 22. We improved the value and viability of our project pipeline significantly over the last year. Our projects' focus on extending mine life, improving our cost portfolio are opening prospective new mining districts. I'll take a minute to update you on those that are in the execution phase and those that will come up for funding consideration in 2015.
Turning to Slide 23. In Nevada, the Turf Vent Shaft reached its full depth of just over 2,000 feet during the fourth quarter of 2014. The shaft will increase high-grade ore to Mill 6, adding 100,000 to 150,000 ounces annually while improving cost and efficiency. We expect to be fully operational later this year.
As I mentioned, construction at Merian is progressing on budget and on schedule. The mine is expected to be operational in late 2016 and will deliver gold production of between 400,000 and 500,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of between $650 and $750 per ounce for the first 5 years of operation, excluding escalation. As a reminder, our share of this project is 75%.
Finally in New Zealand, we're extending the life of our Waihi operation through our new Correnso mine and will achieve commercial production during this first quarter of 2015. In addition to adding near-term ounces, Correnso provides a drilling platform to explore for other high-grade veins.
Turning to Slide 24, and the next projects we will consider developing in 2015. Long Canyon represents a new high-potential mining district in Nevada, and we're approaching development as an extension of existing operations in order to leverage our expertise and the infrastructure. The project has been optimized to lower capital, generate stronger returns and reduce the payback period. We expect to reach a decision to proceed with the first phase of development at an investment of between $250 million and $300 million in the first quarter of 2015. The project would add between 100,000 and 150,000 ounces of gold annually at competitive costs beginning in early 2017.
In Australia, we're advancing our Tanami Expansion project, which includes constructing a second decline in the mine and building incremental capacity in the plant. We anticipate reaching a decision on investing between $100 million and $120 million to fund this project in the first half of 2015. The Tanami Expansion project would add between 50,000 and 60,000 ounces of lower-cost production beginning in 2017 and increase mine life by 4 years.
In Ghana, we're evaluating an expansion in the existing Ahafo Mill, which should help offset the impact of lower-grade ore. We anticipate reaching a decision on the mill expansion later this year and see the potential to bring on 100,000 to 125,000 ounces of production at competitive costs beginning in 2017.
I'll wrap up my comments with a look at where we are taking the company in the future. Turning to Slide 25. We advanced our strategy to create a more focused and profitable gold mining business in 2014 and made substantial progress toward our goal to lead the gold sector in creating value for shareholders. Our performance is the result of more than 13,700 employees delivering on their commitments. And I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank our team for a job well done.
Looking forward, we will continue to execute our strategy, which is to improve our underlying business by continuously raising our safety, cost and technical performance; to strengthen our portfolio by building a longer-life, lower-cost asset base; and finally, to create shareholder value by generating cash and continuing to strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet. In short, we're not aiming to be a better gold company; we're aiming to be the best.
Thank you for your time. I'll turn the call back to the operator now to open the line for questions."

We incre",1026,"Thanks, Meredith, and thank you for joining us this morning. Newmont made a strong start to 2015, and I appreciate the chance to tell you more about our performance. In a nutshell, we continued to deliver safe and steady production at lower cost. We increased our free cash flow by nearly $400 million compared to the first quarter of 2014. We advanced projects in Nevada, Suriname and New Zealand and announced plans to build a new mine at Long Canyon. And we continued to strengthen our balance sheet as our improved performance allowed us to prepay debt and fund our best growth prospects. 
I'll turn to Slide 4 to begin with safety. Safety performance is the best way to gauge the health of a business. A strong safety culture goes hand in hand with efficient operations and an engaged workforce. We reduced total injury rates by 9% compared to the prior year quarter, and 2 of our operations, Akyem and Waihi, have worked without reportable injury so far this year. 
We also had the lowest total injury rates among ICMM member companies in 2014. While these statistics show that we're heading in the right direction, we're not where we need to be. In January, a contractor named Brian Holmes suffered a fatal injury during a shaft maintenance work at Leeville in Nevada. Our thoughts are with Brian's family and his colleagues. We'll continue to work on our performance until we can send everyone home safely every day. 
Let's turn to Slide 5 for quarter 1 highlights. Our strategy has proven successful, and we're continuing to follow through on our commitments. The first part of our strategy is to improve the underlying business. We lowered gold all-in sustaining cost for the third quarter running and by 18% compared to the prior year quarter. This was the result of sustained cost improvements and higher grades, favorable oil price and exchange rates and some delayed capital that we'll spend later this year. We also kept gold production steady quarter-on-quarter, offsetting divestments.
The second part of our strategy is to build a stronger portfolio. We reached commercial production at Correnso in January on time and on budget, and we remain on schedule to deliver first production at our Turf Vent Shaft in late 2015, at Merian in late 2016 and at our newest project, Long Canyon, in 2017. 
The third part of our strategy is to create shareholder value. We generated $815 million in adjusted EBITDA, a 65% increase compared to the first quarter of 2014 and prepaid $200 million in debt. We ended the quarter with nearly $2.6 billion in cash on our balance sheet and a net debt that is $1.4 billion lower than a year ago.
Turning to Slide 6. We produced more than 1.2 million ounces of gold and 37,000 tonnes of copper in the first quarter of 2015. As I mentioned, this more than offset the impact of divesting Midas, Jundee and La Herradura. Performance was strong across the portfolio. Batu Hijau ended the quarter ahead of schedule as we mined higher grade Phase 6 ore.
Twin Creeks production was favorable due to higher autoclave recovery. I'll also note that consistent with prior years, Mill 6 at Carlin will be down in the second quarter for planned maintenance. Akyem and Ahafo exceeded targets despite periodic shutdowns due to power availability, which I'll cover in a moment. Boddington also made up for power interruptions resulting from wildfires in Western Australia. Finally, Waihi benefited from higher mill throughput and new production at Correnso. Our cost performance is also strong.
Turning to Slide 7. We reduced gold all-in sustaining cost to $849 per ounce and kept them below $1,000 at every one of our managed operations. 
I'll turn to Slide 8 to walk through the contributing factors. Our gold all-in sustaining cost improved by $185 per ounce from the prior year quarter. As you can see, about half of this improvement stem from CAS reductions driven by better grades and recoveries as well as sustained cost and efficiency improvements.
For example, at Batu Hijau, we reached high grade Phase 6 ore. At Twin Creeks, we hit improved grades, throughput and recoveries. At Yanacocha, higher grades and recoveries offset lower throughput. And at Tanami, improved mining rates led to higher throughput. Lower oil prices and a favorable Australian dollar exchange rate accounted for another 30% of our AISC improvements. Finally, 15% resulted from lower sustaining capital in advanced projects [indiscernible], primarily due to timing.
Turning to Slide 9. Before I hand it over to Laurie for financial results, I'll cover a few key opportunities and challenges. Later in the presentation, I'll discuss Long Canyon, where we're taking advantage of 50 years of operating in Nevada and the expertise, infrastructure and relationships that we've developed along the way to maximize value.
Moving south to Merian, I'm pleased to report that construction is progressing on time and on budget. We have a good partner in the Surinamese government with current [indiscernible] calls and a highly energized team who has begun preproduction mining. 
In Indonesia, we received a new export permit and are having regular meetings with the new administration on the Contract of Work. Our teams in both Indonesia and Ghana are working to negotiate new labor contracts that continue to offer fair wages and benefits while supporting our ability to thrive and grow. 
Negotiations have been more challenging in Ghana, but the National Labor Council has stepped into the process, and we hope to reach an equitable agreement soon. The other challenge we face in Ghana has to do with power. Drought conditions, fuel supply shortages and diminished plant capacity are impacting Ghana's ability to generate power. In January, the government imposed a 33% load shedding requirement on all industrial customers. We're in discussions with the government and other producers to explore power conservation alternatives to minimize disruptions. We have also implemented contingency plans to add temporary power generation capacity by July and permanent capacity by year end. As I mentioned, Ahafo and Akyem are meeting production and cost targets this year. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Laurie."
291795,289046773,794303,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2015",2015-04-24,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Gary, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. It was a strong first quarter for Newmont, and I'm pleased with our performance. First turning to Slide 11. As Gary mentioned, we continue to see strong cost performance across the portfolio. Our f",650,"Thanks, Gary, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. It was a strong first quarter for Newmont, and I'm pleased with our performance. First turning to Slide 11. As Gary mentioned, we continue to see strong cost performance across the portfolio. Our first quarter cost applicable to sales per ounce and all-in sustaining cost per ounce were both nearly 20% favorable to the prior year. 
These improvements drove free cash flow expansion, as seen on Slide 12. We delivered $344 million in consolidated free cash flow in the first quarter and generated a $445 million improvement in cash from continuing operation compared to the year-ago quarter as cost savings more than offset the 7% drop in the gold price.
Also included in our free cash flow is a tax refund of about $100 million received during the quarter. We reported adjusted net income of $229 million in the quarter or $0.46 per share compared to $121 million or $0.24 per share last year. 
Adjusted EBITDA was up 65% from the prior year quarter, benefiting from lower costs applicable to sales due to lower direct operating costs, lower fuel prices, a favorable Australian dollar-U.S. dollar exchange rate and lower exploration advanced projects and other expenses. We continue to fund dividends from free cash flow, and earlier this week, our board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.025 per share, in line with our gold-linked dividend policy.
Turning to Slide 13. We'll walk through the Q1 net income adjustments. The largest adjustments to our GAAP net income during the first quarter included a $0.06 per share gain related to asset sales, $0.07 per share related primarily to impairment of our marketable securities and a $0.09 per share adjustment related to tax valuation allowances stemming from foreign tax credits. After reconciling for these items, we reported adjusted net income of $229 million or $0.46 per share for the most recent quarter.
And now turning to Slide 14. In today's metals price environment, we continue to enhance our financial flexibility. At the end of the first quarter, our investment grade balance sheet had approximately $2.6 billion in cash and equivalents, a $3 billion revolver and roughly $200 million in marketable securities. On a consolidated basis, that's nearly $6 billion of liquidity.
During the quarter, we elected to prepay $200 million towards our existing term loan that matures in 2019. With this most recent prepayment, we have delevered our balance sheet by roughly $300 million since last November.
Slide 15 illustrates our scheduled debt maturities. As you can see, we do not have any significant debt due until 2019. We maintain an investment grade credit rating and metrics, and our net debt at quarter end was approximately $3.9 billion, an improvement of $1.4 billion compared to the prior year. 
During the first quarter, we also extended our revolver. It now runs through 2020, giving us significant flexibility. Our revolver has a single financial covenant, maximum net debt to book capital of 62.5% and we stood at 22.7% as of March 31.
We will continue to analyze opportunities to pay our liabilities in advance. We are on track to pay down $750 million of debt by year-end. As always, any payment of debt will be analyzed in the context of our cash position, operating performance and business environment.
And now turning to Slide 16. Our work to delever the balance sheet and improve our underlying business separates Newmont from the competition. As this slide indicates, our net debt to EBITDA has improved steadily over the last year and outperforms our competitors. Looking forward, we expect this ratio to improve even further.
To summarize, we're comfortable with the relative level of our debt and our maturity profile, but we continue to look at ways to reduce the absolute debt level and safeguard the long-term viability of the business. And now I'll turn the call back over to Gary."
291795,289046773,794303,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2015",2015-04-24,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Laurie. I'll shift gears now to cover outlook. Turning to Slide 18. We're maintaining our long-term guidance, which calls for gold production to increase from between 4.6 million and 4.9 million ounces in 2015 to between 4.7 million and 5.1 millio",1221,"Thanks, Laurie. I'll shift gears now to cover outlook. Turning to Slide 18. We're maintaining our long-term guidance, which calls for gold production to increase from between 4.6 million and 4.9 million ounces in 2015 to between 4.7 million and 5.1 million ounces by 2017. In North America, we expect gold production to increase over the 3-year period as we complete the Turf Vent Shaft and enter a period of lower stripping at Carlin. 
Long Canyon Phase 1 represents additional upside in 2017 that is not included in this guidance. We're managing our Australia, New Zealand and Indonesian assets as a single Asia Pacific region in 2015. At Batu Hijau, we forecast steady gold and copper production increases through higher grade Phase 6 ore and higher gold grades and productivity at Tanami. 
In Africa, we expect production to decline, primarily due to lower-grade ore at Ahafo, and we are assessing an Ahafo Mill Expansion to help offset that trend. In South America, production is forecast to decline in 2015 and 2016 before rising in 2017 as new production at Merian offsets the impact of maturing operations at Yanacocha. We're also working on an integrated approach to developing oxide and sulfide deposits that could extend profitable production at Yanacocha. Our guidance also calls for continuous cost improvements.
Turning to Slide 19. We remain on track to meet our near-term outlook for gold and copper costs and to keep gold all-in sustaining costs below $1,000 per ounce at our managed operations. Our global outlook remains the same but we've made some changes at the regional level. Specifically, we are lowering our 2015 outlook for the Asia Pacific region by about 3% in keeping with favorable oil prices and exchange rates. This is offset by a slight cost increase in Africa as we address the power shortages.
Our costs could further benefit from favorable energy prices and foreign exchange rates. Our current outlook assumes the Australian dollar at AUD 0.85 [ph] to the U.S. dollar and oil at $75 per barrel. Every $10 reduction in oil price implies a $30 million improvement in annual attributable free cash flow. Similarly, every $0.05 favorable change in the Australian dollar exchange rate results in a $60 million improvement in annual attributable free cash flow. These estimates exclude current hedge programs.
Taking a thoughtful approach to managing sustaining capital. Turning to Slide 20. We're maintaining our long-term outlook for sustaining capital costs of between $850 million and $950 million per year. Our updated 2015 outlook now includes increases to develop Long Canyon and to secure additional power generation in Ghana. 
We expect to spend about half of our Long Canyon capital, estimated at between $250 million and $300 million, in 2015 and most of the remainder in 2016. We'll keep you posted on any other changes as we reach decisions on other new projects. 
Turning to Slide 21. We create value by discovering, developing and operating profitable gold mines. And we've improved our ability to do that by optimizing our project pipeline and bringing our best projects forward in a measured and sequenced way. 
I'll highlight a few of our projects. We're completing the liner for the Turf Vent Shaft and have begun to install surface facilities. This keeps us on track to reach commercial production later this year. We're progressing construction of Merian on time and on budget. Detailed engineering is about 75% complete, and our project workforce number is nearly 1,200 people. We expect to produce between 400,000 and 500,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost of between $650 and $750 per ounce for the first 5 years beginning in late 2016.
In Australia, we expect to reach an investment decision on our Tanami expansion project later this year. The project involves building a second decline [ph] in the underground mine, an incremental capacity in the plant to increase profitable production and extend mine life. The Tanami expansion could add incremental gold production of 100,000 to 125,000 ounces per year at lower overall cost for the first 5 years. If approved, we would expect to realize full production and cost improvements in 2017.
In Ghana, we're evaluating an expansion of our existing Ahafo Mill to offset the impact of lower-grade ore. We expect to reach a decision later this year and see the potential to add 100,000 to 125,000 ounces of production at competitive costs in 2017. 
Our newest project to meet our investment criteria is Long Canyon. Turning to Slide 22. Long Canyon represents a new and highly prospective oxide gold district in Nevada. We're approaching development as an extension of our existing operations. 
Taking a phased approach to developing Long Canyon gave us the means to lower development capital to between $250 million and $300 million, which generates an internal rate of return of about 17% at current gold prices. Project highlights include: gold reserves of 1.2 million ounces at an average grade of 2.29 grams per tonne. This grade compares favorably to the average of 0.7 grams per tonne for similar projects in North America. Annual gold production of between 100,000 and 150,000 ounces over an 8-year mine life beginning in early 2017 and cost applicable to sales of between $400 and $500 per ounce and all-in sustaining cost of between $500 and $600 per ounce over the life of mine, which is in the lowest-cost quartile for gold production. 
Looking further up the pipeline at our exploration prospects on Slide 23. Exploration is a core competency and forms a critical part of our strategy to lead the gold sector in value creation. Our program focuses on increasing our existing resource base while maintaining the ability to pursue significant new discoveries. 
Long Canyon is a great example. We currently have 4 drill rigs operating on site, 2 for in-fill drilling and 2 for exploration to assess our best mining and processing options and inform our approach to the next phase of development. To date, only oxide mineralization has been identified over a 3-mile strike length that remains open in all directions. Oxide ores are, of course, synonymous with lower processing costs. It will be another 3 to 5 years before we're ready to make a funding decision on this next phase and we'll keep you posted on our progress. 
Other exploration projects that hold the potential to add production in the medium horizon include the Subika Underground in Ghana, which would give us access to ore grades that are significantly higher than the surface Northwest Exodus in Nevada, an extension of the Exodus Underground Mine, which would add profitable production; and, which is part of the oxide expansion effort at Yanacocha. 
I'll wrap up our comments with a look at where we are taking Newmont into the future. Turning to Slide 24. We're off to a strong start in 2015 and with every quarter, we're moving closer to our goal to lead the gold sector and value creation. Looking forward, we will continue to execute our strategy to improve our underlying business by continuously raising our safety, cost and technical performance; to strengthen our portfolio by building a longer life lower-cost asset base; and to create shareholder value by generating cash and continuing to strengthen our investment grade balance sheet. Thank you for your time. I'll now open the floor to questions."

I think in terms of the overall performance, what we'll do at the midyear is take a step back and just make sure it's fully reflective of what we've experienced through the first half of the year, so we just figured rather than trying to make a big adjustment on the cost numbers, we're comfortable with where production's coming in.

And that's when having a smelter would be of more impact to us as we go through the Phase 7 ore. So we'll continue to keep people updated as we work through those various discussions and also work through with the government.

We incr",1027,"Thanks, Meredith, and thank you for joining us this morning. Newmont made a strong start to 2015, and I appreciate the chance to tell you more about our performance. In a nutshell, we continued to deliver safe and steady production at lower costs. We increased our free cash flow by nearly $400 million compared to the first quarter of 2014. We advanced projects in Nevada, Suriname and New Zealand and announced plans to build a new mine at Long Canyon. And we continued to strengthen our balance sheet as our improved performance allowed us to prepay debt and fund our best growth prospects. 
I'll turn to Slide 4 to begin with safety. Safety performance is the best way to gauge the health of a business. A strong safety culture goes hand in hand with efficient operations and an engaged workforce. We reduced total injury rates by 9% compared to the prior year quarter, and 2 of our operations, Akyem and Waihi, have worked without a reportable injury so far this year. 
We also had the lowest total injury rates among ICMM member companies in 2014. While these statistics show that we're heading in the right direction, we're not where we need to be. In January, a contractor named Brian Holmes suffered a fatal injury during a shaft maintenance work at Leeville in Nevada. Our thoughts are with Brian's family and his colleagues. We'll continue to work on our performance until we can send everyone home safely every day. 
Let's turn to Slide 5 for quarter 1 highlights. Our strategy has proven successful, and we're continuing to follow through on our commitments. The first part of our strategy is to improve the underlying business. We lowered gold all-in sustaining cost for the third quarter running and by 18% compared to the prior year quarter. This was the result of sustained cost improvements and higher grades, favorable oil price and exchange rates and some delayed capital that we'll spend later this year. We also kept gold production steady quarter-on-quarter, offsetting divestments.
The second part of our strategy is to build a stronger portfolio. We reached commercial production at Correnso in January on time and on budget, and we remain on schedule to deliver first production at our Turf Vent Shaft in late 2015, at Merian in late 2016 and at our newest project, Long Canyon, in 2017. 
The third part of our strategy is to create shareholder value. We generated $815 million in adjusted EBITDA, a 65% increase compared to the first quarter of 2014, and prepaid $200 million in debt. We ended the quarter with nearly $2.6 billion in cash on our balance sheet and a net debt that is $1.4 billion lower than a year ago.
Turning to Slide 6. We produced more than 1.2 million ounces of gold and 37,000 tonnes of copper in the first quarter of 2015. As I mentioned, this more than offset the impact of divesting Midas, Jundee and La Herradura. Performance was strong across the portfolio. Batu Hijau ended the quarter ahead of schedule as we mined higher-grade Phase 6 ore.
Twin Creeks production was favorable due to higher autoclave recovery. I'll also note that consistent with prior years, Mill 6 at Carlin will be down in the second quarter for planned maintenance. Akyem and Ahafo exceeded targets despite periodic shutdowns due to power availability, which I'll cover in a moment. Boddington also made up for power interruptions resulting from wildfires in Western Australia. Finally, Waihi benefited from higher mill throughput and new production at Correnso. Our cost performance is also strong.
Turning to Slide 7. We reduced gold all-in sustaining cost to $849 per ounce and kept them below $1,000 at every one of our managed operations. 
I'll turn to Slide 8 to walk through the contributing factors. Our gold all-in sustaining cost improved by $185 per ounce from the prior year quarter. As you can see, about half of this improvement stem from CAS reductions, driven by better grades and recoveries as well as sustained cost and efficiency improvements. For example, at Batu Hijau, we reached high-grade Phase 6 ore. At Twin Creeks, we hit improved grades, throughput and recoveries. At Yanacocha, higher grades and recoveries offset lower throughput. And at Tanami, improved mining rates led to higher throughput. Lower oil prices and a favorable Australian dollar exchange rate accounted for another 30% of our AISC improvements. Finally, 15% resulted from lower sustaining capital in advanced project spend primarily due to timing.
Turning to Slide 9. Before I hand it over to Laurie for financial results, I'll cover a few key opportunities and challenges. Later in the presentation, I'll discuss Long Canyon, where we're taking advantage of 50 years of operating in Nevada and the expertise, infrastructure and relationships that we've developed along the way to maximize value.
Moving south to Merian, I'm pleased to report that construction is progressing on time and on budget. We have a good partner in the Surinamese government, who is current on all cash calls, and a highly energized team, who has begun preproduction mining. 
In Indonesia, we received a new export permit and are having regular meetings with the new administration on the Contract of Work. Our teams in both Indonesia and Ghana are working to negotiate new labor contracts that continue to offer fair wages and benefits while supporting our ability to thrive and grow. 
Negotiations have been more challenging in Ghana, but the National Labour Council has stepped into the process, and we hope to reach an equitable agreement soon. The other challenge we face in Ghana has to do with power. Drought conditions, fuel supply shortages and diminished plant capacity are impacting Ghana's ability to generate power. In January, the government imposed a 33% load shedding requirement on all industrial customers. We're in discussions with the government and other producers to explore power conservation alternatives to minimize disruptions. We have also implemented contingency plans to add temporary power generation capacity by July and permanent capacity by year-end. As I mentioned, Ahafo and Akyem are meeting production and cost targets this year. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Laurie."
291795,289046773,794487,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2015",2015-04-24,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Gary, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. It was a strong first quarter for Newmont, and I'm pleased with our performance. First, turning to Slide 11. As Gary mentioned, we continue to see strong cost performance across the portfolio. Ou",642,"Thanks, Gary, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. It was a strong first quarter for Newmont, and I'm pleased with our performance. 
First, turning to Slide 11. As Gary mentioned, we continue to see strong cost performance across the portfolio. Our first quarter cost applicable to sales per ounce and all-in sustaining cost per ounce were both nearly 20% favorable to the prior year. 
These improvements drove free cash flow expansion, as seen on Slide 12. We delivered $344 million in consolidated free cash flow in the first quarter and generated a $445 million improvement in cash from continuing operation compared to the year-ago quarter as cost savings more than offset the 7% drop in the gold price.
Also included in our free cash flow is a tax refund of about $100 million received during the quarter. We reported adjusted net income of $229 million in the quarter or $0.46 per share compared to $121 million or $0.24 per share last year. 
Adjusted EBITDA was up 65% from the prior year quarter, benefiting from lower cost applicable to sales due to lower direct operating costs; lower fuel prices; a favorable Australian dollar-U.S. dollar exchange rate; and lower exploration, advanced projects and other expenses. We continue to fund dividends from free cash flow, and earlier this week, our board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.025 per share, in line with our gold-linked dividend policy.
Turning to Slide 13. We'll walk through the Q1 net income adjustments. The largest adjustments to our GAAP net income during the first quarter included a $0.06 per share gain related to asset sales, $0.07 per share related primarily to impairment of our marketable securities and a $0.09 per share adjustment related to tax valuation allowances stemming from foreign tax credits. After reconciling for these items, we reported adjusted net income of $229 million or $0.46 per share for the most recent quarter.
And now turning to Slide 14. In today's metals price environment, we continue to enhance our financial flexibility. At the end of the first quarter, our investment-grade balance sheet had approximately $2.6 billion in cash and equivalents, a $3 billion revolver and roughly $200 million in marketable securities. On a consolidated basis, that's nearly $6 billion of liquidity.
During the quarter, we elected to prepay $200 million towards our existing term loan that matures in 2019. With this most recent prepayment, we have delevered our balance sheet by roughly $300 million since last November.
Slide 15 illustrates our scheduled debt maturities. As you can see, we do not have any significant debt due until 2019. We maintain an investment-grade rating and metrics, and our net debt at quarter-end was approximately $3.9 billion, an improvement of $1.4 billion compared to the prior year. During the first quarter, we also extended our revolver. It now runs through 2020, giving us significant flexibility. Our revolver has a single financial covenant, maximum net debt-to-book capital of 62.5%, and we stood at 22.7% as of March 31.
We will continue to analyze opportunities to pay our liabilities in advance. We are on track to pay down $750 million of debt by year-end. As always, any payment of debt will be analyzed in the context of our cash position, operating performance and business environment.
And now turning to Slide 16. Our work to delever the balance sheet and improve our underlying business separates Newmont from the competition. As this slide indicates, our net debt-to-EBITDA has improved steadily over the last year and outperforms our competitors. Looking forward, we expect this ratio to improve even further.
To summarize, we're comfortable with the relative level of our debt and our maturity profile, but we continue to look at ways to reduce the absolute debt level and safeguard the long-term viability of the business. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Gary."
291795,289046773,794487,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2015",2015-04-24,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Laurie. I'll shift gears now to cover outlook. Turning to Slide 18. We're maintaining our long-term guidance, which calls for gold production to increase from between 4.6 million and 4.9 million ounces in 2015 to between 4.7 million and 5.1 millio",1217,"Thanks, Laurie. I'll shift gears now to cover outlook. Turning to Slide 18. We're maintaining our long-term guidance, which calls for gold production to increase from between 4.6 million and 4.9 million ounces in 2015 to between 4.7 million and 5.1 million ounces by 2017. In North America, we expect gold production to increase over the 3-year period as we complete the Turf Vent Shaft and enter a period of lower stripping at Carlin. Long Canyon Phase 1 represents additional upside in 2017 that is not included in this guidance. 
We're managing our Australia, New Zealand and Indonesian assets as a single Asia-Pacific region in 2015. At Batu Hijau, we forecast steady gold and copper production increases through higher-grade Phase 6 ore and higher gold grades and productivity at Tanami. 
In Africa, we expect production to decline primarily due to lower-grade ore at Ahafo, and we are assessing an Ahafo Mill Expansion to help offset that trend. 
In South America, production is forecast to decline in 2015 and 2016 before rising in 2017 as new production at Merian offsets the impact of maturing operations at Yanacocha. We're also working on an integrated approach to developing oxide and sulfide deposits that could extend profitable production at Yanacocha. Our guidance also calls for continuous cost improvements.
Turning to Slide 19. We remain on track to meet our near-term outlook for gold and copper costs and to keep gold all-in sustaining cost below $1,000 per ounce at our managed operations. Our global outlook remains the same, but we've made some changes at the regional level. Specifically, we are lowering our 2015 outlook for the Asia-Pacific region by about 3% in keeping with favorable oil prices and exchange rates. This is offset by a slight cost increase in Africa as we address the power shortages.
Our costs could further benefit from favorable energy prices and foreign exchange rates. Our current outlook assumes the Australian dollar at $0.85 to the U.S. dollar and oil at $75 per barrel. Every $10 reduction in oil price implies a $30 million improvement in annual attributable free cash flow. Similarly, every $0.05 favorable change in the Australian dollar exchange rate results in a $60 million improvement in annual attributable free cash flow. These estimates exclude current hedge programs.
Taking a thoughtful approach to managing sustaining capital. Turning to Slide 20. We're maintaining our long-term outlook for sustaining capital costs of between $850 million and $950 million per year. Our updated 2015 outlook now includes increases to develop Long Canyon and to secure additional power generation in Ghana.  We expect to spend about half of our Long Canyon capital, estimated at between $250 million and $300 million, in 2015 and most of the remainder in 2016. We'll keep you posted on any other changes as we reach decisions on other new projects. 
Turning to Slide 21. We create value by discovering, developing and operating profitable gold mines. And we've improved our ability to do that by optimizing our project pipeline and bringing our best projects forward in a measured and sequenced way. 
I'll highlight a few of our projects. We're completing the liner for the Turf Vent Shaft and have begun to install surface facilities. This keeps us on track to reach commercial production later this year. We're progressing construction of Merian on time and on budget. Detailed engineering is about 75% complete, and our project workforce number is nearly 1,200 people. We expect to produce between 400,000 and 500,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost of between $650 and $750 per ounce for the first 5 years, beginning in late 2016.
In Australia, we expect to reach an investment decision on our Tanami expansion project later this year. The project involves building a second decline in the underground mine and incremental capacity in the plant to increase profitable production and extend mine life. The Tanami expansion could add incremental gold production of 100,000 to 125,000 ounces per year at lower overall costs for the first 5 years. If approved, we would expect to realize full production and cost improvements in 2017.
In Ghana, we're evaluating an expansion of our existing Ahafo Mill to offset the impact of lower-grade ore. We expect to reach a decision later this year and see the potential to add 100,000 to 125,000 ounces of production at competitive costs in 2017. 
Our newest project to meet our investment criteria is Long Canyon. Turning to Slide 22. Long Canyon represents a new and highly prospective oxide gold district in Nevada. We're approaching development as an extension of our existing operations.  Taking a phased approach to developing Long Canyon gave us the means to lower development capital to between $250 million and $300 million, which generates an internal rate of return of about 17% at current gold prices. Project highlights include gold reserves of 1.2 million ounces at an average grade of 2.29 grams per tonne. This grade compares favorably to the average of 0.7 grams per tonne for similar projects in North America. Annual gold production of between 100,000 and 150,000 ounces over an 8-year mine life beginning in early 2017 and costs applicable to sales of between $400 and $500 per ounce and all-in sustaining costs of between $500 and $600 per ounce over the life of mine, which is in the lowest-cost quartile for gold production. 
Looking further up the pipeline at our exploration prospects on Slide 23. Exploration is a core competency and forms a critical part of our strategy to lead the gold sector in value creation. Our program focuses on increasing our existing resource base while maintaining the ability to pursue significant new discoveries. 
Long Canyon is a great example. We currently have 4 drill rigs operating on site, 2 for in-fill drilling and 2 for exploration, to assess our best mining and processing options and then form our approach to the next phase of development. To date, only oxide mineralization has been identified over a 3-mile strike length that remains open in all directions. Oxide ores are, of course, synonymous with lower processing costs. It will be another 3 to 5 years before we're ready to make a funding decision on this next phase, and we'll keep you posted on our progress. 
Other exploration projects that hold the potential to add production in the medium horizon include the Subika Underground in Ghana, which would give us access to ore grades that are significantly higher than the surface PIP; Northwest Exodus in Nevada, an extension of the Exodus Underground Mine, which would add profitable production; and Quecher Main, which is part of the oxide expansion effort at Yanacocha. 
I'll wrap up our comments with a look at where we are taking Newmont into the future. Turning to Slide 24. We're off to a strong start in 2015, and with every quarter, we're moving closer to our goal to lead the gold sector in value creation. Looking forward, we will continue to execute our strategy to improve our underlying business by continuously raising our safety, cost and technical performance; to strengthen our portfolio by building a longer-life, lower-cost asset base; and to create shareholder value by generating cash and continuing to strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet. 
Thank you for your time. I'll now open the floor to questions."

291795,289046773,794561,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2015",2015-04-24,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Meredith, and thank you for joining us this morning. Newmont made a strong start to 2015, and I appreciate the chance to tell you more about our performance. In a nutshell, we continued to deliver safe and steady production at lower costs. We incr",1026,"Thanks, Meredith, and thank you for joining us this morning. Newmont made a strong start to 2015, and I appreciate the chance to tell you more about our performance. In a nutshell, we continued to deliver safe and steady production at lower costs. We increased our free cash flow by nearly $400 million compared to the first quarter of 2014. We advanced projects in Nevada, Suriname and New Zealand and announced plans to build a new mine at Long Canyon. And we continued to strengthen our balance sheet as our improved performance allowed us to prepay debt and fund our best growth prospects. 
I'll turn to Slide 4 to begin with safety. Safety performance is the best way to gauge the health of a business. A strong safety culture goes hand in hand with efficient operations and an engaged workforce. We reduced total injury rates by 9% compared to the prior year quarter, and 2 of our operations, Akyem and Waihi, have worked without a reportable injury so far this year. 
We also had the lowest total injury rates among ICMM member companies in 2014. While these statistics show that we're heading in the right direction, we're not where we need to be. In January, a contractor named Brian Holmes suffered a fatal injury during a shaft maintenance work at Leeville in Nevada. Our thoughts are with Brian's family and his colleagues. We'll continue to work on our performance until we can send everyone home safely every day. 
Let's turn to Slide 5 for quarter 1 highlights. Our strategy has proven successful, and we're continuing to follow through on our commitments. The first part of our strategy is to improve the underlying business. We lowered gold all-in sustaining cost for the third quarter running and by 18% compared to the prior year quarter. This was the result of sustained cost improvements and higher grades, favorable oil price and exchange rates and some delayed capital that we'll spend later this year. We also kept gold production steady quarter-on-quarter, offsetting divestments.
The second part of our strategy is to build a stronger portfolio. We reached commercial production at Correnso in January, on time and on budget, and we remain on schedule to deliver first production at our Turf Vent Shaft in late 2015, at Merian in late 2016 and at our newest project, Long Canyon, in 2017. 
The third part of our strategy is to create shareholder value. We generated $815 million in adjusted EBITDA, a 65% increase compared to the first quarter of 2014, and prepaid $200 million in debt. We ended the quarter with nearly $2.6 billion in cash on our balance sheet and a net debt that is $1.4 billion lower than a year ago.
Turning to Slide 6. We produced more than 1.2 million ounces of gold and 37,000 tonnes of copper in the first quarter of 2015. As I mentioned, this more than offset the impact of divesting Midas, Jundee and La Herradura. Performance was strong across the portfolio. Batu Hijau ended the quarter ahead of schedule as we mined higher-grade Phase 6 ore.
Twin Creeks production was favorable due to higher autoclave recovery. I'll also note that consistent with prior years, Mill 6 at Carlin will be down in the second quarter for planned maintenance. Akyem and Ahafo exceeded targets despite periodic shutdowns due to power availability, which I'll cover in a moment. Boddington also made up for power interruptions resulting from wildfires in Western Australia. Finally, Waihi benefited from higher mill throughput and new production at Correnso. 
Our cost performance is also strong; turning to Slide 7. We reduced gold all-in sustaining cost to $849 per ounce and kept them below $1,000 at every one of our managed operations. 
I'll turn to Slide 8 to walk through the contributing factors. Our gold all-in sustaining cost improved by $185 per ounce from the prior year quarter. As you can see, about half of this improvement stem from CAS reductions, driven by better grades and recoveries, as well as sustained cost and efficiency improvements. For example, at Batu Hijau, we reached high-grade Phase 6 ore. At Twin Creeks, we hit improved grades, throughput and recoveries. At Yanacocha, higher grades and recoveries offset lower throughput. And at Tanami, improved mining rates led to higher throughput. Lower oil prices and a favorable Australian dollar exchange rate accounted for another 30% of our AISC improvements. Finally, 15% resulted from lower sustaining capital in advanced project spend primarily due to timing.
Turning to Slide 9. Before I hand it over to Laurie for financial results, I'll cover a few key opportunities and challenges. Later in the presentation, I'll discuss Long Canyon, where we're taking advantage of 50 years of operating in Nevada and the expertise, infrastructure and relationships that we've developed along the way to maximize value.
Moving south to Merian, I'm pleased to report that construction is progressing on time and on budget. We have a good partner in the Surinamese Government, who is current on all cash calls, and a highly energized team, who has begun preproduction mining. 
In Indonesia, we received a new export permit and are having regular meetings with the new administration on the Contract of Work. Our teams in both Indonesia and Ghana are working to negotiate new labor contracts that continue to offer fair wages and benefits while supporting our ability to thrive and grow. 
Negotiations have been more challenging in Ghana, but the National Labour Council has stepped into the process, and we hope to reach an equitable agreement soon. The other challenge we face in Ghana has to do with power. Drought conditions, fuel supply shortages and diminished plant capacity are impacting Ghana's ability to generate power. In January, the government imposed a 33% load-shedding requirement on all industrial customers. We're in discussions with the government and other producers to explore power conservation alternatives to minimize disruptions. We have also implemented contingency plans to add temporary power generation capacity by July and permanent capacity by year-end. As I mentioned, Ahafo and Akyem are meeting production and cost targets this year. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Laurie."
291795,289046773,794561,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2015",2015-04-24,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Gary, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. It was a strong first quarter for Newmont, and I'm pleased with our performance. First, turning to Slide 11. As Gary mentioned, we continue to see strong cost performance across the portfolio. Ou",642,"Thanks, Gary, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. It was a strong first quarter for Newmont, and I'm pleased with our performance. 
First, turning to Slide 11. As Gary mentioned, we continue to see strong cost performance across the portfolio. Our first quarter cost applicable to sales per ounce and all-in sustaining cost per ounce were both nearly 20% favorable to the prior year. 
These improvements drove free cash flow expansion, as seen on Slide 12. We delivered $344 million in consolidated free cash flow in the first quarter and generated a $445 million improvement in cash from continuing operation compared to the year-ago quarter as cost savings more than offset the 7% drop in the gold price.
Also included in our free cash flow is a tax refund of about $100 million received during the quarter. We reported adjusted net income of $229 million in the quarter or $0.46 per share compared to $121 million or $0.24 per share last year. 
Adjusted EBITDA was up 65% from the prior year quarter, benefiting from lower cost applicable to sales due to lower direct operating costs; lower fuel prices; a favorable Australian dollar-U.S. dollar exchange rate; and lower exploration, advanced projects and other expenses. We continue to fund dividends from free cash flow, and earlier this week, our board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.025 per share, in line with our gold-linked dividend policy.
Turning to Slide 13. We'll walk through the Q1 net income adjustments. The largest adjustments to our GAAP net income during the first quarter included a $0.06 per share gain related to asset sales, $0.07 per share related primarily to impairment of our marketable securities and a $0.09 per share adjustment related to tax valuation allowances stemming from foreign tax credits. After reconciling for these items, we reported adjusted net income of $229 million or $0.46 per share for the most recent quarter.
And now turning to Slide 14. In today's metals price environment, we continue to enhance our financial flexibility. At the end of the first quarter, our investment-grade balance sheet had approximately $2.6 billion in cash and equivalents, a $3 billion revolver and roughly $200 million in marketable securities. On a consolidated basis, that's nearly $6 billion of liquidity.
During the quarter, we elected to prepay $200 million towards our existing term loan that matures in 2019. With this most recent prepayment, we have de-levered our balance sheet by roughly $300 million since last November.
Slide 15 illustrates our scheduled debt maturities. As you can see, we do not have any significant debt due until 2019. We maintain an investment-grade rating and metrics, and our net debt at quarter-end was approximately $3.9 billion, an improvement of $1.4 billion compared to the prior year. During the first quarter, we also extended our revolver. It now runs through 2020, giving us significant flexibility. Our revolver has a single financial covenant, maximum net debt-to-book capital of 62.5%, and we stood at 22.7% as of March 31.
We will continue to analyze opportunities to pay our liabilities in advance. We are on track to pay down $750 million of debt by year-end. As always, any payment of debt will be analyzed in the context of our cash position, operating performance and business environment.
And now turning to Slide 16. Our work to de-lever the balance sheet and improve our underlying business separates Newmont from the competition. As this slide indicates, our net debt-to-EBITDA has improved steadily over the last year and outperforms our competitors. Looking forward, we expect this ratio to improve even further.
To summarize, we're comfortable with the relative level of our debt and our maturity profile, but we continue to look at ways to reduce the absolute debt level and safeguard the long-term viability of the business. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Gary."

I'll shift gears now to cover outlook, turning to Slide 18. We're maintaining our long-term guidance, which calls for gold production to increase from between 4.6 million and 4.9 million ounces in 2015 to between 4.7 million and 5.1 millio",1217,"Thanks, Laurie. I'll shift gears now to cover outlook, turning to Slide 18. We're maintaining our long-term guidance, which calls for gold production to increase from between 4.6 million and 4.9 million ounces in 2015 to between 4.7 million and 5.1 million ounces by 2017. In North America, we expect gold production to increase over the 3-year period as we complete the Turf Vent Shaft and enter a period of lower stripping at Carlin. Long Canyon Phase 1 represents additional upside in 2017 that is not included in this guidance. 
We're managing our Australia, New Zealand and Indonesian assets as a single Asia-Pacific region in 2015. At Batu Hijau, we forecast steady gold and copper production increases through higher-grade Phase 6 ore and higher gold grades and productivity at Tanami. 
In Africa, we expect production to decline primarily due to lower-grade ore at Ahafo, and we are assessing an Ahafo Mill Expansion to help offset that trend. 
In South America, production is forecast to decline in 2015 and 2016 before rising in 2017 as new production at Merian offsets the impact of maturing operations at Yanacocha. We're also working on an integrated approach to developing oxide and sulfide deposits that could extend profitable production at Yanacocha. Our guidance also calls for continuous cost improvements.
Turning to Slide 19. We remain on track to meet our near-term outlook for gold and copper costs and to keep gold all-in sustaining cost below $1,000 per ounce at our managed operations. Our global outlook remains the same, but we've made some changes at the regional level. Specifically, we are lowering our 2015 outlook for the Asia-Pacific region by about 3% in keeping with favorable oil prices and exchange rates. This is offset by a slight cost increase in Africa as we address the power shortages.
Our costs could further benefit from favorable energy prices and foreign exchange rates. Our current outlook assumes the Australian dollar at $0.85 to the U.S. dollar and oil at $75 per barrel. Every $10 reduction in oil price implies a $30 million improvement in annual attributable free cash flow. Similarly, every $0.05 favorable change in the Australian dollar exchange rate results in a $60 million improvement in annual attributable free cash flow. These estimates exclude current hedge programs.
Taking a thoughtful approach to managing sustaining capital, turning to Slide 20. We're maintaining our long-term outlook for sustaining capital costs of between $850 million and $950 million per year. Our updated 2015 outlook now includes increases to develop Long Canyon and to secure additional power generation in Ghana. We expect to spend about half of our Long Canyon capital, estimated at between $250 million and $300 million, in 2015 and most of the remainder in 2016. We'll keep you posted on any other changes as we reach decisions on other new projects. 
Turning to Slide 21. We create value by discovering, developing and operating profitable gold mines. And we've improved our ability to do that by optimizing our project pipeline and bringing our best projects forward in a measured and sequenced way. 
I'll highlight a few of our projects. We're completing the liner for the Turf Vent Shaft and have begun to install surface facilities. This keeps us on track to reach commercial production later this year. We're progressing construction of Merian on time and on budget. Detailed engineering is about 75% complete, and our project workforce number is nearly 1,200 people. We expect to produce between 400,000 and 500,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of between $650 and $750 per ounce for the first 5 years, beginning in late 2016.
In Australia, we expect to reach an investment decision on our Tanami expansion project later this year. The project involves building a second decline in the underground mine and incremental capacity in the plant to increase profitable production and extend mine life. The Tanami expansion could add incremental gold production of 100,000 to 125,000 ounces per year at lower overall costs for the first 5 years. If approved, we would expect to realize full production and cost improvements in 2017.
In Ghana, we're evaluating an expansion of our existing Ahafo Mill to offset the impact of lower-grade ore. We expect to reach a decision later this year and see the potential to add 100,000 to 125,000 ounces of production at competitive costs in 2017. 
Our newest project to meet our investment criteria is Long Canyon, turning to Slide 22. Long Canyon represents a new and highly prospective oxide gold district in Nevada. We're approaching development as an extension of our existing operations. Taking a phased approach to developing Long Canyon gave us the means to lower development capital to between $250 million and $300 million, which generates an internal rate of return of about 17% at current gold prices. Project highlights include gold reserves of 1.2 million ounces at an average grade of 2.29 grams per tonne. This grade compares favorably to the average of 0.7 grams per tonne for similar projects in North America. Annual gold production of between 100,000 and 150,000 ounces over an 8-year mine life beginning in early 2017 and costs applicable to sales of between $400 and $500 per ounce and all-in sustaining costs of between $500 and $600 per ounce over the life of mine, which is in the lowest-cost quartile for gold production. 
Looking further up the pipeline at our exploration prospects on Slide 23. Exploration is a core competency and forms a critical part of our strategy to lead the gold sector in value creation. Our program focuses on increasing our existing resource base while maintaining the ability to pursue significant new discoveries. 
Long Canyon is a great example. We currently have 4 drill rigs operating on site, 2 for in-fill drilling and 2 for exploration, to assess our best mining and processing options and then form our approach to the next phase of development. To date, only oxide mineralization has been identified over a 3-mile strike length that remains open in all directions. Oxide ores are, of course, synonymous with lower processing costs. It will be another 3 to 5 years before we're ready to make a funding decision on this next phase, and we'll keep you posted on our progress. 
Other exploration projects that hold the potential to add production in the medium horizon include the Subika Underground in Ghana, which would give us access to ore grades that are significantly higher than the surface pit; Northwest Exodus in Nevada, an extension of the Exodus Underground Mine, which would add profitable production; and Quecher Main, which is part of the oxide expansion effort at Yanacocha. 
I'll wrap up our comments with a look at where we are taking Newmont into the future, turning to Slide 24. We're off to a strong start in 2015, and with every quarter, we're moving closer to our goal to lead the gold sector in value creation. Looking forward, we will continue to execute our strategy to improve our underlying business by continuously raising our safety, cost and technical performance; to strengthen our portfolio by building a longer-life, lower-cost asset base; and to create shareholder value by generating cash and continuing to strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet.

Obviously, there's some grade issues going forward, but it seems you're being fairly conservative there. So could you just talk around those numbers and why we're seeing such a sort of implied steep ramp in the rest of the year? Or is it simply conservatism?"

I wanted to emphasize that we will be making the spend on the capital, so people don't start modeling a lower amount there. I think in terms of the overall performance, what we'll do at the midyear is take a step back and just make sure it's fully reflective of what we've experienced through the first half of the year. So we just figured, rather than trying to make a big adjustment on the cost numbers, we're comfortable with where production's coming in, let's adjust that. We've made the little tweaks in Africa to account for the power and the tweaks in Australia for what we've seen in changes in oil and exchange rate. But we'd look, as we give those 2, second quarter results, to update the rest of our guidance."

Could you comment as to where you stand now, having had your export license renewed, in terms of actually being an equity investor in a potential smelter out there?

Our position has been -- we don't stand in a good position to build a smelter. We support the country's policy on in-country smelting. We'll work with Freeport or others because we're talking with a few other parties that are looking to build a smelter. When you look at our production profile, you see, over the next 3 years, there's a peak, and then we go through a low range before we would get into Phase 7 out in the 2022, 2023 time frame. And that's when having a smelter would be of more impact to us as we go through the Phase 7 ore. So we'll continue to keep people updated as we work through those various discussions and also work through with the government. I've had -- I should comment, I was out in Indonesia last month and had a number of meetings with different government officials. And I was pleased for meeting with government officials in any country when you have meetings that start on time. And I think what I heard there and what I saw demonstrated in the extension of our export permit, what people say, they do commit to, and it's good to see.

We incr",1026,"Thanks, Meredith, and thank you for joining us this morning. Newmont made a strong start to 2015, and I appreciate the chance to tell you more about our performance. In a nutshell, we continued to deliver safe and steady production at lower costs. We increased our free cash flow by nearly $400 million compared to the first quarter of 2014. We advanced projects in Nevada, Suriname and New Zealand and announced plans to build a new mine at Long Canyon. And we continued to strengthen our balance sheet as our improved performance allowed us to prepay debt and fund our best growth prospects. 
I'll turn to Slide 4 to begin with safety. Safety performance is the best way to gauge the health of a business. A strong safety culture goes hand in hand with efficient operations and an engaged workforce. We reduced total injury rates by 9% compared to the prior year quarter, and 2 of our operations, Akyem and Waihi, have worked without a reportable injury so far this year. 
We also had the lowest total injury rates among ICMM member companies in 2014. While these statistics show that we're heading in the right direction, we're not where we need to be. In January, a contractor named Brian Holmes suffered a fatal injury during a shaft maintenance work at Leeville in Nevada. Our thoughts are with Brian's family and his colleagues. We'll continue to work on our performance until we can send everyone home safely every day. 
Let's turn to Slide 5 for quarter 1 highlights. Our strategy has proven successful, and we're continuing to follow through on our commitments. The first part of our strategy is to improve the underlying business. We lowered gold all-in sustaining cost for the third quarter running and by 18% compared to the prior year quarter. This was the result of sustained cost improvements and higher grades, favorable oil price and exchange rates and some delayed capital that we'll spend later this year. We also kept gold production steady quarter-on-quarter, offsetting divestments.
The second part of our strategy is to build a stronger portfolio. We reached commercial production at Correnso in January, on time and on budget, and we remain on schedule to deliver first production at our Turf Vent Shaft in late 2015, at Merian in late 2016 and at our newest project, Long Canyon, in 2017. 
The third part of our strategy is to create shareholder value. We generated $815 million in adjusted EBITDA, a 65% increase compared to the first quarter of 2014, and prepaid $200 million in debt. We ended the quarter with nearly $2.6 billion in cash on our balance sheet and a net debt that is $1.4 billion lower than a year ago.
Turning to Slide 6. We produced more than 1.2 million ounces of gold and 37,000 tonnes of copper in the first quarter of 2015. As I mentioned, this more than offset the impact of divesting Midas, Jundee and La Herradura. Performance was strong across the portfolio. Batu Hijau ended the quarter ahead of schedule as we mined higher-grade Phase 6 ore.
Twin Creeks production was favorable due to higher autoclave recovery. I'll also note that consistent with prior years, Mill 6 at Carlin will be down in the second quarter for planned maintenance. Akyem and Ahafo exceeded targets despite periodic shutdowns due to power availability, which I'll cover in a moment. Boddington also made up for power interruptions resulting from wildfires in Western Australia. Finally, Waihi benefited from higher mill throughput and new production at Correnso. 
Our cost performance is also strong; turning to Slide 7. We reduced gold all-in sustaining cost to $849 per ounce and kept them below $1,000 at every one of our managed operations. 
I'll turn to Slide 8 to walk through the contributing factors. Our gold all-in sustaining cost improved by $185 per ounce from the prior year quarter. As you can see, about half of this improvement stem from CAS reductions, driven by better grades and recoveries, as well as sustained cost and efficiency improvements. For example, at Batu Hijau, we reached high-grade Phase 6 ore. At Twin Creeks, we hit improved grades, throughput and recoveries. At Yanacocha, higher grades and recoveries offset lower throughput. And at Tanami, improved mining rates led to higher throughput. Lower oil prices and a favorable Australian dollar exchange rate accounted for another 30% of our AISC improvements. Finally, 15% resulted from lower sustaining capital in advanced project spend primarily due to timing.
Turning to Slide 9. Before I hand it over to Laurie for financial results, I'll cover a few key opportunities and challenges. Later in the presentation, I'll discuss Long Canyon, where we're taking advantage of 50 years of operating in Nevada and the expertise, infrastructure and relationships that we've developed along the way to maximize value.
Moving south to Merian, I'm pleased to report that construction is progressing on time and on budget. We have a good partner in the Surinamese Government, who is current on all cash calls, and a highly energized team, who has begun preproduction mining. 
In Indonesia, we received a new export permit and are having regular meetings with the new administration on the Contract of Work. Our teams in both Indonesia and Ghana are working to negotiate new labor contracts that continue to offer fair wages and benefits while supporting our ability to thrive and grow. 
Negotiations have been more challenging in Ghana, but the National Labour Council has stepped into the process, and we hope to reach an equitable agreement soon. The other challenge we face in Ghana has to do with power. Drought conditions, fuel supply shortages and diminished plant capacity are impacting Ghana's ability to generate power. In January, the government imposed a 33% load-shedding requirement on all industrial customers. We're in discussions with the government and other producers to explore power conservation alternatives to minimize disruptions. We have also implemented contingency plans to add temporary power generation capacity by July and permanent capacity by year-end. As I mentioned, Ahafo and Akyem are meeting production and cost targets this year. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Laurie."
291795,289046773,795203,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2015",2015-04-24,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Gary, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. It was a strong first quarter for Newmont, and I'm pleased with our performance. First, turning to Slide 11. As Gary mentioned, we continue to see strong cost performance across the portfolio. Ou",643,"Thanks, Gary, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. It was a strong first quarter for Newmont, and I'm pleased with our performance. 
First, turning to Slide 11. As Gary mentioned, we continue to see strong cost performance across the portfolio. Our first quarter cost applicable to sales per ounce and all-in sustaining cost per ounce were both nearly 20% favorable to the prior year. 
These improvements drove free cash flow expansion, as seen on Slide 12. We delivered $344 million in consolidated free cash flow in the first quarter and generated a $445 million improvement in cash from continuing operation compared to the year ago quarter as cost savings more than offset the 7% drop in the gold price.
Also included in our free cash flow is a tax refund of about $100 million received during the quarter. We reported adjusted net income of $229 million in the quarter or $0.46 per share compared to $121 million or $0.24 per share last year. 
Adjusted EBITDA was up 65% from the prior year quarter, benefiting from lower cost applicable to sales due to lower direct operating costs; lower fuel prices; a favorable Australian dollar-U.S. dollar exchange rate; and lower exploration, advanced projects and other expenses. We continue to fund dividends from free cash flow, and earlier this week, our board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.025 per share, in line with our gold-linked dividend policy.
Turning to Slide 13. We'll walk through the Q1 net income adjustments. The largest adjustments to our GAAP net income during the first quarter included a $0.06 per share gain related to asset sales, $0.07 per share related primarily to impairment of our marketable securities and a $0.09 per share adjustment related to tax valuation allowances stemming from foreign tax credits. After reconciling for these items, we reported adjusted net income of $229 million or $0.46 per share for the most recent quarter.
And now turning to Slide 14. In today's metals price environment, we continue to enhance our financial flexibility. At the end of the first quarter, our investment-grade balance sheet had approximately $2.6 billion in cash and equivalents, a $3 billion revolver and roughly $200 million in marketable securities. On a consolidated basis, that's nearly $6 billion of liquidity.
During the quarter, we elected to prepay $200 million towards our existing term loan that matures in 2019. With this most recent prepayment, we have delevered our balance sheet by roughly $300 million since last November.
Slide 15 illustrates our scheduled debt maturities. As you can see, we do not have any significant debt due until 2019. We maintain an investment-grade rating and metrics, and our net debt at quarter-end was approximately $3.9 billion, an improvement of $1.4 billion compared to the prior year. During the first quarter, we also extended our revolver. It now runs through 2020, giving us significant flexibility. Our revolver has a single financial covenant, maximum net debt-to-book capital of 62.5%, and we stood at 22.7% as of March 31.
We will continue to analyze opportunities to pay our liabilities in advance. We are on track to pay down $750 million of debt by year-end. As always, any payment of debt will be analyzed in the context of our cash position, operating performance and business environment.
And now turning to Slide 16. Our work to delever the balance sheet and improve our underlying business separates Newmont from the competition. As this slide indicates, our net debt-to-EBITDA has improved steadily over the last year and outperforms our competitors. Looking forward, we expect this ratio to improve even further.
To summarize, we're comfortable with the relative level of our debt and our maturity profile, but we continue to look at ways to reduce the absolute debt level and safeguard the long-term viability of the business. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Gary."

I'll shift gears now to cover outlook, turning to Slide 18. We're maintaining our long-term guidance, which calls for gold production to increase from between 4.6 million and 4.9 million ounces in 2015 to between 4.7 million and 5.1 millio",1217,"Thanks, Laurie. I'll shift gears now to cover outlook, turning to Slide 18. We're maintaining our long-term guidance, which calls for gold production to increase from between 4.6 million and 4.9 million ounces in 2015 to between 4.7 million and 5.1 million ounces by 2017. In North America, we expect gold production to increase over the 3-year period as we complete the Turf Vent Shaft and enter a period of lower stripping at Carlin. Long Canyon Phase 1 represents additional upside in 2017 that is not included in this guidance. 
We're managing our Australia, New Zealand and Indonesian assets as a single Asia-Pacific region in 2015. At Batu Hijau, we forecast steady gold and copper production increases through higher-grade Phase 6 ore and higher gold grades and productivity at Tanami. 
In Africa, we expect production to decline primarily due to lower-grade ore at Ahafo, and we are assessing an Ahafo Mill Expansion to help offset that trend. 
In South America, production is forecast to decline in 2015 and 2016 before rising in 2017 as new production at Merian offsets the impact of maturing operations at Yanacocha. We're also working on an integrated approach to developing oxide and sulfide deposits that could extend profitable production at Yanacocha. Our guidance also calls for continuous cost improvements.
Turning to Slide 19. We remain on track to meet our near-term outlook for gold and copper costs and to keep gold all-in sustaining cost below $1,000 per ounce at our managed operations. Our global outlook remains the same, but we've made some changes at the regional level. Specifically, we are lowering our 2015 outlook for the Asia-Pacific region by about 3% in keeping with favorable oil prices and exchange rates. This is offset by a slight cost increase in Africa as we address the power shortages.
Our costs could further benefit from favorable energy prices and foreign exchange rates. Our current outlook assumes the Australian dollar at $0.85 to the U.S. dollar and oil at $75 per barrel. Every $10 reduction in oil price implies a $30 million improvement in annual attributable free cash flow. Similarly, every $0.05 favorable change in the Australian dollar exchange rate results in a $60 million improvement in annual attributable free cash flow. These estimates exclude current hedge programs.
Taking a thoughtful approach to managing sustaining capital, turning to Slide 20. We're maintaining our long-term outlook for sustaining capital costs of between $850 million and $950 million per year. Our updated 2015 outlook now includes increases to develop Long Canyon and to secure additional power generation in Ghana. We expect to spend about half of our Long Canyon capital, estimated at between $250 million and $300 million, in 2015 and most of the remainder in 2016. We'll keep you posted on any other changes as we reach decisions on other new projects. 
Turning to Slide 21. We create value by discovering, developing and operating profitable gold mines. And we've improved our ability to do that by optimizing our project pipeline and bringing our best projects forward in a measured and sequenced way. 
I'll highlight a few of our projects. We're completing the liner for the Turf Vent Shaft and have begun to install surface facilities. This keeps us on track to reach commercial production later this year. We're progressing construction of Merian on time and on budget. Detailed engineering is about 75% complete, and our project workforce number is nearly 1,200 people. We expect to produce between 400,000 and 500,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of between $650 and $750 per ounce for the first 5 years, beginning in late 2016.
In Australia, we expect to reach an investment decision on our Tanami expansion project later this year. The project involves building a second decline in the underground mine and incremental capacity in the plant to increase profitable production and extend mine life. The Tanami expansion could add incremental gold production of 100,000 to 125,000 ounces per year at lower overall costs for the first 5 years. If approved, we would expect to realize full production and cost improvements in 2017.
In Ghana, we're evaluating an expansion of our existing Ahafo Mill to offset the impact of lower-grade ore. We expect to reach a decision later this year and see the potential to add 100,000 to 125,000 ounces of production at competitive costs in 2017. 
Our newest project to meet our investment criteria is Long Canyon, turning to Slide 22. Long Canyon represents a new and highly prospective oxide gold district in Nevada. We're approaching development as an extension of our existing operations. Taking a phased approach to developing Long Canyon gave us the means to lower development capital to between $250 million and $300 million, which generates an internal rate of return of about 17% at current gold prices. Project highlights include gold reserves of 1.2 million ounces at an average grade of 2.29 grams per tonne. This grade compares favorably to the average of 0.7 grams per tonne for similar projects in North America. Annual gold production of between 100,000 and 150,000 ounces over an 8-year mine life beginning in early 2017 and costs applicable to sales of between $400 and $500 per ounce and all-in sustaining costs of between $500 and $600 per ounce over the life of mine, which is in the lowest-cost quartile for gold production. 
Looking further up the pipeline at our exploration prospects on Slide 23. Exploration is a core competency and forms a critical part of our strategy to lead the gold sector in value creation. Our program focuses on increasing our existing resource base while maintaining the ability to pursue significant new discoveries. 
Long Canyon is a great example. We currently have 4 drill rigs operating on site, 2 for in-fill drilling and 2 for exploration, to assess our best mining and processing options and then form our approach to the next phase of development. To date, only oxide mineralization has been identified over a 3-mile strike length that remains open in all directions. Oxide ores are, of course, synonymous with lower processing costs. It will be another 3 to 5 years before we're ready to make a funding decision on this next phase, and we'll keep you posted on our progress. 
Other exploration projects that hold the potential to add production in the medium horizon include the Subika Underground in Ghana, which would give us access to ore grades that are significantly higher than the surface pit; Northwest Exodus in Nevada, an extension of the Exodus Underground Mine, which would add profitable production; and Quecher Main, which is part of the oxide expansion effort at Yanacocha. 
I'll wrap up our comments with a look at where we are taking Newmont into the future, turning to Slide 24. We're off to a strong start in 2015, and with every quarter, we're moving closer to our goal to lead the gold sector in value creation. Looking forward, we will continue to execute our strategy to improve our underlying business by continuously raising our safety, cost and technical performance; to strengthen our portfolio by building a longer-life, lower-cost asset base; and to create shareholder value by generating cash and continuing to strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet.

I think in terms of the overall performance, what we'll do at the midyear is take a step back and just make sure it's fully reflective of what we've experienced through the first half of the year. So we just figured, rather than trying to make a big adjustment on the cost numbers, we're comfortable with where production's coming in, let's adjust that.

We'll work with Freeport or others because we're talking with a few other parties that are looking to build a smelter. When you look at our production profile, you see, over the next 3 years, there's a peak, and then we go through a low range before we would get into Phase 7 out in the 2022, 2023 time frame. And that's when having a smelter would be of more impact to us as we go through the Phase 7 ore. So we'll continue to keep people updated as we work through those various discussions and also work through with the government. I've had -- I should comment, I was out in Indonesia last month and had a number of meetings with different government officials. And I was pleased for meeting with government officials in any country when you have meetings that start on time.

Newmont continued to deliver strong performance in the second quarter, and I'd like to walk you through the highlights now. We reduced our injury rates, maintained steady gold production and lowered our all-in sustaining costs by 14% per ounce compared to the prior year quarter. This performance resulted in our fifth consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow, a 32% increase in adjusted EBITDA and a 17% increase in operating cash flow compared to 2014. 
We also announced the acquisition of Cripple Creek and Victor in Colorado and advanced the Turf Vent Shaft and Long Canyon operations or mines rather in Nevada in Merian and Suriname. Finally, we leveraged strong operating performance to pay down debt and return cash to shareholders.
Turning to Slide 4 to look at our safety performance. I'm pleased to report that we reduced our total injury rate by slightly more than 40% this quarter compared to last year. This constitutes Newmont's lowest-ever injury rate and reflects tremendous dedication by our team and significant improvement by our contractors. 
I particularly want to acknowledge our teams in Ghana and Suriname, who completed the entire quarter working without injury, proving that our goal of 0 harm is achievable. This performance comes down to strong operating discipline, safe facilities and most importantly, a sense of accountability for safety that runs throughout the entire workforce. 
Let's turn to Slide 5 for other quarter highlights. Our strategy has 3 elements and we're making progress on all fronts: first, to improve the underlying business. We maintained steady gold production, more than offsetting the impacts of divestments and doubled our copper production. Our gold all-in sustaining costs were just over $900 per ounce, which represents a 14% improvement over the prior year quarter. 
Second, to strengthen the portfolio, we announced the acquisition of Cripple Creek and Victor in June and expect the transaction to close in early August. CC&V adds cash flow and production and improves our portfolio mine life, cost and risk profile. We also announced the sale of Waihi, which will bring total proceeds from the sale of noncore assets to $1.6 billion over the last 2 years.
Turning to organic growth. Construction at Turf Vent Shaft, Merian and Long Canyon is advancing on schedule and on budget. 
The third part of our strategy is to create shareholder value. We generated nearly $700 million in adjusted EBITDA, up 32% from the prior year and $119 million in free cash flow. This strong performance allowed us to declare a dividend despite lower metal prices and paid down $75 million in debt during the quarter. We remain on track to pay down further debt in 2015.
Let's turn to Slide 6 to look at production. We produced more than 1.2 million ounces of gold and 41,000 tonnes of copper in the second quarter on an attributable basis. This is slightly more gold than we produced in the prior year quarter and represents a 12% increase after you adjust for divesting Jundee and La Herradura. 
Operations around the world contributed to this strong performance. At Batu Hijau, gold and copper production continues to rise as we mine higher-grade ore. We'll continue to mine higher grade through 2017 and are reviewing options for developing the next phase of mining.
Boddington also delivered a strong gold and copper production. The team has leveraged the Full Potential program to improve productivity in the mine through load and haul efficiency and in the middle via throughput, utilization and maintenance improvements. 
Twin Creeks produced more gold as a result of planned higher grades and volumes and improved autoclave performance. At Tanami, we had another strong quarter, primarily from increased throughput driven by planning and productivity improvements. At KCGM, we've commissioned our new ultra-fine grind mills and saw improved production for the quarter. And finally, Yanacocha delivered higher leach and mill production.
Turning to Slide 7 and our cost performance. Ongoing cost reductions are largely the result of higher productivity and sustainable cost and efficiency improvements. We also benefited from favorable oil price and exchange rates, which largely offset lower metal prices during the quarter and some delayed timing in our capital expenditures. We expect our cost to increase slightly in the second half of the year due mainly to lower production volumes at Ahafo and Yanacocha but will finish the year well within our improved guidance, which I'll discuss in a moment. 
This graph shows our progress over the last 3 years. Our year-to-date all-in sustaining cost is $879 per ounce, and we expect to end 2015 having achieved a 20% reduction from 2012. Putting it all together, we're making the most of our opportunities and managing our challenges.
Turning to Slide 8. Batu Hijau is running at full capacity, and we continue to work with the government to negotiate modifications to our contract of work and to renew our export permit. We also negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement that features reasonable wage increases of 3% in 2015 and 4% in 2016 for our represented workforce. 
In Ghana, the team has installed 14 megawatts of temporary power generation capacity at Akyem and will add another 21 megawatts of permanent capacity at Ahafo by year end. Both sites are now operating at full capacity. Labor negotiations in Ghana are ongoing, and we remain committed to reaching an agreement that offers fair wages and benefits while sustaining profitable operations. 
Merian remains on track for first production in 2016, with engineering about 90% complete and construction about 25% complete. You can see how we're progressing on the camp, mill, truck shop and power plant in this photo. We've also stockpiled just over 500,000 tonnes of higher-grade ore. Finally, we've begun work to integrate Cripple Creek and Victor into the Newmont team and into our portfolio.
Let's turn for more detail on Cripple Creek and Victor on Slide 9. CC&V is a surface mine and heap leach operation about 100 miles from our headquarters in Denver. The operation is about 2/3 through a $585 million expansion, and we expect the remaining development capital to be fully funded by CC&V's operating cash flow. 
The expansion includes a new mill to augment production, improve recovery on higher-grade ore and add capacity for a potential underground operation. The mill is up and running and expected to reach full production capacity later this year. The expansion also features a new recovery plant and second leach pad, which are expected to be in production in the second half of 2016. 
CC&V will contribute 350,000 to 400,000 ounces of gold production at all-in sustaining costs of between $825 and $875 per ounce in 2016 and 2017. These costs exclude further efficiency and optimization improvement opportunities that we've identified. For example, we see potential to lower CC&V's mining costs by up to 10% by optimizing the mine plan to reduce stripping and eliminate marginal ounces. We also believe we can improve site recoveries by up to 2% by applying Newmont's proprietary technology. 
Longer term, surface and underground expansions could also increase CC&V's value and mine life but will require further definition and optimization. With that, I'll hand it over to Laurie for an update on financial results."
291795,304736186,836530,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2015",2015-07-23,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Gary, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.

Our second quarter gold",612,"Thanks, Gary, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. It was a strong quarter for Newmont and I'm pleased with our performance.
Turning to Slide 11. As Gary mentioned, we continue to see cost improvement across the portfolio. Our second quarter gold cost applicable to sales per ounce and gold all-in sustaining cost per ounce were both 14% favorable to the prior year. These improvements contributed to EBITDA expansion and our fifth consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. Despite an 8% decline in our average realized gold price, the lower cost from operations led to continued strong financial results.
Turning to Slide 12. During the second quarter, we generated more than $440 million in cash from continuing operations, an increase of more than 17% from the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was also up 32% from the prior year due to higher grades and recoveries especially at Batu Hijau, improved oil prices and exchange rates and ongoing efficiency improvements. 
Consolidated free cash flow was $119 million during the second quarter, including increased development capital spending at our projects such as Merian and Long Canyon. Year-to-date free cash flow now stands at $463 million, almost $400 million higher than the prior year period. We reported adjusted net income of $131 million in the second quarter or $0.26 per share compared to $101 million or $0.20 per share last year.
Turning to Slide 13 for a review of that. Adjusted net income excludes a $0.02 per share gain related to discontinued operation, a $0.05 per share loss related to impairment and restructuring costs and a $0.09 per share impairment of certain deferred tax assets. After reconciling for these items, we reported adjusted net income of $131 million or $0.26 per share as I noted. The strong quarter operationally was also reflected in adjusted EBITDA of $692 million, up 32% from the prior year. Similarly, adjusted EBITDA excludes impairments, restructuring, acquisition and divestiture costs.
Now turning to Slide 14. At the end of the second quarter, our investment-grade balance sheet had over $3.3 billion in cash and equivalents. Excluding the cash we will use to acquire CC&V, adjusted cash is about $2.5 billion. Combining that adjusted cash, our $3 billion revolver and roughly $200 million in marketable securities gives us nearly $6 billion of liquidity. 
During the second quarter, we repaid $75 million of debt, primarily toward the revolver. We've also eliminated Ahafo's remaining loan balance. This brings our year-to-date total debt payment to $280 million, and we remain on track to pay down further debt by year end.
We have no significant debt maturities until 2019, and our current net debt-to-book capital of 17.9% is well below the maximum 62.5% for our revolver covenant. Newmont's strong cash flows and enhanced balance sheet provided us with the confidence to maintain our dividend as we announced earlier this week despite the average gold price for the quarter of $1,192.
Turning to Slide 15. Our work to delever the balance sheet and improve our underlying business separates Newmont from the competition. As our slide indicates, our net debt-to-EBITDA continues to improve and outperform competitor averages. In a $1,200 gold price environment, we're targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1, which we estimate will allow us to maintain an investment-grade balance sheet across a variety of metal price scenarios. 
To summarize, Newmont's strong liquidity and cash flow positions us to deliver results across the commodity cycle. We're comfortable with our relative level of debt and maturity profile but will continue to look at ways to reduce the absolute debt level and strengthen the long-term viability of our business. And now I'll turn the call back over to Gary."

We're revising our production and cost guidance to reflect continued strong performance at our operations and the impact of building Long Canyon Phase 1, acquiring CC&V and di",1816,"Thanks, Laurie. I'll shift gears now to cover our outlook. Turning to Slide 17. We're revising our production and cost guidance to reflect continued strong performance at our operations and the impact of building Long Canyon Phase 1, acquiring CC&V and divesting Waihi. We now expect to produce between 4.7 million and 5.1 million ounces of gold in 2015, up slightly from our previously published range of 4.6 million to 4.9 million ounces. 
We also improved our 2015 copper production guidance by about 10% due to a better face position at Batu Hijau as we've been able to make better progress on pit dewatering than we'd planned. Our revised long-term guidance calls for gold production of between 5.2 million and 5.5 million ounces by 2017, a 9% increase from previous guidance. 
In North America, we expect gold production to increase over the 3-year period as we complete the Turf Vent Shaft, enter a period of lower stripping at Carlin and add production from CC&V and Long Canyon Phase 1. 
In Asia Pacific, we expect Batu Hijau to contribute steady gold and copper production from higher-grade ore over the next 3 years. A planned expansion at Tanami, if approved, represents additional upside. 
In Africa, we expect production to decline over the next 3 years, primarily due to lower grades at Ahafo. The team is developing profitable expansion projects, including an optimized Ahafo Mill Expansion to increase throughput and offset lower-grade ore. In the Subika underground mine, which should improve ore grade and add up to 200,000 ounces of production per year, we're reducing overall unit costs. These expansions also represent potential upside.
In South America, production is forecast to decline in 2015 and 2016 before rising in 2017 as new production at Merian offsets maturing operations at Yanacocha. We're working on an integrated approach to developing oxide and sulfide deposits that could extend profitable production at Yanacocha and expect to review initial study findings in mid-2016. 
We also revised our cost outlook, turning to Slide 18. Our new cost guidance also reflects a lower exchange rate for the Australian dollar of USD 0.80 to the Australian dollar, down from USD 0.85 previously. Our oil price assumption remains unchanged at $75 per barrel. We now expect our 2015 gold all-in sustaining costs to fall between $920 and $980 per ounce, a 4% reduction from previous guidance. 
At the regional level, we reduced our Asia Pacific cost outlook for 2015 based on ongoing cost and efficiency improvements as well as the lower exchange rate. We also improved Boddington copper costs. In Africa, we lowered our cost outlook due to improved year-to-date performance.
Looking out to 2017. We now expect to deliver all-in sustaining costs of between $900 and $1,000 per ounce, down about 3% from our previous range of $925 to $1,025 per ounce. Our long-term outlook for copper cost remains unchanged.
Turning to Slide 19 to discuss capital. Our capital outlook reflects reduced sustaining capital expenditures at Carlin, Twin Creeks, Boddington and Batu Hijau. This is offset by additional development capital needed to complete the CC&V expansion. With these changes, we expect 2015 capital expenditure of between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, in line with previous guidance. 
We reduced our 2015 sustaining capital outlook due to operating efficiencies and cost savings as well as a modest shift in timing. Our long-term sustaining capital outlook of between $850 million and $950 million per year remains unchanged. 
Our project pipeline remains one of the strongest in the sector. Turning to Slide 20. We create value by discovering, developing and operating profitable gold mines. And we've improved our ability to do that by optimizing our project pipeline and bringing our best projects forward in a measured and sequenced manner. 
We remain on track to reach commercial production at the Turf Vent Shaft later this year. The shaft will allow us to produce an additional 100,000 to 150,000 ounces of higher-grade ore at Carlin's Leeville underground mine. We're also making good progress at Merian where we expect to produce between 400,000 and 500,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of between $650 and $750 per ounce for the first 5 years beginning in late 2016. 
I visited Long Canyon last week and I'm pleased with the team's progress. First production from this new and highly prospective oxide gold district is slated for early 2017. We expect Long Canyon to produce between 100,000 and 150,000 ounces of gold per year at all-in sustaining costs of between $500 and $600 per ounce.
In Australia, we expect to reach a decision on our Tanami expansion project later this year. The project involves building a second decline in the underground mine and incremental capacity in the plant to increase profitable production and extend mine life. The Tanami expansion could add incremental gold production of 100,000 to 125,000 ounces per year at lower overall cost for the first 5 years. If approved, we would expect production and cost improvements in 2017.
In Ghana, we continue to evaluate an expansion of our existing Ahafo Mill to help offset the impact of lower-grade ore. We expect to reach a decision later this year and see the potential to add 100,000 to 125,000 ounces of production at competitive costs. Lastly, we continue to study ways to extend profitable production from Yanacocha's remaining oxide and sulfide deposits by optimizing sequencing and recovery. We expect to review initial study findings in mid-2016.
Turning to exploration on Slide 21. Exploration is a core competency at Newmont and forms a critical part of our strategy to lead the sector in value creation. Our program focuses on increasing our existing resource base while maintaining the ability to pursue significant new discoveries. Nearly 70% of our forecast 2015 gold production was discovered or defined by Newmont geologists. 
Early-stage exploration projects that hold the potential to be in production in the medium horizon include: the Subika Underground in Ghana should give us access to ore grades that are significantly higher than the surface pit; Long Canyon in Nevada, where oxide mineralization has been identified over a 3-mile strike length and remains open in all directions; Northwest Exodus in Nevada, an extension of the Exodus Underground Mine, which would add profitable production; and Catcher Main, which is part of the oxide expansion effort at Yanacocha. 
Tanami provides a great example of our exploration success. Turning to Slide 22. Our exploration team has successfully grown Tanami's high-grade underground mineralization from 150,000 ounces in 1993 to nearly 11 million ounces. Half of these ounces have already been mined and about half are still in our reserves and resources. Most of this growth has been driven by extensions of the Callie and Auron deposits still hold significant upside. Our team believes there is the potential to double our current reserves and resources at Tanami at comparable grades through expansions at Callie, which remains open at depth and at where only 50% of the deposit has been drilled to reserve and resource. 
Development of 2 new discoveries, Federation Limb and Liberator in close proximity to our existing underground mine and through our brownfields program with targets like the in where we've drilled intercepts of up to 20 meters at grades of 8.6 grams per tonne of gold. All of these deposits can be developed relatively inexpensively due to our existing infrastructure with ore processed at our existing mill. 
Turning to Slide 23 for a closer look at Auron. This long section shows the Callie and Auron deposits along with some of the results of our drilling program to date. The gold color represents our reserves, the dark blue shows our resources and the light blue shows inventory or material that has not yet advanced to resource status. 
As you can see, both Callie and Auron have significant growth potential on top of the more than 5 million ounces of currently declared reserves and resources. As I just mentioned, Callie remains open at depth and much of Auron is still undrilled. We're excited about the drill results to date, which suggests that extensions are at a comparable thickness and grade with what we're already mining today. The mineralization is mainly free gold, which you can see in this photo.
Turning to Slide 24 for a closer look at the Federation Limb. Federation Limb was discovered in 2013 and is located in a structure that is parallel to Callie, where we are mining today. The discovery is significant in terms of potential size, grade and proximity to existing infrastructure. Federation's mineralization varies in thickness from 2 to 35 meters and in grade from 2 to 200 grams per tonne. We declared an initial resource of 0.5 million ounces at an average grade of 6.9 grams per tonne in 2014. This represents about 25% of the potential target, and we continue to see higher grades and open mineralization that will be further defined through in-fill drilling.
Finally, turning to Liberator on Slide 25. Liberator is a brand-new discovery made just this year located below Federation. Like Federation, Liberator is significant due to its potential size, grade and proximity to existing infrastructure. Liberator's mineralization varies in thickness from 2 to 40 meters and in grade from 2 to 30 grams of gold per tonne. We intend to further define the deposit and declare first resource at Liberator in 2016. We're excited about the potential for longer-term growth at Tanami and throughout our portfolio where we're also prepared to weather headwinds.
Turning to Slide 26. We run our business to maintain flexibility in a variety of gold price environments and update our contingency plans on a regular basis. This chart gives you an idea of what we might do differently in a prolonged period of lower or higher gold price. Under significant pricing constraints, specific actions we would take to include delaying stripping campaigns and sustaining capital expenditures, further reducing overhead and exploration costs and deferring early-stage projects. 
Similarly, as gold prices improve, we'll maintain our cost and capital discipline, continue to advance our most promising projects and exploration prospects and look to accelerate our debt repayment. We are comfortable with how we've positioned the business and believe our success in getting our house in order and optimizing our portfolio and project pipeline is paying off. 
I'll wrap up my comments with a quick look at where we're taking Newmont in the future. Our goal is to be the most profitable and responsible gold mining company in the world. We will reach that goal by continuing to deliver our strategy to improve our underlying business by continuously raising our safety, cost and technical performance; to strengthen our portfolio by building a longer life, lower-cost asset base; and to create shareholder value by generating cash, paying dividends and continuing to strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet.

I'll take the first part here on Carlin and Boddington in terms of strip ratio, because those are probably the 2 biggest drivers of Carlin being the biggest. And I was just out there last week and have a pretty good handle on what's going on. I think the big difference has been we've had material that was originally characterized as waste that's now become ore. So that's a good thing in terms of mineral model but it also results and lower stripping. So what we'd expect it to be stripping is waste as now ore. That ore has a longer haul when you've been out there, so taking it from the northern bit down to where the mill is does require a longer haul. So that's taking up the truck capacity and lower stripping. At Boddington, it's been changes to the mine plan that we implemented earlier this year and really the shape. And that's allowed us not just for this year but going forward to reduce some of the stripping. Twin Creeks, the question there was -- Chris Robison is going to address Twin Creeks question."

But seeing last week's aggressive pullback in some of the gold equities, and it does seem like we're seeing some sort of investor fatigue or -- and or capitulation toward gold and by extension, the gold acquisitions. Could you come as to what you're hearing at the board level, not only at the Newmont board but maybe within the industry as to what the industry's planning to do in order to stay relevant as an asset class toward investors, which will require as a potential for market cap and liquidity? And just in other words, is M&A potentially back on the burner in 2016 if we continue to see gold prices stable at $1,100?"

We're really focused on running our existing business well and delivering results. I think as has been highlighted, continuing to deliver the results that we say we're going to, continuing to look at ways to improve the businesses is the way to earn the credibility of shareholders. As an industry, I think we've got different participants going after it in different ways. I think we'll see some that will do well and perform well through this price environment. We've got others that I'm sure we'll get challenged just by the nature of how they got across and gone after their cost improvement and efficiencies. We've really focused over the last couple of years with our board on what can be done to sustainably improve cost and efficiencies, not just do something that's flashing the pan for a year or 2. And I think that's just as an important from a shareholder standpoint to look at it. So our discussions with shareholders, our discussion with our board, and we just completed those discussions here recently with our most recent board meeting, we're really focused on making sure we continue to deliver, stay within our strategy, make sure the foundation's going well, make sure we've got good financial capacity, keep an eye on the balance sheet, keep an eye on shareholder returns as you saw with the dividend, that we believe we are positioned well to be able to pay that dividend even though it fell below our current guideline. And those are the sort of things we've been discussing and focusing on. I think in terms of the market, I've always been saying, keep an eye on both what's happening with ETS and what's happening in China. And I think the announcement last week on China came out as unfortunately, a bit of a negative surprise but quite frankly, there's an increase in gold reserves time had and the underlying fundamentals of demand in China for gold still remains strong. Last quarter was the fourth strongest quarter in gold demand in China, so I think that's good. I think India continues to play well in that. The overall potential headwinds that people see in the U.S. economy performance and interest rates sit out there. I think quite a bit of that I would expect priced in, but I think where things go actually getting some of those things to happen in terms of interest rates finally moving so the speculation stops, and we moved past that stage will be important. But we're in it for the long term. We want to make sure the business is positioned to work through the different swings, ups and downs. And so we're not having to shoot from the hip and come up with short-term sort of approaches to addressing the business fundamentals. And I think we've really worked hard here at Newmont to make sure that we've positioned the business to survive well through these sorts of swings."

Newmont continued to deliver strong performance in the second quarter, and I'd like to walk you through the highlights now. We reduced our injury rates, maintained steady gold production and low",1207,"Thanks, Meredith, and thank you for joining us this morning. Newmont continued to deliver strong performance in the second quarter, and I'd like to walk you through the highlights now. We reduced our injury rates, maintained steady gold production and lowered our all-in sustaining costs by 14% per ounce compared to the prior year quarter. This performance resulted in our fifth consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow, a 32% increase in adjusted EBITDA and a 17% increase in operating cash flow compared to 2014. 
We also announced the acquisition of Cripple Creek and Victor in Colorado and advanced the Turf Vent Shaft and Long Canyon operations or mines rather in Nevada in Merian and Suriname. Finally, we leveraged strong operating performance to pay down debt and return cash to shareholders.
Turning to Slide 4 to look at our safety performance. I'm pleased to report that we reduced our total injury rate by slightly more than 40% this quarter compared to last year. This constitutes Newmont's lowest-ever injury rate and reflects tremendous dedication by our team and significant improvement by our contractors. 
I particularly want to acknowledge our teams in Ghana and Suriname, who completed the entire quarter working without injury, proving that our goal of 0 harm is achievable. This performance comes down to strong operating discipline, safe facilities and most importantly, a sense of accountability for safety that runs throughout the entire workforce. 
Let's turn to Slide 5 for other quarter highlights. Our strategy has 3 elements, and we're making progress on all fronts: First, to improve the underlying business. We maintained steady gold production, more than offsetting the impacts of divestments and doubled our copper production. Our gold all-in sustaining costs were just over $900 per ounce, which represents a 14% improvement over the prior year quarter. 
Second, to strengthen the portfolio, we announced the acquisition of Cripple Creek and Victor in June and expect the transaction to close in early August. CC&V adds cash flow and production and improves our portfolio mine life, cost and risk profile. We also announced the sale of Waihi, which will bring total proceeds from the sale of noncore assets to $1.6 billion over the last 2 years.
Turning to organic growth. Construction at Turf Vent Shaft, Merian and Long Canyon is advancing on schedule and on budget. 
The third part of our strategy is to create shareholder value. We generated nearly $700 million in adjusted EBITDA, up 32% from the prior year, and $119 million in free cash flow. This strong performance allowed us to declare a dividend despite lower metal prices and paid down $75 million in debt during the quarter. We remain on track to pay down further debt in 2015.
Let's turn to Slide 6 to look at production. We produced more than 1.2 million ounces of gold and 41,000 tonnes of copper in the second quarter on an attributable basis. This is slightly more gold than we produced in the prior year quarter and represents a 12% increase after you adjust for divesting Jundee and La Herradura. Operations around the world contributed to this strong performance. 
At Batu Hijau, gold and copper production continues to rise as we mine higher-grade ore. We'll continue to mine higher grades through 2017 and are reviewing options for developing the next phase of mining.
Boddington also delivered a strong gold and copper production. The team has leveraged the Full Potential Program to improve productivity in the mine through load and haul efficiency and in the mill via throughput, utilization and maintenance improvements. 
Twin Creeks produced more gold as a result of planned higher grades and volumes and improved autoclave performance. At Tanami, we had another strong quarter, primarily from increased throughput driven by planning and productivity improvements. At KCGM, we've commissioned our new ultra-fine grind mills and saw improved production for the quarter. And finally, Yanacocha delivered higher leach and mill production.
Turning to Slide 7 and our cost performance. Ongoing cost reductions are largely the result of higher productivity and sustainable cost and efficiency improvements. We also benefited from favorable oil price and exchange rates, which largely offset lower metal prices during the quarter and some delayed timing in our capital expenditures. We expect our cost to increase slightly in the second half of the year due mainly to lower production volumes at Ahafo and Yanacocha but will finish the year well within our improved guidance, which I'll discuss in a moment. 
This graph shows our progress over the last 3 years. Our year-to-date all-in sustaining cost is $879 per ounce, and we expect to end 2015 having achieved a 20% reduction from 2012. Putting it all together, we're making the most of our opportunities and managing our challenges.
Turning to Slide 8. Batu Hijau is running at full capacity, and we continue to work with the government to negotiate modifications to our contract of work and to renew our export permit. We also negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement that features reasonable wage increases of 3% in 2015 and 4% in 2016 for our represented workforce. 
In Ghana, the team has installed 14 megawatts of temporary power generation capacity at Akyem and will add another 21 megawatts of permanent capacity at Ahafo by year end. Both sites are now operating at full capacity. Labor negotiations in Ghana are ongoing, and we remain committed to reaching an agreement that offers fair wages and benefits while sustaining profitable operations. 
Merian remains on-track for first production in 2016, with engineering about 90% complete and construction about 25% complete. You can see how we're progressing on the camp, mill, truck shop and power plant in this photo. We've also stockpiled just over 500,000 tonnes of higher-grade ore. Finally, we've begun work to integrate Cripple Creek and Victor into the Newmont team and into our portfolio.
Let's turn for more detail on Cripple Creek and Victor on Slide 9. CC&V is a surface mine and heap leach operation about 100 miles from our headquarters in Denver. The operation is about 2/3 through a $585 million expansion, and we expect the remaining development capital to be fully funded by CC&V's operating cash flow. 
The expansion includes a new mill to augment production, improve recovery on higher-grade ore and add capacity for a potential underground operation. The mill is up and running and expected to reach full production capacity later this year. The expansion also features a new recovery plant and second leach pad, which are expected to be in production in the second half of 2016. 
CC&V will contribute 350,000 to 400,000 ounces of gold production at all-in sustaining costs of between $825 and $875 per ounce in 2016 and 2017. These costs exclude further efficiency and optimization improvement opportunities that we've identified. For example, we see potential to lower CC&V's mining costs by up to 10% by optimizing the mine plan to reduce stripping and eliminate marginal ounces. We also believe we can improve site recoveries by up to 2% by applying Newmont's proprietary technology. 
Longer term, surface and underground expansions could also increase CC&V's value and mine life but will require further definition and optimization. With that, I'll hand it over to Laurie for an update on financial results."

It was a strong quarter for Newmont and I'm pleased with our performance.Turning to Slide 11. As Gary mentioned, we continue to see cost improvement across the portfolio. Our second quarter gold",613,"Thanks, Gary, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. It was a strong quarter for Newmont and I'm pleased with our performance.
Turning to Slide 11. As Gary mentioned, we continue to see cost improvement across the portfolio. Our second quarter gold cost applicable to sales per ounce and gold all-in sustaining cost per ounce were both 14% favorable to the prior year. These improvements contributed to EBITDA expansion and our fifth consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. Despite an 8% decline in our average realized gold price, the lower cost from operations led to continued strong financial results.
Turning to Slide 12. During the second quarter, we generated more than $440 million in cash from continuing operations, an increase of more than 17% from the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was also up 32% from the prior year due to higher grades and recoveries, especially at Batu Hijau improved oil prices and exchange rates and ongoing efficiency improvements. 
Consolidated free cash flow was $119 million during the second quarter, including increased development capital spending at our projects such as Merian and Long Canyon. Year-to-date free cash flow now stands at $463 million, almost $400 million higher than the prior year period. We reported adjusted net income of $131 million in the second quarter or $0.26 per share compared to $101 million or $0.20 per share last year.
Turning to Slide 13 for a review of that. Adjusted net income excludes a $0.02 per share gain related to discontinued operation, a $0.05 per share loss related to impairment and restructuring costs and a $0.09 per share impairment of certain deferred tax assets. After reconciling for these items, we reported adjusted net income of $131 million or $0.26 per share, as I've noted. The strong quarter operationally was also reflected in adjusted EBITDA of $692 million, up 32% from the prior year. Similarly, adjusted EBITDA excludes impairments, restructuring, acquisition and divestiture costs.
Now turning to Slide 14. At the end of the second quarter, our investment-grade balance sheet had over $3.3 billion in cash and equivalents. Excluding the cash we will use to acquire CC&V, adjusted cash is about $2.5 billion. Combining that adjusted cash, our $3 billion revolver and roughly $200 million in marketable securities gives us nearly $6 billion of liquidity. 
During the second quarter, we repaid $75 million of debt, primarily towards the PTNNT revolver. We've also eliminated Ahafo's remaining loan balance. This brings our year-to-date total debt payment to $280 million, and we remain on track to pay down further debt by year end.
We have no significant debt maturities until 2019, and our current net debt-to-book capital of 17.9% is well below the maximum 62.5% for our revolver covenant. Newmont's strong cash flows and enhanced balance sheet provided us with the confidence to maintain our dividend, as we announced earlier this week, despite the average gold price for the quarter of $1,192.
Turning to Slide 15. Our work to delever the balance sheet and improve our underlying business separates Newmont from the competition. As our slide indicates, our net debt-to-EBITDA continues to improve and outperform competitor averages. In a $1,200 gold price environment, we're targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1, which we estimate will allow us to maintain an investment-grade balance sheet across a variety of metal price scenarios. 
To summarize, Newmont's strong liquidity and cash flow positions us to deliver results across the commodity cycle. We're comfortable with our relative level of debt and maturity profile but we'll continue to look at ways to reduce the absolute debt level and strengthen the long-term viability of our business. And now, I'll turn the call back over to Gary."
291795,304736186,836892,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2015",2015-07-23,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Laurie. I'll shift gears now to cover our outlook. Turning to Slide 17. We're revising our production and cost guidance to reflect continued strong performance at our operations and the impact of building Long Canyon Phase 1, acquiring CC&V and di",1819,"Thanks, Laurie. I'll shift gears now to cover our outlook. Turning to Slide 17. We're revising our production and cost guidance to reflect continued strong performance at our operations and the impact of building Long Canyon Phase 1, acquiring CC&V and divesting Waihi. We now expect to produce between 4.7 million and 5.1 million ounces of gold in 2015, up slightly from our previously published range of 4.6 million to 4.9 million ounces. 
We also improved our 2015 copper production guidance by about 10% due to a better face position at Batu Hijau as we've been able to make better progress on pit dewatering than we'd planned. Our revised long-term guidance calls for gold production of between 5.2 million and 5.5 million ounces by 2017, a 9% increase from previous guidance. 
In North America, we expect gold production to increase over the 3-year period as we complete the Turf Vent Shaft, enter a period of lower stripping at Carlin and add production from CC&V and Long Canyon Phase 1. 
In Asia Pacific, we expect Batu Hijau to contribute steady gold and copper production from higher-grade ore over the next 3 years. A planned expansion at Tanami, if approved, represents additional upside. 
In Africa, we expect production to decline over the next 3 years, primarily due to lower grades at Ahafo. The team is developing profitable expansion projects, including an optimized Ahafo Mill Expansion to increase throughput and offset lower-grade ore. In the Subika underground mine, which should improve ore grade and add up to 200,000 ounces of production per year, we're reducing overall unit costs. These expansions also represent potential upside.
In South America, production is forecast to decline in 2015 and 2016 before rising in 2017 as new production at Merian offsets maturing operations at Yanacocha. We're working on an integrated approach to developing oxide and sulfide deposits that could extend profitable production at Yanacocha and expect to review initial study findings in mid-2016. 
We also revised our cost outlook, turning to Slide 18. Our new cost guidance also reflects a lower exchange rate for the Australian dollar of USD 0.80 to the Australian dollar, down from USD 0.85 previously. Our oil price assumption remains unchanged at $75 per barrel. We now expect our 2015 gold all-in sustaining costs to fall between $920 and $980 per ounce, a 4% reduction from previous guidance. 
At the regional level, we reduced our Asia Pacific cost outlook for 2015 based on ongoing cost and efficiency improvements as well as the lower exchange rate. We also improved Boddington copper costs. In Africa, we lowered our cost outlook due to improved year-to-date performance.
Looking out to 2017. We now expect to deliver all-in sustaining costs of between $900 and $1,000 per ounce, down about 3% from our previous range of $925 to $1,025 per ounce. Our long-term outlook for copper cost remains unchanged.
Turning to Slide 19 to discuss capital. Our capital outlook reflects reduced sustaining capital expenditures at Carlin, Twin Creeks, Boddington and Batu Hijau. This is offset by additional development capital needed to complete the CC&V expansion. With these changes, we expect 2015 capital expenditure of between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, in line with previous guidance. 
We reduced our 2015 sustaining capital outlook due to operating efficiencies and cost savings as well as a modest shift in timing. Our long-term sustaining capital outlook of between $850 million and $950 million per year remains unchanged. 
Our project pipeline remains one of the strongest in the sector. Turning to Slide 20. We create value by discovering, developing and operating profitable gold mines. And we've improved our ability to do that by optimizing our project pipeline and bringing our best projects forward in a measured and sequenced manner. 
We remain on track to reach commercial production at the Turf Vent Shaft later this year. The shaft will allow us to produce an additional 100,000 to 150,000 ounces of higher-grade ore at Carlin's Leeville underground mine. We're also making good progress at Merian, where we expect to produce between 400,000 and 500,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of between $650 and $750 per ounce for the first 5 years beginning in late 2016. 
I visited Long Canyon last week and I'm pleased with the team's progress. First production from this new and highly prospective oxide gold district is slated for early 2017. We expect Long Canyon to produce between 100,000 and 150,000 ounces of gold per year at all-in sustaining costs of between $500 and $600 per ounce.
In Australia, we expect to reach a decision on our Tanami expansion project later this year. The project involves building a second decline in the underground mine and incremental capacity in the plant to increase profitable production and extend mine life. The Tanami expansion could add incremental gold production of 100,000 to 125,000 ounces per year at lower overall cost for the first 5 years. If approved, we would expect production and cost improvements in 2017.
In Ghana, we continue to evaluate an expansion of our existing Ahafo Mill to help offset the impact of lower-grade ore. We expect to reach a decision later this year and see the potential to add 100,000 to 125,000 ounces of production at competitive costs. Lastly, we continue to study ways to extend profitable production from Yanacocha's remaining oxide and sulfide deposits by optimizing sequencing and recovery. We expect to review initial study findings in mid-2016.
Turning to exploration on Slide 21. Exploration is a core competency at Newmont and forms a critical part of our strategy to lead the sector in value creation. Our program focuses on increasing our existing resource base while maintaining the ability to pursue significant new discoveries. Nearly 70% of our forecast 2015 gold production was discovered or defined by Newmont geologists. 
Early-stage exploration projects that hold the potential to be in production in the medium horizon include: the Subika Underground in Ghana should give us access to ore grades that are significantly higher than the surface pit; Long Canyon in Nevada, where oxide mineralization has been identified over a 3-mile strike length and remains open in all directions; Northwest Exodus in Nevada, an extension of the Exodus Underground Mine, which would add profitable production; and Catcher Main, which is part of the oxide expansion effort at Yanacocha. 
Tanami provides a great example of our exploration success. Turning to Slide 22. Our exploration team has successfully grown Tanami's high-grade underground mineralization from 150,000 ounces in 1993 to nearly 11 million ounces. Half of these ounces have already been mined and about half are still in our reserves and resources. Most of this growth has been driven by extensions of the Callie and Auron deposits will still hold significant upside. Our team believes there is the potential to double our current reserves and resources at Tanami at comparable grades through expansions at Callie, which remains open at depth, and at Auron, where only 50% of the deposit has been drilled to reserve and resource. 
Development of 2 new discoveries, Federation Limb and Liberator in close proximity to our existing underground mine and through our brownfields program, with targets like the Sulin [ph] Footwall, where we've drilled intercepts of up to 20 meters at grades of 8.6 grams per tonne of gold. All of these deposits can be developed relatively inexpensively due to our existing infrastructure with ore processed at our existing mill. 
Turning to Slide 23 for a closer look at Auron. This long section shows the Callie and Auron deposits along with some of the results of our drilling program to date. The gold color represents our reserves, the dark blue shows our resources, and the light blue shows inventory or material that has not yet advanced to resource status. 
As you can see, both Callie and Auron have significant growth potential on top of the more than 5 million ounces of currently declared reserves and resources. As I'd just mentioned, Callie remains open at depth and much of Auron is still undrilled. We're excited about the drill results to date, which suggest that extensions are at a comparable thickness in grade with what we're already mining today. The mineralization is mainly free gold, which you can see in this photo.
Turning to Slide 24 for a closer look at the Federation Limb. Federation Limb was discovered in 2013 and is located in a structure that is parallel to Callie, where we are mining today. The discovery is significant in terms of potential size, grade and proximity to existing infrastructure. Federation's mineralization varies in thickness from 2 to 35 meters and in grades from 2 to 200 grams per tonne. We declared an initial resource of 0.5 million ounces at an average grade of 6.9 grams per tonne in 2014. This represents about 25% of the potential target, and we continue to see higher grades and open mineralization that will be further defined through in-fill drilling.
Finally, turning to Liberator on Slide 25. Liberator is a brand-new discovery made just this year located below Federation. Like Federation, Liberator is significant due to its potential size, grade and proximity to existing infrastructure. Liberator's mineralization varies in thickness from 2 to 40 meters and in grade from 2 to 30 grams of gold per tonne. We intend to further define the deposit and declare first resource at Liberator in 2016. We're excited about the potential for longer-term growth at Tanami and throughout our portfolio, where we're also prepared to weather headwinds.
Turning to Slide 26. We run our business to maintain flexibility in a variety of gold price environments and update our contingency plans on a regular basis. This chart gives you an idea of what we might do differently in a prolonged period of lower or higher gold price. Under significant pricing constraints, specific actions we would take include: Delaying stripping campaigns and sustaining capital expenditures; further reducing overhead and exploration costs; and deferring early-stage projects. 
Similarly, as gold prices improve, we'll maintain our cost and capital discipline continue to advance our most promising projects and exploration prospects and look to accelerate our debt repayment. We are comfortable with how we've positioned the business and believe our success in getting our house in order and optimizing our portfolio and project pipeline is paying off. 
I'll wrap up my comments with a quick look at where we're taking Newmont in the future. Our goal is to be the most profitable and responsible gold mining company in the world. We will reach that goal by continuing to deliver our strategy to improve our underlying business by continuously raising our safety, cost and technical performance; to strengthen our portfolio by building a longer life, lower-cost asset base; and to create shareholder value by generating cash, paying dividends and continuing to strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet.

I'll take the first part here on Carlin and Boddington in terms of strip ratio because those are probably the 2 biggest drivers, with Carlin being the biggest. And I was just out there last week and have a pretty good handle on what's going on. I think the big difference has been we've had material that was originally characterized as waste that's now become ore. So that's a good thing in terms of mineral model, but it also results in lower stripping. So what we'd expected to be stripping as waste is now ore. That ore has a longer haul when you've been out there. So taking it from the northern bit down to where the mill is does require a longer haul. So that's taking up the truck capacity and lower stripping. 
At Boddington, it's been changes to the mine plan that we implemented earlier this year and really the shape, and that's allowed us, not just for this year but going forward, to reduce some of the stripping.

I met with a number of government officials earlier this year and more recently, met with the Minister of Mines and Energy as he was here in the U.S. to just talk about the progress and where we are both in terms of the modifications to our contract to work and the permit extension. And we do continue to discuss with several parties the potential of participating in a smelter and supporting the country's policy of having in-country processing. Those are at different stages with different parties, and I'm not really at liberty to get into the details on those other than we continue to progress that. I do think there's a desire in the country to continue to see be operations run as we work together towards a solution. And I've been encouraged as I was when I visited in March, and that resulted in getting our extension in March.

We're really focused on running our existing business well and delivering results. I think, as has been highlighted, continuing to deliver the results that we say we're going to, continuing to look at ways to improve the businesses is the way to earn the credibility of shareholders. As an industry, I think we've got different participants going after it in different ways. I think we'll see some that will do well and perform well through this price environment. We've got others that I'm sure we'll get challenged just by the nature of how they've gone across and gone after their cost improvement and efficiencies. We've really focused, over the last couple of years, with our board on what can be done to sustainably improve cost and efficiencies, not just do something that's flashing the pan for a year or 2. And I think that's just as an important from a shareholder standpoint to look at it. So our discussions with shareholders, our discussion with our board, and we just completed those discussions here recently with our most recent board meeting, we're really focused on making sure we continue to deliver, stay within our strategy, make sure the foundation is going well, make sure we've got good financial capacity, keep an eye on the balance sheet, keep an eye on shareholder returns, as you saw with the dividend, that we believe we're positioned well to be able to pay that dividend even though it fell below our current guideline. And those are the sorts of things that we've been discussing and focusing on. 
I think in terms of the market, I've always been saying, keep an eye on both what's happening with ETS and what's happening in China. And I think the announcement last week on China came out as, unfortunately, a bit of a negative surprise. But quite frankly, there's an increase in gold reserves that China had, and the underlying fundamentals of demand in China for gold still remains strong. Last quarter was the fourth strongest quarter in gold demand in China. So I think that's good. I think India continues to play well in that. The overall potential headwinds that people see in the U.S. economy performance and interest rates sit out there. I think quite a bit of that, I would expect, is priced in. But I think where things go, actually getting some of those things to happen in terms of interest rate is finally moving. So the speculation stops and we move past that stage will be important. But we're in it for the long term. We want to make sure the business is positioned to work through the different swings, ups and downs -- and so we're not having to shoot from the hip and come up with short-term sort of approaches to addressing the business fundamentals. And I think we've really worked hard here at Newmont to make sure that we've positioned the business to survive well through these sorts of swings."

Newmont continued to deliver strong performance in the second quarter, and I'd like to walk you through the highlights now.

Newmont continued to deliver strong performance in the second quarter, and I'd like to walk you through the highlights now. We reduced our injury rates, maintained steady gold production and lowered our all-in sustaining costs by 14% per ounce compared to the prior year quarter. This performance resulted in our fifth consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow, a 32% increase in adjusted EBITDA and a 17% increase in operating cash flow compared to 2014. 
We also announced the acquisition of Cripple Creek and Victor in Colorado and advanced the Turf Vent Shaft and Long Canyon operations, or mines rather, in Nevada in Merian and Suriname. Finally, we leveraged strong operating performance to pay down debt and return cash to shareholders.
Turning to Slide 4 to look at our safety performance. I'm pleased to report that we reduced our total injury rate by slightly more than 40% this quarter compared to last year. This constitutes Newmont's lowest-ever injury rate and reflects tremendous dedication by our team and significant improvement by our contractors. 
I particularly want to acknowledge our teams in Ghana and Suriname, who completed the entire quarter working without injury, proving that our goal of 0 harm is achievable. This performance comes down to strong operating discipline, safe facilities and most importantly, a sense of accountability for safety that runs throughout the entire workforce. 
Let's turn to Slide 5 for other quarter highlights. Our strategy has 3 elements, and we're making progress on all fronts: First, to improve the underlying business. We maintained steady gold production, more than offsetting the impacts of divestments and doubled our copper production. Our gold all-in sustaining costs were just over $900 per ounce, which represents a 14% improvement over the prior year quarter. 
Second, to strengthen the portfolio, we announced the acquisition of Cripple Creek and Victor in June and expect the transaction to close in early August. CC&V adds cash flow and production and improves our portfolio mine life, cost and risk profile. We also announced the sale of Waihi, which will bring total proceeds from the sale of noncore assets to $1.6 billion over the last 2 years.
Turning to organic growth. Construction at Turf Vent Shaft, Merian and Long Canyon is advancing on schedule and on budget. 
The third part of our strategy is to create shareholder value. We generated nearly $700 million in adjusted EBITDA, up 32% from the prior year, and $119 million in free cash flow. This strong performance allowed us to declare a dividend despite lower metal prices and pay down $75 million in debt during the quarter. We remain on track to pay down further debt in 2015.
Let's turn to Slide 6 to look at production. We produced more than 1.2 million ounces of gold and 41,000 tonnes of copper in the second quarter on an attributable basis. This is slightly more gold than we produced in the prior year quarter and represents a 12% increase after you adjust for divesting Jundee and La Herradura. Operations around the world contributed to this strong performance. 
At Batu Hijau, gold and copper production continues to rise as we mine higher-grade ore. We'll continue to mine higher grades through 2017 and are reviewing options for developing the next phase of mining.
Boddington also delivered a strong gold and copper production. The team has leveraged the Full Potential Program to improve productivity in the mine through load and haul efficiency and in the mill via throughput, utilization and maintenance improvements. 
Twin Creeks produced more gold as a result of planned higher grades and volumes and improved autoclave performance. At Tanami, we had another strong quarter, primarily from increased throughput driven by planning and productivity improvements. At KCGM, we've commissioned our new ultra-fine grind mills and saw improved production for the quarter. And finally, Yanacocha delivered higher leach and mill production.
Turning to Slide 7 and our cost performance. Ongoing cost reductions are largely the result of higher productivity and sustainable cost and efficiency improvements. We also benefited from favorable oil price and exchange rates, which largely offset lower metal prices during the quarter and some delayed timing in our capital expenditures. We expect our cost to increase slightly in the second half of the year due mainly to lower production volumes at Ahafo and Yanacocha but will finish the year well within our improved guidance, which I'll discuss in a moment. 
This graph shows our progress over the last 3 years. Our year-to-date all-in sustaining cost is $879 per ounce, and we expect to end 2015 having achieved a 20% reduction from 2012. Putting it all together, we're making the most of our opportunities and managing our challenges.
Turning to Slide 8. Batu Hijau is running at full capacity, and we continue to work with the government to negotiate modifications to our contract of work and to renew our export permit. We also negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement that features reasonable wage increases of 3% in 2015 and 4% in 2016 for our represented workforce. 
In Ghana, the team has installed 14 megawatts of temporary power generation capacity at Akyem and will add another 21 megawatts of permanent capacity at Ahafo by year end. Both sites are now operating at full capacity. Labor negotiations in Ghana are ongoing, and we remain committed to reaching an agreement that offers fair wages and benefits while sustaining profitable operations. 
Merian remains on-track for first production in 2016, with engineering about 90% complete and construction about 25% complete. You can see how we're progressing on the camp, mill, truck shop and power plant in this photo. We've also stockpiled just over 500,000 tonnes of higher-grade ore. Finally, we've begun work to integrate Cripple Creek and Victor into the Newmont team and into our portfolio.
Let's turn for more detail on Cripple Creek and Victor on Slide 9. CC&V is a surface mine and heap leach operation about 100 miles from our headquarters in Denver. The operation is about 2/3 through a $585 million expansion, and we expect the remaining development capital to be fully funded by CC&V's operating cash flow. 
The expansion includes a new mill to augment production, improve recovery on higher-grade ore and add capacity for a potential underground operation. The mill is up and running and expected to reach full production capacity later this year. The expansion also features a new recovery plant and second leach pad, which are expected to be in production in the second half of 2016. 
CC&V will contribute 350,000 to 400,000 ounces of gold production at all-in sustaining costs of between $825 and $875 per ounce in 2016 and 2017. These costs exclude further efficiency and optimization improvement opportunities that we've identified. For example, we see potential to lower CC&V's mining costs by up to 10% by optimizing the mine plan to reduce stripping and eliminate marginal ounces. We also believe we can improve site recoveries by up to 2% by applying Newmont's proprietary technology. 
Longer term, surface and underground expansions could also increase CC&V's value and mine life but will require further definition and optimization. With that, I'll hand it over to Laurie for an update on financial results."

Our second quarter gold",612,"Thanks, Gary, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. It was a strong quarter for Newmont and I'm pleased with our performance.
Turning to Slide 11. As Gary mentioned, we continue to see cost improvement across the portfolio. Our second quarter gold cost applicable to sales per ounce and gold all-in sustaining cost per ounce were both 14% favorable to the prior year. These improvements contributed to EBITDA expansion and our fifth consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. Despite an 8% decline in our average realized gold price, the lower cost from operations led to continued strong financial results.
Turning to Slide 12. During the second quarter, we generated more than $440 million in cash from continuing operations, an increase of more than 17% from the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was also up 32% from the prior year due to higher grades and recoveries, especially at Batu Hijau, improved oil prices and exchange rates and ongoing efficiency improvements. 
Consolidated free cash flow was $119 million during the second quarter, including increased development capital spending at our projects such as Merian and Long Canyon. Year-to-date free cash flow now stands at $463 million, almost $400 million higher than the prior year period. We reported adjusted net income of $131 million in the second quarter or $0.26 per share compared to $101 million or $0.20 per share last year.
Turning to Slide 13 for a review of that. Adjusted net income excludes a $0.02 per share gain related to discontinued operation, a $0.05 per share loss related to impairment and restructuring costs and a $0.09 per share impairment of certain deferred tax assets. After reconciling for these items, we reported adjusted net income of $131 million or $0.26 per share, as I've noted. The strong quarter operationally was also reflected in adjusted EBITDA of $692 million, up 32% from the prior year. Similarly, adjusted EBITDA excludes impairments, restructuring, acquisition and divestiture costs.
Now turning to Slide 14. At the end of the second quarter, our investment-grade balance sheet had over $3.3 billion in cash and equivalents. Excluding the cash we will use to acquire CC&V, adjusted cash is about $2.5 billion. Combining that adjusted cash, our $3 billion revolver and roughly $200 million in marketable securities gives us nearly $6 billion of liquidity. 
During the second quarter, we repaid $75 million of debt, primarily towards the PTNNT revolver. We've also eliminated Ahafo's remaining loan balance. This brings our year-to-date total debt payment to $280 million, and we remain on track to pay down further debt by year-end.
We have no significant debt maturities until 2019, and our current net debt-to-book capital of 17.9% is well below the maximum 62.5% for our revolver covenant. Newmont's strong cash flows and enhanced balance sheet provided us with the confidence to maintain our dividend, as we announced earlier this week, despite the average gold price for the quarter of $1,192.
Turning to Slide 15. Our work to delever the balance sheet and improve our underlying business separates Newmont from the competition. As our slide indicates, our net debt-to-EBITDA continues to improve and outperform competitor averages. In a $1,200 gold price environment, we're targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1, which we estimate will allow us to maintain an investment-grade balance sheet across a variety of metal price scenarios. 
To summarize, Newmont's strong liquidity and cash flow positions us to deliver results across the commodity cycle. We're comfortable with our relative level of debt and maturity profile but we'll continue to look at ways to reduce the absolute debt level and strengthen the long-term viability of our business. And now, I'll turn the call back over to Gary."

I'll shift gears now to cover our outlook. Turning to Slide 17. We're revising our production and cost guidance to reflect continued strong performance at our operations and the impact of building Long Canyon Phase 1, acquiring CC&V and divesting Waihi. We now expect to produce between 4.7 million and 5.1 million ounces of gold in 2015, up slightly from our previously published range of 4.6 million to 4.9 million ounces. 
We also improved our 2015 copper production guidance by about 10% due to a better face position at Batu Hijau as we've been able to make better progress on pit dewatering than we'd planned. Our revised long-term guidance calls for gold production of between 5.2 million and 5.5 million ounces by 2017, a 9% increase from previous guidance. 
In North America, we expect gold production to increase over the 3-year period as we complete the Turf Vent Shaft, enter a period of lower stripping at Carlin and add production from CC&V and Long Canyon Phase 1. 
In Asia Pacific, we expect Batu Hijau to contribute steady gold and copper production from higher-grade ore over the next 3 years. A planned expansion at Tanami, if approved, represents additional upside. 
In Africa, we expect production to decline over the next 3 years, primarily due to lower grades at Ahafo. The team is developing profitable expansion projects, including an optimized Ahafo Mill Expansion to increase throughput and offset lower-grade ore. In the Subika underground mine, which should improve ore grade and add up to 200,000 ounces of production per year, we're reducing overall unit costs. These expansions also represent potential upside.
In South America, production is forecast to decline in 2015 and 2016 before rising in 2017 as new production at Merian offsets maturing operations at Yanacocha. We're working on an integrated approach to developing oxide and sulfide deposits that could extend profitable production at Yanacocha and expect to review initial study findings in mid-2016. 
We also revised our cost outlook, turning to Slide 18. Our new cost guidance also reflects a lower exchange rate for the Australian dollar of USD 0.80 to the Australian dollar, down from USD 0.85 previously. Our oil price assumption remains unchanged at $75 per barrel. We now expect our 2015 gold all-in sustaining costs to fall between $920 and $980 per ounce, a 4% reduction from previous guidance. 
At the regional level, we reduced our Asia Pacific cost outlook for 2015 based on ongoing cost and efficiency improvements as well as the lower exchange rate. We also improved Boddington copper costs. In Africa, we lowered our cost outlook due to improved year-to-date performance.
Looking out to 2017. We now expect to deliver all-in sustaining costs of between $900 and $1,000 per ounce, down about 3% from our previous range of $925 to $1,025 per ounce. Our long-term outlook for copper cost remains unchanged.
Turning to Slide 19 to discuss capital. Our capital outlook reflects reduced sustaining capital expenditures at Carlin, Twin Creeks, Boddington and Batu Hijau. This is offset by additional development capital needed to complete the CC&V expansion. With these changes, we expect 2015 capital expenditure of between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, in line with previous guidance. 
We reduced our 2015 sustaining capital outlook due to operating efficiencies and cost savings as well as a modest shift in timing. Our long-term sustaining capital outlook of between $850 million and $950 million per year remains unchanged. 
Our project pipeline remains one of the strongest in the sector. Turning to Slide 20. We create value by discovering, developing and operating profitable gold mines. And we've improved our ability to do that by optimizing our project pipeline and bringing our best projects forward in a measured and sequenced manner. 
We remain on track to reach commercial production at the Turf Vent Shaft later this year. The shaft will allow us to produce an additional 100,000 to 150,000 ounces of higher-grade ore at Carlin's Leeville underground mine. We're also making good progress at Merian, where we expect to produce between 400,000 and 500,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of between $650 and $750 per ounce for the first 5 years beginning in late 2016. 
I visited Long Canyon last week and I'm pleased with the team's progress. First production from this new and highly prospective oxide gold district is slated for early 2017. We expect Long Canyon to produce between 100,000 and 150,000 ounces of gold per year at all-in sustaining costs of between $500 and $600 per ounce.
In Australia, we expect to reach a decision on our Tanami expansion project later this year. The project involves building a second decline in the underground mine and incremental capacity in the plant to increase profitable production and extend mine life. The Tanami expansion could add incremental gold production of 100,000 to 125,000 ounces per year at lower overall cost for the first 5 years. If approved, we would expect production and cost improvements in 2017.
In Ghana, we continue to evaluate an expansion of our existing Ahafo Mill to help offset the impact of lower-grade ore. We expect to reach a decision later this year and see the potential to add 100,000 to 125,000 ounces of production at competitive costs. Lastly, we continue to study ways to extend profitable production from Yanacocha's remaining oxide and sulfide deposits by optimizing sequencing and recovery. We expect to review initial study findings in mid-2016.
Turning to exploration on Slide 21. Exploration is a core competency at Newmont and forms a critical part of our strategy to lead this sector in value creation. Our program focuses on increasing our existing resource base while maintaining the ability to pursue significant new discoveries. Nearly 70% of our forecast 2015 gold production was discovered or defined by Newmont geologists. 
Early-stage exploration projects that hold the potential to be in production in the medium horizon include: the Subika Underground in Ghana should give us access to ore grades that are significantly higher than the surface pit; Long Canyon in Nevada, where oxide mineralization has been identified over a 3-mile strike length and remains open in all directions; Northwest Exodus in Nevada, an extension of the Exodus Underground Mine, which would add profitable production; and Catcher Main, which is part of the oxide expansion effort at Yanacocha. 
Tanami provides a great example of our exploration success. Turning to Slide 22. Our exploration team has successfully grown Tanami's high-grade underground mineralization from 150,000 ounces in 1993 to nearly 11 million ounces. Half of these ounces have already been mined and about half are still in our reserves and resources. Most of this growth has been driven by extensions of the Callie and Auron deposits, which still hold significant upside. Our team believes there is the potential to double our current reserves and resources at Tanami at comparable grades through expansions at Callie, which remains open at depth, and at Auron, where only 50% of the deposit has been drilled to reserve and resource. 
Development of 2 new discoveries, Federation Limb and Liberator, in close proximity to our existing underground mine and through our brownfields program, with targets like the Sulin [ph] Footwall, where we've drilled intercepts of up to 20 meters at grades of 8.6 grams per tonne of gold. All of these deposits can be developed relatively inexpensively due to our existing infrastructure with ore processed at our existing mill. 
Turning to Slide 23 for a closer look at Auron. This long section shows the Callie and Auron deposits along with some of the results of our drilling program to date. The gold color represents our reserves, the dark blue shows our resources, and the light blue shows inventory or material that has not yet advanced to resource status. 
As you can see, both Callie and Auron have significant growth potential on top of the more than 5 million ounces of currently declared reserves and resources. As I'd just mentioned, Callie remains open at depth and much of Auron is still undrilled. We're excited about the drill results to date, which suggest that extensions are at a comparable thickness in grade with what we're already mining today. The mineralization is mainly free gold, which you can see in this photo.
Turning to Slide 24 for a closer look at the Federation Limb. Federation Limb was discovered in 2013 and is located in a structure that is parallel to Callie, where we are mining today. The discovery is significant in terms of potential size, grade and proximity to existing infrastructure. Federation's mineralization varies in thickness from 2 to 35 meters and in grades from 2 to 200 grams per tonne. We declared an initial resource of 0.5 million ounces at an average grade of 6.9 grams per tonne in 2014. This represents about 25% of the potential target, and we continue to see higher grades and open mineralization that will be further defined through in-fill drilling.
Finally, turning to Liberator on Slide 25. Liberator is a brand-new discovery made just this year located below Federation. Like Federation, Liberator is significant due to its potential size, grade and proximity to existing infrastructure. Liberator's mineralization varies in thickness from 2 to 40 meters and in grade from 2 to 30 grams of gold per tonne. We intend to further define the deposit and declare first resource at Liberator in 2016. We're excited about the potential for longer-term growth at Tanami and throughout our portfolio, where we're also prepared to weather headwinds.
Turning to Slide 26. We run our business to maintain flexibility in a variety of gold price environments and update our contingency plans on a regular basis. This chart gives you an idea of what we might do differently in a prolonged period of lower or higher gold price. Under significant pricing constraints, specific actions we would take include: Delaying stripping campaigns and sustaining capital expenditures; further reducing overhead and exploration costs; and deferring early-stage projects. 
Similarly, as gold prices improve, we'll maintain our cost and capital discipline, continue to advance our most promising projects and exploration prospects and look to accelerate our debt repayment. We are comfortable with how we've positioned the business and believe our success in getting our house in order and optimizing our portfolio and project pipeline is paying off. 
I'll wrap up my comments with a quick look at where we're taking Newmont in the future. Our goal is to be the most profitable and responsible gold mining company in the world. We will reach that goal by continuing to deliver our strategy to improve our underlying business by continuously raising our safety, cost and technical performance; to strengthen our portfolio by building a longer life, lower-cost asset base; and to create shareholder value by generating cash, paying dividends and continuing to strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet. 
Thanks for your time. I'll open the floor to questions now, operator."

I'll take the first part here on Carlin and Boddington in terms of strip ratio because those are probably the 2 biggest drivers, with Carlin being the biggest. And I was just out there last week and have a pretty good handle on what's going on. I think the big difference has been we've had material that was originally characterized as waste that's now become ore. So that's a good thing in terms of mineral model, but it also results in lower stripping. So what we'd expected to be stripping as waste is now ore. That ore has a longer haul, and you've been out there. So taking it from the northern pit down to where the mill is does require a longer haul. So that's taking up the truck capacity and lower stripping. 
At Boddington, it's been changes to the mine plan that we implemented earlier this year and really the shape, and that's allowed us, not just for this year but going forward, to reduce some of the stripping. 
Twin Creeks, the question there was -- Chris Robison is going to address the Twin Creeks question."

We're really focused on running our existing business well and delivering results. I think, as has been highlighted, continuing to deliver the results that we say we're going to, continuing to look at ways to improve the businesses is the way to earn the credibility of shareholders. As an industry, I think we've got different participants going after it in different ways. I think we'll see some that will do well and perform well through this price environment. We've got others that I'm sure will get challenged just by the nature of how they've gone across and gone after their cost improvement and efficiencies. We've really focused, over the last couple of years, with our board on what can be done to sustainably improve cost and efficiencies, not just do something that's flash in the pan for a year or 2. And I think that's just as important from a shareholder standpoint to look at it. So our discussions with shareholders, our discussion with our board, and we just completed those discussions here recently with our most recent board meeting, we're really focused on making sure we continue to deliver, stay within our strategy, make sure the foundation is going well, make sure we've got good financial capacity, keep an eye on the balance sheet, keep an eye on shareholder returns, as you saw with the dividend, that we believe we're positioned well to be able to pay that dividend even though it fell below our current guideline. And those are the sorts of things that we've been discussing and focusing on. 
I think in terms of the market, I've always been saying, keep an eye on both what's happening with ETS and what's happening in China. And I think the announcement last week on China came out as, unfortunately, a bit of a negative surprise. But quite frankly, there's an increase in gold reserves that China had, and the underlying fundamentals of demand in China for gold still remains strong. Last quarter was the fourth strongest quarter in gold demand in China. So I think that's good. I think India continues to play well in that. The overall potential headwinds that people see in the U.S. economy performance and interest rates sit out there. I think quite a bit of that, I would expect, is priced in. But I think where things go, actually getting some of those things to happen in terms of interest rate is finally moving. So the speculation stops and we move past that stage will be important. But we're in it for the long term. We want to make sure the business is positioned to work through the different swings, ups and downs and -- so we're not having to shoot from the hip and come up with short-term sort of approaches to addressing the business fundamentals. And I think we've really worked hard here at Newmont to make sure that we've positioned the business to survive well through these sorts of swings."

Newmont continued to deliver strong performance in the second quarter, and I'd like to walk you through the highlights now. We reduced our injury rates, maintained steady gold production and low",1207,"Thanks, Meredith, and thank you for joining us this morning. Newmont continued to deliver strong performance in the second quarter, and I'd like to walk you through the highlights now. We reduced our injury rates, maintained steady gold production and lowered our all-in sustaining costs by 14% per ounce compared to the prior year quarter. This performance resulted in our fifth consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow, a 32% increase in adjusted EBITDA and a 17% increase in operating cash flow compared to 2014. 
We also announced the acquisition of Cripple Creek and Victor in Colorado and advanced the Turf Vent Shaft and Long Canyon operations, or mines rather, in Nevada in Merian and Suriname. Finally, we leveraged strong operating performance to pay down debt and return cash to shareholders.
Turning to Slide 4 to look at our safety performance. I'm pleased to report that we reduced our total injury rate by slightly more than 40% this quarter compared to last year. This constitutes Newmont's lowest-ever injury rate and reflects tremendous dedication by our team and significant improvement by our contractors. 
I particularly want to acknowledge our teams in Ghana and Suriname, who completed the entire quarter working without injury, proving that our goal of 0 harm is achievable. This performance comes down to strong operating discipline, safe facilities and most importantly, a sense of accountability for safety that runs throughout the entire workforce. 
Let's turn to Slide 5 for other quarter highlights. Our strategy has 3 elements, and we're making progress on all fronts: First, to improve the underlying business. We maintained steady gold production, more than offsetting the impacts of divestments and doubled our copper production. Our gold all-in sustaining costs were just over $900 per ounce, which represents a 14% improvement over the prior year quarter. 
Second, to strengthen the portfolio, we announced the acquisition of Cripple Creek and Victor in June and expect the transaction to close in early August. CC&V adds cash flow and production and improves our portfolio mine life, cost and risk profile. We also announced the sale of Waihi, which will bring total proceeds from the sale of noncore assets to $1.6 billion over the last 2 years.
Turning to organic growth. Construction at Turf Vent Shaft, Merian and Long Canyon is advancing on schedule and on budget. 
The third part of our strategy is to create shareholder value. We generated nearly $700 million in adjusted EBITDA, up 32% from the prior year, and $119 million in free cash flow. This strong performance allowed us to declare a dividend despite lower metal prices and pay down $75 million in debt during the quarter. We remain on track to pay down further debt in 2015.
Let's turn to Slide 6 to look at production. We produced more than 1.2 million ounces of gold and 41,000 tonnes of copper in the second quarter on an attributable basis. This is slightly more gold than we produced in the prior year quarter and represents a 12% increase after you adjust for divesting Jundee and La Herradura. Operations around the world contributed to this strong performance. 
At Batu Hijau, gold and copper production continues to rise as we mine higher-grade ore. We'll continue to mine higher grades through 2017 and are reviewing options for developing the next phase of mining.
Boddington also delivered a strong gold and copper production. The team has leveraged the Full Potential Program to improve productivity in the mine through load and haul efficiency and in the mill via throughput, utilization and maintenance improvements. 
Twin Creeks produced more gold as a result of planned higher grades and volumes and improved autoclave performance. At Tanami, we had another strong quarter, primarily from increased throughput driven by planning and productivity improvements. At KCGM, we've commissioned our new ultra-fine grind mills and saw improved production for the quarter. And finally, Yanacocha delivered higher leach and mill production.
Turning to Slide 7 and our cost performance. Ongoing cost reductions are largely the result of higher productivity and sustainable cost and efficiency improvements. We also benefited from favorable oil price and exchange rates, which largely offset lower metal prices during the quarter and some delayed timing in our capital expenditures. We expect our cost to increase slightly in the second half of the year due mainly to lower production volumes at Ahafo and Yanacocha but will finish the year well within our improved guidance, which I'll discuss in a moment. 
This graph shows our progress over the last 3 years. Our year-to-date all-in sustaining cost is $879 per ounce, and we expect to end 2015 having achieved a 20% reduction from 2012. Putting it all together, we're making the most of our opportunities and managing our challenges.
Turning to Slide 8. Batu Hijau is running at full capacity, and we continue to work with the government to negotiate modifications to our contract of work and to renew our export permit. We also negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement that features reasonable wage increases of 3% in 2015 and 4% in 2016 for our represented workforce. 
In Ghana, the team has installed 14 megawatts of temporary power generation capacity at Akyem and will add another 21 megawatts of permanent capacity at Ahafo by year end. Both sites are now operating at full capacity. Labor negotiations in Ghana are ongoing, and we remain committed to reaching an agreement that offers fair wages and benefits while sustaining profitable operations. 
Merian remains on-track for first production in 2016, with engineering about 90% complete and construction about 25% complete. You can see how we're progressing on the camp, mill, truck shop and power plant in this photo. We've also stockpiled just over 500,000 tonnes of higher-grade ore. Finally, we've begun work to integrate Cripple Creek and Victor into the Newmont team and into our portfolio.
Let's turn for more detail on Cripple Creek and Victor on Slide 9. CC&V is a surface mine and heap leach operation about 100 miles from our headquarters in Denver. The operation is about 2/3 through a $585 million expansion, and we expect the remaining development capital to be fully funded by CC&V's operating cash flow. 
The expansion includes a new mill to augment production, improve recovery on higher-grade ore and add capacity for a potential underground operation. The mill is up and running and expected to reach full production capacity later this year. The expansion also features a new recovery plant and second leach pad, which are expected to be in production in the second half of 2016. 
CC&V will contribute 350,000 to 400,000 ounces of gold production at all-in sustaining costs of between $825 and $875 per ounce in 2016 and 2017. These costs exclude further efficiency and optimization improvement opportunities that we've identified. For example, we see potential to lower CC&V's mining costs by up to 10% by optimizing the mine plan to reduce stripping and eliminate marginal ounces. We also believe we can improve site recoveries by up to 2% by applying Newmont's proprietary technology. 
Longer term, surface and underground expansions could also increase CC&V's value and mine life but will require further definition and optimization. With that, I'll hand it over to Laurie for an update on financial results."

It was a strong quarter for Newmont and I'm pleased with our performance.Turning to Slide 11. As Gary mentioned, we continue to see cost improvement across the portfolio. Our second quarter gold",612,"Thanks, Gary, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. It was a strong quarter for Newmont and I'm pleased with our performance.
Turning to Slide 11. As Gary mentioned, we continue to see cost improvement across the portfolio. Our second quarter gold cost applicable to sales per ounce and gold all-in sustaining cost per ounce were both 14% favorable to the prior year. These improvements contributed to EBITDA expansion and our fifth consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. Despite an 8% decline in our average realized gold price, the lower cost from operations led to continued strong financial results.
Turning to Slide 12. During the second quarter, we generated more than $440 million in cash from continuing operations, an increase of more than 17% from the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was also up 32% from the prior year due to higher grades and recoveries, especially at Batu Hijau, improved oil prices and exchange rates and ongoing efficiency improvements. 
Consolidated free cash flow was $119 million during the second quarter, including increased development capital spending at our projects such as Merian and Long Canyon. Year-to-date free cash flow now stands at $463 million, almost $400 million higher than the prior year period. We reported adjusted net income of $131 million in the second quarter or $0.26 per share compared to $101 million or $0.20 per share last year.
Turning to Slide 13 for a review of that. Adjusted net income excludes a $0.02 per share gain related to discontinued operation, a $0.05 per share loss related to impairment and restructuring costs and a $0.09 per share impairment of certain deferred tax assets. After reconciling for these items, we reported adjusted net income of $131 million or $0.26 per share, as I've noted. The strong quarter operationally was also reflected in adjusted EBITDA of $692 million, up 32% from the prior year. Similarly, adjusted EBITDA excludes impairments, restructuring, acquisition and divestiture costs.
Now turning to Slide 14. At the end of the second quarter, our investment-grade balance sheet had over $3.3 billion in cash and equivalents. Excluding the cash we will use to acquire CC&V, adjusted cash is about $2.5 billion. Combining that adjusted cash, our $3 billion revolver and roughly $200 million in marketable securities gives us nearly $6 billion of liquidity. 
During the second quarter, we repaid $75 million of debt, primarily towards the PTNNT revolver. We've also eliminated Ahafo's remaining loan balance. This brings our year-to-date total debt payment to $280 million, and we remain on track to pay down further debt by year-end.
We have no significant debt maturities until 2019, and our current net debt-to-book capital of 17.9% is well below the maximum 62.5% for our revolver covenant. Newmont's strong cash flows and enhanced balance sheet provided us with the confidence to maintain our dividend, as we announced earlier this week, despite the average gold price for the quarter of $1,192.
Turning to Slide 15. Our work to delever the balance sheet and improve our underlying business separates Newmont from the competition. As our slide indicates, our net debt-to-EBITDA continues to improve and outperform competitor averages. In a $1,200 gold price environment, we're targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1, which we estimate will allow us to maintain an investment-grade balance sheet across a variety of metal price scenarios. 
To summarize, Newmont's strong liquidity and cash flow positions us to deliver results across the commodity cycle. We're comfortable with our relative level of debt and maturity profile but we'll continue to look at ways to reduce the absolute debt level and strengthen the long-term viability of our business. And now, I'll turn the call back over to Gary."
291795,304736186,837829,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2015",2015-07-23,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Laurie. I'll shift gears now to cover our outlook. Turning to Slide 17. We're revising our production and cost guidance to reflect continued strong performance at our operations and the impact of building Long Canyon Phase 1, acquiring CC&V and di",1819,"Thanks, Laurie. I'll shift gears now to cover our outlook. Turning to Slide 17. We're revising our production and cost guidance to reflect continued strong performance at our operations and the impact of building Long Canyon Phase 1, acquiring CC&V and divesting Waihi. We now expect to produce between 4.7 million and 5.1 million ounces of gold in 2015, up slightly from our previously published range of 4.6 million to 4.9 million ounces. 
We also improved our 2015 copper production guidance by about 10% due to a better face position at Batu Hijau as we've been able to make better progress on pit dewatering than we'd planned. Our revised long-term guidance calls for gold production of between 5.2 million and 5.5 million ounces by 2017, a 9% increase from previous guidance. 
In North America, we expect gold production to increase over the 3-year period as we complete the Turf Vent Shaft, enter a period of lower stripping at Carlin and add production from CC&V and Long Canyon Phase 1. 
In Asia Pacific, we expect Batu Hijau to contribute steady gold and copper production from higher-grade ore over the next 3 years. A planned expansion at Tanami, if approved, represents additional upside. 
In Africa, we expect production to decline over the next 3 years, primarily due to lower grades at Ahafo. The team is developing profitable expansion projects, including an optimized Ahafo Mill Expansion to increase throughput and offset lower-grade ore. In the Subika underground mine, which should improve ore grade and add up to 200,000 ounces of production per year, we're reducing overall unit costs. These expansions also represent potential upside.
In South America, production is forecast to decline in 2015 and 2016 before rising in 2017 as new production at Merian offsets maturing operations at Yanacocha. We're working on an integrated approach to developing oxide and sulfide deposits that could extend profitable production at Yanacocha and expect to review initial study findings in mid-2016. 
We also revised our cost outlook, turning to Slide 18. Our new cost guidance also reflects a lower exchange rate for the Australian dollar of USD 0.80 to the Australian dollar, down from USD 0.85 previously. Our oil price assumption remains unchanged at $75 per barrel. We now expect our 2015 gold all-in sustaining costs to fall between $920 and $980 per ounce, a 4% reduction from previous guidance. 
At the regional level, we reduced our Asia Pacific cost outlook for 2015 based on ongoing cost and efficiency improvements as well as the lower exchange rate. We also improved Boddington copper costs. In Africa, we lowered our cost outlook due to improved year-to-date performance.
Looking out to 2017. We now expect to deliver all-in sustaining costs of between $900 and $1,000 per ounce, down about 3% from our previous range of $925 to $1,025 per ounce. Our long-term outlook for copper cost remains unchanged.
Turning to Slide 19 to discuss capital. Our capital outlook reflects reduced sustaining capital expenditures at Carlin, Twin Creeks, Boddington and Batu Hijau. This is offset by additional development capital needed to complete the CC&V expansion. With these changes, we expect 2015 capital expenditure of between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, in line with previous guidance. 
We reduced our 2015 sustaining capital outlook due to operating efficiencies and cost savings as well as a modest shift in timing. Our long-term sustaining capital outlook of between $850 million and $950 million per year remains unchanged. 
Our project pipeline remains one of the strongest in the sector. Turning to Slide 20. We create value by discovering, developing and operating profitable gold mines. And we've improved our ability to do that by optimizing our project pipeline and bringing our best projects forward in a measured and sequenced manner. 
We remain on track to reach commercial production at the Turf Vent Shaft later this year. The shaft will allow us to produce an additional 100,000 to 150,000 ounces of higher-grade ore at Carlin's Leeville underground mine. We're also making good progress at Merian, where we expect to produce between 400,000 and 500,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of between $650 and $750 per ounce for the first 5 years beginning in late 2016. 
I visited Long Canyon last week and I'm pleased with the team's progress. First production from this new and highly prospective oxide gold district is slated for early 2017. We expect Long Canyon to produce between 100,000 and 150,000 ounces of gold per year at all-in sustaining costs of between $500 and $600 per ounce.
In Australia, we expect to reach a decision on our Tanami expansion project later this year. The project involves building a second decline in the underground mine and incremental capacity in the plant to increase profitable production and extend mine life. The Tanami expansion could add incremental gold production of 100,000 to 125,000 ounces per year at lower overall cost for the first 5 years. If approved, we would expect production and cost improvements in 2017.
In Ghana, we continue to evaluate an expansion of our existing Ahafo Mill to help offset the impact of lower-grade ore. We expect to reach a decision later this year and see the potential to add 100,000 to 125,000 ounces of production at competitive costs. Lastly, we continue to study ways to extend profitable production from Yanacocha's remaining oxide and sulfide deposits by optimizing sequencing and recovery. We expect to review initial study findings in mid-2016.
Turning to exploration on Slide 21. Exploration is a core competency at Newmont and forms a critical part of our strategy to lead this sector in value creation. Our program focuses on increasing our existing resource base while maintaining the ability to pursue significant new discoveries. Nearly 70% of our forecast 2015 gold production was discovered or defined by Newmont geologists. 
Early-stage exploration projects that hold the potential to be in production in the medium horizon include: the Subika Underground in Ghana should give us access to ore grades that are significantly higher than the surface pit; Long Canyon in Nevada, where oxide mineralization has been identified over a 3-mile strike length and remains open in all directions; Northwest Exodus in Nevada, an extension of the Exodus Underground Mine, which would add profitable production; and Catcher Main, which is part of the oxide expansion effort at Yanacocha. 
Tanami provides a great example of our exploration success. Turning to Slide 22. Our exploration team has successfully grown Tanami's high-grade underground mineralization from 150,000 ounces in 1993 to nearly 11 million ounces. Half of these ounces have already been mined and about half are still in our reserves and resources. Most of this growth has been driven by extensions of the Callie and Auron deposits, which still hold significant upside. Our team believes there is the potential to double our current reserves and resources at Tanami at comparable grades through expansions at Callie, which remains open at depth, and at Auron, where only 50% of the deposit has been drilled to reserve and resource. 
Development of 2 new discoveries, Federation Limb and Liberator, in close proximity to our existing underground mine and through our brownfields program, with targets like the Sulin [ph] Footwall, where we've drilled intercepts of up to 20 meters at grades of 8.6 grams per tonne of gold. All of these deposits can be developed relatively inexpensively due to our existing infrastructure with ore processed at our existing mill. 
Turning to Slide 23 for a closer look at Auron. This long section shows the Callie and Auron deposits along with some of the results of our drilling program to date. The gold color represents our reserves, the dark blue shows our resources, and the light blue shows inventory or material that has not yet advanced to resource status. 
As you can see, both Callie and Auron have significant growth potential on top of the more than 5 million ounces of currently declared reserves and resources. As I'd just mentioned, Callie remains open at depth and much of Auron is still undrilled. We're excited about the drill results to date, which suggest that extensions are at a comparable thickness in grade with what we're already mining today. The mineralization is mainly free gold, which you can see in this photo.
Turning to Slide 24 for a closer look at the Federation Limb. Federation Limb was discovered in 2013 and is located in a structure that is parallel to Callie, where we are mining today. The discovery is significant in terms of potential size, grade and proximity to existing infrastructure. Federation's mineralization varies in thickness from 2 to 35 meters and in grades from 2 to 200 grams per tonne. We declared an initial resource of 0.5 million ounces at an average grade of 6.9 grams per tonne in 2014. This represents about 25% of the potential target, and we continue to see higher grades and open mineralization that will be further defined through in-fill drilling.
Finally, turning to Liberator on Slide 25. Liberator is a brand-new discovery made just this year located below Federation. Like Federation, Liberator is significant due to its potential size, grade and proximity to existing infrastructure. Liberator's mineralization varies in thickness from 2 to 40 meters and in grade from 2 to 30 grams of gold per tonne. We intend to further define the deposit and declare first resource at Liberator in 2016. We're excited about the potential for longer-term growth at Tanami and throughout our portfolio, where we're also prepared to weather headwinds.
Turning to Slide 26. We run our business to maintain flexibility in a variety of gold price environments and update our contingency plans on a regular basis. This chart gives you an idea of what we might do differently in a prolonged period of lower or higher gold price. Under significant pricing constraints, specific actions we would take include: Delaying stripping campaigns and sustaining capital expenditures; further reducing overhead and exploration costs; and deferring early-stage projects. 
Similarly, as gold prices improve, we'll maintain our cost and capital discipline, continue to advance our most promising projects and exploration prospects and look to accelerate our debt repayment. We are comfortable with how we've positioned the business and believe our success in getting our house in order and optimizing our portfolio and project pipeline is paying off. 
I'll wrap up my comments with a quick look at where we're taking Newmont in the future. Our goal is to be the most profitable and responsible gold mining company in the world. We will reach that goal by continuing to deliver our strategy to improve our underlying business by continuously raising our safety, cost and technical performance; to strengthen our portfolio by building a longer life, lower-cost asset base; and to create shareholder value by generating cash, paying dividends and continuing to strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet.

I'll take the first part here on Carlin and Boddington in terms of strip ratio because those are probably the 2 biggest drivers, with Carlin being the biggest. And I was just out there last week and have a pretty good handle on what's going on. I think the big difference has been we've had material that was originally characterized as waste that's now become ore. So that's a good thing in terms of mineral model, but it also results in lower stripping. So what we'd expected to be stripping as waste is now ore. That ore has a longer haul when -- and you've been out there. So taking it from the northern pit down to where the mill is does require a longer haul. So that's taking up the truck capacity and lower stripping. 
At Boddington, it's been changes to the mine plan that we implemented earlier this year and really the shape, and that's allowed us, not just for this year but going forward, to reduce some of the stripping. 
Twin Creeks, the question there was -- Chris Robison is going to address the Twin Creeks question."

We'll look at it the same way we do with all of our different options at different price scenarios to see what it makes sense, how it makes sense to bring it forward, how it makes sense to finance that particular investment because it's about 5 years of stripping. We're doing work with the team there to look at ways to maybe reduce that a bit and improve the cost profile and how we can drive things.

We're really focused on running our existing business well and delivering results. I think, as has been highlighted, continuing to deliver the results that we say we're going to, continuing to look at ways to improve the businesses is the way to earn the credibility of shareholders. As an industry, I think we've got different participants going after it in different ways. I think we'll see some that will do well and perform well through this price environment. We've got others that I'm sure will get challenged just by the nature of how they've gone across and gone after their cost improvement and efficiencies. We've really focused, over the last couple of years, with our board on what can be done to sustainably improve cost and efficiencies, not just do something that's flash in the pan for a year or 2. And I think that's just as important from a shareholder standpoint to look at it. So our discussions with shareholders, our discussion with our board, and we just completed those discussions here recently with our most recent board meeting, we're really focused on making sure we continue to deliver, stay within our strategy, make sure the foundation is going well, make sure we've got good financial capacity, keep an eye on the balance sheet, keep an eye on shareholder returns, as you saw with the dividend, that we believe we're positioned well to be able to pay that dividend even though it fell below our current guideline. And those are the sorts of things that we've been discussing and focusing on. 
I think in terms of the market, I've always been saying, keep an eye on both what's happening with ETS and what's happening in China. And I think the announcement last week on China came out as, unfortunately, a bit of a negative surprise. But quite frankly, there's an increase in gold reserves that China had, and the underlying fundamentals of demand in China for gold still remains strong. Last quarter was the fourth strongest quarter in gold demand in China. So I think that's good. I think India continues to play well in that. The overall potential headwinds that people see in the U.S. economy performance and interest rates sit out there. I think quite a bit of that, I would expect, is priced in. But I think where things go, actually getting some of those things to happen in terms of interest rate is finally moving. So the speculation stops and we move past that stage will be important. But we're in it for the long term. We want to make sure the business is positioned to work through the different swings, ups and downs and -- so we're not having to shoot from the hip and come up with short-term sort of approaches to addressing the business fundamentals. And I think we've really worked hard here at Newmont to make sure that we've positioned the business to survive well through these sorts of swings."

291795,312432704,885322,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Meredith, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Newmont delivered another strong quarter and I appreciate the opportunity to walk you through details now. Our operations continued to drive cause down, work more safely and increase",1165,"Thanks, Meredith, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Newmont delivered another strong quarter and I appreciate the opportunity to walk you through details now. Our operations continued to drive cause down, work more safely and increased gold and copper production compared to the prior-year quarter. This performance helped us double our operating cash flow, significantly improve adjusted EBITDA and deliver a 9-fold increase in free cash flow compared to last year, despite lower metal prices.
Our portfolio is also stronger than it was a year ago. We executed value accretive transactions and remain on track with our 4 development projects in the Americas. We also announced the decision to proceed with our Tanami Expansion project in Australia. Finally, we strengthened our balance sheet, made our commitment to pay dividends and repaid $50 million of debt. 
I'll turn to Slide 4 for a moment on these achievements. We continue to execute the 3 elements of our strategy: First, we improved our underlying business by lowering injury rates 15%, decreasing all-in sustaining costs 16%, and increasing gold production 16% quarter-on-quarter. We also tripled copper production. Second, we strengthened our portfolio by acquiring Cripple Creek & Victor as selling assets that represent lower value or higher risk to Newmont.
We remain on schedule and on or under budget at Turf Vent Shaft, Merian and Long Canyon Phase 1. We're also moving forward with our Tanami Expansion project, an investment that will increase profitable production and extend mine life at very competitive returns. 
Finally, we created shareholder value by generating $758 million in adjusted EBITDA and $478 million in free cash flow during the third quarter. This allowed us to continue to sell fund our best projects, pay dividends and pay down debt. Delevering our strategy starts at the mine phase. 
Turning to Slide 5. I visited her team earlier this month and was impressed with our newest operations performance. The team recently reached one-year working with 0 harm and is delivering exceptional business results. This is the bar we're sitting for all our operations. Overall, our total injury rates were 15% lower than the prior year quarter and remained among the lowest in the mining industry. This performance is overshadowed, however, by the loss of a contractor, working on a tree cutting team in Indonesia. Teddy was stuck in upper body by a falling tree and recently succumbed to his injuries. Our thoughts are with his family and his colleagues. Our work to make our operations safer and more efficient never ends. 
Turning to our cost performance on Slide 6. Our gold all-in sustaining costs were $835 per ounce, bringing our year-to-date cost to $864 per ounce. This represents a 27% reduction since 2012. About half the improvements we achieved in the third quarter as a result of sustainable cost and efficiency improvements across the portfolio and higher productivity and sales at low-cost operations. We also benefited from favorable oil price and exchange rates and some delayed timing in our capital expenditures. 
Turning to production on Slide 7. We produced more than 1.3 million attributable ounces of gold during the third quarter. This constitutes 16% more than the prior year quarter and our highest output in the last 7 quarters. New production from CC&V offset about 2/3 of the reductions associated with divestments. We also produced 48,000 tons of copper, mostly as a result of higher grades at Batu Hijau. Our Highway 4 operation that drove this performance. At Batu Hijau, third quarter production reflected higher ore grades, which will mine through 2017. At Boddington, mine plan and full potential improvements unlock higher grades and increase new utilization and recoveries. Tanami delivered strong production and on back of higher grade and improved productivity and also mill utilization, which were achieved through full potential. And finally, Twin Creeks, benefited from improved mill grades and the completion of plan stripping campaign. Putting it all together, our operations are doing good work to maximize opportunities and mitigate challenges. 
Turning to Slide 8. In North America, the Turf Vent Shaft remains unscheduled to reach commercial production in the fourth quarter and will be completed below budget. Engineering and mine development also remain on track at Long Canyon, where we continue to expect first production in 2017. You can see the Leach pad and other surface facilities in this photo. The CC&V integration is also progressing and the operation celebrated 5 million ounces of gold produced last month. Ramp up to full mill capacity slightly behind schedule, and we have adjusted our outlook accordingly. We're working out the bugs and the delay is not expected to impact longer-term production. 
Turning to South America. Merian remains on budget and on schedule to begin producing in 2016. Construction is just over 40% complete and we've stockpiled more than 930,000 tons of ore at higher than planned grades. We're also advancing Project Integral, a phased approach to developing remaining oxide and sulfur deposits and we will have a initial findings by mid 2016. In Africa, we're now operating at full capacity on grid power and new generations generators will be commissioned by year end. We're also advancing our broader power strategy to secure reliable and affordable supply over the long term.
In Indonesia, we expect our export to be renewed in near future and continue to work with the government to finalize amendments to our contract at work. In the meantime, we're operating in full capacity and storing concentrate or shipping it to for processing. In Australia, we've announced that we're moving forward with the Tanami Expansion project. 
Turning to Slide 9, since 2012, Tanami has more than doubled its gold production, cutting costs by about 2/3 and significantly improving resource confidence. The Tanami expansion project builds on this trajectory. It involves constructing a second decline in the underground mine and incremental capacity in the plant to increase profitable production and extend the mine life. The project is the outcome of a detailed review of options to maximize near-term cash flow and long-term asset value.
In the first 5 years of full production, the expansion will increase Tanami's average annual gold production by 80,000 ounces, while all-in sustaining costs by between 5% and 10% and extend mine life by 3 years. First production is expected in the second half of 2017. Adding a second decline will also serve as a platform for exploration drilling to support future expansions. As I mentioned last quarter, we see the potential to double current reserves and resources at comparable grades, by expanding the and Auron deposits and developing new discoveries at Federation and Liberator. We're excited about this project and what the team has done to optimize it. For investment between $100 million and $120 million, the project provides a return of more than 35%, at $1,100 gold and more than 25% at gold prices as low as $900 per ounce. 
With that, I will hand it over to Lori for an update on our financial results."
291795,312432704,885322,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Newmont delivered a great quarter with solid financial results. Turning to slide 11. As Gary mentioned, we continue to see cost improvement across the portfolio. Our third quarter gold",909,"Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Newmont delivered a great quarter with solid financial results. 
Turning to slide 11. As Gary mentioned, we continue to see cost improvement across the portfolio. Our third quarter gold cost applicable to sales per ounce and gold all-in sustaining costs per ounce were 14% and 16% favorable respectively, to the prior-year quarter. With these most recent results, we have maintained our portfolio all-in sustaining costs below $1,000 per ounce for the last 5 quarters running. Gold production was also strong in the quarter and was up 16% from the prior year.
Despite a 13% decline in the average realized gold price from a year ago, we continue to generate strong earnings and robust cash flow. 
Turning to slide 12, during the third quarter, revenue was up 16% and we generated $813 million in cash from continuing operations, an increase of more than 148% from the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was up 67% from the prior year, due to higher production at Batu Hijau, Boddington, Tanami and Twin Creeks, improved oil prices and exchange rates and ongoing cost and efficiency improvements. Consolidated free cash flow was $478 million during the third quarter as higher sales volumes and improved cost offset increased development capital spending at Merian and Long Canyon Phase 1. With these most recent results, our year-to-date free cash flow has grown to $941 million, an amount roughly 8x more than what was generated a year ago. We reported adjusted net income of $126 million in the third quarter or $0.23 per share compared to $249 million or $0.50 per share last year. 
Turning to slide 13. We walked through the adjusted net income adjustments, which include a $0.04 per share gain related to discontinued operations, a $0.10 per share gain related to the TMAC deconsolidation. In the past, we fully consolidated TMAC, but upon completion of their IPO, that is no longer required for accounting purposes. The results will not be included in our line-by-line numbers going forward, and instead will be captured in our equity income line. This gain was on the actual event of deconsolidation and we carved it out for purposes of adjusted net income. It also gave rise to a $0.05 per share gain, resulting from an adjustment to our tax valuation allowances. 
In the quarter, we also recognized $0.07 per share gain on asset sales, primarily our stake in Valcambi refinery. For adjusted net income purposes, we also carved out of $0.04 per share loss related to impairments and loss provisions, and a $0.03 per share loss is related to restructuring, acquisition cost and other minor items.
After reconciling for these items, we reported adjusted net income of $126 million or $0.23 per share. We're particularly pleased to note that this number includes $0.02 of accretion from the addition of to our portfolio for just 2 months. A similar outcome is seen in adjusted EBITDA of $758 million, up 67% from the prior year. It is adjusted for essentially the same unusual items. 
Now turning to slide 14. A strong balance sheet provides a competitive advantage in a volatile gold environment and we continue to execute on capital priorities designed to safeguard our investment grade ratings. At the end of the third quarter, our balance sheet had roughly $3 million in cash and cash equivalents in addition, we have about $400 million in marketable securities, and a $3 billion revolver that is essentially undrawn. In total, that's $6.4 billion of liquidity. This and our strong cash flow in 2015 gives us the comfort that we can start and finish our projects without having to take on additional debt to fund that. 
During the third quarter, we repaid $50 million of that towards the revolver. This brings our year-to-date total debt payment $330 million. We expect to pay down further debt later this year and are on track to repaid a total of $750 million by year end. As always, further payments will be made in context of the current business and market environment, but our significant cash balance certainly supports our ability to pay off additional debt. Given our existing cash balances and revolver, we have ample flexibility to execute on our capital priorities and are actively monitoring the gold price and the fixed income market to evaluate our options. We also maintained our dividend in light of our strong cash flow and operating performance. As a reminder, we have no significant debt maturities due until 2019, and our current net debt to book capital of 19% is well below the maximum 62.5% covenant on our revolver, which is our only covenant. 
And now, turning to slide 15. We are proud that our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of roughly 1.1% is among the lowest in the industry and has continued to improve. We have transformed Newmont's balance sheet into one of the strongest in sector and our liquidity and cash flow generation separate us from the competition. We have reduced our net debt by 32% from the prior year quarter. And more importantly, we have reduced net debt, while also growing our EBITDA, which significantly improves our financial flexibility. We remain comfortable with our relative level of debt and maturity profile and we will continue to examine ways to reduce the absolute debt level and increased the long-term strength of our business. 
And now, I will turn the call back over to Gary."

I'll shift gears now to look at the future. 
Turning to slide 17. We expect to end 2015 with attributable gold production at the higher end of our guidance range, which is between 4.7 million and 5.1 million ounces and copper products of between 140,000 tons in 180,000 tons. The changes we're making to our 2015 guidance are twofold. First, we are lowering our outlook for gold all-in sustaining costs 4% between $880 and $940. This reflects strong performance, particularly in Asia Pacific and Africa, as well as lower exchange rates in favorable power and diesel prices. We expect these cost to rise slightly in the fourth quarter due to higher exploration and advanced project spending, sustaining capital timing and lower grades at Yanacocha. Second we lowered our full year outlook for capital expenditures by about 9%, between $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. This reduction reflects lower sustaining capital expenditures of between $740 million and $780 million or 13% below previous guidance. Again, cost efficiency improvements at Yanacocha, Boddington, Batu Hijau, Ahafo Akyem as well as some timing impacts. Our improved outlook also deflects lower development capital, including $50 million in savings at Merian, realized through supply-chain improvements, favorable exchange rates and lower commodity prices. This reduction is partially offset by new development capital for the Tanami Expansion project. Our project pipeline continues to be one of the strongest in the gold sector. 
Turning to slide 18. Our projects focus on profitably extending the life of our existing operations, we are to opening perspective new mining districts. Before we reach funding decisions, we scrutinize our approach to each project with a goal to lower initial capital cost, accelerate payback and leverage existing infrastructure. Projects that are in the execution phase include that Turf Vent Shaft, which will give us access to be between 100,000 and 150,000 ounces of higher grade ore per year and support for the expansion at Leeville. Merian, which will deliver 400,000 to 500,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of between $650 to $750 per ounce for the first 5 years beginning in 2016.
The Cripple Creek & Victor expansion, which includes the New mill, leach pad and recovery plant that will be commissioned in second half of 2016. CC&V will contribute between 350,000 and 400,000 ounces of gold in 2016 and 2017 and is expected to lower Newmont's overall cost profile. The first phase of Long Canyon, which will add between 100,000 ounces of gold and 150,000 ounces of gold per year at all-in sustaining costs of between $500 and $600 per ounce beginning in 2017. And finally, the Tanami Expansion project, which I touched on earlier. Further up the pipeline, we're advancing the Ahafo Mill Expansion in Subika underground mine in Ghana. These projects are design to help offset the impact of lower grades and harder we have deferred the decision to proceed with the Ahafo Mill Expansion until the second half of next year to coincide with our timing on the Subika Underground decision.
We're also progressing the phase 7 cutback at Batu Hijau, where we are working to secure the stability we need for ongoing investment. Quecher Main, which is part of the oxide expansion effort in Yanacocha. And Northwest Exodus in Nevada, which would extend the current underground operation and add profitable production. 
Turning to exploration on slide 19. Exploration is one of our core competencies. About 70% of the Board their mining in 2015 was discovered by Newmont geologists. Our program focuses on maintaining our existing resource base, while preserving options to pursue significant new discoveries. We employ rigorous standards to make sure the highest-quality ounces are added to our reserve base and we've developed proprietary geologic risk assessment project to improve our orebody confidence. This map shows prospects in Nevada, Peru, Ghana and Australia that we expect to be in production before 2020. And longer term prospects in the U.S., Ethiopia and the Guiana Shield.
Turning to slide 20 for a closer look at our underground prospects that Exodus in Nevada. Exodus is a high-grade underground old body that was identified in 2008 with 300,000 ounce discovery. Through new discoveries at Northwest Exodus in 2011 and Exodus Footwall in 2013, we've grown the resource base to 1.2 million ounces to date, of which 300,000 ounces have been mined. We see the potential to double this figure over the next few years by converting mineral inventory into reserves and resource, and by drilling the remaining half of Exodus' targeted mineralization. 
Turning to slide 21. Northwest Exodus is located several hundred meters from Exodus. We declared a main resource of 700,000 ounces in 2014, and expect to declare first results in early 2016. Compared to our initial Exodus discovery, Northwest Exodus is larger with 50% higher grades, mineralization remains open on the hanging wall.
Turning to slide 22. the exodus Footwall is our latest discovery and is located in different stratigraphy than Exodus in Northwest Exodus. We recently identified mineralization of upto 51 meters at grades of 12.5 grams ton and the footwall remains open along strike and at depth. We anticipate declaring first resource at Exodus Footwall in early 2016. While we intend to pursue these opportunities, we're also prepared for a ongoing market volatility. 
Turning to slide 23. At today's metal prices, we can afford to advance our best projects and exploration projects, fund our dividends and repay debt. This chart gives you an idea of what maybe might do differently in a prolonged period of lower or higher gold prices. Under significant constraints, we would delay stepping campaigns and sustain capital, we complete our current projects and further reduce overhead and exploration cost. As gold price improves, we will continue to optimize cost in capital, fund our most profitable projects, accelerate debt repayment and increase dividend in line with our policy. Getting our house in order now allows us to deliver superior margins when gold price recovers. 
Turning to slide 24. We're continuing to make good progress toward our goal to become the world's most profitable and reliable gold producer. We will reach that goal by continuing to deliver our strategy to improve our underlying business, by continuously raising our safety, cost and technical performance to strengthen our portfolio by building a longer life, lower-cost asset base and to create shareholder value by generating cash, paying dividends and strengthening our investment grade balance sheet. Thank you for your time.

We don't see ourselves changing that hedge position or increasing it quite frankly. We've seen a good correlation between gold price and the Aussie dollars, not really that drives anything, but we don't see any need to make a change in our position on the foreign exchange rate hedging. When it comes to the diesel fuel, we basically do that in Nevada, because of the ability for us to take hedge accounting and we're not taking a position on where the price will go.

I'm pleased to report that Newmont delivered another strong quarter, and I appreciate the opportunity to walk you through details now. Our operations continued to drive cost down, work more safely and increase",1171,"Thanks, Meredith, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Newmont delivered another strong quarter, and I appreciate the opportunity to walk you through details now. Our operations continued to drive cost down, work more safely and increase gold and copper production compared to the prior year quarter. This performance helped us double our operating cash flow, significantly improve adjusted EBITDA and deliver a 9-fold increase in free cash flow compared to last year, despite lower metal prices.
Our portfolio is also stronger than it was a year ago. We executed value accretive transactions, and remained on track with our 4 development projects in the Americas. We also announced the decision to proceed with our Tanami Expansion project in Australia. Finally, we strengthened our balance sheet, met our commitment to pay dividends and repaid $50 million of debt. 
I'll turn to Slide 4 for a moment on these achievements. We continue to execute the 3 elements of our strategy. First, we improved our underlying business by lowering injury rates 15%, decreasing all-in sustaining costs 16% and increasing gold production 16% quarter-on-quarter. We also tripled copper production.
Second, we strengthened our portfolio by acquiring Cripple Creek & Victor and selling assets that represent lower value or higher risk to Newmont. We remain on schedule and on or under budget at Turf Vent Shaft, Merian and Long Canyon Phase 1. We're also moving forward with our Tanami Expansion project, an investment that will increase profitable production and extend mine life at very competitive returns. 
Finally, we created shareholder value by generating $758 million in adjusted EBITDA and $478 million in free cash flow during the third quarter. This allowed us to continue to sell fund our best projects, pay dividends and pay down debt.
Delevering our strategy starts at the mine phase. Turning to Slide 5. I visited the team earlier this month and was impressed with our newest operations performance. The team recently reached 1 year working with 0 harm, and is delivering exceptional business results. This is the bar we're setting for all our operations.
Overall, our total injury rates were 15% lower than the prior year quarter and remained among the lowest in the mining industry. This performance is overshadowed, however, by the loss of a contractor working on a tree-cutting team in Indonesia. [indiscernible] was stuck in upper body by a falling tree and recently succumbed to his injuries. Our thoughts are with his family and his colleagues. Our work to make our operations safer and more efficient never ends. 
Turning to our cost performance on Slide 6. Our gold all-in sustaining costs were $835 per ounce, bringing our year-to-date cost to $864 per ounce. This represents a 27% reduction since 2012, about half the improvements we achieved in the third quarter as a result of sustainable cost and efficiency improvements across the portfolio and higher productivity and sales at low-cost operations. We also benefited from favorable oil price and exchange rates and some delayed timing in our capital expenditures. 
Turning to production on Slide 7. We produced more than 1.3 million attributable ounces of gold during the third quarter. This constitutes 16% more than the prior year quarter, and our highest output in the last 7 quarters. New production from CC&V offset about 2/3 of the reductions associated with divestments. We also produced 48,000 tons of copper, mostly as a result of higher grades at Batu Hijau. I'll highlight 4 operation that drove this performance.
At Batu Hijau, third quarter production reflected higher Phase 6 ore grades, which we'll mine through 2017. At Boddington, mine plan and full potential improvements unlock higher grades and increased new utilization and recoveries. Tanami delivered strong production, and on back of higher grade and improved productivity and also mill utilization, which were achieved through full potential. And finally, Twin Creeks, benefited from improved mill grades and the completion of planned stripping campaign. Putting it all together, our operations are doing good work to maximize opportunities and mitigate challenges. 
Turning to Slide 8. In North America, the Turf Vent Shaft remains on schedule to reach commercial production in the fourth quarter, and will be completed below budget. Engineering and mine development also remain on track at Long Canyon, where we continue to expect first production in 2017. You can see the leach pad and other surface facilities in this photo.
The CC&V integration is also progressing, and the operation celebrated 5 million ounces of gold produced last month. Ramp up to full-mill capacity is slightly behind schedule, and we've adjusted our outlook accordingly. We're working out the bugs and the delay is not expected to impact longer-term production. 
Turning to South America. Merian remains on budget and on schedule to begin producing in 2016. Construction is just over 40% complete and we've stockpiled more than 930,000 tons of ore at higher than planned grades. We're also advancing Project Integral, a phased approach to developing Yanacocha's remaining oxide and sulfide deposits, and we'll have initial findings by mid-2016.
In Africa, we're now operating at full capacity on grid power and Ahafo's new generators will be commissioned by year end. We're also advancing our broader power strategy to secure reliable and affordable supply over the long term.
In Indonesia, we expect our export permit to be renewed in near future and continue to work with the government to finalize amendments to our contract at work. In the meantime, we're operating in full capacity and storing concentrate or shipping it Gresik to for processing. In Australia, we've announced that we're moving forward with the Tanami Expansion project. 
Turning to Slide 9. Since 2012, Tanami has more than doubled its gold production, while cutting costs by about 2/3 and significantly improving resource confidence. The Tanami Expansion project builds on this trajectory. It involves constructing a second decline in the underground mine and incremental capacity in the plant to increase profitable production and extend the mine life.
The project is the outcome of a detailed review of options to maximize near-term cash flow and long-term asset value. In the first 5 years of full production, the expansion will increase Tanami's average annual gold production by 80,000 ounces, lower all-in sustaining costs by between 5% and 10% and extend mine life by 3 years. First production is expected in the second half of 2017.
Adding a second decline will also serve as a platform for exploration drilling to support future expansions. As I mentioned last quarter, we see the potential to double current reserves and resources at comparable grades, by expanding the Callie and Auron deposits, and developing new discoveries at Federation and Liberator.
We're excited about this project and what the team has done to optimize it. For an investment of between $100 million and $120 million, the project provides a return of more than 35%, at $1,100 gold and more than 25% at gold prices as low as $900 per ounce. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Laurie for an update on our financial results."
291795,312432704,885690,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Newmont delivered a great quarter with solid financial results. Turning to slide 11. As Gary mentioned, we continue to see cost improvement across the portfolio. Our third quarter gold",910,"Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Newmont delivered a great quarter with solid financial results. 
Turning to slide 11. As Gary mentioned, we continue to see cost improvement across the portfolio. Our third quarter gold cost applicable to sales per ounce and gold all-in sustaining costs per ounce were 14% and 16% favorable, respectively, to the prior year quarter. With these most recent results, we have maintained our portfolio all-in sustaining costs below $1,000 per ounce for the last 5 quarters running. Gold production was also strong in the quarter and was up 16% from the prior year. Despite a 13% decline in the average realized gold price from a year ago, we continue to generate strong earnings and robust cash flow. 
Turning to slide 12. During the third quarter, revenue was up 16% and we generated $813 million in cash from continuing operations, an increase of more than 148% from the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was up 67% from the prior year, due to higher production at Batu Hijau, Boddington, Tanami and Twin Creeks, improved oil prices and exchange rates and ongoing cost and efficiency improvements.
Consolidated free cash flow was $478 million during the third quarter as higher sales volumes and improved cost offset increased development capital spending at Merian and Long Canyon Phase 1. With these most recent results, our year-to-date free cash flow has grown to $941 million, an amount roughly 8x more than what was generated a year ago. We reported adjusted net income of $126 million in the third quarter or $0.23 per share, compared to $249 million or $0.50 per share last year. 
Turning to slide 13, we'll walked through the adjusted net income adjustments, which include a $0.04 per share gain related to discontinued operations, a $0.10 per share gain related to the TMAC deconsolidation. In the past, we fully consolidated TMAC, but upon completion of their IPO, that is no longer required for accounting purposes. Their results will not be included in our line-by-line numbers going forward, and instead will be captured in our equity income line. This gain was on the actual event of deconsolidation and we carved it out for purposes of adjusted net income. It also gave rise to a $0.05 per share gain, resulting from an adjustment to our tax valuation allowances. 
In the quarter, we also recognized a $0.07 per share gain on asset sales, primarily our stake in Valcambi refinery. For adjusted net income purposes, we also carved out of $0.04 per share loss related to impairments and loss provisions, and a $0.03 per share loss is related to restructuring, acquisition costs and other minor items.
After reconciling for these items, we reported adjusted net income of $126 million or $0.23 per share. We're particularly pleased to note that this number includes $0.02 of accretion from the addition of CC&V to our portfolio for just a short 2 months. A similar outcome is seen in adjusted EBITDA of $758 million, up 67% from the prior year. It is adjusted for essentially the same unusual items. 
Now turning to slide 14. A strong balance sheet provides a competitive advantage in a volatile gold price environment, and we continue to execute on capital priorities designed to safeguard our investment-grade ratings. At the end of the third quarter, our balance sheet had roughly $3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we had about $400 million in marketable securities and a $3 billion revolver that is essentially undrawn. In total, that's $6.4 billion of liquidity. This and our strong cash flow in 2015 gives us the comfort that we can start and finish our projects without having to take on additional debt to fund them. 
During the third quarter, we repaid $50 million of debt toward the PTNNT revolver. This brings our year-to-date total debt payments $330 million. We expect to pay down further debt later this year and are on track to repay a total of $750 million by year-end. As always, further payments will be made in context of the current business and market environment, but our significant cash balance certainly supports our ability to pay off additional debt. 
Given our existing cash balances and revolver, we have ample flexibility to execute on our capital priorities and are actively monitoring the gold price and the fixed income market to evaluate our options. We also maintained our dividend in light of our strong cash flow and operating performance. As a reminder, we have no significant debt maturities due until 2019, and our current net-debt-to-book capital of 19% is well below the maximum 62.5% covenant on our revolver, which is our only covenant. 
And now, turning to slide 15. We're proud that our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of roughly 1.1% is among the lowest in the industry and has continued to improve. We have transformed Newmont's balance sheet into one of the strongest in the sector, and our liquidity and cash flow generation separate us from the competition. We have reduced our net debt by 32% from the prior year quarter. And more importantly, we have reduced net debt, while also growing our EBITDA, which significantly improved our financial flexibility. We remain comfortable with our relative level of debt and maturity profile and we will continue to examine ways to reduce the absolute debt level and increase the long-term strength of our business. 
And now, I'll turn the call back over to Gary."

I'll shift gears now to look at the future, turning to slide 17. We expect to end 2015 with attributable gold production at the higher end of our guidance range, which is between 4.7 million and 5.1 million ounces, and copper products of b",1098,"Thanks, Laurie. I'll shift gears now to look at the future, turning to slide 17. We expect to end 2015 with attributable gold production at the higher end of our guidance range, which is between 4.7 million and 5.1 million ounces, and copper products of between 140,000 and 180,000 tons. The changes we're making to our 2015 guidance are twofold. 
First, we're looking -- we're lowering our outlook for gold all-in sustaining costs 4% to between $880 and $940. This reflects strong performance, particularly in Asia Pacific and Africa, as well as lower exchange rates in favorable power and diesel prices. We expect these costs to rise slightly in the fourth quarter due to higher exploration and advanced project spending, sustaining capital timing and lower grades at Yanacocha and Ahafo.
Second, we lowered our full year outlook for capital expenditure by about 9% to between $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion. This reduction reflects lower sustaining capital expenditures of between $740 million and $780 million or 13% below previous guidance, gained through cost and efficiency improvements at Yanacocha, Boddington, Batu Hijau, Ahafo and Akyem as well as some timing impacts. Our improved outlook also deflects lower development capital, including $50 million in savings at Merian, realized through supply-chain improvements, favorable exchange rates and lower commodity prices. This reduction is partially offset by new development capital for the Tanami Expansion project.
Our project pipeline continues to be one of the strongest in the gold sector. Turning to slide 18. Our projects focus on profitably extending the life of our existing operations or opening perspective new mining districts. Before we reach funding decisions, we scrutinize our approach to each project with a goal to lower initial capital cost, accelerate payback and leverage existing infrastructure. 
Projects that are in the execution phase include the Turf Vent Shaft, which will give us access to be between 100,000 and 150,000 ounces of higher-grade ore per year and support for the expansion at Leeville. Merian, which will deliver 400,000 to 500,000 ounces of gold and all-in sustaining costs of between $650 to $750 per ounce for the first 5 years beginning in 2016. The Cripple Creek & Victor expansion, which includes the new mill, leach pad and recovery plant that will be commissioned in second half of 2016. CC&V will contribute between 350,000 and 400,000 ounces of gold in 2016 and 2017 and is expected to lower Newmont's overall cost profile.
The first phase of Long Canyon, which will add between 100,000 ounces of gold production per year and 150,000 ounces of gold per year at all-in sustaining costs of between $500 and $600 per ounce beginning in 2017. And finally, the Tanami Expansion project, which I touched on earlier. Further up the pipeline, we're advancing the Ahafo mill expansion in Subika underground mine in Ghana. These projects are designed to help offset the impact of lower grades and harder ore. We have deferred the decision to proceed with the Ahafo mill expansion until the second half of next year to coincide with our timing on the Subika underground decision.
We're also progressing the Phase 7 cutback at Batu Hijau, where we are working to secure the stability we need for ongoing investment; Quecher Main, which is part of the oxide expansion effort in Yanacocha; and Northwest Exodus in Nevada, which would extend the current underground operation and add profitable production. 
Turning to exploration on Slide 19. Exploration is one of our core competencies. About 70% of the gold we're mining in 2015 was discovered by Newmont geologists. Our program focuses on maintaining our existing resource base, while preserving options to pursue significant new discoveries. We employ rigorous standards to make sure the highest-quality ounces are added to our reserve base, and we've developed a proprietary geologic risk assessment project to improve our orebody confidence. This map shows prospects in Nevada, Peru, Ghana and Australia that we expect to be in production before 2020, and longer term prospects in the U.S., Ethiopia and the Guiana Shield.
Turning to slide 20, for a closer look at our underground prospects that Exodus in Nevada. Exodus is a high-grade underground orebody that was identified in 2008, with a 300,000-ounce discovery. Through new discoveries at Northwest Exodus in 2011 and Exodus Footwall in 2013, we've grown the resource base to 1.2 million ounces to date, of which 300,000 ounces have been mined. We see the potential to double this figure over the next few years by converting mineral inventory into reserves and resource, and by drilling the remaining half of Exodus' targeted mineralization. 
Turning to slide 21. Northwest Exodus is located several hundred meters from Exodus. We declared a main resource of 700,000 ounces in 2014, and expect to declare first reserves in early 2016. Compared to our initial Exodus discovery, Northwest Exodus is larger, with 50% higher grades, mineralization remains open on the hanging wall.
Turning to slide 22. the Exodus Footwall is our latest high-grade discovery, and is located in different stratigraphy than Exodus and Northwest Exodus. We recently identified mineralization of up to 51 meters at grades of 12.5 grams per ton and the footwall remains open along strike and at depth. We anticipate declaring first resource at Exodus Footwall in early 2016. While we intend to pursue these opportunities, we're also prepared for ongoing market volatility. 
Turning to slide 23. At today's metal prices, we can afford to advance our best projects and exploration projects -- or prospects, fund our dividends and repay debt. This chart gives you an idea of what we might do differently in a prolonged period of lower or higher gold prices. Under significant constraints, we would delay stripping campaigns and sustain capital. We complete our current projects and further reduce overhead and exploration cost. As gold price improves, we will continue to optimize cost in capital, fund our most profitable projects, accelerate debt repayment and increase dividend in line with our policy. Getting our house in order now allows us to deliver superior margins when gold price recovers. 
Turning to slide 24. We're continuing to make good progress toward our goal to become the world's most profitable and reliable gold producer. We will reach that goal by continuing to deliver our strategy to improve our underlying business, by continuously raising our safety, cost and technical performance to strengthen our portfolio by building a longer life, lower-cost asset base and to create shareholder value by generating cash, paying dividends and strengthening our investment grade balance sheet. Thank you for your time.

We've seen a good correlation between gold price and the Aussie dollar, not that, that clearly drives anything, but we don't see any need to make a change in our position on the foreign exchange rate hedging. When it comes to the diesel fuel, we basically do that in Nevada, because of the ability for us to take hedge accounting. And we're not taking a position on where the price will go, it's just we do it in order to try to smooth out what the price swings might be.

Our mine planning folks and technical folks continue to look at it, but we're optimistic that we can do that. I think the other piece of it is, while we talk about the mill, the new value leach is going very well. Our team is very confident that we can bring that in on time or a bit ahead of schedule and comfortable with cost there. So while the focus a bit on the mill, the heart of the operation is the valley leach, and that's going very well, early stage with our folks coming on and taking that over."

I'm pleased to report that Newmont delivered another strong quarter, and I appreciate the opportunity to walk you through the details now. Our operations continued to drive cost down, work more safely and increase gold and copper production compared to the prior year quarter. This performance helped us double our operating cash flow, significantly improve adjusted EBITDA and deliver a 9-fold increase in free cash flow compared to last year, despite lower metal prices.
Our portfolio is also stronger than it was a year ago. We executed value accretive transactions, and remained on track with our 4 development projects in the Americas. We also announced the decision to proceed with our Tanami Expansion project in Australia. Finally, we strengthened our balance sheet, met our commitment to pay dividends and repaid $50 million of debt. 
I'll turn to Slide 4 for more on these achievements. We continue to execute the 3 elements of our strategy. First, we improved our underlying business by lowering injury rates 15%, decreasing all-in sustaining costs 16% and increasing gold production 16% quarter-on-quarter. We also tripled copper production.
Second, we strengthened our portfolio by acquiring Cripple Creek & Victor and selling assets that represent lower value or higher risk to Newmont. We remain on schedule and on or under budget at Turf Vent Shaft, Merian and Long Canyon Phase 1. We're also moving forward with our Tanami Expansion project, an investment that will increase profitable production and extend mine life at very competitive returns. 
Finally, we created shareholder value by generating $758 million in adjusted EBITDA and $478 million in free cash flow during the third quarter. This allowed us to continue to sell fund our best projects, pay dividends and pay down debt.
Delivering our strategy starts at the mine phase. Turning to Slide 5. I visited the team earlier this month and was impressed with our newest operations performance. The team recently reached 1 year working with 0 harm, and is delivering exceptional business results. This is the bar we're setting for all our operations.
Overall, our total injury rates were 15% lower than the prior year quarter and remained among the lowest in the mining industry. This performance is overshadowed, however, by the loss of a contractor working on a tree-cutting team in Indonesia. [indiscernible]Hack Mastar Teddy was struck in upper body by a falling tree and recently succumbed to his injuries. Our thoughts are with his family and his colleagues. Our work to make our operations safer and more efficient never ends. 
Turning to our cost performance on Slide 6. Our gold all-in sustaining costs were $835 per ounce for the quarter, bringing our year-to-date cost to $864 per ounce. This represents a 27% reduction since 2012, about half the improvements we achieved in the third quarter as a result of sustainable cost and efficiency improvements across the portfolio and higher productivity and sales at low-cost operations. We also benefited from favorable oil price and exchange rates and some delayed timing in our capital expenditures. 
Turning to production on Slide 7. We produced more than 1.3 million attributable ounces of gold during the third quarter. This constitutes 16% more than the prior year quarter, and our highest output in the last 7 quarters. New production from CC&V offset about 2/3 of the reductions associated with divestments. We also produced 48,000 tons of copper, mostly as a result of higher grades at Batu Hijau. I'll highlight 4 operation that drove this performance.
At Batu Hijau, third quarter production reflected higher Phase 6 ore grades, which we'll mine through 2017. At Boddington, mine plan and full potential improvements unlock higher grades and increased new utilization and recoveries. Tanami delivered strong production, and on the back of higher grade and improved productivity and also mill utilization, which were achieved through full potential. And finally, Twin Creeks, benefited from improved mill grades and the completion of a planned stripping campaign. Putting it all together, our operations are doing good work to maximize opportunities and mitigate challenges. 
Turning to Slide 8. In North America, the Turf Vent Shaft remains on schedule to reach commercial production in the fourth quarter, and will be completed below budget. Engineering and mine development also remain on track at Long Canyon, where we continue to expect first production in 2017. You can see the leach pad and other surface facilities in this photo.
The CC&V integration is also progressing, and the operation celebrated 5 million ounces of gold produced last month. Ramp up to full-mill capacity is slightly behind schedule, and we've adjusted our outlook accordingly. We're working out the bugs and the delay is not expected to impact longer-term production. 
Turning to South America. Merian remains on budget and on schedule to begin producing in 2016. Construction is just over 40% complete and we've stockpiled more than 930,000 tons of ore at higher than planned grades. We're also advancing Project Integral, a phased approach to developing Yanacocha's remaining oxide and sulfide deposits, and we'll have initial findings by mid-2016.
In Africa, we're now operating at full capacity on grid power and Ahafo's new generators will be commissioned by year end. We're also advancing our broader power strategy to secure reliable and affordable supply over the long term.
In Indonesia, we expect our export permit to be renewed in the near future and continue to work with the government to finalize amendments to our contract at work. In the meantime, we're operating at full capacity and storing concentrate or shipping it Gresik to for processing. In Australia, we've announced that we're moving forward with the Tanami Expansion project. 
Turning to Slide 9. Since 2012, Tanami has more than doubled its gold production, while cutting costs by about 2/3 and significantly improving resource confidence. The Tanami Expansion project builds on this trajectory. It involves constructing a second decline in the underground mine and incremental capacity in the plant to increase profitable production and extend the mine life.
The project is the outcome of a detailed review of options to maximize near-term cash flow and long-term asset value. In the first 5 years of full production, the expansion will increase Tanami's average annual gold production by 80,000 ounces, lower all-in sustaining costs by between 5% and 10% and extend mine life by 3 years. First production is expected in the second half of 2017.
Adding a second decline will also serve as a platform for exploration drilling to support future expansions. As I mentioned last quarter, we see the potential to double current reserves and resources at comparable grades, by expanding the Callie and Auron deposits, and developing new discoveries at Federation and Liberator.
We're excited about this project and what the team has done to optimize it. For an investment of between $100 million and $120 million, the project provides a return of more than 35%, at $1,100 gold and more than 25% at gold prices as low as $900 per ounce. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Laurie for an update on our financial results."
291795,312432704,885859,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Newmont delivered a great quarter with solid financial results. Turning to slide 11. As Gary mentioned, we continue to see cost improvement across the portfolio. Our third quarter gold",910,"Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Newmont delivered a great quarter with solid financial results. 
Turning to slide 11. As Gary mentioned, we continue to see cost improvement across the portfolio. Our third quarter gold cost applicable to sales per ounce and gold all-in sustaining costs per ounce were 14% and 16% favorable, respectively, to the prior year quarter. With these most recent results, we have maintained our portfolio all-in sustaining costs below $1,000 per ounce for the last 5 quarters running. Gold production was also strong in the quarter and was up 16% from the prior year. Despite a 13% decline in the average realized gold price from a year ago, we continue to generate strong earnings and robust cash flow. 
Turning to slide 12. During the third quarter, revenue was up 16% and we generated $813 million in cash from continuing operations, an increase of more than 148% from the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was up 67% from the prior year, due to higher production at Batu Hijau, Boddington, Tanami and Twin Creeks, improved oil prices and exchange rates and ongoing cost and efficiency improvements.
Consolidated free cash flow was $478 million during the third quarter as higher sales volumes and improved cost offset increased development capital spending at Merian and Long Canyon Phase 1. With these most recent results, our year-to-date free cash flow has grown to $941 million, an amount roughly 8x more than what was generated a year ago. We reported adjusted net income of $126 million in the third quarter or $0.23 per share, compared to $249 million or $0.50 per share last year. 
Turning to slide 13, we walked through the adjusted net income adjustments, which include a $0.04 per share gain related to discontinued operations, a $0.10 per share gain related to the TMAC deconsolidation. In the past, we fully consolidated TMAC, but upon completion of their IPO, that is no longer required for accounting purposes. Their results will not be included in our line-by-line numbers going forward, and instead will be captured in our equity income line. This gain was on the actual event of deconsolidation and we carved it out for purposes of adjusted net income. It also gave rise to a $0.05 per share gain, resulting from an adjustment to our tax valuation allowances. 
In the quarter, we also recognized a $0.07 per share gain on asset sales, primarily our stake in the Valcambi refinery. For adjusted net income purposes, we also carved out of $0.04 per share loss related to impairments and loss provisions, and a $0.03 per share loss related to restructuring, acquisition costs and other minor items.
After reconciling for these items, we reported adjusted net income of $126 million or $0.23 per share. We're particularly pleased to note that this number includes $0.02 of accretion from the addition of CC&V to our portfolio for just a short 2 months. A similar outcome is seen in adjusted EBITDA of $758 million, up 67% from the prior year. It is adjusted for essentially the same unusual items. 
Now turning to slide 14. A strong balance sheet provides a competitive advantage in a volatile gold price environment, and we continue to execute on capital priorities designed to safeguard our investment-grade rating. At the end of the third quarter, our balance sheet had roughly $3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we had about $400 million in marketable securities and a $3 billion revolver that is essentially undrawn. In total, that's $6.4 billion of liquidity. This and our strong cash flow in 2015 gives us the comfort that we can start and finish our projects without having to take on additional debt to fund them. 
During the third quarter, we repaid $50 million of debt toward the PTNNT revolver. This brings our year-to-date total debt payments $330 million. We expect to pay down further debt later this year and are on track to repay a total of $750 million by year-end. As always, further payments will be made in context of the current business and market environment, but our significant cash balance certainly supports our ability to pay off additional debt. 
Given our existing cash balances and revolver, we have ample flexibility to execute on our capital priorities and are actively monitoring the gold price and the fixed income market to evaluate our options. We also maintained our dividend in light of our strong cash flow and operating performance. As a reminder, we have no significant debt maturities due until 2019, and our current net-debt-to-book capital of 19% is well below the maximum 62.5% covenant on our revolver, which is our only covenant. 
And now, turning to slide 15. We're proud that our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of roughly 1.1% is among the lowest in the industry and has continued to improve. We have transformed Newmont's balance sheet into one of the strongest in the sector, and our liquidity and cash flow generation separate us from the competition. We have reduced our net debt by 32% from the prior year quarter. And more importantly, we have reduced net debt, while also growing our EBITDA, which significantly improved our financial flexibility. We remain comfortable with our relative level of debt and maturity profile and we will continue to examine ways to reduce the absolute debt level and increase the long-term strength of our business. 
And now, I'll turn the call back over to Gary."

I'll shift gears now to look at the future, turning to slide 17. We expect to end 2015 with attributable gold production at the higher end of our guidance range, which is between 4.7 million and 5.1 million ounces, and copper products of b",1095,"Thanks, Laurie. I'll shift gears now to look at the future, turning to slide 17. We expect to end 2015 with attributable gold production at the higher end of our guidance range, which is between 4.7 million and 5.1 million ounces, and copper products of between 140,000 and 180,000 tons. The changes we're making to our 2015 guidance are twofold. 
First, we're looking -- we're lowering our outlook for gold all-in sustaining costs 4% to between $880 and $940 per ounce. This reflects strong performance, particularly in Asia Pacific and Africa, as well as lower exchange rates in favorable power and diesel prices. We expect these costs to rise slightly in the fourth quarter due to higher exploration and advanced project spending, sustaining capital timing and lower grades at Yanacocha and Ahafo.
Second, we lowered our full year outlook for capital expenditure by about 9% to between $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion. This reduction reflects lower sustaining capital expenditures of between $740 million and $780 million or 13% below previous guidance, gained through cost and efficiency improvements at Yanacocha, Boddington, Batu Hijau, Ahafo and Akyem as well as some timing impacts. Our improved outlook also deflects lower development capital, including $50 million in savings at Merian, realized through supply-chain improvements, favorable exchange rates and lower commodity prices. This reduction is partially offset by new development capital for the Tanami Expansion project.
Our project pipeline continues to be one of the strongest in the gold sector. Turning to slide 18. Our projects focus on profitably extending the life of our existing operations or opening perspective new mining districts. Before we reach funding decisions, we scrutinize our approach to each project with a goal to lower initial capital cost, accelerate payback and leverage existing infrastructure. 
Projects that are in the execution phase include the Turf Vent Shaft, which will give us access to be between 100,000 and 150,000 ounces of higher-grade ore per year and support further expansion at Leeville. Merian, which will deliver 400,000 to 500,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of between $650 to $750 per ounce for the first 5 years beginning in 2016. The Cripple Creek & Victor expansion, which includes the new mill, leach pad and recovery plant that will be commissioned in second half of 2016. CC&V will contribute between 350,000 and 400,000 ounces of gold in 2016 and '17 and is expected to lower Newmont's overall cost profile.
The first phase of Long Canyon, which will add between 100,000 and 150,000 ounces of gold production per year at all-in sustaining costs of between $500 and $600 per ounce beginning in 2017. And finally, the Tanami Expansion project, which I touched on earlier. Further up the pipeline, we're advancing the Ahafo mill expansion and Subika underground mine in Ghana. These projects are designed to help offset the impact of lower grades and harder ore. We have deferred the decision to proceed with the Ahafo mill expansion until the second half of next year to coincide with our timing on the Subika underground decision.
We're also progressing the Phase 7 cutback at Batu Hijau, where we are working to secure the stability we need for ongoing investment; Quecher Main, which is part of the oxide expansion effort in Yanacocha; and Northwest Exodus in Nevada, which would extend the current underground operation and add profitable production. 
Turning to exploration on Slide 19. Exploration is one of our core competencies. About 70% of the gold we're mining in 2015 was discovered by Newmont geologists. Our program focuses on maintaining our existing resource base, while preserving options to pursue significant new discoveries. We employ rigorous standards to make sure the highest-quality ounces are added to our reserve base, and we've developed a proprietary geologic risk assessment process to improve our orebody confidence. This map shows prospects in Nevada, Peru, Ghana and Australia that we expect to be in production before 2020, and longer term prospects in the U.S., Ethiopia and the Guiana Shield.
Turning to slide 20, for a closer look at our underground prospects at Exodus in Nevada. Exodus is a high-grade underground orebody that was identified in 2008, with a 300,000 ounce discovery. Through new discoveries at Northwest Exodus in 2011 and Exodus Footwall in 2013, we've grown the resource base to 1.2 million ounces to date, of which 300,000 ounces have been mined. We see the potential to double this figure over the next few years by converting mineral inventory into reserves and resource, and by drilling the remaining half of Exodus' targeted mineralization. 
Turning to slide 21. Northwest Exodus is located several hundred meters from Exodus. We declared a main resource of 700,000 ounces in 2014, and expect to declare first reserves in early 2016. Compared to our initial Exodus discovery, Northwest Exodus is larger, with 50% higher grades, mineralization remains open on the Hanging Wall.
Turning to slide 22. the Exodus Footwall is our latest high-grade discovery, and is located in different stratigraphy than Exodus and Northwest Exodus. We recently identified mineralization of up to 51 meters at grades of 12.5 grams per ton and the footwall remains open along strike and at depth. We anticipate declaring first resource at Exodus Footwall in early 2016. While we intend to pursue these opportunities, we're also prepared for ongoing market volatility. 
Turning to slide 23. At today's metal prices, we can afford to advance our best projects and exploration projects -- or prospects, fund our dividends and repay debt. This chart gives you an idea of what we might do differently in a prolonged period of lower or higher gold prices. Under significant constraints, we would delay stripping campaigns and sustaining capital. We'd complete our current projects and further reduce overhead and exploration cost. As gold price improves, we will continue to optimize cost in capital, fund our most profitable projects, accelerate debt repayment and increase dividends in line with our policy. Getting our house in order now allows us to deliver superior margins when gold price recovers. 
Turning to slide 24. We're continuing to make good progress toward our goal to become the world's most profitable and reliable gold producer. We will reach that goal by continuing to deliver our strategy to improve our underlying business, by continuously raising our safety, cost and technical performance to strengthen our portfolio by building a longer life, lower-cost asset base and to create shareholder value by generating cash, paying dividends and strengthening our investment grade balance sheet. Thank you for your time.

I'm pleased to report that Newmont delivered another strong quarter, and I appreciate the opportunity to walk you through the details now.

I'm pleased to report that Newmont delivered another strong quarter, and I appreciate the opportunity to walk you through the details now. Our operations continued to drive cost down, work more safely and increase gold and copper production compared to the prior year quarter. This performance helped us double our operating cash flow, significantly improve adjusted EBITDA and deliver a 9-fold increase in free cash flow compared to last year, despite lower metal prices.
Our portfolio is also stronger than it was a year ago. We executed value accretive transactions, and remained on track with our 4 development projects in the Americas. We also announced the decision to proceed with our Tanami Expansion project in Australia. Finally, we strengthened our balance sheet, met our commitment to pay dividends and repaid $50 million of debt. 
I'll turn to Slide 4 for more on these achievements. We continue to execute the 3 elements of our strategy. First, we improved our underlying business by lowering injury rates 15%, decreasing all-in sustaining costs 16% and increasing gold production 16% quarter-on-quarter. We also tripled copper production.
Second, we strengthened our portfolio by acquiring Cripple Creek & Victor and selling assets that represent lower value or higher risk to Newmont. We remain on schedule and on or under budget at Turf Vent Shaft, Merian and Long Canyon Phase 1. We're also moving forward with our Tanami Expansion project, an investment that will increase profitable production and extend mine life at very competitive returns. 
Finally, we created shareholder value by generating $758 million in adjusted EBITDA and $478 million in free cash flow during the third quarter. This allowed us to continue to self-fund our best projects, pay dividends and pay down debt.
Delivering our strategy starts at the mine phase. Turning to Slide 5. I visited the team earlier this month and was impressed with our newest operations performance. The team recently reached 1 year working with 0 harm, and is delivering exceptional business results. This is the bar we're setting for all our operations.
Overall, our total injury rates were 15% lower than the prior year quarter and remained among the lowest in the mining industry. This performance is overshadowed, however, by the loss of a contractor working on a tree-cutting team in Indonesia. Pak Mastar Teddy [ph] was struck in upper body by a falling tree and recently succumbed to his injuries. Our thoughts are with his family and his colleagues. Our work to make our operations safer and more efficient never ends. 
Turning to our cost performance on Slide 6. Our gold all-in sustaining costs were $835 per ounce for the quarter, bringing our year-to-date cost to $864 per ounce. This represents a 27% reduction since 2012, about half the improvements we achieved in the third quarter are the result of sustainable cost and efficiency improvements across the portfolio and higher productivity and sales at low-cost operations. We also benefited from favorable oil price and exchange rates and some delayed timing in our capital expenditures. 
Turning to production on Slide 7. We produced more than 1.3 million attributable ounces of gold during the third quarter. This constitutes 16% more than the prior year quarter, and our highest output in the last 7 quarters. New production from CC&V offset about 2/3 of the reductions associated with divestments. We also produced 48,000 tons of copper, mostly as a result of higher grades at Batu Hijau. I'll highlight 4 operation that drove this performance.
At Batu Hijau, third quarter production reflected higher Phase 6 ore grades, which we'll mine through 2017. At Boddington, mine plan and full potential improvements unlock higher grades and increased mill utilization and recoveries. Tanami delivered strong production, and on the back of higher grade and improved productivity and also mill utilization, which were achieved through full potential. And finally, Twin Creeks, benefited from improved mill grades and the completion of a planned stripping campaign. Putting it all together, our operations are doing good work to maximize opportunities and mitigate challenges. 
Turning to Slide 8. In North America, the Turf Vent Shaft remains on schedule to reach commercial production in the fourth quarter, and will be completed below budget. Engineering and mine development also remain on track at Long Canyon, where we continue to expect first production in 2017. You can see the leach pad and other surface facilities in this photo.
The CC&V integration is also progressing, and the operation celebrated 5 million ounces of gold produced last month. Ramp up to full-mill capacity is slightly behind schedule, and we've adjusted our outlook accordingly. We're working out the bugs and the delay is not expected to impact longer-term production. 
Turning to South America. Merian remains on budget and on schedule to begin producing in 2016. Construction is just over 40% complete and we've stockpiled more than 930,000 tons of ore at higher than planned grades. We're also advancing Project Integral, a phased approach to developing Yanacocha's remaining oxide and sulfide deposits, and we'll have initial findings by mid-2016.
In Africa, we're now operating at full capacity on grid power and Ahafo's new generators will be commissioned by year end. We're also advancing our broader power strategy to secure reliable and affordable supply over the long term.
In Indonesia, we expect our export permit to be renewed in the near future and continue to work with the government to finalize amendments to our contract at work. In the meantime, we're operating at full capacity and storing concentrate or shipping it Gresik to for processing. In Australia, we've announced that we're moving forward with the Tanami Expansion project. 
Turning to Slide 9. Since 2012, Tanami has more than doubled its gold production, while cutting costs by about 2/3 and significantly improving resource confidence. The Tanami Expansion project builds on this trajectory. It involves constructing a second decline in the underground mine and incremental capacity in the plant to increase profitable production and extend the mine life.
The project is the outcome of a detailed review of options to maximize near-term cash flow and long-term asset value. In the first 5 years of full production, the expansion will increase Tanami's average annual gold production by 80,000 ounces, lower all-in sustaining costs by between 5% and 10% and extend mine life by 3 years. First production is expected in the second half of 2017.
Adding a second decline will also serve as a platform for exploration drilling to support future expansions. As I mentioned last quarter, we see the potential to double current reserves and resources at comparable grades, by expanding the Callie and Auron deposits, and developing new discoveries at Federation and Liberator.
We're excited about this project and what the team has done to optimize it. For an investment of between $100 million and $120 million, the project provides a return of more than 35%, at $1,100 gold and more than 25% at gold prices as low as $900 per ounce. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Laurie for an update on our financial results."
291795,312432704,913284,"Newmont Mining Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2015",2015-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Newmont delivered a great quarter with solid financial results. Turning to slide 11. As Gary mentioned, we continue to see cost improvement across the portfolio. Our third quarter gold",910,"Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Newmont delivered a great quarter with solid financial results. 
Turning to slide 11. As Gary mentioned, we continue to see cost improvement across the portfolio. Our third quarter gold cost applicable to sales per ounce and gold all-in sustaining costs per ounce were 14% and 16% favorable, respectively, to the prior year quarter. With these most recent results, we have maintained our portfolio all-in sustaining costs below $1,000 per ounce for the last 5 quarters running. Gold production was also strong in the quarter and was up 16% from the prior year. Despite a 13% decline in the average realized gold price from a year ago, we continue to generate strong earnings and robust cash flow. 
Turning to slide 12. During the third quarter, revenue was up 16% and we generated $813 million in cash from continuing operations, an increase of more than 148% from the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was up 67% from the prior year, due to higher production at Batu Hijau, Boddington, Tanami and Twin Creeks, improved oil prices and exchange rates and ongoing cost and efficiency improvements.
Consolidated free cash flow was $478 million during the third quarter as higher sales volumes and improved cost offset increased development capital spending at Merian and Long Canyon Phase 1. With these most recent results, our year-to-date free cash flow has grown to $941 million, an amount roughly 8x more than what was generated a year ago. We reported adjusted net income of $126 million in the third quarter or $0.23 per share, compared to $249 million or $0.50 per share last year. 
Turning to slide 13, we walked through the adjusted net income adjustments, which include a $0.04 per share gain related to discontinued operations, a $0.10 per share gain related to the TMAC deconsolidation. In the past, we fully consolidated TMAC, but upon completion of their IPO, that is no longer required for accounting purposes. Their results will not be included in our line-by-line numbers going forward, and instead will be captured in our equity income line. This gain was on the actual event of deconsolidation and we carved it out for purposes of adjusted net income. It also gave rise to a $0.05 per share gain, resulting from an adjustment to our tax valuation allowances. 
In the quarter, we also recognized a $0.07 per share gain on asset sales, primarily our stake in the Valcambi refinery. For adjusted net income purposes, we also carved out of $0.04 per share loss related to impairments and loss provisions, and a $0.03 per share loss related to restructuring, acquisition costs and other minor items.
After reconciling for these items, we reported adjusted net income of $126 million or $0.23 per share. We're particularly pleased to note that this number includes $0.02 of accretion from the addition of CC&V to our portfolio for just a short 2 months. A similar outcome is seen in adjusted EBITDA of $758 million, up 67% from the prior year. It is adjusted for essentially the same unusual items. 
Now turning to slide 14. A strong balance sheet provides a competitive advantage in a volatile gold price environment, and we continue to execute on capital priorities designed to safeguard our investment-grade rating. At the end of the third quarter, our balance sheet had roughly $3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we had about $400 million in marketable securities and a $3 billion revolver that is essentially undrawn. In total, that's $6.4 billion of liquidity. This and our strong cash flow in 2015 gives us the comfort that we can start and finish our projects without having to take on additional debt to fund them. 
During the third quarter, we repaid $50 million of debt toward the PTNNT revolver. This brings our year-to-date total debt payments $330 million. We expect to pay down further debt later this year and are on track to repay a total of $750 million by year-end. As always, further payments will be made in context of the current business and market environment, but our significant cash balance certainly supports our ability to pay off additional debt. 
Given our existing cash balances and revolver, we have ample flexibility to execute on our capital priorities and are actively monitoring the gold price and the fixed income market to evaluate our options. We also maintained our dividend in light of our strong cash flow and operating performance. As a reminder, we have no significant debt maturities due until 2019, and our current net-debt-to-book capital of 19% is well below the maximum 62.5% covenant on our revolver, which is our only covenant. 
And now, turning to slide 15. We're proud that our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of roughly 1.1% is among the lowest in the industry and has continued to improve. We have transformed Newmont's balance sheet into one of the strongest in the sector, and our liquidity and cash flow generation separate us from the competition. We have reduced our net debt by 32% from the prior year quarter. And more importantly, we have reduced net debt, while also growing our EBITDA, which significantly improved our financial flexibility. We remain comfortable with our relative level of debt and maturity profile and we will continue to examine ways to reduce the absolute debt level and increase the long-term strength of our business. 
And now, I'll turn the call back over to Gary."

I'll shift gears now to look at the future, turning to slide 17. We expect to end 2015 with attributable gold production at the higher end of our guidance range, which is between 4.7 million and 5.1 million ounces, and copper production of between 140,000 and 180,000 tons. The changes we're making to our 2015 guidance are twofold. 
First, we're looking -- we're lowering our outlook for gold all-in sustaining costs 4% to between $880 and $940 per ounce. This reflects strong performance, particularly in Asia Pacific and Africa, as well as lower exchange rates in favorable power and diesel prices. We expect these costs to rise slightly in the fourth quarter due to higher exploration and advanced project spending, sustaining capital timing and lower grades at Yanacocha and Ahafo.
Second, we lowered our full year outlook for capital expenditure by about 9% to between $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion. This reduction reflects lower sustaining capital expenditures of between $740 million and $780 million or 13% below previous guidance, gained through cost and efficiency improvements at Yanacocha, Boddington, Batu Hijau, Ahafo and Akyem as well as some timing impacts. Our improved outlook also reflects lower development capital, including $50 million in savings at Merian, realized through supply-chain improvements, favorable exchange rates and lower commodity prices. This reduction is partially offset by new development capital for the Tanami Expansion project.
Our project pipeline continues to be one of the strongest in the gold sector. Turning to slide 18. Our projects focus on profitably extending the life of our existing operations or opening prospective new mining districts. Before we reach funding decisions, we scrutinize our approach to each project with a goal to lower initial capital cost, accelerate payback and leverage existing infrastructure. 
Projects that are in the execution phase include the Turf Vent Shaft, which will give us access to be between 100,000 and 150,000 ounces of higher-grade ore per year and support further expansion at Leeville. Merian, which will deliver 400,000 to 500,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of between $650 and $750 per ounce for the first 5 years beginning in 2016. The Cripple Creek & Victor expansion, which includes the new mill, leach pad and recovery plant that will be commissioned in second half of 2016. CC&V will contribute between 350,000 and 400,000 ounces of gold in 2016 and '17 and is expected to lower Newmont's overall cost profile.
The first phase of Long Canyon, which will add between 100,000 and 150,000 ounces of gold production per year at all-in sustaining costs of between $500 and $600 per ounce beginning in 2017. And finally, the Tanami Expansion project, which I touched on earlier. Further up the pipeline, we're advancing the Ahafo mill expansion and Subika underground mine in Ghana. These projects are designed to help offset the impact of lower grades and harder ore. We have deferred the decision to proceed with the Ahafo mill expansion until the second half of next year to coincide with our timing on the Subika underground decision.
We're also progressing the Phase 7 cutback at Batu Hijau, where we are working to secure the stability we need for ongoing investment; Quecher Main, which is part of the oxide expansion effort at Yanacocha; and Northwest Exodus in Nevada, which would extend the current underground operation and add profitable production. 
Turning to exploration on Slide 19. Exploration is one of our core competencies. About 70% of the gold we're mining in 2015 was discovered by Newmont geologists. Our program focuses on maintaining our existing resource base, while preserving options to pursue significant new discoveries. We employ rigorous standards to make sure the highest-quality ounces are added to our reserve base, and we've developed a proprietary geologic risk assessment process to improve our orebody confidence. This map shows prospects in Nevada, Peru, Ghana and Australia that we expect to be in production before 2020, and longer term prospects in the U.S., Ethiopia and the Guiana Shield.
Turning to slide 20, for a closer look at our underground prospects at Exodus in Nevada. Exodus is a high-grade underground orebody that was identified in 2008, with a 300,000 ounce discovery. Through new discoveries at Northwest Exodus in 2011 and Exodus Footwall in 2013, we've grown the resource base to 1.2 million ounces to date, of which 300,000 ounces have been mined. We see the potential to double this figure over the next few years by converting mineral inventory into reserves and resource, and by drilling the remaining half of Exodus' targeted mineralization. 
Turning to slide 21. Northwest Exodus is located several hundred meters from Exodus. We declared a main resource of 700,000 ounces in 2014, and expect to declare first reserves in early 2016. Compared to our initial Exodus discovery, Northwest Exodus is larger, with 50% higher grades, mineralization remains open on the Hanging Wall.
Turning to slide 22. the Exodus Footwall is our latest high-grade discovery, and is located in different stratigraphy than Exodus and Northwest Exodus. We recently identified mineralization of up to 51 meters at grades of 12.5 grams per ton and the footwall remains open along strike and at depth. We anticipate declaring first resource at Exodus Footwall in early 2016. While we intend to pursue these opportunities, we're also prepared for ongoing market volatility. 
Turning to slide 23. At today's metal prices, we can afford to advance our best projects and exploration projects -- or prospects, fund our dividends and repay debt. This chart gives you an idea of what we might do differently in a prolonged period of lower or higher gold prices. Under significant constraints, we would delay stripping campaigns and sustaining capital. We'd complete our current projects and further reduce overhead and exploration cost. As gold price improves, we will continue to optimize cost in capital, fund our most profitable projects, accelerate debt repayment and increase dividends in line with our policy. Getting our house in order now allows us to deliver superior margins when gold price recovers. 
Turning to slide 24. We're continuing to make good progress toward our goal to become the world's most profitable and reliable gold producer. We will reach that goal by continuing to deliver our strategy to improve our underlying business, by continuously raising our safety, cost and technical performance to strengthen our portfolio by building a longer life, lower-cost asset base and to create shareholder value by generating cash, paying dividends and strengthening our investment grade balance sheet. Thank you for your time.

We've seen a good correlation between gold price and the Aussie dollar, not that, that clearly drives anything, but we don't see any need to make a change in our position on the foreign exchange rate hedging. When it comes to the diesel fuel, we basically do that in Nevada, because of the ability for us to take hedge accounting.

On I guess CC&V, I know it's, I guess, early stages and you guys are still working out the kinks. But just wanted to get your, I guess, idea thinking about the cost, mining cost and then your recoveries there. You mentioned that you could reduce those by 10% and 2%, respectively. And I guess, with 2 months under your belt, what's your current thinking? Has it changed since the time you guys acquired the mine?"

Our mine planning folks and technical folks continue to look at it, but we're optimistic that we can do that. I think the other piece of it is, while we talk about the mill, the New Valley leach is going very well. Our team is very confident that we can bring that in on time or a bit ahead of schedule and comfortable with cost there. So while we focus a bit on the mill, the heart of the operation is the Valley leach, and that's going very well, early stage with our folks coming on and taking that over."
