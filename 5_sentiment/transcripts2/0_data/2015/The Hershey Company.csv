Welcome to The Hershey Company's Fourth Quarter 2014 Conference Call. J.P. Bilbrey, President and CEO; and Bert Alfonso, President, International and Head of Mergers and Acquisitions, will provide you with an overview of our results followed by a Q&A session.
Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2013 filed with the SEC.
If you have not seen a press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Within the Notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.
As a result, we will discuss 2014 fourth quarter results, excluding net pretax charges of $32.5 million or $0.32 per share diluted, primarily related to noncash trade market impairment charge amount on disposal of $24.8 million or $0.10 per share diluted and business realignment costs of $4.7 million or $0.02 per share diluted. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges.
With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey."

In 2014, Hershey made progress against its strategic initiatives. U.S. CMG xAOC+C market share reached 31.4%, up 0.3 share points versus last year. 
We acquired Shanghai Golden Monkey, which more than doubled the company's presence in China. We expanded into stacks and with the launch of Hershey's spreads and the related as Graham dippers, and we sourced 30% of our cocoa needs from certified and sustainable cocoa farms, putting us in a solid positioned to deliver on our 100% goal by 2020.
There were also challenges. In 2014, we believe lower retail store traffic, changes in consumers spending pattern as a result of the snack program and a more competitive snacking environment were contributing factors impacting how consumers participated in the snack segment. This resulted in fourth quarter and full year sales and earnings that were below our expectations.
Specifically, growth in snacking alternatives and in evolving retail landscape or packing how consumers buy and where and how they make purchases. Higher income consumers continued to ask for simple ingredients, health and wellness; and millennials view brands and brand attributes beyond traditional transparency to include social responsibility. 
They are also interacting with media differently.
Now let me share with you some of the things that we're doing to address this. Our R&D and innovation teams continue to make progress on new confectionery and snack products that enable us to offer a great confectionery products and increase the breadth of our portfolio. 
Later this year, the Club Channel will be introducing Brookside dark chocolate fruit and nuts snack bars. 
Building on our snacks and adjacency strategy, earlier today, we announced that we entered into an agreement to acquire KRAVE Jerky, which enables us to enter the rapidly growing meat snacks category. We're really excited about this acquisition and the opportunity to participate in the $2.5 billion meat snacks category that's growing at a double rate. While snacks and adjacencies is a lever in our long-term sales algorithm, we're very focused on confectionery. It's who we are, and it's our namesake. We have a lot of CMG innovation this year that I'll talk to in a moment, but we also have a meaningful new product pipeline that gives me confidence that innovation can continue to contribute at least 1 point of growth to our net sales algorithm on an annual basis. So I remain bullish on the CMG category and our ability to keep increasing market share. 
As it relates to simple ingredients and transparency, we've actually done a lot of work here. We have leveraged what we've done as our plan is to move a large portion of our portfolio in this direction. We're building the capability and have made progress to source non-GMO sugar and RSVT-free milk for products in the United States. We've already begun this work with key sourcing suppliers here in the U.S., and we'll have more news on this later in the year.
On the media front we expected advertising and related consumer promotion will increase at a rate greater than sales. Included in this is a greater proportion of investment in digital advertising on programs, consumers view on their mobile devices via traditional networks, user-generated content and sources like Buzz . So we're making investments like will benefit the company in the near and long-term. But we'll have more in this in CAGNY, so let's move on.
I was satisfied with improved results in the convenience store, large mass retail and dollar store channels, especially in the second half of the year. However, FDMx nonseasonal candy performance was not in line with our initial plans. Lower retail store traffic, greater levels of in-store activity by broader snacking manufacturers and continued economic challenges for a segment of consumers in these channels impacted our nonseasonal candy growth. Looking at total xAOC+C-store takeaway, U.S. market place performance sequentially improved throughout the year. Hershey fourth quarter retail takeaway of 3.8% was greater than the category growth of 2.2% resulting in a market share gain of 0.5 points. Marketplace performance was greater than 4Q net sales given solid Halloween and holiday sales, a portion of which shipped in the third quarter; the timing of the buying related to the price increases as a portion of third quarter net sales would have normally occurred in the fourth quarter; and the lapping of the strong year-ago period with select retailers increase inventory levels. 
Driving our fourth quarter takeaway results were improvements in convenience stores, large mass retail and dollar stores. These were the channels were many of our second half initiatives were focused, so I was pleased with the results. 
The programming and execution changes we made in the FDMx and Club Channel simply require a longer lead time to impact in-store merchandising activity. Hence, our sales mix and lower-than-forecast category growth impacted profitability and margins.
Let me now talk about 2015, where our focus will be on restoring our U.S. momentum. 
We have a solid line-up of products that will bring variety, news and excitement in the category. In addition to the carryover benefit of Brookside Crunchy Clusters and Reese's spreads, we're also launching Kit Kat White Minis, Hershey's Caramels, Ice Breakers Cool Blast Chews, Reese's Spreads, Snackters, Graham Dippers and some other yet-to-be-announced new products. 
Additionally, the Reese's brand is leveraging its NCAA relationship and has become an official sponsor of ESPN College Football Game Day. These initiatives are tied into the customers specific merchandising programs and big core brands that should result in higher quality merchandising versus last year. 
Additionally, we're increasing our reach as we're adding incremental headcount to our sales force that will result in hours in store being up mid-single digits. We'll complement this with increased levels of advertising that I mentioned earlier. We believe the investments we're making across our business positions us for future growth. The dynamics of the confectionery category, impulsivity, conversion rate at checkouts, season multiple pep types are all in advantage. As a result, in 2015, we anticipate that the plans we have in place will help mitigate the volume elasticity related to the price increase and that will outpace the category, and again, gain market share. 
Let me now provide you with some information on our International business. For the full year, our international net sales increased nearly 15%, including the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates and positive contribution of about $54  million for the Shanghai Golden Monkey. Excluding SGM and unfavorable FX, international net sales increased 10%, a solid number but less than our expectations due to macro economic headwinds that have yet to subside and will most likely remain a challenge this year. 
The Hershey, Golden Monkey integration work is underway and on track.
In 2015, we'll distribute acquired confectionery and protein-based bean-curd snacks into the China modern trade, and we expect to have deeper Tier 2 city coverage of some Hershey chocolate products. We're also leveraging newly acquired manufacturing capabilities.
In China, Brazil, Mexico and India, we've made solid progress against our planned initiatives of investing in go-to-market capabilities and portfolio expansions. In select markets, we launched Reese's, and it's off to a good start. Additionally, we're testing additional products as we looked to build out our global brands over the next few years. 
Therefore, in 2015, including a negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates and excluding the impact of M&A, we expect international net sales growth to increase around 10%.
Including SGM, reported international net sales are expected to be around $1.2 billion by the end of 2015.
By country, our chocolate business in China had a solid year. Chocolate category growth in 2014 was about 12%. Historically, the chocolate category has increased 10% to 11% in the fourth quarter. However, it slowed to around 8% as we see less gifting behind the government policy changes.
Hershey fourth quarter retail takeaway of about 20% was less than our expectation. Importantly, our market share in Q4 increased to full point  to around 11%. In Mexico, chocolate category growth in the modern trade 2014 was around 1%. The category and consumer struggle during the year although trends were better in the second half of the year with chocolate category growth of 3%. But this is still below the historical growth rate of 7% to 8%. Hershey Mexico chocolate retail takeaway for the year was up around 2%, resulting in a market share gain of 0.3 points.
We expect 2015 to be better in last year, albeit in a continuing challenging environment. 
Our performance in Brazil sequentially improved as the year progressed. For the year, Brazil chocolate category growth was 1% versus about 5% in recent years. Hershey retail takeaway was up 2%. Our performance was driven by our Hershey tablet bar growth and the launch of Reese's. 
We'll look to build on this in 2015.
Now to wrap up. Our consumer and customer plans as well as our investment profile for 2015 clearly reflect the learnings from 2014. Our plans are focused and the investment profile is concentrated in the areas to leverage Hershey's advantage brands and go-to-market strength. Investment in our brands, innovation and capabilities as well as an increase across all channels and merchandising and programming positions the company to compete effectively in confectionery and across the broader snack continuum.
We believe these investments should generate organic net sales growth or constant currency sales, excluding M&A and FX impacts of around 4% to 6% in 2015. This is less than our previous estimate and reflects the macroeconomic headwinds in international markets and the slowly improving U.S. nonseasonal trends. 
I typically just talked to net sales with or without M&A. However, when we established our long-term sales target, we didn't anticipate the U.S. dollar being this strong. Given the current backdrop, we expect foreign exchange rates to be greater than our previous estimate and be about 1 percentage point unfavorable in 2015. We estimate that the net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures will be around 2.5 points.
We continue to focus on growth initiatives and margin opportunities behind continuous productivity improvement initiatives. With the conclusion of the project Next Century program, in 2015, we'll focus on where the next largest opportunities are for future incremental productivity and cost savings. A portion of any particular savings from this assessment would be reinvested in our CMG and snacks business to accelerate our growth. And we'll provide more information on this at the upcoming CAGNY conference. I will now turn it over to Bert, who will provide some additional details on our financial results. Bert?"

It's a pleasure to be here to talk about our results as well as some of the recent M&A activity. As Mark mentioned, I've been pretty close to all of this, as I have responsibility for the M&A function as well as our international segment. So let's get started. 
Fourth quarter net sales of $2 billion increased 2.7% versus last year, generating adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.04, an increased 20.9%. As J.P. stated, the sales increase was lower than our expectations, primarily due to lower retail store traffic. Net price realization, mostly in the U.S., was a 3.1-point benefit. Excluding Shanghai Golden Monkey, volume was off 2.3 points due to price elasticity associated with the U.S. price increase announced in July and lower-than-expected nonseasonal sales. 
The Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition was a 2.7-point benefit and foreign currency was a 0.8-point headwinds. 
Q4 U.S. seasonal sales, primarily driven by holiday, increased high single digits on a percentage basis versus last year. Full year seasonal sales were a bp higher given a later Easter in 2014. 
Conversely, Easter is 15-day shorter in 2015 and will be a headwind this year. From a marketplace perspective, our Halloween and holiday market share increased 0.9 points and 1.1 points, respectively. 
International net sales in the fourth quarter increased 28%, including a benefit of about $54 million related to the Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition. Excluding Shanghai Golden Monkey, international net sales increased 8% as reported and 11% on a constant currency basis, as unfavorable FX was greater than anticipated. Macro economic headwinds in Q4 led to international sales being lower than our expectations.
Turning to margins. Fourth quarter adjusted gross margin increased by 30 basis points. The increase is driven by net price realization, slightly favorable input costs and supply chain productivity, partially offset by unfavorable sales mix and other supply chain costs. 
Fourth quarter adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT increased 17.5% versus last year, generating an adjusted EBIT margin of 18.7%, a 240-basis-point increase versus last year. The increase is due to higher gross margin and lower SM&A cost that declined about 5% due primarily to lower employee-related costs.
In Q4, advertising was at about as the same as last year. As we said throughout the year, advertising GRPs were up mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus 2013. Now let me provide a bit more detail on our International business. China continues to drive international net sales growth and excluding Shanghai Golden Monkey increased about 35% in both the fourth quarter and for the full year. We anticipated similar profile in 2015. I am very pleased with the progress we continue to make in China and remain optimistic regarding confectionery growth in both the modern and traditional trade. We will continue to expand our selling capabilities and expect growth in 2015 to be balanced between velocity and distribution gains. We will also expand cross selling of products between Shanghai Golden Monkey and Hershey China in the coming year.
And Finally, we were very pleased  with our 1.6-point share gain in chocolate in 2014.
In Brazil, Q4 net sales were about the same as last year on a reported basis, an increase of about 12% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, net sales declined about 3% on a reported basis and increased about 7% on a constant currency basis versus last year. Despite the difficult category environment, we were pleased with a small share gain of 0.1 points. In 2015, we're exploring other go-to-market options together with our current JV partner, . Our distribution JV with has enabled us to double our market share over the last few years, however, we are considering having total control of the selling and distribution function to give us more flexibly and investment options. 
In Mexico, fourth quarter net sales declined 6% on a reported basis, and we're flat on a constant currency basis versus last year. For the full year, net sales declined 8% on a reported basis and 4% on a constant currency basis compared to 2013.
Again our chocolate performance was favorable with a 0.3-point share gain, driven by both velocity and distribution gains. Trends in Mexico are getting better, and we expect continued improvements throughout 2015 although still below the historical growth rates.
We have made solid progress against our international strategic plans; we remain committed to our core markets; and we'll continue to make the necessary investments to build distribution capability, brand equity and drive trial and repeat purchases.
Moving down the P&L. Fourth quarter interest expense is $21 million was about the same as last year. For the full year, interest expense was $85 million and in line with our expectations. And for 2015, we expect interest expense to be $75 million to $80 million. The invested tax rate for the fourth quarter and the full year was 34.5% in line with our estimates. 
In 2015, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be similar to last year. In the fourth quarter, with average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately $223.5 million, leading to adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.04 and increases 20.9%.
Full year adjusted EBIT increased 5.8% versus last year, generating an adjusted EBIT margin of 19.6% or a 40-basis-point increase. The increase was driven by lower SG&A.
Turning now to the balance sheet and to our cash flow. At the end of the fourth quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year's fourth quarter by $240 million. Accounts receivable was higher by $119 million, primarily due to the Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition, China consolidation and traditional credit terms provided to our largest customers in China. Inventory was higher by $141 million to the Shanghai Golden Monkey in as well as higher raw material inventory levels, primary in dairy, that we mentioned in the last quarter. And accounts payable increased by $21 million. 
Capital additions, including software, were $139 million in the fourth quarter and $379 million for the full year, in line with our expectations. This included capital related to our manufacturing facility that we are building in Johor, Malaysia. In 2015, we expect CapEx to be in the $375 million to $400 million range. The company repurchased 2 million of outstanding shares in the fourth quarter and 202 million for the full year. Repurchases of $125 million were against the prior authorization, and $77 million were against the current $250 million repurchase authorization approved in February of 2014.
In addition, 32 million common shares were repurchased in Q4 to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options. Depreciation and amortization was $59 million in the fourth quarter and $212 million for the full year, in line with expectations. Dividends paid during the quarter were $115 million and $440 million for the full year. Cash and short-term investments at the end of fourth quarter were $471 million, slightly below our expectations due to the lower sales. The company remains well positioned to fund our dividends, working capital, capital expenditure requirements and acquisitions.
Let me close by providing context into our 2015 outlook. As J.P. summarized, in 2015, we have a solid pipeline of targeted innovation, merchandising and programming that can drive pack type and channel growth. In addition, advertising and related consumer marketing expense is expected to increase at a rate greater than net sales growth. As a result, we expect 2015 net sales to increase from 5.5% to 7.5%, including the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates and a net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures of about 2.5 points. 
This includes the acquisition of Shanghai Golden Monkey and Alan Candy that goes in the fourth quarter as well as the ventured into the last month to acquire KRAVE Jerky and divest Mauna Loa. We expect the trade on Mauna Loa transactions to close in the first quarter. Excluding that acquisitions and divestitures, sales were expected to increase 3% to 5%. This is lower than our previous estimate due to the continued macroeconomic headwinds as well as greater-than-initial estimates related to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. And we expect foreign exchange impact to be greater than our previous estimate and have an unfavorable impact of approximately 1 percentage point on our full year net sales growth.
We continue to have a significant focus on gross margin and expect the previously announced pricing action as well as productivity and cost savings to result in 2015 gross margin expansion of 135 to 145 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share diluted are expected to increase 8% to 10% and that includes dilution from acquisition and divestitures of $0.03 to $0.05 per share.
Before we open up for Q&A, just a couple thoughts on the first quarter. Remember that Easter is 2 weeks shorter this year and being sold on the old price points, which will pressure both margins. Our international sales profile is similar to prior years with annual growth, primarily driven by second half. Therefore, total first quarter net sales, including M&A, are expected to be around the low end of our annual sales target.
Additionally, brand building as well as investments and capabilities will ramp up in Q1. Given all these moving parts, EPS growth is expected to be pressured in the first quarter and higher as the year progresses. I thank you for your time this morning, and we'll now take questions."

We are encouraged with some of the things we're seeing as we deconstruct the weekly data. So you're correct. The nonseasonal FDMX sales has been the biggest drag in our business. So we feel good about the fact that in the fourth quarter we saw improvement, we continue to grow ahead of the category, and it was really a result of we think improved focus in merchandising in specific channels. In FDMX it's a slower build there because the planning cycle is also different. But there's a couple of things that we're seeing and if we look at the weekly data and when you get the most recent quad you're going to see that we're making good progression from a share standpoint. We think that reflect some of the changes we made in merchandising. One of the other things that we're seeing is as if trips continue to be negative although they're getting better but negative, and of course, that continues to affect the ends of consumer because this is all everyday business. Because people in the story lose that instant consumer piece. So we're very focused on that. There's 8 piece of data that I recently looked at for our brand specifically that within there's an increase in  actual purchase size. So the trips that we're getting purchase size is actually up. The one caveat I'll make with that is keep in mind with the fourth quarter you have some seasonal influence so that can be part of it. But in the weekly data, and this is all information, we do have some real encouragement there. So I feel good about what I'm beginning to see. Anecdotally, as you talk to retailers, I would say that I'm hearing some of those same kinds of sentiments echoed and then of course, we all are aware that the consumers had a lot of pressure at the bottom of the economic pyramid, and it's still yet to be seen how that consumer participates in the market. But for the total, I think I'm encouraged."

When we look at the international business, we're probably closer to around 13% back then, and we've lowered it to around 10% as J.P. mentioned. The macroeconomy has gotten little tougher in places like Brazil and Mexico. We saw a little bit of a slowdown in China in the fourth quarter, but we worry less about that. We have a lot -- we have a lot of momentum going to Chinese new year. But certainly, when J.P. talked about in terms of some pickup on the everyday business and some -- and a little bit lower expectations at least for 2015 and international is what's made the biggest difference. We also had a little pressure on our export business, which was not huge. It is very profitable, and as you can imagine, the currency into somebody's market also has some impact."

Your #2 commodity, dairy, is now in free fall, and I know you've bought forward to some extent, that's understandable but it looks to me like your cost bucket flat to down exiting the year. Is there something I'm missing as to why that margin expansion is so small? And how that might take over the year? And then third and finally, can you give us a sense what kind of volume you're thinking all associated with this guidance?

Let me kind of take pricing one first, and then I'll let Bert talk a little bit about the gross margin. The best way to think about the pricing is that as we move through the year, there is still some activities that are under the old price certainly around the seasonal business. So you'll begin to see that have a greater impact in Q2 and Q3, and then as you think about getting through the end of '15, we continue to model the elasticity at about 1-1 rate in terms of volume and price. So by the time we get to the first quarter of 2016 from our modeling would suggest that we're back to a whole environment or back to 100 in terms of volume contribution to our growth. So that's the way I would think about it broadly. There's a lot of movement still. But as we look at some of our channel modeling there's nothing that we're seeing that would cause us to believe that we would be any different than how we planned it. As you know, when you are increasing advertising in the various rapid rate back in 2008, '09 and 2011, there might have been a little bit of a faster conversion rate, but we think the way we've currently modeled it is probably about right."

As I think about our gross margin expansion, we're expecting 135 to 145 basis points. We're coming off the on we're actually down in gross margin, first time in a long time. We did start to see a pickup in the fourth quarter, slightly below what we thought. When we look at our year-end commodities, I won't talk specifically about hedging program but clearly, cocoa is still on average at higher prices than it was in our '14 standard, and it's really a function of them as we roll out our commodity program in an environment of increasing costs, and we've seen cocoa increased pretty dramatically. Obviously, you might have some of your lower hedges rolling off and are going to a little bit higher market. And what we've seen some improvement recently and that's good. We still have Cocoa that's higher than '14 levels. So that does have some -- a bit of an impact in terms of how you're thinking about the expansion. And the other thing is, as J.P. mentioned, our profile for 2015 is driven by pricing. So we are expecting 5 to 6 points of pricing and 1 to  2 points of lower volume. That lower volume does pressure our absorption of the plant so you don't get the full benefit of that until you get later in the year, as J.P. mentioned, we start to recover the prepress preprice volume. So some volume impact as we worked through the price elasticity and whilst some commodities are clearly in a better place like dairy and sugar, we do still have higher cocoa prices year-on-year so that's helping to mitigate to some degree what might be otherwise larger gross margin expansion."

One interesting piece of data is how can penetration actually went up to our brands in 2014. And so I think the thing that we're seeing is potentially several folds. So 2014, there are a lot of moving parts in terms of macroeconomic influences on consumers. So we see that. The trips piece for our business like ours, which has this everyday component is certainly, it impacted people are in stores and I think that there's more -- there's a real consumer strata influence there that I think has to be dealt with. And then in terms of let's just talk about the consumer themselves. I do believe there's an evolution always happening with consumers and the relationships they have with brands. I think some of the smaller brands have done a very good job of resonating with some of the on trend things that consumers talk about and we can talk separately about and second of why we think that's on friend product uniquely positioned within that particular segment. But as we saw takeaway improve throughout the year, we felt we became a more competitive company responding to some of the just things that are happening within the category and consumers, of course, have broader choices. But we see happening almost everywhere, and I'm very optimistic about how this place are strength is that snacking, in portable smoking is not just a short-term event. This is really trend and it's becoming a habit. If you look at the way the number of meals people have joined today, they have broader options on the menu on how to participate and we just have to be competitive and if we have to be competitive with the brands we have that are within the core of The Hershey Company, confession products. We're expanding brands like Brookside, which have a nice halo effect and then we also see ourselves as we've talked about expanding across a broader snacking continuum. And even if you think about China in a brand from our been could come in China commodity product protein comics on friend in terms of being snacking on the go red so we do see that being more and more important in terms of consumer trend and so as a company, we have to adapt to where the consumer is headed. We talked about simple ingredients with the GMI committee think about the chocolate bar, there's really only 4 components in a chocolate bar. So should be talking about the simplicity of that and in responding to the transparency that consumers want and we're doing that. So I'm very optimistic about all of those things. What we, Alexia, you set us up nicely to talk about KRAZE. Michele Buck, who is  the President of North America was very, very involved with the acquisition for KRAZE is. So why don't I give her a change to just talk for a couple of minutes about the acquisition."

Meat snacks is a category that is one of the fastest growing, growing double-digit in the U.S. this past year and over the past several years. Household penetration is expanding. So household penetration is only about 31% but it continues to grow, 32 points this past. So clearly it's meeting a lot of consumer needs. And as we looked to that category,  KRAVE was interesting to us because KRAVE is really playing in the fastest-growing segment of the meat snacks category, the better-for-you premium segment. So we really like the brand. We think it has tremendous potential. The product proposition has a unique point of difference with a great taste of texture. It's a  culinary inspired kind of profile, and we think that there's a lot of potential, and they continue to bring new consumers into the meat snacks category in the marketplace for us to leverage Hershey's strengths in supply chain but you might say it's the retail to really drive the business.

I think, Eric, if you look historically the premium, we sort of defined it over time is somewhere around 7% or 8% of the total category.

And I also think that part of the category has, in many ways, a clear message to the consumer, also, is around sometimes ingredients and so forth. So I've believe that that's what we're seeing more than anything else. I agree with you, we've not done a good job in the premium space. We're spending a lot of time right now on how we want to participate in premium. We're pushing up some within our middle of our portfolio certainly with products like Brookside, which takes us up a little bit. You'll see some of the innovation we have this year, which we'll also do that. And then we're looking strongly at our brands like Scharffenberger and trying to make an effort to see how we can play differently with those brands. So we're not going to ignore that. I think in the past, we have not done a good job. We want to reorient ourselves a bit there. And then it's still problematic for the consumers  that are participating in the category.

But there where some positive that we certainly saw in the fourth quarter? I mean we saw the C-store Class 3 did very well at the high end of our 3% to 4% long-term category growth rate, one of our largest retail partners was -- had takeaways in the fourth quarter, certainly greater, greater than the 3% to 4%. Dollar stores continue to do well. And the trends that we -- again, that we're seeing very early in January are on pace with that. Certainly, in some of the building not quite at the level of those other channels but getting better than what we had in the fourth quarter. So those are some signs of encouragement there. I think just a couple of other things, as you start to lap the snap, which was in an event that happened back in November of the previous year -- in 2013, so you start to get that back into the base. And then I think the unknown, and keep in mind, we never talk about gas prices in terms of leading sales up-and-down. So in difficult times, we seem to be pretty good in terms of those linkages. However, while we don't know the answer to yet I don't think is that the real income that the lower fuel prices are bringing to consumers is really significant. So how that makes its way through to behavior? I don't think we know yet, but I think that's more likely a positive than a negative, I would say, for food in general and consumer products in general and then obviously, we're going to fight for our share of that."

There are always these periods of times which would seem more challenging maybe than others. But if you think about our footprint and our portfolio, the countries that we're focused against despite there maybe currency headwinds and these kinds of things, these are some of the best high-growth GDP markets around. We don't have a lot of legacy businesses that we have to drag along with this. I look at China by itself, and largely, we're a Hershey's business there and more specifically, we're a Hershey's Kisses business there. As we expand our category in our portfolio within the category that gives us a tremendous amount of runway. We advertise in -- like I think only about 20% or 25% of the cities that the leading competitor in the market does and so as we continue to expand that and our household penetration grows. We can talk about what's the right GDP for China, but if you think about an emerging, middle class and our portfolio over time, we have a tremendous amount of runway there. And so as we execute against our business model in a thoughtful, planful, we have this very precious North American business that I have a tremendous amount of confidence in, I think that our guidance is absolutely right for the long-term.

Bilbrey, President and CEO; and Bert Alfonso, President, International, and Head of Mergers and Acquisitions, will provide you with an overview of our results, followed by a Q&A session.
Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2013 filed with the SEC.
If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website, in the investor relations section.
Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Note section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes that presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.
As a result, we will discuss 2014 fourth quarter results, excluding net pretax charges of $32.5 million or $0.13 per share diluted, primarily related to a noncash trademark impairment charge and onetime [ph] disposal of $24.8 million or $0.10 per share diluted and business realignment costs of $4.7 million or $0.02 per share diluted. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges.
With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey."

In 2014, Hershey made progress against its strategic initiatives. U.S. CMG xAOC+C market share reached 31.4%, up 0.3 share points versus last year. We acquired Shanghai Golden Monkey, which more than doubles the company's presence in China. We expanded into snacks and adjacencies with the launch of Hershey’s Spreads and the related Snacksters Graham Dippers. And we sourced 30% of our cocoa needs from certified and sustainable cocoa farms, putting us in a solid position to deliver on our 100% goal by 2020.
There were also challenges. In 2014, we believe lower retail store traffic, changes in consumer spending patterns as a result of the SNAP program and a more competitive snacking environment were contributing factors that impacted how consumers participated in the snack segment. This resulted in fourth quarter and full year sales and earnings that were below our expectations. Specifically, growth in snacking alternatives and an evolving retail landscape are impacting what consumers buy and where and how they make purchases. Higher-income consumers continue to ask for simple ingredients, health and wellness. And millennials view brands and brand attributes beyond traditional transparency to include social responsibility. They are also interacting with media differently.
Now let me share with you some of the things that we're doing to address this. Our R&D and innovation teams continue to make progress on new confectionery and snack products that enable us to offer great confectionery products and increase the breadth of our portfolio. Later this year, the Club Channel will be introducing Brookside dark chocolate fruit-and-nut snack bars.
Building on our snacks and adjacencies strategy, earlier today, we announced that we entered into an agreement to acquire KRAVE Jerky, which enables us to enter the rapidly growing meat snacks category. We're really excited about this acquisition and the opportunity to participate in the $2.5 billion meat snacks category that's growing at a double-figure rate.
While snacks and adjacencies is a lever in our long-term sales algorithm, we're very focused on confectionery. It's who we are and it's our namesake. We have a lot of CMG innovation this year that I'll talk to in a moment, but we also have a meaningful new product pipeline that gives me confidence that innovation can continue to contribute at least one point of growth to our net sales algorithm on an annual basis. So I remain bullish on the CMG category and our ability to keep increasing market share.
As it relates to simple ingredients and transparency, we've actually done a lot of work here. We haven't leveraged what we've done, as our plan is to move a large portion of our portfolio in this direction. We're building the capability and have made progress to source non-GMO sugar and RSBT-free (sic) [rBST-free] milk for products in the United States. We've already begun this work with key sourcing suppliers here in the U.S., and we'll have more news on this later in the year.
On the media front, we expect that advertising and related consumer promotion will increase at a rate greater than sales. Included in this is a greater proportion of investment in digital advertising on programs consumers view on their mobile devices via traditional networks, user-generated content and sources like BuzzFeed. So we're making investments that will benefit the company in the near and long term. And we'll have more on this at CAGNY, so let's move on.
I was satisfied with improved results in the convenience store, large mass retail and dollar store channels, especially in the second half of the year. However, FDMx nonseasonal candy performance was not in line with our initial plans. Lower retail store traffic, greater levels of in-store activity by broader snacking manufacturers and continued economic challenges for a segment of consumers in these channels impacted our nonseasonal candy growth.
Looking at total xAOC+C-store retail takeaway. U.S. marketplace performance sequentially improved throughout the year. Hershey fourth quarter retail takeaway of 3.8% was greater than the category growth of 2.2%, resulting in a market share gain of 0.5 points. Marketplace performance was greater than 4Q net sales given solid Halloween and holiday sales, a portion of which shipped in the third quarter; the timing of the buying-in related to the price increase, as a portion of third quarter net sales would have normally occurred in the fourth quarter; and the lapping of the strong year-ago period when select retailers increased inventory levels.
Driving our fourth quarter takeaway results were improvements in convenience stores, large mass retail and dollar stores. These were the channels where many of our second half initiatives were focused, so I was pleased with the results. The programming and execution changes we made in the FDMx and Club Channel simply require a longer lead time to impact in-store merchandising activity, hence our sales mix and lower-than-forecast category growth impacted profitability and margins.
Let me now talk about 2015, where our focus will be on restoring our U.S. momentum.
We have a solid lineup of new products that will bring variety, news and excitement to the category. In addition to the carryover benefit of Brookside Crunchy Clusters and Reese's Spreads, we're also launching Kit Kat White Minis, Hershey's caramels, Ice Breakers Cool Blasts Chews, Reese's Spreads Snacksters Graham Dippers and some other yet-to-be-announced new products. Additionally, the Reese's brand is leveraging its NCAA relationship and has become an official sponsor of ESPN college football game day. These initiatives are tied into customer-specific merchandising programs and big core brands that should result in higher-quality merchandising versus last year.
Additionally, we're increasing our reach as we're adding incremental headcount to our sales force that will result in hours in store being up mid-single digits. We'll complement this with increased levels of advertising that I mentioned earlier.
We believe the investments we're making across our business positions us for future growth. The dynamics of the confectionery category, impulsivity, conversion rate at checkouts, season multiple-pack types are all an advantage. As a result, in 2015, we anticipate that the plans we have in place will help mitigate the volume elasticity related to the price increase, and it will outpace the category and again gain market share.
Let me now provide you with some information on our international business.
For the full year, our international net sales increased nearly 15%, including the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates and positive contribution of about $54 million from Shanghai Golden Monkey. Excluding SGM and unfavorable FX, international net sales increased 10%, a solid number but less than our expectations due to macroeconomic headwinds that have yet to subside and will most likely remain a challenge this year. The Hershey-Golden Monkey integration work is underway and on track.
In 2015, we'll distribute acquired confectionery and protein-based bean curd snacks into the China modern trade, and we expect to have deeper Tier 2 city coverage of some Hershey chocolate products. We're also leveraging newly acquired manufacturing capabilities. In China, Brazil, Mexico and India, we've made solid progress against our planned initiatives of investing in go-to-market capabilities and portfolio expansion. In select markets, we launched Reese's, and it's off to a good start. Additionally, we're testing additional products, as we look to build out our global brands over the next few years.
Therefore, in 2015, including a negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates and excluding the impact of M&A, we expect international net sales growth to increase around 10%. Including SGM, reported international net sales are expected to be around $1.2 billion by the end of 2015.
By country, our chocolate business in China had a solid year. Chocolate category growth in 2014 was about 12%. Historically, the chocolate category has increased 10% to 11% in the fourth quarter. However, it slowed to around 8% as we see less gifting behind the government policy changes.
Hershey fourth quarter retail takeaway of about 20% was less than our expectation. Importantly, our market share in Q4 increased a full point to around 11%. In Mexico, chocolate category growth in the modern trade 2014 was around 1%. The category and consumer struggled during the year, although trends were better in the second half of the year, with chocolate category growth of 3%. But this is still below the historical growth rate of 7% to 8%. Hershey Mexico chocolate retail takeaway for the year was up around 2%, resulting in a market share gain of 0.3 points. We expect 2015 to be better than last year, albeit in a continuing challenging environment.
Our performance in Brazil sequentially improved as the year progressed. For the year, Brazil chocolate category growth was 1% versus about 5% in recent years. Hershey retail takeaway was up 2%. Our performance was driven by our Hershey tablet bar growth and the launch of Reese's. We'll look to build on this in 2015.
Now to wrap up. Our consumer and customer plans as well as our investment profile for 2015 clearly reflect the learnings from 2014. Our plans are focused, and the investment profile is concentrated in the areas to leverage Hershey's advantage brands and go-to-market strength. Investment in our brands, innovation and capabilities, as well as an increase across all channels and merchandising and programming, positions the company to compete effectively in confectionery and across the broader snack continuum. We believe these investments should generate organic net sales growth on constant currency sales, excluding M&A and FX impacts, of around 4% to 6% in 2015. This is less than our previous estimate and reflects the macroeconomic headwinds in international markets and the slowly improving U.S. nonseasonal trends.
I typically just talk to net sales with or without M&A. However, when we established our long-term sales target, we didn't anticipate the U.S. dollar being this strong. Given the current backdrop, we expect foreign exchange rates to be greater than our previous estimate and be about 1 percentage point unfavorable in 2015. We estimate that the net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures will be around 2.5 points.
We continue to focus on growth initiatives and margin opportunities behind continuous productivity-improvement initiatives. With the conclusion of the Project Next Century program, in 2015, we'll focus on where the next largest opportunities are for future incremental productivity and cost savings. A portion of any particular savings from this assessment would be reinvested in our CMG and snacks business to accelerate our growth. And we'll provide more information on this at the upcoming CAGNY conference.
I will now turn it over to Bert, who will provide some additional details on our financial results. Bert?"

It's a pleasure to be here to talk about our results as well as some of the recent M&A activity. As Mark mentioned, I've been very close to all of this, as I have responsibility for the M&A function as well as our international segment.
So let's get started.
Fourth quarter net sales of $2 billion increased 2.7% versus last year, generating adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.04, an increased 20.9%. As J.P. stated, the sales increase was lower than our expectations, primarily due to lower retail store traffic. Net price realization, mostly in the U.S., was a 3.1-point benefit. Excluding Shanghai Golden Monkey, volume was off 2.3 points due to price elasticity associated with the U.S. price increase announced in July and lower-than-expected nonseasonal sales. The Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition was a 2.7-point benefit, and foreign currency was a 0.8-point headwind.
Q4 U.S. seasonal sales, primarily driven by holiday, increased high single digits on a percentage basis versus last year. Full year seasonal sales were a bp higher given a later Easter in 2014. Conversely, Easter is 15 days shorter in 2015 and will be a headwind this year. From a marketplace perspective, our Halloween and holiday market share increased 0.9 points and 1.1 points, respectively.
International net sales in the fourth quarter increased 28%, including a benefit of about $54 million related to the Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition. Excluding Shanghai Golden Monkey, international net sales increased 8% as reported and 11% on a constant currency basis, as unfavorable FX was greater than anticipated. Macroeconomic headwinds in Q4 led to international sales being lower than our expectations.
Turning to margins. Fourth quarter adjusted gross margin increased by 30 basis points. The increase was driven by net price realization, slightly favorable input costs and supply chain productivity, partially offset by unfavorable sales mix and other supply chain costs.
Fourth quarter adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT increased 17.5% versus last year, generating an adjusted EBIT margin of 18.7%, a 240 basis point increase versus last year. The increase was due to higher gross margin and lower SM&A costs that declined about 5% due primarily to lower employee-related costs. In Q4, advertising was at about the same as last year. As we said throughout the year, advertising GRPs were up mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus 2013.
Now let me provide a bit more detail on our international business.
China continues to drive international net sales growth and, excluding Shanghai Golden Monkey, increased about 35% in both the fourth quarter and for the full year. We anticipate a similar profile in 2015. I am very pleased with the progress we continue to make in China and remain optimistic regarding confectionery growth in both the modern and traditional trade. We will continue to expand our selling capabilities and expect growth in 2015 to be balanced between velocity and distribution gains. We will also expand cross-selling of products between Shanghai Golden Monkey and Hershey China in the coming year. And finally, we were very pleased with our 1.6-point share gain in chocolate in 2014.
In Brazil, Q4 net sales were about the same as last year on a reported basis and increased about 12% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, net sales declined about 3% on a reported basis and increased about 7% on a constant currency basis versus last year. Despite the difficult category environment, we were pleased with a small share gain of 0.1 points. In 2015, we're exploring other go-to-market options together with our current JV partner Bauducco. Our distribution JV with Bauducco has enabled us to double our market share in the last few years. However, we are considering having total control of the selling and distribution function to give us more flexibly and investment options.
In Mexico, fourth quarter net sales declined 6% on a reported basis and were flat on a constant currency basis versus last year. For the full year, net sales declined 8% on a reported basis and 4% on a constant currency basis compared to 2013. Again, our chocolate performance was favorable, with a 0.3-point share gain driven by both velocity and distribution gains. Trends in Mexico are getting better, and we expect continued improvement throughout 2015, although still below the historical growth rates.
We have made solid progress against our international strategic plans. We remain committed to our core markets. And we'll continue to make the necessary investments to build distribution capability, brand equity; and drive trial and repeat purchases.
Moving down the P&L.
The fourth quarter interest expense of $21 million was about the same as last year. For the full year, interest expense was $85 million and in line with our expectations. And for 2015, we expect interest expense to be $75 million to $80 million.
The adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter and the full year was 34.5%, in line with our estimates. In 2015, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be similar to last year.
In the fourth quarter, with -- average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 223.5 million, leading to adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.04, an increase of 20.9%.
Full year adjusted EBIT increased 5.8% versus last year, generating an adjusted EBIT margin of 19.6% or a 40 basis point increase. The increase was driven by lower SG&A.
Turning now to the balance sheet and to our cash flow.
At the end of the fourth quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year's fourth quarter by $240 million. Accounts receivable was higher by $119 million, primarily due to the Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition, Lotte China consolidation and traditional credit terms provided to our largest customers in China. Inventory was higher by $141 million due to Shanghai Golden Monkey and Lotte, as well as higher raw material inventory levels, primarily dairy that we mentioned in the last quarter. And accounts payable increased by $21 million.
Capital additions, including software, were $139 million in the fourth quarter and $379 million for the full year, in line with our expectations. This included capital related to our manufacturing facility that we are building in Johor, Malaysia. In 2015, we expect CapEx to be in the $375 million to $400 million range.
The company repurchased 2 million of outstanding shares in the fourth quarter and 202 million for the full year. Repurchases of $125 million were against the prior authorization, and $77 million were against the current $250 million repurchase authorization approved in February of 2014. In addition, 32 million of common shares were repurchased in Q4 to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options.
Depreciation and amortization was $59 million in the fourth quarter and $212 million for the full year, in line with expectations.
Dividends paid during the quarter were $115 million and $440 million for the full year.
Cash and short-term investments at the end of fourth quarter were $471 million, slightly below our expectations due to the lower sales.
The company remains well positioned to fund our dividends, working capital, capital expenditure requirements and acquisitions.
Let me close by providing context into our 2015 outlook. As J.P. summarized, in 2015, we have a solid pipeline of targeted innovation, merchandising and programming that can drive pack type and channel growth. In addition, advertising and related consumer marketing expense is expected to increase at a rate greater than net sales growth. As a result, we expect 2015 net sales to increase from 5.5% to 7.5%, including the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates and a net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures of about 2.5 points. This includes the acquisition of Shanghai Golden Monkey and Allan Candy that closed in the fourth quarter, as well as the agreement entered into the last month to acquire KRAVE Jerky and divest Mauna Loa. We expect the KRAVE and Mauna Loa transactions to close in the first quarter.
Excluding net acquisitions and divestitures, sales are expected to increase 3% to 5%. This is lower than our previous estimate due to the continued macroeconomic headwinds as well as greater-than-initial estimates related to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. And we expect foreign exchange impact to be greater than our previous estimate and have an unfavorable impact of approximately one percentage point on our full year net sales growth.
We continue to have a significant focus on gross margin and expect the previously announced pricing action as well as productivity and cost savings to result in 2015 gross margin expansion of 135 to 145 basis points.
Adjusted earnings per share diluted are expected to increase 8% to 10%, and that includes dilution from acquisitions and divestitures of $0.03 to $0.05 per share.
Before we open up for Q&A, just a couple of thoughts on the first quarter. Remember that Easter is 2 weeks shorter this year and being sold on at the old price points, which will pressure gross margin. Our international sales profile is similar to prior years, with annual growth primarily driven by second half. Therefore, total first quarter net sales, including M&A, are expected to be around the low end of our annual sales target. Additionally, brand building as well as investments in selling capabilities will ramp up in Q1.
Given all these moving parts, EPS growth is expected to be pressured in the first quarter and higher as the year progresses.

And we are encouraged with some of the things we're seeing as we deconstruct the weekly data. So you're correct. The nonseasonal FDMx sales has been the biggest drag in our business. So we feel good about the fact that, in the fourth quarter, we saw improvement. We continued to grow ahead of the category. And it was really a result of, we think, improved focus in merchandising in specific channels. In FDMx, it's a slower build there because the planning cycle is also different, but there's a couple of things that we're seeing. And if we look at the weekly data and when you get the most recent quad, you're going to see that we're making good progression from a share standpoint. We think that reflects some of the changes we made in merchandising. One of the other things that we're seeing is trips continue to be negative, although they're getting better but negative, and of course that continues to affect the ends of consumer because this is all everyday business; because if people aren't in the store, you lose that instant consumable piece. So we're very focused on that. There's a piece of data that I recently looked at for our brand specifically that within the trip, there's an increase in actual purchase size. So the trips that we're getting purchase size is actually up, but the one caveat I'll make with that is keep in mind, with the fourth quarter, you have some seasonal influence, so that can be part of it, but in the weekly data, and this is all home skin information, we do have some real encouragement there. So I feel good about what I'm beginning to see. Anecdotally, as you talk to retailers, I would say that I'm hearing some of those same kinds of sentiments echoed. And then of course, we all are aware that the consumers have a lot of pressure at the bottom of the economic pyramid. And it's still yet to be seen how that consumer participates in the market, but for the total, I think I'm encouraged."

Today, we're firmly at 1 point, and we'll see where that goes. Hopefully, the dollar starts to stabilize a bit. When we look at the international business, we're probably closer to around 13% back then, and we've lowered it to around 10%, as J.P. mentioned. The macroeconomy has gotten a little tougher in places like Brazil and Mexico. We saw a little bit of a slowdown in China in the fourth quarter, but we worry less about that. A lot -- we've had a lot of momentum going into Chinese New Year. But certainly, what J.P. talked about in terms of some pickup on the everyday business and some -- and a little bit lower expectations, at least for 2015, in international is what's made the biggest difference. We've also had a little pressure on our export business, which was not huge. It is very profitable. And as you can imagine, the currency into some of these markets also has some impact."

Your #2 commodity, dairy, is now in free fall. And I know you've bought forward to some extent. That's understandable, but it looks to me like your cost bucket item is flat to down exiting the year. Like, is there something I'm missing as to why that margin expansion is so small and how that might pace over the year? And then third and finally, can you give us a sense what kind of volume you're thinking overly [ph] associated with this guidance? So is it right [ph] to understand that there's somewhat this manufacturing deleverage kind of like we saw in the fourth quarter?"

The best way to think about the pricing is that, as we move through the year, there are still some activities that are under the old price certainly around the seasonal business, so you'll begin to see that have a greater impact in Q2 and Q3. And then as you think about getting through the end of '15, we continue to model the elasticity at about a 1:1 rate in terms of volume and price, so by the time we get to the first quarter of 2016, our modeling would suggest that we're back to a whole environment or back to 100 in terms of volume contribution to our growth. So that's the way I would think about it broadly. There's a lot of movement still, but as we look at some of our channel modeling, there's nothing that we're seeing that would cause us to believe that it would be any different than how we've planned it. And as you know, when we were increasing advertising in a very rapid rate back in 2008, '09 and 2011, there might have been a little bit of a faster conversion rate, but we think the way we've currently modeled it is probably about right."

We're coming off a year when we're actually down on gross margin first time in a long time. We did start to see a pickup in the fourth quarter slightly below where we thought. When you look at our year-on-year commodities, well, I won't talk specifically about hedging program, but clearly, cocoa is still on average at higher prices than it was in our '14 standard. And that's really a function of as we roll out our commodity program in an environment of increasing costs, and we've seen cocoa increase pretty dramatically. Obviously, you have -- you may have some of your lower hedges rolling off and are buying into a little bit higher market. So while we've seen some improvement recently, and that's good, we still have cocoa that's higher than '14 levels. So that does have some -- a bit of an impact in terms of how you're thinking about the expansion. And the other thing is, as J.P. mentioned, our profile for 2015 is driven by pricing. So we're expecting 5 to 6 points of pricing and 1 to 2 points of lower volume. And that lower volume does pressure our absorption in the plants, and so you don't get the full benefit of that until, as you get later in the year, as J.P. mentioned, we start to recover the pre-price-increase volume. So some volume impact as we work through the price elasticity. And whilst some commodities are clearly in a better place, like dairy and sugar, we do still have higher cocoa prices year-on-year. So that's helping to mitigate to some degree what might be otherwise larger gross margin expansion."

And then in terms of let's just talk about the consumer themselves: I do believe there's an evolution always happening with consumers and the relationships they have with brands. I think some of the smaller brands have done a very good job of resonating with some of the on-trend things that consumers talk about. And we can talk separately about KRAVE here in a second, of why we think that's an on-trend product uniquely positioned within that particular segment. But as we saw takeaway improve throughout the year, we felt we became a more competitive company responding to some of the -- just things that are happening within the category. And consumers, of course, have broader choices. What we see happening almost everywhere, and I'm very optimistic about how this plays to our strengths, is that snacking and portable snacking is not just a short-term event. This is really a trend, and it's becoming a habit. And if you look at the way the number of meals people have during the today, they have broader options on the menu of how to participate in that. We just have to be competitive. And we have to be competitive with the brands we have that are within the core of The Hershey Company, our confectionery products. We're expanding brands like Brookside, which has a nice halo effect of goodness. And then we also see ourselves, as we've talked about, expanding across a broader snacking continuum. And even if you talk, even if you think about China and a brand, our bean curd, in China, that's a product that brings protein. It's on trend in terms of being a ""snacking on the go"" brand. So we just see that being more and more important in terms of consumer trend. And so as a company, we have to adapt to where the consumer is headed. We talked about simple ingredients with GMO-free. If you think about a chocolate bar, there's really only 4 components in a chocolate bar. So we should be talking about the simplicity of that in responding to the transparency that consumers want, and we're doing that. So I'm very optimistic about all of those things. Why don't we let -- Alexia, you were -- you set us up nicely to talk about KRAZE. I -- Michele Buck, who's the President of North America and was very, very involved with the acquisition for KRAZE, is here, so why don't I give her a chance to just talk for a couple of minutes about the acquisition?"

As J.P. mentioned, we're seeing consumers continue to snack more and graze throughout the day. And as such, their snacking needs are really evolving. And we are going to be focused, as we continue to look at the growth of our company as a snack company, in how we meet those needs. One of the areas that we've seen a lot of consumer interest in is portable nutrition and protein-based snacking. So as we look at that marketplace, clearly, one of the categories that's really meeting consumers' needs is meat snacks. Meat snacks is a category that is one of the fastest growing, growing double digit in the U.S. this past year and over the past several years. Household penetration is expanding. So household penetration is only about 31%, but it continues to grow, grew 2 points this past year. So clearly, it's meeting a lot of consumer needs. And as we looked at that category,  KRAVE was interesting to us because KRAVE is really playing in the fastest-growing segment of the meat snacks category, the better-for-you premium segment. So we really like the brand. We think it has tremendous potential. The product proposition has a unique point of difference with a great taste, a texture. It's a culinary-inspired kind of profile. And we think that there's a lot of potential. And they continue to bring new consumers into the meat snacks category in the marketplace for us to leverage Hershey's strengths in supply chain, consumer insights in retail to really drive the business. So we couldn't be more excited about how it will continue to help us to meet consumers' needs as we stay very focused, of course, on winning in our category."

I certainly appreciate the evolution of where consumers are going and Hershey's desire to sort of cover off on that a bit more with snacking adjacencies and such, but the last time Hershey did this, albeit in a different set of sort of broader snacking categories, the execution really wasn't where the company wanted it to be. The sustainability of some of those items, whether it was cookies in the C-store, nuts, things like that, weren't exactly, I guess, as sustainable. So is there something now that is different about capabilities, the way you're planning for these sorts of things, whether it's KRAVE or things beyond that, that make you feel a lot better about the sustainability of it?

And then in more difficult economic times, usually the distribution in category contraction goes along with it. I think what it speaks to in the current environment is the top end of the economic pyramid is fine and the consumer that participates there has the ability to participate. And I also think that part of the category has, in many ways, a clear message to the consumer also that is around, sometimes, ingredients and so forth. So I believe that that's what we're seeing more than anything else. I agree with you. We've not done a good job in the premium space. We're spending a lot of time right now on how we want to participate in premium. We're pushing up some within our -- the middle of our portfolio, certainly with products like Brookside, which takes us up a little bit. You'll see some of the innovation we have this year which will also do that. And then we're looking strongly at our brands like Scharffen Berger and trying to make an effort to see how we can play differently with those brands. So we're not going to ignore that. I think, in the past, we have not done a good job. We want to reorient ourselves a bit there. And then it's still problematic for the consumers that are participating in the category. So you will see some category expansion from that space, but I think that the overall category really will continue to be driven by mass products."

And we think, because of our go-to-market capabilities, our R&D and ability to make things taste great, that there's opportunities for us in broader snacking."

But if you think about our footprint and our portfolio, the countries that we're focused against despite there maybe currency headwinds and these kinds of things, these are some of the best, high-growth GDP markets around. We don't have a lot of legacy businesses that we have to drag along with this. I look at China by itself, and largely, we're a Hershey's business there. And more specifically, we're a Hershey's Kisses business there. As we expand our category -- or our portfolio within the category, that gives us a tremendous amount of runway. We advertise in like, I think, only about 20% or 25% of the cities that the leading competitor in the market does, so as we continue to expand that, and our household penetration grows. We can talk about what's the right GDP for China, but if you think about an emerging middle class and our portfolio over time, we have a tremendous amount of runway there. And so as we execute against our business model in a thoughtful, planful way, we have this very precious North American business that I have a tremendous amount of confidence in, I think that our guidance is absolutely right for the long term. We want to continue to be acquisitive. And so I think we've got a great future."

Welcome to The Hershey Company's Fourth Quarter 2014 Conference Call. J.P. Bilbrey, President and CEO, and Bert Alfonso, President, International, and Head of Mergers and Acquisitions, will provide you with an overview of our results, followed by a Q&A session.
Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2013 filed with the SEC.
If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website, in the investor relations section.
Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Note section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes that presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.
As a result, we will discuss 2014 fourth quarter results, excluding net pretax charges of $32.5 million or $0.13 per share diluted, primarily related to a noncash trademark impairment charge and loss on disposal of $24.8 million or $0.10 per share diluted and business realignment costs of $4.7 million or $0.02 per share diluted. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges.
With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey."

In 2014, Hershey made progress against its strategic initiatives. U.S. CMG xAOC+C market share reached 31.4%, up 0.3 share points versus last year. We acquired Shanghai Golden Monkey, which more than doubles the company's presence in China. We expanded into snacks and adjacencies with the launch of Hershey’s Spreads and the related Snacksters Graham Dippers. And we sourced 30% of our cocoa needs from certified and sustainable cocoa farms, putting us in a solid position to deliver on our 100% goal by 2020.
There were also challenges. In 2014, we believe lower retail store traffic, changes in consumer spending patterns as a result of the SNAP program and a more competitive snacking environment were contributing factors that impacted how consumers participated in the snack segment. This resulted in fourth quarter and full year sales and earnings that were below our expectations. Specifically, growth in snacking alternatives and an evolving retail landscape are impacting what consumers buy and where and how they make purchases. Higher-income consumers continue to ask for simple ingredients, health and wellness. And millennials view brands and brand attributes beyond traditional transparency to include social responsibility. They are also interacting with media differently.
Now let me share with you some of the things that we're doing to address this. Our R&D and innovation teams continue to make progress on new confectionery and snack products that enable us to offer great confectionery products and increase the breadth of our portfolio. Later this year, in the Club Channel, we will be introducing Brookside dark chocolate fruit-and-nut snack bars.
Building on our snacks and adjacencies strategy, earlier today, we announced that we entered into an agreement to acquire KRAVE Jerky, which enables us to enter the rapidly growing meat snacks category. We're really excited about this acquisition and the opportunity to participate in the $2.5 billion meat snacks category that's growing at a double-figure rate.
While snacks and adjacencies is a lever in our long-term sales algorithm, we're very focused on confectionery. It's who we are and it's our namesake. We have a lot of CMG innovation this year that I'll talk to in a moment, but we also have a meaningful new product pipeline that gives me confidence that innovation can continue to contribute at least one point of growth to our net sales algorithm on an annual basis. So I remain bullish on the CMG category and our ability to keep increasing market share.
As it relates to simple ingredients and transparency, we've actually done a lot of work here. We haven't leveraged what we've done, as our plan is to move a large portion of our portfolio in this direction. We're building the capability and have made progress to source non-GMO sugar and RSBT-free (sic) [rBST-free] milk for products in the United States. We've already begun this work with key sourcing suppliers here in the U.S., and we'll have more news on this later in the year.
On the media front, we expect that advertising and related consumer promotion will increase at a rate greater than sales. Included in this is a greater proportion of investment in digital advertising on programs consumers view on their mobile devices via traditional networks, user-generated content and sources like BuzzFeed. So we're making investments that will benefit the company in the near and long term. And we'll have more on this at CAGNY, so let's move on.
I was satisfied with improved results in the convenience store, large mass retail and dollar store channels, especially in the second half of the year. However, FDMx nonseasonal candy performance was not in line with our initial plans. Lower retail store traffic, greater levels of in-store activity by broader snacking manufacturers and continued economic challenges for a segment of consumers in these channels impacted our nonseasonal candy growth.
Looking at total xAOC+C-store retail takeaway, U.S. marketplace performance sequentially improved throughout the year. Hershey fourth quarter retail takeaway of 3.8% was greater than the category growth of 2.2%, resulting in a market share gain of 0.5 points. Marketplace performance was greater than 4Q net sales given solid Halloween and holiday sales, a portion of which shipped in the third quarter; the timing of the buy-in related to the price increase, as a portion of third quarter net sales would have normally occurred in the fourth quarter; and the lapping of the strong year-ago period when select retailers increased inventory levels.
Driving our fourth quarter takeaway results were improvements in convenience stores, large mass retail and dollar stores. These were the channels where many of our second half initiatives were focused, so I was pleased with the results. The programming and execution changes we made in the FDMx and Club Channel simply require a longer lead time to impact in-store merchandising activity, hence our sales mix and lower-than-forecast category growth impacted profitability and margins.
Let me now talk about 2015, where our focus will be on restoring our U.S. momentum.
We have a solid lineup of new products that will bring variety, news and excitement to the category. In addition to the carryover benefit of Brookside Crunchy Clusters and Reese's Spreads, we're also launching Kit Kat White Minis, Hershey's caramels, Ice Breakers Cool Blast Chews, Reese's Spreads Snacksters, Graham Dippers and some other yet-to-be-announced new products. Additionally, the Reese's brand is leveraging its NCAA relationship and has become an official sponsor of ESPN college football game day. These initiatives are tied into customer-specific merchandising programs and big core brands that should result in higher-quality merchandising versus last year.
Additionally, we're increasing our reach as we're adding incremental headcount to our sales force that will result in hours in store being up mid-single digits. We'll complement this with increased levels of advertising that I mentioned earlier.
We believe the investments we're making across our business positions us for future growth. The dynamics of the confectionery category, impulsivity, conversion rate at checkout, season, multiple pack types are all an advantage. As a result, in 2015, we anticipate that the plans we have in place will help mitigate the volume elasticity related to the price increase, and it will outpace the category and again gain market share.
Let me now provide you with some information on our international business.
For the full year, our international net sales increased nearly 15%, including the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates and positive contribution of about $54 million from Shanghai Golden Monkey. Excluding SGM and unfavorable FX, international net sales increased 10%, a solid number but less than our expectations due to macroeconomic headwinds that have yet to subside and will most likely remain a challenge this year. The Hershey-Golden Monkey integration work is underway and on track.
In 2015, we'll distribute acquired confectionery and protein-based bean curd snacks into the China modern trade, and we expect to have deeper Tier 2 city coverage of some Hershey chocolate products. We're also leveraging newly acquired manufacturing capabilities. In China, Brazil, Mexico and India, we've made solid progress against our planned initiative of investing in go-to-market capabilities and portfolio expansion. In select markets, we launched Reese's and it's off to a good start. Additionally, we're testing additional products, as we look to build out our global brands over the next few years.
Therefore, in 2015, including a negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates and excluding the impact of M&A, we expect international net sales growth to increase around 10%. Including SGM, reported international net sales are expected to be around $1.2 billion by the end of 2015.
By country, our chocolate business in China had a solid year. Chocolate category growth in 2014 was about 12%. Historically, the chocolate category has increased 10% to 11% in the fourth quarter. However, it slowed to around 8% as we see less gifting behind the government policy changes.
Hershey fourth quarter retail takeaway of about 20% was less than our expectation. Importantly, our market share in Q4 increased a full point to around 11%. In Mexico, chocolate category growth in the modern trade 2014 was around 1%. The category and consumer struggled during the year, although trends were better in the second half of the year, with chocolate category growth of 3%. But this is still below the historical growth rate of 7% to 8%. Hershey Mexico chocolate retail takeaway for the year was up around 2%, resulting in a market share gain of 0.3 points. We expect 2015 to be better than last year, albeit in a continuing challenging environment.
Our performance in Brazil sequentially improved as the year progressed. For the year, Brazil chocolate category growth was 1% versus about 5% in recent years. Hershey retail takeaway was up 2%. Our performance was driven by our Hershey tablet bar growth and the launch of Reese's. We'll look to build on this in 2015.
Now to wrap up. Our consumer and customer plans as well as our investment profile for 2015 clearly reflect the learnings from 2014. Our plans are focused, and the investment profile is concentrated in the areas to leverage Hershey's advantage brands and go-to-market strength. Investment in our brands, innovation and capabilities, as well as an increase across all channels in merchandising and programming, positions the company to compete effectively in confectionery and across the broader snack continuum. We believe these investments should generate organic net sales growth, or constant currency sales, excluding M&A and FX impacts, of around 4% to 6% in 2015. This is less than our previous estimate and reflects the macroeconomic headwinds in international markets and the slowly improving U.S. nonseasonal trends.
I typically just talk to net sales with and without M&A. However, when we established our long-term sales target, we didn't anticipate the U.S. dollar being this strong. Given the current backdrop, we expect foreign exchange rates to be greater than our previous estimate and be about 1 percentage point unfavorable in 2015. We estimate that the net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures will be around 2.5 points.
We continue to focus on growth initiatives and margin opportunities behind continuous productivity-improvement initiatives. With the conclusion of the Project Next Century program, in 2015, we'll focus on where the next largest opportunities are for future incremental productivity and cost savings. A portion of any particular savings from this assessment would be reinvested in our CMG and snacks business to accelerate our growth. And we'll provide more information on this at the upcoming CAGNY conference.
I will now turn it over to Bert, who will provide some additional detail on our financial results. Bert?"

It's a pleasure to be here to talk about our results as well as some of the recent M&A activity. As Mark mentioned, I've been very close to all of this, as I have responsibility for the M&A function as well as our international segment.
So let's get started.
Fourth quarter net sales of $2 billion increased 2.7% versus last year, generating adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.04, an increase of 20.9%. As J.P. stated, the sales increase was lower than our expectations, primarily due to lower retail store traffic. Net price realization, mostly in the U.S., was a 3.1-point benefit. Excluding Shanghai Golden Monkey, volume was off 2.3 points due to price elasticity associated with the U.S. price increase announced in July and lower-than-expected nonseasonal sales. The Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition was a 2.7-point benefit, and foreign currency was a 0.8-point headwind.
Q4 U.S. seasonal sales, primarily driven by holiday, increased high single digits on a percentage basis versus last year. Full year seasonal sales were a bp higher given a later Easter in 2014. Conversely, Easter is 15 days shorter in 2015 and will be a headwind this year. From a marketplace perspective, our Halloween and holiday market share increased 0.9 points and 1.1 points, respectively.
International net sales in the fourth quarter increased 28%, including a benefit of about $54 million related to the Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition. Excluding Shanghai Golden Monkey, international net sales increased 8% as reported and 11% on a constant currency basis, as unfavorable FX was greater than anticipated. Macroeconomic headwinds in Q4 led to international sales being lower than our expectations.
Turning to margins. Fourth quarter adjusted gross margin increased by 30 basis points. The increase was driven by net price realization, slightly favorable input costs and supply chain productivity, partially offset by unfavorable sales mix and other supply chain costs.
Fourth quarter adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT increased 17.5% versus last year, generating an adjusted EBIT margin of 18.7%, a 240 basis point increase versus last year. The increase was due to higher gross margin and lower SM&A costs that declined about 5% due primarily to lower employee-related costs. In Q4, advertising was at about the same as last year. As we said throughout the year, advertising GRPs were up mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus 2013.
Now let me provide a bit more detail on our international business.
China continues to drive international net sales growth and, excluding Shanghai Golden Monkey, increased about 35% in both the fourth quarter and for the full year. We anticipate a similar profile in 2015. I am very pleased with the progress we continue to make in China and remain optimistic regarding confectionery growth in both the modern and traditional trade. We will continue to expand our selling capabilities and expect growth in 2015 to be balanced between velocity and distribution gains. We will also expand cross-selling of products between Shanghai Golden Monkey and Hershey China in the coming year. And finally, we were very pleased with our 1.6-point share gain in chocolate in 2014.
In Brazil, Q4 net sales were about the same as last year on a reported basis and increased about 12% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, net sales declined about 3% on a reported basis and increased about 7% on a constant currency basis versus last year. Despite the difficult category environment, we were pleased with a small share gain of 0.1 points. In 2015, we're exploring other go-to-market options together with our current JV partner Bauducco. Our distribution JV with Bauducco has enabled us to double our market share in the last few years. However, we are considering having total control of the selling and distribution function to give us more flexibility and investment options.
In Mexico, fourth quarter net sales declined 6% on a reported basis and were flat on a constant currency basis versus last year. For the full year, net sales declined 8% on a reported basis and 4% on a constant currency basis compared to 2013. Again, our chocolate performance was favorable, with a 0.3-point share gain driven by both velocity and distribution gains. Trends in Mexico are getting better and we expect continued improvement throughout 2015, although still below the historical growth rates.
We have made solid progress against our international strategic plans. We remain committed to our core markets. And we'll continue to make the necessary investments to build distribution capability, brand equity, and drive trial and repeat purchases.
Moving down the P&L.
The fourth quarter interest expense of $21 million was about the same as last year. For the full year, interest expense was $85 million and in line with our expectations. And for 2015, we expect interest expense to be $75 million to $80 million.
The adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter and the full year was 34.5%, in line with our estimates. In 2015, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be similar to last year.
In the fourth quarter, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 223.5 million, leading to adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.04, an increase of 20.9%.
Full year adjusted EBIT increased 5.8% versus last year, generating an adjusted EBIT margin of 19.6% or a 40 basis point increase. The increase was driven by lower SG&A.
Turning now to the balance sheet and to our cash flow.
At the end of the fourth quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year's fourth quarter by $240 million. Accounts receivable was higher by $119 million, primarily due to the Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition, Lotte China consolidation and traditional credit terms provided to our largest customers in China. Inventory was higher by $141 million due to Shanghai Golden Monkey and Lotte, as well as high raw material inventory levels, primarily dairy, that we mentioned in the last quarter. And accounts payable increased by $21 million.
Capital additions, including software, were $139 million in the fourth quarter and $379 million for the full year, in line with our expectations. This included capital related to our manufacturing facility that we are building in Johor, Malaysia. In 2015, we expect CapEx to be in the $375 million to $400 million range.
The company repurchased 2 million of outstanding shares in the fourth quarter and 202 million for the full year. Repurchases of $125 million were against the prior authorization, and $77 million were against the current $250 million repurchase authorization approved in February of 2014. In addition, 32 million of common shares were repurchased in Q4 to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options.
Depreciation and amortization was $59 million in the fourth quarter and $212 million for the full year, in line with expectations.
Dividends paid during the quarter were $115 million and $440 million for the full year.
Cash and short-term investments at the end of fourth quarter were $471 million, slightly below our expectations due to the lower sales.
The company remains well positioned to fund our dividends, working capital, capital expenditure requirements and acquisitions.
Let me close by providing context into our 2015 outlook. As J.P. summarized, in 2015, we have a solid pipeline of targeted innovation, merchandising and programming that can drive pack type and channel growth. In addition, advertising and related consumer marketing expense is expected to increase at a rate greater than net sales growth. As a result, we expect 2015 net sales to increase from 5.5% to 7.5%, including the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates and a net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures of about 2.5 points. This includes the acquisition of Shanghai Golden Monkey and Allan Candy that closed in the fourth quarter, as well as the agreement entered into over the last month to acquire KRAVE Jerky and divest Mauna Loa. We expect the KRAVE and Mauna Loa transactions to close in the first quarter.
Excluding net acquisitions and divestitures, sales are expected to increase 3% to 5%. This is lower than our previous estimate due to the continued macroeconomic headwinds as well as greater-than-initial estimates related to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. And we expect foreign exchange impact to be greater than our previous estimate and have an unfavorable impact of approximately one percentage point on our full year net sales growth.
We continue to have a significant focus on gross margin and expect the previously announced pricing action as well as productivity and cost savings to result in 2015 gross margin expansion of 135 to 145 basis points.
Adjusted earnings per share diluted are expected to increase 8% to 10%, and that includes dilution from acquisitions and divestitures of $0.03 to $0.05 per share.
Before we open it up for Q&A, just a couple of thoughts on the first quarter. Remember that Easter is 2 weeks shorter this year and being sold on at the old price points, which will pressure gross margin. Our international sales profile is similar to prior years, with annual growth primarily driven by second half. Therefore, total first quarter net sales, including M&A, are expected to be around the low end of our annual sales target. Additionally, brand building as well as investments in stocking [ph] capabilities will ramp up in Q1.
Given all these moving parts, EPS growth is expected to be pressured in the first quarter and higher as the year progresses.

And we are encouraged with some of the things we're seeing as we deconstruct the weekly data. So you're correct. The nonseasonal FDMx sales has been the biggest drag on our business. So we feel good about the fact that in the fourth quarter, we saw improvement. We continued to grow ahead of the category. And it was really a result of, we think, improved focus in merchandising in specific channels. In FDMx, it's a slower build there because the planning cycle is also different, but there's a couple of things that we're seeing. And if we look at the weekly data and when you get the most recent quad, you're going to see that we're making good progression from a share standpoint. We think that reflects some of the changes we've made in merchandising. One of the other things that we're seeing is that trips continue to be negative, although they're getting better but negative, and of course that continues to affect the ends of [ph] consumer because this is all everyday business. Because if people aren't in the store, you lose that instant consumable piece. So we're very focused on that. There's a piece of data that I recently looked at for our brand specifically that within the trip, there's an increase in actual purchase size. So the trips that we're getting purchase size is actually up, but the one caveat I'll make with that is keep in mind, with the fourth quarter, you have some seasonal influence, so that could be part of it, but in the weekly data, and this is all home skin [ph] information, we do have some real encouragement there. So I feel good about what I'm beginning to see. Anecdotally, as you talk to retailers, I would say that I'm hearing some of those same kinds of sentiments echoed. And then of course, we all are aware that the consumers have a lot of pressure at the bottom of the economic pyramid. And it's still yet to be seen how that consumer participates in the market, but for the total, I think I'm encouraged."

Today, we're firmly at 1 point and we'll see where that goes. Hopefully, the dollar starts to stabilize a bit. When we look at the international business, we're probably closer to around 13% back then and we've lowered it to around 10%, as J.P. mentioned. The macroeconomy has gotten a little tougher in places like Brazil and Mexico. We saw a little bit of a slowdown in China in the fourth quarter, but we worry less about that. A lot -- we've had a lot of momentum going into Chinese New Year. But certainly, what J.P. talked about in terms of some pickup on the everyday business and some -- and a little bit lower expectations, at least for 2015, in international is what's made the biggest difference. We've also had a little pressure on our export business, which while it's not huge, it is very profitable. And as you can imagine, the currency into some of these markets also has some impact."

You get this magnitude of price increase. Your #2 commodity, dairy, is now in free fall. And I know you've bought forward to some extent. That's understandable, but it looks to me like your cost bucket item is flat to down exiting the year. Like, is there something I'm missing as to why that margin expansion is so small and how that might pace [ph] over the year? And then third and finally, can you give us a sense what kind of volume you're thinking globally associated with this guidance?

The best way to think about the pricing is that, as we move through the year, there are still some activities that are under the old price certainly around the seasonal business, so you'll begin to see that have a greater impact in Q2 and Q3. And then as you think about getting through the end of '15, we continue to model the elasticity at about a 1:1 rate in terms of volume and price, so by the time we get to the first quarter of 2016, our modeling would suggest that we're back to a whole environment or back to 100 in terms of volume contribution to our growth. So that's the way I would think about it broadly. There's a lot of movement still, but as we look at some of our channel modeling, there's nothing that we're seeing that would cause us to believe that it would be any different than how we've planned it. And as you know, when we were increasing advertising at a very rapid rate back in 2008, '09 and 2011, there might have been a little bit of a faster conversion rate, but we think the way we've currently modeled it is probably about right."

As we think about our gross margin expansion, we're expecting 135 to 145 basis points. We're coming off a year when we're actually down on gross margin, first time in a long time. We did start to see a pickup in the fourth quarter slightly below where we thought. When we look at our year-on-year commodities, well, I won't talk specifically about hedging program, but clearly, cocoa is still on average at higher prices than it was in our '14 standard. And that's really a function of as we roll out our commodity program in an environment of increasing costs and we've seen cocoa increase pretty dramatically. Obviously, you have -- you may have some of your lower hedges rolling off and are buying into a little bit higher market. So while we've seen some improvement recently, and that's good, we still have cocoa that's higher than '14 levels. So that does have some -- a bit of an impact in terms of how you're thinking about the expansion. And the other thing is, as J.P. mentioned, our profile for 2015 is driven by pricing. So we're expecting 5 to 6 points of pricing and 1 to 2 points of lower volume. And that lower volume does pressure our absorption in the plants, and so you don't get the full benefit of that until, as you get later in the year, as J.P. mentioned, we start to recover the pre-price-increase volume. So some volume impact as we work through the price elasticity. And while some commodities are clearly in a better place, like dairy and sugar, we do still have higher cocoa prices year-on-year. So that's helping to mitigate to some degree what might be otherwise larger gross margin expansion."

And then my second question is actually more about the acquisition strategy from here.

And so I think",539,"Yes, Alexia, to your first question, around the category, my answer would be no. I don't think there's anything structural that's going on here. One interesting piece of data is household penetration actually went up for our brands in 2014. And so I think the thing that we're seeing is potentially several-fold. So 2014, there were a lot of moving parts in terms of macroeconomic influences on consumers, so we see that. The trips piece for a business like ours which has this everyday component is, certainly, an impact that people aren't in stores. And I think that is more -- there's a real consumer strata influence there that I think has to be dealt with. And then in terms of let's just talk about the consumer themselves: I do believe there's an evolution always happening with consumers and the relationships they have with brands. I think some of the smaller brands have done a very good job of resonating with some of the on-trend things that consumers talk about. And we can talk separately about KRAVE here in a second, of why we think that's an on-trend product uniquely positioned within that particular segment. But as we saw takeaway improve throughout the year, we felt we became a more competitive company responding to some of the -- just things that are happening within the category. And consumers, of course, have broader choices. What we see happening almost everywhere, and I'm very optimistic about how this plays to our strengths, is that snacking and portable snacking is not just a short-term event. This is really a trend, and it's becoming a habit. And if you look at the way the number of meals people have during the day, they have broader options on the menu of how to participate in that. We just have to be competitive. And we have to be competitive with the brands we have that are within the core of The Hershey Company, our confectionery products. We're expanding brands like Brookside, which have a nice halo effect of goodness. And then we also see ourselves, as we've talked about, expanding across a broader snacking continuum. And even if you talk, even if you think about China and a brand, our bean curd, in China, that's a product that brings protein. It's on-trend in terms of being a ""snacking on the go"" brand. So we just see that being more and more important in terms of consumer trend. And so as a company, we have to adapt to where the consumer is headed. We talked about simple ingredients with GMO-free. If you think about a chocolate bar, there's really only 4 components in a chocolate bar. So we should be talking about the simplicity of that in responding to the transparency that consumers want, and we're doing that. So I'm very optimistic about all of those things. Why don't we let -- Alexia, you were -- you set us up nicely to talk about KRAVE. I -- Michele Buck, who's the President of North America and was very, very involved with the acquisition for KRAVE, is here, so why don't I give her a chance to just talk for a couple of minutes about the acquisition?"

One of the areas that we've seen a lot of consumer interest in is portable nutrition and protein-based snacking. So as we look at that marketplace, clearly, one of the categories that's really meeting consumers' needs is meat snacks. Meat snacks is a category that is one of the fastest growing, growing double digit in the U.S. this past year and over the past several years. Household penetration is expanding. So household penetration is only about 31%, but it continues to grow, grew 2 points this past year. So clearly, it's meeting a lot of consumer needs. And as we looked at that category,  KRAVE was interesting to us because KRAVE is really playing in the fastest-growing segment of the meat snacks category, the better-for-you premium segment. So we really like the brand. We think it has tremendous potential. The product proposition has a unique point of difference with a great taste, a texture. It's a culinary-inspired kind of profile. And we think that there's a lot of potential. And they continue to bring new consumers into the meat snacks category in the marketplace for us to leverage Hershey's strengths in supply chain, consumer insights and retail to really drive the business.

I think, Eric, if you look historically, the premium, as we've sort of defined it over time, is somewhere around 7% or 8% of the total category. In good economic times, it always tends to grow and expand in terms of space. Some of that growth is driven by distribution. And then in more difficult economic times, usually the distribution in category contraction goes along with it. I think what it speaks to in the current environment is the top end of the economic pyramid is fine and the consumer that participates there has the ability to participate. And I also think that part of the category has, in many ways, a clear message to the consumer also that is around, sometimes, ingredients and so forth. So I believe that that's what we're seeing more than anything else. I agree with you. We've not done a good job in the premium space. We're spending a lot of time right now on how we want to participate in premium. We're pushing up some within our -- the middle of our portfolio, certainly with products like Brookside, which takes us up a little bit. You'll see some of the innovation we have this year which will also do that. And then we're looking strongly at our brands like Scharffen Berger and trying to make an effort to see how we can play differently with those brands. So we're not going to ignore that. I think, in the past, we have not done a good job. We want to reorient ourselves a bit there. And then it's still problematic for the consumers that are participating in the category. So you will see some category expansion from that space, but I think that the overall category really will continue to be driven by mass products."

We advertise in like, I think, only about 20% or 25% of the cities that the leading competitor in the market does, so as we continue to expand that, and our household penetration grows. We can talk about what's the right GDP for China, but if you think about an emerging middle class and our portfolio over time, we have a tremendous amount of runway there.

Let me remind everyone listening to today's conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations which are subject to risks and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2014 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. The non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.
As a result, we will discuss 2015 first quarter results, excluding net pretax charges of $9.7 million or $0.02 per share diluted and a gain on the sale of a trademark of $10 million or $0.03 per share diluted. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges. With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey."

While our sales and earnings performance for the quarter was mixed, I was happy with the progress that we made in key areas, particularly in the U.S. business where operating and marketplace performance was in line with our expectations. We completed the KRAVE acquisition towards the end of March and we began the integration work. We can now begin to shares snacking insights related to consumer and market segmentation, as well as distribution and channel opportunities.
As we stated in January and at CAGNY, we expected first quarter sales and earnings to be pressure due to Easter timing, as seasonal net sales occurred at pre-price increase levels. However, Q1 results were lower than we anticipated due to some unexpected softness in China. The weakness was across the majority of the consumer packaged goods space in the China modern trade. The acceleration of this softness in the first quarter versus Q4 was unexpected. Chocolate was one of the few categories in China that grew in the first quarter, although less than last year. In China, Hershey's slightly outpaced the category and gained market share. However, the pace of growth slowed significantly. Mark will provide you with additional financial details, so let me give you an overview of the business.
Overall, total company Q1 net sales, excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates, increased 4.6%, driven primarily by pricing and net benefit from acquisitions of 1.6 points. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate was a 1.1 headwind. Our expectation was for adjusted earnings per share diluted to be about the same as last year, so the dollar $1.09 that we earned was largely due to unexpected international sales growth. 
Including Easter, seasonal activity in the year-ago and current period, the candy, mint and gum, or CMG category, increased 3.9% for the 12 weeks ended March 21, 2015, within the xAOC+C channels. Gum continues to underperform. And excluding it, the chocolate -- non-chocolate and mint categories increased about 4.2%. Excluding Easter, seasonal activity in the current and year ago period combined growth of chocolate, non- chocolate and mints was up 3%.
Hershey's first quarter CMG retail takeaway in the xAOC+C universe was 4.6%, benefiting from an earlier Easter versus last year. We had a good Easter and believe we will gain share in this important season. 
Excluding Easter seasonal sales, Hershey's everyday marketplace performance continues to improve. Specifically, Hershey's xAOC+C CMG retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ending March 21, excluding Easter seasonal sales in the current and year ago period, increased plus 3.1%. 
Perhaps the easiest way to assess performance given seasonal timing is by looking at absolute market share results.
We gained market share, both with and without the Easter seasonal activity. All in, including the seasonal activity, Hershey's first quarter CMG market share in the xAOC+C universe increased plus 0.2 points. 
U.S. first quarter organic net sales of nearly 3%. Seasonal sales, roughly 1/4 of our business in the first quarter, declined year-over-year due to a shorter Easter season. This was more than offset by our Everyday business, which I'm pleased to say, increased mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year. This is slightly ahead of Everyday retail takeaway of 3.1% due to the timing and shipments of second quarter promotions and new products. 
In the second quarter, we believe our Everyday momentum will continue with the broader rollout and launch of Ice Breakers Cool Blasts Chews, Hershey's Caramels and additional Lancaster cream flavors. And Hershey's first quarter xAOC+C chocolate retail takeaway, excluding Easter, was up 3.3%, resulting in chocolate market share gains of 0.6 points. Importantly, retail takeaway was solid across many of core chocolate franchises, including Reese's, Hershey's, Kit Kat, Kisses and Brookside.
Switching to non-chocolate candy or NCC, in the xAOC+C channels, Hershey's NCC business, excluding Easter in the current and year ago period, declined 2%, as we were lapping the year-ago launch of the Lancaster product line. We anticipate that our NCC performance will be a bit better over the next couple of quarters, supported by Lancaster in-store sampling events, national FSIs and some Summer Fun flavors of Twizzlers. 
While not as large as chocolate, in NCC, we continued to do well within the gum and the mint categories. Specifically, our Q1 gum and mints retail takeaway within the xAOC+C universe was up 11% and 10.5%, respectively. As a result, our gum market share increased by 0.4 points to 5.2%. Our mint market share increased 0.7 points, expanding our segment leading position to 40.3%.
In the C store classic trade where the seasonal impacts are minimal, the CMG category was up 5.1%, driven by pricing. As it relates to the previously announced price increase, volume elasticity trends are tough to discern in the x AOC universe given the influence of seasonal candy on shelf at pre-price increase levels. However, conversion appears to be on track.
Total Hershey's C-store performance was solid, with retail takeaway up plus 4.8%. It was driven by pricing of 9 to 10 points, offset by volume elasticity of about 5%. This is relatively in line with our modeling for this channel. 
Our C-store chocolate and mint retail takeaway was particularly solid, up 4.9% and 8.9%, respectively. These gains were driven by core brand advertising, in-store selling, merchandising and programming.
International results were mixed in the first quarter, given greater than expected unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and China retail softness that impacted overall grocery, as well as the chocolate category growth. Recall during last quarter's conference call, we've stated that chocolate category growth in China was about 8%, and that was less than the historical 10% to 11%. 
In the first quarter, chocolate category growth was 4%, again, softer than we would have anticipated and less than the year-ago period. Given the Chinese New Year holiday, the first quarter is typically the biggest quarter of the year for chocolate consumption. Some of this softness is most likely due to government policy related to gifting. However, macroeconomic news indicates things have significantly slowed, and this could be impacting overall consumer confidence. This is evident when looking at Nielsen data for the broader CBG Group, which are also soft. Our chocolate retail takeaway in China was about 5% in the first quarter, resulting in a market share gain of 0.1 points. 
In all of the markets where we operate, our goal is to shift to consumption, so that consumer has a good experience related to freshness and taste. Therefore, our China first quarter net sales moderated and declined 47% versus a year ago. We will continue to execute against plans with our retail partners in China to drive store traffic and in-store activity over the remainder of the year.
As a result, our China chocolate plan reflects the first quarter and remains relatively intact versus our initial plan. We have made some adjustments on how we'll get there. We expect to enter some Tier 2 cities, and we'll increase the level of in-store sampling to drive Everyday trial and repeat. Additionally, we are beginning to get Brookside out of the market out into the market and using Golden Monkey distributor assets to help us achieve that. 
Shanghai Golden Monkey integration is progressing. In the first quarter, Golden Monkey was dilutive to our earnings. However, results will be stronger in the second half of the year, supported by a solid pipeline of snack and non-chocolate candy new products.
In Mexico, first quarter constant currency net sales increased about 16%. As expected, our business has sequentially improved over the last 3 quarters, as consumers have adjusted to the VAT tax instituted last year. Importantly, the chocolate category increased about 13%. We estimate that Hershey retail takeaway was up about 12%, driven by Hershey's spikes and a king-sized Q1 event at some selective retailers.
Over the remainder of the year, we have a lot of in-store activity planned, highlighting new packaging designs and pack types that we believe will generate solid net sales growth.
In Brazil, first quarter constant currency net sales increased about 18%. The results benefited from an easy comp versus a year ago period and an earlier Easter. Although note that we don't have a broad Easter portfolio on Brazil, it's the big kiss offering is our primary seasonal item. 
Hersey's tablet bar performance was good. And while small, Reese's is starting to gain traction in Brazil. 
Despite fixed international results in the first quarter, we remain confident about plans over the remainder of the year. We have made adjustments where necessary and have the right mix of innovation and in-store activity to achieve our objectives. 
Our international growth profile, excluding Golden Monkey, is similar to prior years and driven by performance in the second half, particularly the fourth quarter. However, foreign currency exchange rates remained volatile. And over the remainder of the year, the unfavorable impact on net sales is expected to be greater than our previous estimate. Given this backdrop and first quarter softness in China, we now expect international net sales, excluding the benefit of Golden Monkey, to increase about 5% versus our previous expectation of about a 10% increase.
Now to wrap up. 
Core brand merchandising, programming and innovation accelerates over the remainder of the year. There is no change to our advertising and marketing methodology. And we continued to expect that it will increase at a rate greater than net sales growth. We believe these investments should generate full year organic net sales growth or constant currency sales, excluding M&A and FX impacts, of around 3.5% to 4.5% in 2015. We expect foreign exchange rates to be greater than our previous estimate by about 0.5 point and be about 1.5 points unfavorable in 2015.
We continued to estimate that the net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures will be around 2.5 points.
With a profitable U.S. Business on track, an increase in gross margin expansion and Golden Monkey accretion later in the year, we expect an increase in 2015 full year adjusted earnings per share diluted of 8% to 10%, including dilution from acquisitions and divestitures of $0.03 to $0.05 per share. 
Before we provide you with additional financial details, I like to take this opportunity to welcome Patricia Little, our CFO as of March 16. Patricia is a seasoned financial leader who knows how to create shareholder value and develop talent. And we believe will be a benefit to our global organization and all of our shareholders."

98873,290550755,792616,"The Hershey Company, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,"Earnings Calls","The Hershey Company","Executives","Thank you, Patricia. Good morning to everyone on the phone and webcast.First quarter net sales of $1.9 billion was up 3.5% versus the prior year. Excluding the negative impact on foreign currency exchange rates of 1.1 point, about 0.5 point greater that",1538,"Thank you, Patricia. Good morning to everyone on the phone and webcast.
First quarter net sales of $1.9 billion was up 3.5% versus the prior year. Excluding the negative impact on foreign currency exchange rates of 1.1 point, about 0.5 point greater that estimate, net sales increased 4.6%. The fluctuation in the Canadian dollar was responsible for about half of the FX impact in the Mexican peso and Brazilian real, the majority of the remainder. 
As we indicated last quarter, given the shorter Easter, volume elasticity related to the U.S. price increase and the timing of innovation, we expect that consolidated net sales growth in Q1 to be around the low-end of our long-term target. However, we didn't anticipate the anomaly in China that J.P. referred to. 
Pricing and net M&A was at 3.8 point and 1.6 point benefit, partially offset by volume, that was a  0 point and point headwind. Importantly, North America organic net sales, excluding FX and M&A, increased 3.4%, relatively in line with our expectations. North America pricing of 4.3 points was partially offset by volume that was up 0.9 points due to elasticity related to the price increase and lower seasonal sales.
International and Other segment net sales increased 8.5%, driven by the Golden Monkey acquisition, a 13.3 point benefit, while FX was a 4.8 point headwind. International and Other segment organic net sales were above the same as last year. 
As we stated in January, first quarter EPS will be pressured. Our expectation was for adjusted EPS to be about the same as last year due to seasonal product sales that occurred at reprice increased level and our plan for higher SM&A expenses.
However, we did not anticipate the lower levels of growth in China within the biggest cities and hypermarkets. This impacted chocolate category growth in the quarter, as well as some of our decisions related to Golden Monkey go-to-market strategies. Hence, adjusted EPS diluted of $1.09, down about 5% versus last year, was off versus our plan, primarily due to China chocolate sales and Golden Monkey dilution.
Turning now to margins. In the first quarter
[Audio Gap]
First quarter adjusted gross margin increased 10 basis points driven by supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives, as well as the net price realization, which more than offset higher input costs. 
Earlier this month, we implemented select input costs strategies that we believe will enable growth gross margin to increase 155 to 165 basis points for the full year. 
Adjusted EBIT in the first quarter declined 5.6% versus last year, resulting in adjusted EBIT margin of 20.3%. The decline was driven by higher SM&A expenses that increased 12.3% versus last year. 
Looking at a couple of the pieces. 
Advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased about 8%. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses, including advertising and related consumer marketing, increased about 15%. This increase reflects the addition of Golden Monkey, investments in mark to market capabilities in U.S. and international markets, as well as knowledgebase consumer insights.
Let me now provide you with a brief update on the International business. 
Similar to prior years, our expectation entering 2015 was for International net sales growth would be back half weighted. We still believe that will be the case, given our plans for advertising, merchandising, programming and new products. 
Q1 international net sales increased 8.8%. Note that this excludes global retail and licensing results, which was relatively in line with expectations. 
Looking at our focus markets. We believe China chocolate category's softness was impacted by consumer confidence, given all the negative headlines we've all seen like slowing GDP growth, although we were encouraged that margin Nielsen data showed an acceleration in category growth versus January and February. Over the remainder of the year, we expect net sales growth in China to sequentially improve, although it will be driven by performance in the second half of the year. 
We have adjusted our China plans to generate greater in-store activities to support faster growth in the hypermarkets, while we're entering some Tier 2 cities and we have plans to increase our exposure in the fast-growing e-commerce channel. 
On a constant currency basis, net sales in Mexico and Brazil increased midteens on a percentage basis versus last year due to easier comps. Recall that at the beginning of '14, we have the headwind of the back tax enactment in Mexico and volume U.S. elasticity related to the price increase in Brazil. We expect Mexico and Brazil performance to be better than last year. However, we expect the real and peso to remain volatile and be a major headwind related to reported net sales. 
Moving down the P&L. 
First quarter interest expense of $19.2 million declined $2.2 million versus last year. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be in the $75 million to $80 million range. 
The adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was 35%, in line with our estimate. For the full year, we expect the adjusted net tax rate to be slightly lower than the year-ago rate of 34.5%. This is a little different from our initial analysis and guidance that the full year adjusted tax rate would be about the same as last year.
For the first quarter of 2015, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 222.7 million, a 1.9% decline compared to last year.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. 
At the end of the first quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year's first quarter by $69.2 million. Accounts receivable was lower by $13.8 million and remains extremely recurring. Inventory was higher by 67 million, and accounts payable declined by $16 million. The net increase in trading capital was driven by acquisitions. Excluding net acquisitions and divestitures, net trading capital increased $7 million. 
In terms of other specific cash flow items. 
Total capital additions, including software, were $62.7 million in the first quarter. For the year, we expect total capital expense just to be about $375 million to $400 million, including capital related to the Johor, Malaysia project of about $110 million. Excluding this project, CapEx is about $275 million or about 3.5% of net sales.
Depreciation and amortization was $58.3 million in the first quarter, in line with our estimate. During the first quarter, dividends paid were $114 million. The company repurchased $173 million of outstanding shares in the first quarter against the February 2014 authorization which is now complete. No shares have been purchased against the $250 million authorization approved in February 2015. This authorization is in addition to the company's policy of repurchasing shares in the open market related to issues in connection with stock option exercises. In the first quarter, the company repurchased $134 million of common shares to replace shares issued in connection with exercise of stock options.
Cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter were up $405 million. 
As J.P. summarized, in 2015, we have a solid pipeline of innovation, merchandising and programming. In addition, marketing expense is expected to increase at a rate greater that net sales growth. As a result we expect 2015 net sales to increase 4.5% to 5.5%, including a net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures of around 2.5 points and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate of about 1.5 points. 
Excluding these items, organic net sales are expected to increase 3.5% to 4.5% versus the previous 4% to 6%. While we remain confident in our business plans, a narrowing of the sales range reflects the global macroeconomic challenges that continued to persist. The decline of the lower end of the range by 0.5 points primarily reflects the first quarter China underperformance. We continued to have a significant focus on gross margin and expect that the previously announced price increase, as well as productivity and cost savings, to result in gross margin expansion of 155 to 165 basis points. 
Combined with a slightly lower net tax rate and Golden Monkey accretion in the second half of the year, adjusted earnings per share diluted is expected to increase 8% to 10%. 
Before we open it up to Q&A, just a couple of thoughts on the second quarter. 
We have plans to generate solid gross margin expansion over the remaining quarters. However, the second quarter is typically our smallest quarter as it relates to overall net sales. And our international sales profile is similar to prior years, with annual growth primarily driven by fourth quarter performance. Additionally, Golden Monkey will be dilutive in the second quarter before ramping up in the second half of the year. While small, KRAVE margins are lower than the company average and it will also contribute in increase in total consolidated SM&A expense in the second quarter. 
Therefore, second quarter net sales, including M&A and FX, is expected to be at near the low-end of our full year sales target of 4.5% to 5.5% before accelerating in the second half of the year. Given all these moving parts, we expect second quarter EPS diluted growth to be pressured and around the same as last year.

We think there's lot of this is a cyclical based on what you're hearing, GDP and consumer confidence, things we already mentioned. We don't think it's that's much structural, in fact, the structural changes would think actually help us in the long run, things like urbanization, as well as more of a consumer economy, which is the government's pushing. But no, we've lowered certainly the overall year expectations. We'd said we'd be somewhere around 30 and that the category would be in the low double digits. We certainly lowered to that to high-single digits. Still think we can to 2x to 3x the category growth rate, but we certainly lowered that overall year expectation, not trying to make up the first quarter."

BPCE snacks which continue to perform really well, and obviously, we are encouraged by KRAVE. But I think we're in an era where the snacking continuum and the occasions of snacking are broadening, and therefore, consumer choice is greater. And so we have to work hard at making sure that, at the point-of-sale, our brands are winning in terms of merchandising, et cetera. I tell you the one thing that if I -- it's I personally have a takeaway from the first quarter that I feel better about than anything else we probably could talk about on this call, is that we've seen a strengthening our Everyday business. And so if you take Easter out and all of the previous quarters and all, and you just looked at what's the health of Everyday business, we are doing -- our Everyday brands are up. And importantly, that's always a measure of advertising effectiveness.

Let -- I would tell you that as a consumer insight driven company, a brand building company, we are going to always be focused on growth and growing our brands. The cost is a lever and it's an important one. So look, I mean if we can all capture synergies in our business via acquisitions and add-ons and making sure that we've got P&L leverage, we absolutely have to be focused against that because the investments that we make have to pay for themselves. But first and foremost, we have a business model that we want to pursue. So yes, I think there is some very good reminders in the marketplace that suggests that, listen, you got to make sure you're not getting fat, but you also have to make sure that along the way you're not getting fat, you're allocating resources in a way that you can win in the marketplace on a going basis, and so that's important. If I come back to the first part of your question, we are balancing those investments, both internationally and in the U.S. So we've proven over and over again that the passion of our sales organization, our feet on the Street, represent us better than any other choice we could make. I have also seen some evidence in the marketplace where some other companies are coming to that conclusion as well. But for our company, we continued to be focused against those investments. And the only way we can grow our brands in these new markets is to forward invest in the capabilities that make them broadly available to consumers and we will continue to do that, but we'll do that in the most effective and efficient way we possibly can."

And then kind of the question here is, 47%, of course, every time you read a number like that on a company like this, you do a double take to make sure you didn't misread it. I think the takeaway here, but this is the question, is the 47% decline in the China business is an inventory adjustment essentially, so that in 4Q, you had massive shipments of product to retail, anticipating something like a 30% growth in the first quarter in China. First quarter China retail, I think you guys said, was 5% for Hershey products. And hence, that requires a massive change in the shipment pattern in Q1. Bert, Am I putting all this together right?"

And you're quite right. As we anticipated the growth in the first quarter for Chinese New Year and didn't see that coming along, we obviously shipped less into the marketplace because JP mentioned earlier I think in his remarks, we shipped to the consumption consumption pattern is. We don't expect that will be made up for the rest of the year, so we've adjusted down our growth, although we think the rest of the year, it should be more normalized than what we saw during the Chinese New Year."

Can you give us a sense, maybe your waves of full years gross margins, so can you give us a sense how much maybe mix or performance in the International business affects gross margin versus, if it were just say a north -- that extra growth in International you're expecting effects, the consolidated gross margin versus if it were say just the North American business experiencing that 4-plus-percent pricing and modest volume decline?"

Welcome to The Hershey Company's First Quarter 2015 Conference Call. J.P. Bilbrey, Chairman, President and CEO, and I will provide you with an overview of results, followed by a Q&A session.
Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2014 filed with the SEC.
If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Note section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. The non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes that presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.
As a result, we will discuss 2015 first quarter results, excluding net pretax charges of $9.7 million or $0.02 per share diluted and a gain on the sale of a trademark of $10 million or $0.03 per share diluted. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges.
With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey."

While our sales and earnings performance for the quarter was mixed, I was happy with the progress that we made in key areas, particularly in the U.S. business, where operating and marketplace performance was in line with our expectations. We completed the KRAVE acquisition towards the end of March, and we begun the integration work. We can now begin to share snacking insights related to consumer and market segmentation, as well as distribution and channel opportunities.
As we stated in January and at CAGNY, we expected first quarter sales and earnings to be pressured due to Easter timing, as seasonal net sales occurred at pre-price increase levels. However, Q1 results were lower than we anticipated due to some unexpected softness in China. The weakness was across the majority of the consumer packaged goods space in the China modern trade. The acceleration of this softness in the first quarter versus Q4 was unexpected.
Chocolate was one of the few categories in China that grew in the first quarter, although less than last year. In China, Hershey's slightly outpaced the category and gained market share, however, the pace of growth slowed significantly. Mark will provide you with additional financial details, so let me give you an overview of the business.
Overall, total company Q1 net sales, excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates, increased 4.6%, driven primarily by pricing and net benefit from acquisitions of 1.6 points. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate was a 1.1 headwind. Our expectation was for adjusted earnings per share diluted to be about the same as last year, so the $1.09 that we earned was largely due to lower-than-expected international sales growth.
Including Easter, seasonal activity in the year-ago and current period, the candy, mint and gum, or CMG category, increased 3.9% for the 12 weeks ended March 21, 2015, within the xAOC+C channels. Gum continues to underperform. And excluding it, the chocolate -- non-chocolate and mint categories increased about 4.2%. Excluding Easter, seasonal activity in the current and year-ago period, combined growth of chocolate, non-chocolate and mints, was up 3%.
Hershey's first quarter CMG retail takeaway in the xAOC+C universe was 4.6%, benefiting from an earlier Easter versus last year. We had a good Easter and believe we will gain share in this important season.
Excluding Easter seasonal sales, Hershey's everyday marketplace performance continues to improve. Specifically, Hershey's xAOC+C CMG retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ending March 21, excluding Easter seasonal sales in the current and year-ago period, increased plus 3.1%.
Perhaps, the easiest way to assess performance, given seasonal timing, is by looking at absolute market share results. We gained market share, both with and without the Easter seasonal activity. All in, including the seasonal activity, Hershey's first quarter CMG market share in the xAOC+C universe increased plus 0.2 points.
U.S. first quarter organic net sales of nearly 3%. Seasonal sales, roughly 1/4 of our business in the first quarter, declined year-over-year due to a shorter Easter season. This was more than offset by our everyday business, which I'm pleased to say increased mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year. This is slightly ahead of everyday retail takeaway of 3.1% due to the timing and shipments of second quarter promotions and new products.
In the second quarter, we believe our everyday momentum will continue with the broader rollout and launch of Ice Breakers Cool Blasts Chews, Hershey's Caramels and additional Lancaster cream flavors. And Hershey's first quarter xAOC+C chocolate retail takeaway, excluding Easter, was up 3.3%, resulting in chocolate market share gains of 0.6 points. Importantly, retail takeaway was solid across many of core chocolate franchises, including Reese's, Hershey's, Kit Kat, Kisses and Brookside.
Switching to non-chocolate candy, or NCC, in the xAOC+C channels, Hershey's NCC business, excluding Easter in the current and year-ago period, declined 2%, as we were lapping the year-ago launch of the Lancaster product line. We anticipate that our NCC performance will be a bit better over the next couple of quarters, supported by Lancaster in-store sampling events, national FSIs and some Summer Fun flavors of Twizzlers.
While not as large as chocolate, in NCC, we continued to do well within the gum and the mint categories. Specifically, our Q1 gum and mint retail takeaway within the xAOC+C universe was up 11% and 10.5%, respectively. As a result, our gum market share increased by 0.4 points to 5.2%. Our mint market share increased 0.7 points, expanding our segment leading position to 40.3%.
In the C-store class of trade, where the seasonal impacts are minimal, the CMG category was up 5.1%, driven by pricing. As it relates to the previously announced price increase, volume elasticity trends are tough to discern in the xAOC universe, given the influence of seasonal candy on shelf at pre-price increase levels. However, conversion appears to be on track.
Total Hershey's C-store performance was solid, with retail takeaway up plus 4.8%. It was driven by pricing of 9 to 10 points, offset by volume elasticity of about 5%. This is relatively in line with our modeling for this channel.
Our C-store chocolate and mint retail takeaway was particularly solid, up 4.9% and 8.9%, respectively. These gains were driven by core brand advertising, in-store selling, merchandising and programming.
International results were mixed in the first quarter, given greater-than-expected unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and China retail softness that impacted overall grocery, as well as the chocolate category growth. Recall during last quarter's conference call, we've stated that chocolate category growth in China was about 8%, and that was less than the historical 10% to 11%.
In the first quarter, chocolate category growth was 4%, again, softer than we would have anticipated and less than the year-ago period.
Given the Chinese New Year holiday, the first quarter is typically the biggest quarter of the year for chocolate consumption. Some of this softness is most likely due to government policy related to giving -- gifting. However, macroeconomic news indicates things have significantly slowed, and this could be impacting overall consumer confidence. This is evident when looking at Nielsen data for the broader CPG group, which was also soft. Our chocolate retail takeaway in China was about 5% in the first quarter, resulting in a market share gain of 0.1 points.
In all of the markets where we operate, our goal is to shift to consumption so that consumer has a good experience related to freshness and taste. Therefore, our China first quarter net sales moderated and declined 47% versus a year ago. We will continue to execute against plans with our retail partners in China to drive store traffic and in-store activity over the remainder of the year.
As a result, our China chocolate plan reflects the first quarter miss and remains relatively intact versus our initial plan. We have made some adjustments on how we'll get there. We expect to enter some Tier 2 cities, and we'll increase the level of in-store sampling to drive everyday trial and repeat. Additionally, we're beginning to get Brookside out of the market -- out into the market and using Golden Monkey distributor assets to help us achieve that.
Shanghai Golden Monkey integration is progressing. In the first quarter, Golden Monkey was dilutive to our earnings, however, results will be stronger in the second half of the year, supported by a solid pipeline of snack and non-chocolate candy new products.
In Mexico, first quarter constant currency net sales increased about 16%. As expected, our business has sequentially improved over the last 3 quarters, as consumers have adjusted to the VAT tax instituted last year. Importantly, the chocolate category increased about 13%. We estimate that Hershey retail takeaway was up about 12%, driven by Hershey spikes and a king-sized Q1 event at some selected retailers. Over the remainder of the year, we have a lot of in-store activity planned, highlighting new packaging designs and pack types that we believe will generate solid net sales growth.
In Brazil, first quarter constant currency net sales increased about 18%. Results benefited from an easy comp versus the year-ago period and an earlier Easter. Although note that we don't have a broad Easter portfolio on Brazil, the Big Kiss offering is our primary seasonal item. Hersey's tablet bar performance was good. And while small, Reese's is starting to gain traction in Brazil.
Despite mixed international results in the first quarter, we remain confident about plans over the remainder of the year. We've made adjustments where necessary and have the right mix of innovation and in-store activity to achieve our objectives.
Our international growth profile, excluding Golden Monkey, is similar to prior years and driven by performance in the second half, particularly the fourth quarter. However, foreign currency exchange rates remain volatile. And over the remainder of the year, the unfavorable impact on net sales is expected to be greater than our previous estimate. Given this backdrop and first quarter softness in China, we now expect international net sales, excluding the benefit of Golden Monkey, to increase about 5% versus our previous expectation of about a 10% increase.
Now to wrap up. Core brand merchandising, programming and innovation accelerates over the remainder of the year. There is no change to our advertising and marketing methodology, and we continue to expect that it will increase at a rate greater than net sales growth. We believe these investments should generate full year organic net sales growth or constant currency sales, excluding M&A and FX impacts, of around 3.5% to 4.5% in 2015. We expect foreign exchange rates to be greater than our previous estimate by about 0.5 point and be about 1.5 points unfavorable in 2015.
We continue to estimate that the net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures will be around 2.5 points. With a profitable U.S. business on track, an increase in gross margin expansion and Golden Monkey accretion later in the year, we expect an increase in 2015 full year adjusted earnings per share diluted of 8% to 10%, including dilution from acquisitions and divestitures of $0.03 to $0.05 per share.

First quarter net sales of $1.9 billion was up 3.5% versus the prior year. Excluding the negative impact on foreign currency exchange rates of 1.1 points, about 0.5 point greater than estimate, net sales increased 4.6%. The fluctuation in the Canadian dollar was responsible for about half of the FX impact, and the Mexican peso and Brazilian real the majority of the remainder.
As we indicated last quarter, given the shorter Easter, volume elasticity related to the U.S. price increase and the timing of innovation, we expected consolidated net sales growth in Q1 to be around the low end of our long-term target. However, we didn't anticipate the anomaly in China that J.P. referred to.
Pricing and net M&A was a 3.8-point and 1.6-point benefit, partially offset by volume that was a 0.8-point headwind. Importantly, North America organic net sales, excluding FX and M&A, increased 3.4%, relatively in line with our expectations. North America pricing of 4.3 points was partially offset by volume that was up 0.9 points due to elasticity related to the price increase and lower seasonal sales.
International and Other segment net sales increased 8.5%, driven by the Golden Monkey acquisition, a 13.3-point benefit, while FX was a 4.8-point headwind. International and Other segment organic net sales were above the same as last year.
As we stated in January, first quarter EPS would be pressured. Our expectation was for adjusted EPS to be about the same as last year due to seasonal product sales that occurred at pre-price increase level and our plan for higher SM&A expenses.
However, we did not anticipate the lower levels of growth in China within the biggest cities and hypermarkets. This impacted chocolate category growth in the quarter, as well as some of our decisions related to Golden Monkey go-to-market strategies. Hence, adjusted EPS diluted of $1.09, down about 5% versus last year, was off versus our plan, primarily due to China chocolate sales and Golden Monkey dilution.
Turning now to margins. In the -- 
[Audio Gap]
first quarter, adjusted gross margin increased 10 basis points, driven by supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives, as well as the net price realization which more than offset higher input costs.
Earlier this month, we implemented select input cost strategies that we believe will enable gross margin to increase 155 to 165 basis points for the full year.
Adjusted EBIT in the first quarter declined 5.6% versus last year, resulting in adjusted EBIT margin of 20.3%. The decline was driven by higher SM&A expenses that increased 12.3% versus last year.
Looking at a couple of the pieces. Advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased about 8%. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, increased about 15%. This increase reflects the addition of Golden Monkey, investments in mark-to-market capabilities in the U.S. and the international markets, as well as knowledge-based consumer insights.
Let me now provide you with a brief update on the international business. Similar to prior years, our expectation entering 2015 was for international net sales growth would be back-half weighted. We still believe that will be the case, given our plans for advertising, merchandising, programming and new products. Q1 international net sales increased 8.8%. Note that this excludes global retail and licensing results, which was relatively in line with expectations.
Looking at our focus markets. We believe China chocolate category softness was impacted by consumer confidence, given all the negative headlines we've all seen, like slowing GDP growth, although we were encouraged that March Nielsen data showed an acceleration in category growth versus January and February. Over the remainder of the year, we expect net sales growth in China to sequentially improve, although it will be driven by performance in the second half of the year.
We have adjusted our China plans to generate greater in-store activities to support faster growth in the hypermarkets. We'll be entering some Tier 2 cities, and we have plans to increase our exposure in the fast-growing e-commerce channel.
On a constant currency basis, net sales in Mexico and Brazil increased mid-teens on a percentage basis versus last year due to easier comps. Recall that at the beginning of '14, we have the headwind of the back tax enactment in Mexico and volume elasticity related to the price increase in Brazil. We expect Mexico and Brazil performance to be better than last year. However, we expect the real and peso to remain volatile and be a major headwind related to reported net sales.
Moving down the P&L. First quarter interest expense of $19.2 million declined $2.2 million versus last year. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be in the $75 million to $80 million range.
The adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was 35%, in line with our estimate. For the full year, we expect the adjusted net tax rate to be slightly lower than the year-ago rate of 34.5%. This is a little different from our initial analysis and guidance that the full year adjusted tax rate would be about the same as last year.
For the first quarter of 2015, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 222.7 million, a 1.9% decline compared to last year.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the first quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year's first quarter by $69.2 million. Accounts receivable was lower by $13.8 million and remains extremely recurring. Inventory was higher by $67 million, and accounts payable declined by $16 million. The net increase in trading capital was driven by acquisitions. Excluding net acquisitions and divestitures, net trading capital increased $7 million.
In terms of other specific cash flow items. Total capital additions, including software, were $62.7 million in the first quarter. For the year, we expect total capital expense just to be about $375 million to $400 million, including capital related to the Johor, Malaysia project of about $110 million. Excluding this project, CapEx is about $275 million or about 3.5% of net sales.
Depreciation and amortization was $58.3 million in the first quarter, in line with our estimate. During the first quarter, dividends paid were $114 million. The company repurchased $173 million of outstanding shares in the first quarter against the February 2014 authorization which is now complete. No shares have been purchased against the $250 million authorization approved in February 2015.
This authorization is an addition to the company's policy of repurchasing shares in the open market related to issues in connection with stock option exercises. In the first quarter, the company repurchased $134 million of common shares to replace shares issued in connection with exercise of stock options. Cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter were up $405 million.
As J.P. summarized, in 2015, we have a solid pipeline of innovation, merchandising and programming. In addition, marketing expense is expected to increase at a rate greater than net sales growth. As a result, we expect 2015 net sales to increase 4.5% to 5.5%, including a net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures of around 2.5 points and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate of about 1.5 points.
Excluding these items, organic net sales are expected to increase 3.5% to 4.5% versus the previous 4% to 6%. While we remain confident in our business plans, a narrowing of the sales range reflects the global macroeconomic challenges that continue to persist. The decline at the lower end of the range by 0.5 point primarily reflects the first quarter China underperformance.
We continue to have a significant focus on gross margin and expect that the previously announced price increase, as well as productivity and cost savings, to result in gross margin expansion of 155 to 165 basis points. Combined with a slightly lower net tax rate and Golden Monkey accretion in the second half of the year, adjusted earnings per share diluted is expected to increase 8% to 10%.
Before we open it up to Q&A, just a couple of thoughts on the second quarter. We have plans to generate solid gross margin expansion over the remaining quarters. However, the second quarter is typically our smallest quarter as it relates to overall net sales. And our international sales profile is similar to prior years, with annual growth primarily driven by fourth quarter performance. Additionally, Golden Monkey will be dilutive in the second quarter before ramping up in the second half of the year.
While small, KRAVE margins are lower than the company average, and it will also contribute to the increase in total consolidated SM&A expense in the second quarter. Therefore, second quarter net sales, including M&A and FX, is expected to be at near the low end of our full year sales target of 4.5% to 5.5% before accelerating in the second half of the year. Given all these moving parts, we expect second quarter EPS diluted growth to be pressured and around the same as last year.

And we also have a lot of innovation which kicks in after New Year, and that's been the typical pattern, where we have distribution -- distributor meetings early in the second quarter for that innovation. And there's a very strong innovation pipeline for that. And so our expectation is that we will be on target for that accretion during the full year and that, that will come in the back half. The other small acquisitions and divestitures, whether it be Mauna Loa or KRAVE, kind of offset each other."

But it sounds like you're going to spend more money for some of this in-market activity to try to boost sales. So I'm just trying to kind of piece those pieces together, why it wouldn't be more dilutive if you're having to spend more money to drive sales, especially since it was already more dilutive than you thought in the first quarter. So am I thinking about that correctly, I guess?"

What we're saying in this case is that the Shanghai Golden Monkey slight accretion to the year remains intact based on the activity programs that we have in place. In terms of higher spending, we're not projecting higher spending in the international business in terms of getting back to our targets for the year. And we're also, given the magnitude of the China sales miss, we're not projecting that we can make up that sales miss, which is part of what Mark explained on the call down on the lower end. We do have higher year-on-year costs in the sales force. That's our program as we actively go into more cities. And we did still have advertising in the first quarter during Chinese New Year, although it certainly wasn't as effective as we thought it would be."

In fact, some of the structural changes we think actually help us in the long run, things like urbanization, as well as more of a consumer economy, which is at the government's pushing. But no, we've lowered certainly the overall year expectations. We'd said we'd be somewhere around 30 and that the category would be in the low double digits.

It seems like a lot of the pegboard and mini products that have been introduced in past years are on sale a lot. I think, J.P., you've mentioned in the past seeing more kind of snack-based competition. And so maybe, can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in markets?

Eric, I think what we would say is that across snacking, we are seeing that there's a lot of activity out there. If you look at the overall snacking wheel in the share performance, you can see that there's been some moderation there, with the exception that CMG is sort of returning more to historical performance base. You see meat snacks which continues to perform really well, and obviously, we're encouraged by KRAVE. But I think we're in an era where the snacking continuum and the occasions of snacking are broadening, and therefore, consumer choice is greater. And so we have to work hard at making sure that, at the point-of-sale, our brands are winning in terms of merchandising, et cetera. I tell you the one thing that if I -- as I personally have a takeaway from the first quarter that I feel better about than anything else we probably could talk about on this call, is that we've seen a strengthening in our everyday business. And so if you take Easter out and all of the previous quarters and all, and you just looked at what's the health of the everyday business, we're doing -- our everyday brands are up. And importantly, that's always a measure of advertising effectiveness. So the combination of advertising working for us and seeing our everyday business improving outside of that environment, that is a very, very healthy sign. And for me, that's the thing I feel best about in the entire first quarter."

Let's -- I would tell you that as a consumer insight-driven company, a brand-building company, we're going to always be focused on growth and growing our brands. The cost is a lever and it's an important one. So look, I mean, if we can all capture synergies in our business via acquisitions and add-ons and making sure that we've got P&L leverage, we absolutely have to be focused against that because the investments that we make have to pay for themselves. But first and foremost, we have a business model that we want to pursue. So yes, I think there's some very good reminders in the marketplace that suggest that, listen, you got to make sure you're not getting fat, but you also have to make sure that along the way to not getting fat, you're allocating resources in a way that you can win in the marketplace on a going basis. And so that's important. If I come back to the first part of your question, we're balancing those investments, both internationally and in the U.S. So we've proven over and over again that the passion of our sales organization, our feet on the street represent us better than any other choice we could make. I have also seen some evidence in the marketplace where some other companies are coming to that conclusion as well. But for our company, we continue to be focused against those investments. And the only way we can grow our brands in these new markets is to forward-invest in the capabilities that make them broadly available to consumers, and we'll continue to do that. But we'll do that in the most effective and efficient way we possibly can."

And then kind of the question here is, 47%, of course, every time you read a number like that on a company like this, you do a double-take to make sure you didn't misread it. I think the takeaway here, but this is the question, is the 47% decline in the China business, it's an inventory adjustment essentially, so that in 4Q, you had massive shipments of product to retail, anticipating something like a 30% growth in the first quarter in China. First quarter China retail, I think you guys said, was 5% for Hershey products. And hence, that requires a massive change in the shipment pattern in Q1. Bert, am I putting all this together right?"

So there were a few markets, and certainly, our export business was impacted. But it was largely a China story in the scheme of things. And you're quite right. As we anticipated the growth in the first quarter for Chinese New Year and didn't see that coming along, we obviously shipped less into the marketplace because, as J.P. mentioned earlier, I think, in his remarks, we try to ship to where the consumption pattern is. We don't expect that, that will be made up in the rest of the year, so we've adjusted down our growth, although we think the rest of the year should be more normalized than what we saw during the Chinese New Year."

Welcome to The Hershey Company's First Quarter 2015 Conference Call. J.P. Bilbrey, Chairman, President and CEO, and I will provide you with an overview of results, followed by a Q&A session.
Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations which are subject to risks and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2014 filed with the SEC.
If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Note section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. The non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes that presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.
As a result, we will discuss 2015 first quarter results excluding net pretax charges of $9.7 million or $0.02 per share diluted and a gain on the sale of a trademark of $10 million or $0.03 per share diluted. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges.
With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey."

While our sales and earnings performance for the quarter was mixed, I was happy with the progress that we made in key areas, particularly in the U.S. business, where operating and marketplace performance was in line with our expectations. We completed the KRAVE acquisition towards the end of March, and we’ve begun the integration work. We can now begin to share snacking insights related to consumer and market segmentation, as well as distribution and channel opportunities.
As we stated in January and at CAGNY, we expected first quarter sales and earnings to be pressured due to Easter timing, as seasonal net sales occurred at pre-price increase levels. However, Q1 results were lower than we anticipated due to some unexpected softness in China. The weakness was across the majority of the consumer packaged goods space in the China modern trade. The acceleration of this softness in the first quarter versus Q4 was unexpected.
Chocolate was one of the few categories in China that grew in the first quarter, although less than last year. In China, Hershey's slightly outpaced the category and gained market share, however, the pace of growth slowed significantly. Mark will provide you with additional financial details, so let me give you an overview of the business.
Overall, total company Q1 net sales, excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates, increased 4.6%, driven primarily by pricing and net benefit from acquisitions of 1.6 points. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate was a 1.1 headwind. Our expectation was for adjusted earnings per share diluted to be about the same as last year, so the $1.09 that we earned was largely due to lower-than-expected international sales growth.
Including Easter, seasonal activity in the year-ago and current period, the candy, mint and gum, or CMG category, increased 3.9% for the 12 weeks ended March 21, 2015, within the xAOC+C channels. Gum continues to underperform. And excluding it, the chocolate, non-chocolate and mint categories increased about 4.2%. Excluding Easter, seasonal activity in the current and year-ago period, combined growth of chocolate, non-chocolate and mints, was up 3%.
Hershey's first quarter CMG retail takeaway in the xAOC+C universe was 4.6%, benefiting from an earlier Easter versus last year. We had a good Easter and believe we will gain share in this important season.
Excluding Easter seasonal sales, Hershey's everyday marketplace performance continues to improve. Specifically, Hershey's xAOC+C CMG retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ending March 21, excluding Easter seasonal sales in the current and year-ago period, increased plus 3.1%.
Perhaps the easiest way to assess performance, given seasonal timing is by looking at absolute market share results. We gained market share both with and without the Easter seasonal activity. All in, including the seasonal activity, Hershey's first quarter CMG market share in the xAOC+C universe increased plus 0.2 points.
U.S. first quarter organic net sales of nearly 3%. Seasonal sales, roughly 1/4 of our business in the first quarter, declined year-over-year due to a shorter Easter season. This was more than offset by our everyday business, which I'm pleased to say increased mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year. This is slightly ahead of everyday retail takeaway of 3.1% due to the timing and shipments of second quarter promotions and new products.
In the second quarter, we believe our everyday momentum will continue with the broader rollout and launch of Ice Breakers Cool Blasts Chews, Hershey's Caramels and additional Lancaster cream flavors. And Hershey's first quarter xAOC+C chocolate retail takeaway, excluding Easter, was up 3.3%, resulting in chocolate market share gains of 0.6 points. Importantly, retail takeaway was solid across many of core chocolate franchises, including Reese's, Hershey's, Kit Kat, Kisses and Brookside.
Switching to non-chocolate candy, or NCC, in the xAOC+C channels, Hershey's NCC business, excluding Easter in the current and year-ago period, declined 2%, as we were lapping the year-ago launch of the Lancaster product line. We anticipate that our NCC performance will be a bit better over the next couple of quarters, supported by Lancaster in-store sampling events, national FSIs and some Summer Fun flavors of Twizzlers.
While not as large as chocolate, in NCC, we continued to do well within the gum and the mint categories. Specifically, our Q1 gum and mint retail takeaway within the xAOC+C universe was up 11% and 10.5%, respectively. As a result, our gum market share increased by 0.4 points to 5.2%. Our mint market share increased 0.7 points, expanding our segment-leading position to 40.3%.
In the C-store class of trade, where the seasonal impacts are minimal, the CMG category was up 5.1%, driven by pricing. As it relates to the previously announced price increase, volume elasticity trends are tough to discern in the xAOC universe, given the influence of seasonal candy on shelf at pre-price increase levels. However, conversion appears to be on track.
Total Hershey's C-store performance was solid, with retail takeaway up plus 4.8%. It was driven by pricing of 9 to 10 points, offset by volume elasticity of about 5%. This is relatively in line with our modeling for this channel.
Our C-store chocolate and mint retail takeaway was particularly solid, up 4.9% and 8.9%, respectively. These gains were driven by core brand advertising, in-store selling, merchandising and programming.
International results were mixed in the first quarter, given greater-than-expected unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and China retail softness that impacted overall grocery, as well as the chocolate category growth. Recall during last quarter's conference call, we've stated that chocolate category growth in China was about 8%, and that was less than the historical 10% to 11%.
In the first quarter, chocolate category growth was 4%, again, softer than we would have anticipated and less than the year-ago period.
Given the Chinese New Year holiday, the first quarter is typically the biggest quarter of the year for chocolate consumption. Some of this softness is most likely due to government policy related to giving -- gifting. However, macroeconomic news indicates things have significantly slowed, and this could be impacting overall consumer confidence. This is evident when looking at Nielsen data for the broader CPG group, which was also soft. Our chocolate retail takeaway in China was about 5% in the first quarter, resulting in a market share gain of 0.1 points.
In all of the markets where we operate, our goal is to shift to consumption so that consumer has a good experience related to freshness and taste. Therefore, our China first quarter net sales moderated and declined 47% versus a year ago. We will continue to execute against plans with our retail partners in China to drive store traffic and in-store activity over the remainder of the year.
As a result, our China chocolate plan reflects the first quarter miss and remains relatively intact versus our initial plan. We have made some adjustments on how we'll get there. We expect to enter some Tier 2 cities, and we'll increase the level of in-store sampling to drive everyday trial and repeat. Additionally, we're beginning to get Brookside out of the market -- out into the market and using Golden Monkey distributor assets to help us achieve that.
Shanghai Golden Monkey integration is progressing. In the first quarter, Golden Monkey was dilutive to our earnings, however, results will be stronger in the second half of the year, supported by a solid pipeline of snack and non-chocolate candy new products.
In Mexico, first quarter constant currency net sales increased about 16%. As expected, our business has sequentially improved over the last 3 quarters, as consumers have adjusted to the VAT tax instituted last year. Importantly, the chocolate category increased about 13%. We estimate that Hershey retail takeaway was up about 12%, driven by Hershey spikes and a king-sized Q1 event at some selected retailers. Over the remainder of the year, we have a lot of in-store activity planned, highlighting new packaging designs and pack types that we believe will generate solid net sales growth.
In Brazil, first quarter constant currency net sales increased about 18%. Results benefited from an easy comp versus the year-ago period and an earlier Easter. Although note that we don't have a broad Easter portfolio on Brazil, as the Big Kiss offering is our primary seasonal item. Hersey's tablet bar performance was good. And while small, Reese's is starting to gain traction in Brazil.
Despite mixed international results in the first quarter, we remain confident about plans over the remainder of the year. We've made adjustments where necessary and have the right mix of innovation and in-store activity to achieve our objectives.
Our international growth profile, excluding Golden Monkey, is similar to prior years and driven by performance in the second half, particularly the fourth quarter. However, foreign currency exchange rates remain volatile. And over the remainder of the year, the unfavorable impact on net sales is expected to be greater than our previous estimate. Given this backdrop and first quarter softness in China, we now expect international net sales, excluding the benefit of Golden Monkey, to increase about 5% versus our previous expectation of about a 10% increase.
Now to wrap up. Core brand merchandising, programming and innovation accelerates over the remainder of the year. There is no change to our advertising and marketing methodology, and we continue to expect that it will increase at a rate greater than net sales growth. We believe these investments should generate full year organic net sales growth or constant currency sales, excluding M&A and FX impacts, of around 3.5% to 4.5% in 2015. We expect foreign exchange rates to be greater than our previous estimate by about 0.5 point and be about 1.5 points unfavorable in 2015.
We continue to estimate that the net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures will be around 2.5 points. With a profitable U.S. business on track, an increase in gross margin expansion and Golden Monkey accretion later in the year, we expect an increase in 2015 full year adjusted earnings per share diluted of 8% to 10%, including dilution from acquisitions and divestitures of $0.03 to $0.05 per share.
Before we provide you with additional financial details, I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome Patricia Little, our CFO as of March 16.

Good morning to everyone on the phone and webcast.First quarter net sales of $1.9 billion was up 3.5% versus the prior year.

First quarter net sales of $1.9 billion was up 3.5% versus the prior year. Excluding the negative impact on foreign currency exchange rates of 1.1 points, about 0.5 point greater than estimate, net sales increased 4.6%. The fluctuation in the Canadian dollar was responsible for about half of the FX impact, and the Mexican peso and Brazilian real the majority of the remainder.
As we indicated last quarter, given the shorter Easter, volume elasticity related to the U.S. price increase and the timing of innovation, we expected consolidated net sales growth in Q1 to be around the low end of our long-term target. However, we didn't anticipate the anomaly in China that J.P. referred to.
Pricing and net M&A was a 3.8-point and 1.6-point benefit, partially offset by volume that was a 0.8-point headwind. Importantly, North America organic net sales, excluding FX and M&A, increased 3.4%, relatively in line with our expectations. North America pricing of 4.3 points was partially offset by volume that was off 0.9 points due to elasticity related to the price increase and lower seasonal sales.
International and Other segment net sales increased 8.5%, driven by the Golden Monkey acquisition, a 13.3-point benefit, while FX was a 4.8-point headwind. International and Other segment organic net sales were about the same as last year.
As we stated in January, first quarter EPS would be pressured. Our expectation was for adjusted EPS to be about the same as last year due to seasonal product sales that occurred at pre-price increase level and our plan for higher SM&A expenses.
However, we did not anticipate the lower levels of growth in China within the biggest cities and hypermarkets. This impacted chocolate category growth in the quarter, as well as some of our decisions related to Golden Monkey go-to-market strategies. Hence, adjusted EPS diluted of $1.09, down about 5% versus last year, was off versus our plan, primarily due to China chocolate sales and Golden Monkey dilution.
Turning now to margins. In the -- 
[Audio Gap]
first quarter, adjusted gross margin increased 10 basis points, driven by supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives, as well as the net price realization which more than offset higher input costs.
Earlier this month, we implemented select input cost strategies that we believe will enable gross margin to increase 155 to 165 basis points for the full year.
Adjusted EBIT in the first quarter declined 5.6% versus last year, resulting in adjusted EBIT margin of 20.3%. The decline was driven by higher SM&A expenses that increased 12.3% versus last year.
Looking at a couple of the pieces. Advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased about 8%. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, increased about 15%. This increase reflects the addition of Golden Monkey, investments in mark-to-market capabilities in the U.S. and the international markets, as well as knowledge-based consumer insights.
Let me now provide you with a brief update on the international business. Similar to prior years, our expectation entering 2015 was for international net sales growth would be back-half weighted. We still believe that will be the case, given our plans for advertising, merchandising, programming and new products. Q1 international net sales increased 8.8%. Note that this excludes global retail and licensing results, which was relatively in line with expectations.
Looking at our focus markets. We believe China chocolate category softness was impacted by consumer confidence, given all the negative headlines we've all seen, like slowing GDP growth, although we were encouraged that March Nielsen data showed an acceleration in category growth versus January and February. Over the remainder of the year, we expect net sales growth in China to sequentially improve, although it will be driven by performance in the second half of the year.
We have adjusted our China plans to generate greater in-store activities to support faster growth in the hypermarkets. We'll be entering some Tier 2 cities, and we have plans to increase our exposure in the fast-growing e-commerce channel.
On a constant currency basis, net sales in Mexico and Brazil increased mid-teens on a percentage basis versus last year due to easier comps. Recall that at the beginning of '14, we had the headwind of the VAT tax enactment in Mexico and volume elasticity related to the price increase in Brazil. We expect Mexico and Brazil performance to be better than last year. However, we expect the real and peso to remain volatile and be a major headwind related to reported net sales.
Moving down the P&L. First quarter interest expense of $19.2 million declined $2.2 million versus last year. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be in the $75 million to $80 million range.
The adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was 35%, in line with our estimate. For the full year, we expect the adjusted net tax rate to be slightly lower than the year-ago rate of 34.5%. This is a little different from our initial analysis and guidance that the full year adjusted tax rate would be about the same as last year.
For the first quarter of 2015, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 222.7 million, a 1.9% decline compared to last year.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the first quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year's first quarter by $69.2 million. Accounts receivable was lower by $13.8 million and remains extremely recurring. Inventory was higher by $67 million, and accounts payable declined by $16 million. The net increase in trading capital was driven by acquisitions. Excluding net acquisitions and divestitures, net trading capital increased $7 million.
In terms of other specific cash flow items. Total capital additions, including software, were $62.7 million in the first quarter. For the year, we expect total capital expense just to be about $375 million to $400 million, including capital related to the Johor, Malaysia project of about $110 million. Excluding this project, CapEx is about $275 million or about 3.5% of net sales.
Depreciation and amortization was $58.3 million in the first quarter, in line with our estimate. During the first quarter, dividends paid were $114 million. The company repurchased $173 million of outstanding shares in the first quarter against the February 2014 authorization which is now complete. No shares have been purchased against the $250 million authorization approved in February 2015.
This authorization is an addition to the company's policy of repurchasing shares in the open market related to issues in connection with stock option exercises. In the first quarter, the company repurchased $134 million of common shares to replace shares issued in connection with exercise of stock options. Cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter were up $405 million.
As J.P. summarized, in 2015, we have a solid pipeline of innovation, merchandising and programming. In addition, marketing expense is expected to increase at a rate greater than net sales growth. As a result, we expect 2015 net sales to increase 4.5% to 5.5%, including a net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures of around 2.5 points and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate of about 1.5 points.
Excluding these items, organic net sales are expected to increase 3.5% to 4.5% versus the previous 4% to 6%. While we remain confident in our business plans, a narrowing of the sales range reflects the global macroeconomic challenges that continue to persist. The decline at the lower end of the range by 0.5 point primarily reflects the first quarter China underperformance.
We continue to have a significant focus on gross margin and expect that the previously announced price increase, as well as productivity and cost savings, to result in gross margin expansion of 155 to 165 basis points. Combined with a slightly lower net tax rate and Golden Monkey accretion in the second half of the year, adjusted earnings per share diluted is expected to increase 8% to 10%.
Before we open it up to Q&A, just a couple of thoughts on the second quarter. We have plans to generate solid gross margin expansion over the remaining quarters. However, the second quarter is typically our smallest quarter as it relates to overall net sales. And our international sales profile is similar to prior years, with annual growth primarily driven by fourth quarter performance. Additionally, Golden Monkey will be dilutive in the second quarter before ramping up in the second half of the year.
While small, KRAVE margins are lower than the company average, and it will also contribute to the increase in total consolidated SM&A expense in the second quarter. Therefore, second quarter net sales, including M&A and FX, is expected to be at near the low end of our full year sales target of 4.5% to 5.5% before accelerating in the second half of the year. Given all these moving parts, we expect second quarter EPS diluted growth to be pressured and around the same as last year.

And there's a very strong innovation pipeline for that. And so our expectation is that we will be on target for that accretion during the full year and that, that will come in the back half.

What we're saying in this case is that the Shanghai Golden Monkey slight accretion to the year remains intact based on the activity programs that we have in place. In terms of higher spending, we're not projecting higher spending in the international business in terms of getting back to our targets for the year. And we're also, given the magnitude of the China sales miss, we're not projecting that we can make up that sales miss, which is part of what Mark explained on the call down on the lower end. We do have higher year-on-year costs in the sales force. That's our program as we actively go into more cities. And we did still have advertising in the first quarter during Chinese New Year, although it certainly wasn't as effective as we thought it would be."

In fact, some of the structural changes we think actually help us in the long run, things like urbanization, as well as more of a consumer economy, which is at the government's pushing. But no, we've lowered certainly the overall year expectations. We'd said we'd be somewhere around 30 and that the category would be in the low double digits.

You see meat snacks which continues to perform really well, and obviously, we're encouraged by KRAVE. But I think we're in an era where the snacking continuum and the occasions of snacking are broadening, and therefore, consumer choice is greater. And so we have to work hard at making sure that, at the point-of-sale, our brands are winning in terms of merchandising, et cetera. I tell you the one thing that if I -- as I personally have a takeaway from the first quarter that I feel better about than anything else we probably could talk about on this call, is that we've seen a strengthening in our everyday business. And so if you take Easter out and all of the previous quarters and all, and you just looked at what's the health of the everyday business, we're doing -- our everyday brands are up. And importantly, that's always a measure of advertising effectiveness. So the combination of advertising working for us and seeing our everyday business improving outside of that environment, that is a very, very healthy sign.

Let's -- I would tell you that as a consumer-insight-driven company, a brand-building company, we're going to always be focused on growth and growing our brands. The cost is a lever and it's an important one. So look, I mean, if we can all capture synergies in our business via acquisitions and add-ons and making sure that we've got P&L leverage, we absolutely have to be focused against that because the investments that we make have to pay for themselves. But first and foremost, we have a business model that we want to pursue. So yes, I think there's some very good reminders in the marketplace that suggest that, listen, you got to make sure you're not getting fat, but you also have to make sure that along the way to not getting fat, you're allocating resources in a way that you can win in the marketplace on a going basis. And so that's important. If I come back to the first part of your question, we're balancing those investments, both internationally and in the U.S. So we've proven over and over again that the passion of our sales organization, our feet on the street represent us better than any other choice we could make. I have also seen some evidence in the marketplace where some other companies are coming to that conclusion as well. But for our company, we continue to be focused against those investments. And the only way we can grow our brands in these new markets is to forward-invest in the capabilities that make them broadly available to consumers, and we'll continue to do that.

And then kind of the question here is, 47%, of course, every time you read a number like that on a company like this, you do a double-take to make sure you didn't misread it. I think the takeaway here, but this is the question, is the 47% decline in the China business, it's an inventory adjustment essentially, so that in 4Q, you had massive shipments of product to retail, anticipating something like a 30% growth in the first quarter in China. First quarter China retail, I think you guys said, was 5% for Hershey products. And hence, that requires a massive change in the shipment pattern in Q1. Bert, am I putting all this together right?"

So there were a few markets, and certainly, our export business was impacted. But it was largely a China story in the scheme of things. And you're quite right. As we anticipated the growth in the first quarter for Chinese New Year and didn't see that coming along, we obviously shipped less into the marketplace because, as J.P. mentioned earlier, I think, in his remarks, we try to ship to where the consumption pattern is. We don't expect that, that will be made up in the rest of the year, so we've adjusted down our growth, although we think the rest of the year should be more normalized than what we saw during the Chinese New Year."

On the first part of your question, the synergy aspect of Golden Monkey, we're in the very early stages of that, so there's very little of that. And the reason for that is, as we plan for those synergies, let's take an example, chocolate products through Golden Monkey sales force, we're still in the process of designing different pack types, different price points which are more appropriate for those markets. So there's not a lot of the miss that's accounted for by not penetrating Hershey products to Golden Monkey. On a year-over-year basis, we haven't given that type of information. But Golden Monkey certainly had a similar impact in the first quarter, as you would have seen in our chocolate business, based on the same lower New Year."

Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations which are subject to risks and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2014 filed with the SEC.
If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Within the Notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally.
These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes that presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.
As a result, we will discuss 2015 second quarter results, excluding net pretax charges of $282 million or $1.23 per share diluted, primarily related to a noncash impairment charge and costs associated with the business productivity initiative announced in June. Our discussion of any future projection will also exclude the impact of these net charges.
With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey."

In our longer-term strategic planning cycle, we know there's always the potential for  volatility, particularly in international markets. The combination of macroeconomic influences and competitive activity in our core China chocolate business, along with disappointing Golden Monkey performance, have resulted in negative short-term results in this part of the business. I'll talk more about these in a few minutes.
Importantly, we're committed to our long-term strategic plan and believe the balance and performance of the strong North America business and attractive growth opportunities in key international markets should enable us to deliver solid growth over the long term.
Our scale and profitable North America business gives us flexibility in the near term while maintaining focus on building our brands in China, Mexico, Brazil and India. The investments we've made in North America over the last few years are paying dividends. Our focus on consumer capabilities and customer insights provide us with the framework to build our brands with retailers.
We're also working with innovative firms like Palantir, that are building our competitive analytical fatalities in the areas of consumer insights and enterprise connectivity.
The implementation of the U.S. price increase we announced last year is on track and the related CMG volume elasticity is in line with our modeling. This was partially offset by increased levels of promotions and discounts related to the Spreads and the Baking Chips businesses.
Our overall our year-to-date U.S. retail takeaway of 3.1% is in line with our expectations. However, this was impacted by a shorter Easter season. Looking at the everyday base CMG business, retail takeaway was up mid-single digits in the second quarter. This is a solid indicator that our advertising or full efforts is working. Additionally, our continued focus on core brands has resulted in market share growth across the Hershey's, Kit Kat, Brookside, Kisses and Ice Breakers franchises.
We continue to optimize and refine our North America marketing model and execution capabilities. We're focused on advertising and marketing returns and are optimizing our spending across the portfolio.
For example, we're increasing our investment in the highest return chocolate business and increasing digital within our media mix. We're also leveraging our precision marketing capability to accelerate growth by executing in-store programming against consumer and geographic preferences by store.
Where we're implementing these plans, those retailers are outperforming the market. Nielsen second quarter measures do not encompass the entire Easter season in both the year-ago and current periods, therefore my remarks will refer to year-to-date marketplace performance for the 28 weeks ended July 11.
Year-to-date, CMG, that's candy, mint and gum, category growth in the xAOC+C channels was up plus 2.7%. The Hershey's CMG retail takeaway for the year-to-date period through July 11, 2015, in channels that account for about 90% of our U.S. retail business was up 3.1%. Looking past the Easter time frame, as expected, our retail takeaway accelerated and is up 4.8% for the 8 weeks ending July 11.
Our overall market share increased to 31.3%, an increase of 0.1 points. Performance by segment is tracking as expected, with share gains in chocolate, mint and gum. We're pleased with our chocolate performance, where our year-to-date market share is up 0.3 points. This is partially offset by nonchocolate candy performance where we lost market share as anticipated, as we lapped prior year Jolly Rancher line extensions and last year's launch of Lancaster.
We're also making progress within snacks. Brookside bars are now available, with initial demand and velocity to be on par with the category leaders. This launch as well as Snack Bites and Snack Mix products will expand our confection equities to source volume across the broader snacking space. Reese's Spread is on track as this flavor profile is differentiated versus the other chocolate spreads within the category. However, the overall jar segment of the chocolate spread category has slowed with household penetration flattish.
The SE consumables segment the spread category is growing, although it's become more competitive. The KRAVE business and integration is on track versus our plans. KRAVE is growing faster than all major competitors, driven by distribution and velocity gains.
Items per store and merchandising is growing and net sales should nearly double this year. Outside of the U.S. in our international markets beyond China, business is relatively on track with our plans. In Mexico, net sales in local currency are up mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year and in line with retail takeaway.
As expected, the category of Hershey continued to improve as we lapped the VAT tax that was instituted last year. In Brazil, net sales in local currency declined mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year due to the timing of Easter and last year's Reese's launch. But despite the tough macroeconomic environment year-to-date, the chocolate category growth in Brazil has been resilient and is up high single digits on a percentage basis versus last year.
Our market share in Brazil is up 0.3 points, with Hershey's and Reese's continuing to gain traction. 
Now let me address the challenges that we are facing in China. Our chocolate performance this year has been impacted by macroeconomic challenges that we believe impacted shopping behavior. Recall, we gained market share in the first quarter but our growth was lower than the historical performance and our own expectations.
And in the second quarter, while category growth returned to low double digits, competitive activity increased as manufacturers responded to poor Chinese New Year sell-through. This resulted in higher levels of increased trade, promotional allowance and discounts that impacted net sales and profitability.
June year-to-date chocolate category growth in China was nearly 6%. Hershey year-to-date China chocolate retail takeaway was 4.3%, with market share up 1/10 of a point. We believe the category will continue to increase at the low double-digit rate we saw in the second quarter, putting it on track to be up 8% to 10% for the full year.
Some of the initial work we've done to help ensure that we execute against our plan in China and get back to our winning ways includes the broader rollout of Brookside chocolates, distribution into smaller format stores and continued focus and acceleration of our e-commerce business.
Our e-commerce business, while small, is up 60% this year. We're partnering with key third-party online retailers like the mall, Tsingtao [ph] and DoD on in learning a lot about digital consumers in China that will help us going forward.
China is a priority market for us and we'll be focused on executing against our core brand building business model. For 120 years, our company has persevered and prospered with great people, purpose and brands, and we believe this model will work in China as we look to gain share in this evolving country and category.
As it relates to  Shanghai Golden Monkey, I'd like to address some of the factors leading to the estimated impairment charge that we announced in this morning's press release. As we've indicated previously, we acquired the Golden Monkey business to broaden our footprint in China by leveraging both the salesforce and the regional and local distributor network in order to diversify Hershey's chocolate growth, which has historically been leveraged to Tier 1 hypermarkets.
Results had been disappointing. We initially thought this is primarily due to macroeconomic headwinds in China. As the integration has progressed and the situation on the ground evolved, we've come to understand that there are significant business issues that we need to address in order to achieve our goals.
Accounts receivable collection has remained challenging and sales continued to slow in the second quarter. Our assessment of the distributor network has made it clear that the network is not as stable as we believe and therefore, the related retail customer reach is not as broad as we believe it to be.
As a result, the sales forecast for the business in 2015, around $90 million is less than our initial expectations of at least $200 million. This disappointing performance is impacting profitability. Despite these near-term results, we remain committed in the long-term success of this acquisition as well as the China market. We're taking steps to build the strong foundation for future success, including the appointment of a new Chairman and General Manager for Golden Monkey with solid China consumer packaged goods experience. We're also looking at the cost structure of different integration strategies that are intended to get the business back on track as quickly as possible.
We'll continue to assess and address these issues and their impact on the value of the business as we work towards acquiring the remaining 20% of the business, which we now anticipate will occur in the fourth quarter of 2015. The timing and terms of the second closing will be informed by the results of our ongoing assessment.
We estimate that our International and Other segment net sales will be about $1 billion this year, with the chocolate share nearly 10% in China, 14% in Mexico and 5% in Brazil. We like the future growth outlook and prospects in these markets, which are an integral part of our international profile.
Now to wrap up. Core brand merchandising, programming and innovation accelerates over the remainder of the year. With the exception of China, there's no change to our advertising and marketing methodology. In these same markets, we continue to refine our plans and we expect North America advertising and relating consumer marketing expense to increase at a rate about 2x greater than the organic net sales growth rate.
And it's generating results. Patricia will provide you with all the details related to the full year outlook, but excluding China chocolate, M&A and unfavorable FX, net sales are expected to be up around 3.5% to  4%.
We feel confident in our North America business plans, where we generate the majority of the company's sales and earnings. The situation continues to evolve in China and our outlook reflects all the inputs that are available to us today.
While further volatility could occur in this market, we wouldn't expect it to have a material impact on our cash flow and strong balance sheet. Our profitable and on track North America business more than offsets the expected dilution from acquisitions and divestitures, primarily Golden Monkey of about $0.20 per share, which we expect will result in 2015 full year adjusted earnings per share diluted growth of 3% to 5%.
Let me end by saying that despite these challenges, I'm optimistic about our future. We're focused and know what we need to do to succeed. We're building strong plans that will put us in a position to win wherever we compete. I'm very pleased that we continue to work as a focused team across the entire company.

Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Second quarter net sales of $1.58 billion were in line with our revised guidance and generated adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.78, an increase of 2.6% versus last year. Ex",1623,"Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Second quarter net sales of $1.58 billion were in line with our revised guidance and generated adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.78, an increase of 2.6% versus last year. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 1.3 points, net sales increased 1.3% versus the year-ago period. Pricing and net acquisitions and divestitures were 5.8 percentage point and 1.4 percentage point benefit partially offset by 3.6 points of volume elasticity related to the previously mentioned price increase and lower sales in China.
Promotional spending, driven by China direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances, was a 2.3 percentage point headwind. As J.P. stated, North America continues to perform well. As is typical, the second quarter is our smallest quarter as it relates to overall net sales growth given the launch and timing of new products and seasonal growth associated with Halloween and Holiday.
North America net sales increased by 1.8% versus last year. Excluding the 60 basis point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Canada, net sales increased 2.4%. North America net sales were slightly better than expectations, primarily due to solid U.S. CMG performance that was partially offset by snacks and grocery softness, primarily due to increased spreads and baking chips competitive activity. Net price realization was 5.5 point benefit and was offset by volume of 3.6 percentage points due to snacks and grocery sales that were less than anticipated and elasticity related to the pricing action that was in line with estimates.
On a net basis, the Allan Candy Company and KRAVE acquisitions as well as the Mauna Loa divestiture was a 50 basis point benefit.
Turning now to margins. Adjusted gross margins increased 130 basis points in the second quarter, driven by net price realization and supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by obsolescence, unfavorable sales mix and lower volumes. For the full year, we continue to expect that gross margin will increase 135 to 145 basis points, driven by price realization.
Operating profit in the second quarter increased 3.3% versus last year, resulting in operating profit margins of 18.3%. The increase was driven by gross margin gains and a decrease in advertising and related consumer marketing expense of about 3%, primarily in China.
As expected, North America operating profit increased double digits on a percentage basis versus last year and was ahead of plan. This was partially offset by international performance, again primarily China. Excluding the acquisitions and divestitures, SM&A expenses, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, was about the same as the year-ago period. Now let me provide a brief update on our international business.
Total International and Other segment net sales for the second quarter declined 12.1% versus last year. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates were a 6-point headwind and the Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition was an 8-point benefit. The International and Other segment core business was off about 14 points, due primarily to China chocolate business performance, where sales declined $35 million. We believe China chocolate category performance was impacted by macroeconomic challenges and trends that are affecting consumer behavior, lower trips in Tier 1 hypermarkets, increased competitive activity and accelerated momentum of e-commerce and online purchases.
As J.P. stated, over the remainder of the year, we're focused on the broader rollout of Brookside chocolates, distribution into smaller format stores and continued focus and acceleration of our e-commerce business.
None of us are happy with the developments around the Golden Monkey acquisition and integration. Our latest outlook for the business is obviously different than the acquisition model. Our initial estimated noncash impairment charge of about $250 million reflects the write-down of the goodwill. There's a lot of in-country analysis and field work going on to assess the potential of the business and the value of the sales and distributor network. Once this work is complete, we'll have a final amount related the impairment charge. We estimate full year Golden Monkey net sales of about $90 million but this is subject to change based on the ongoing work mentioned previously.
On a constant currency basis, net sales in Mexico, Brazil and India were relatively in line with our expectations. Given the macroeconomic and competitive environment in Mexico and Brazil, we're pleased with our performance. Looking at year-to-date, because of Easter timing, local currency sales in Mexico and Brazil are up about 10% and 7%, respectively. Plans are in place that should result in similar net sales increases over the remainder of the year.
In India, Q2 local currency sales were off about 2%. The brands that we are investing in, Jolly Rancher, So Fit and Jumpin, are up double digits. This was offset by the legacy low margin hard Candy business, which we previously indicated we would rationalize.
Therefore, we expect total International and Other segment net sales, including foreign currency headwinds and net contribution from M&A to decline mid-single digits for the full year.
Moving down the P&L, second quarter interest expense of $18.9 million declined $2.4 million versus last year. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be in the $75 million to $80 million range. The adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 35.3%, relatively in line with our estimates. Last quarter, we stated that the full year adjusted net tax rate would be slightly lower than a year ago. Driven by U.S. government investment tax credits, we expect the tax rate to be about 30% in the second half of the year and around 32.5% for the full year.
However, there will be a corresponding offset or expense related to the write-down of the investment tax credit within the other income and expense line item. Hence, the net effect of the full year net income of the tax credits is only about $5 million.
For the second quarter of 2015, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 221 million shares, leading to an  adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.78 or an increase of 2.6% versus a year ago. Let me now provide a quick recap of year-to-date adjusted results.
Net sales increased 1.9% in the first half. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 3.1% versus the year-ago period. Operating profit decreased 2%, resulting in an operating profit margin of 19.4%. Year-to-date adjusted gross margin was 46.6% versus 46% last year or 60 basis points higher as a result of net price realization gains and supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher input costs and obsolescence. 
Adjusted earnings per share diluted in the first half decreased about 1.6% to $1.87 per share  Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow, at the and of the second quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year's second quarter by $80 million. Accounts receivable were higher by $20 million and remain extremely current. Inventory was higher by $19 million and accounts payable declined by $41 million.
Total capital additions, including software, were $90 million in the second quarter. For the year, we continue to expect total capital expenditures to be about $375 million to $400 million, including the capital related to the the Johor, Malaysia project of about $110 million. During the second quarter, depreciation and amortization was $60 million, in line with our estimates. Dividends paid were $115 million. Earlier today, we announced a dividend increase of 9%. We have strong North America marketplace position and remain confident about the long-term growth potential of our business.
In the second quarter, no shares have been purchased against the $250 million authorization approved in February of 2015. In the second quarter, the company repurchased $9 million of common shares or $143 million year-to-date to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options.
Cash and short-term investments at the and of the second quarter were $402 million. This was lower than a year ago, primarily due to the KRAVE and Golden Monkey acquisitions. The company continues to generate substantial free cash flow and has a strong balance sheet. It is well positioned to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements and acquisitions.
As J.P. summarized, over the remainder of the year, net sales will be driven by strong Halloween and Holiday seasonal programming and the continued rollout of new products in North America. In addition, we have made adjustments to the China business strategy to address the changing environment. In North America, advertising and related consumer marketing is expected to increase about 2x the organic net sales growth rate.
These investments will enable us to build on our North America momentum, positioning us to deliver on our objectives. As a result, the company estimates full year net sales will increase about 1.5% to 2.5%, including a net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures of about 1 point and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of about 1.5 points. Excluding unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, full year net sales are expected to increase about 3% to 4%.
We continue to have a significant focus on gross margin and expect solid North America price realization and productivity and cost savings to result in 2015 gross margin expansion of 135 to 145 basis points. Combined with the  $10 million to $15 million in savings from the productivity initiatives announced in June, we expect adjusted earnings per share diluted to be in the $4.10 to $4.18 range, an increase of 3% to 5% versus last year. This includes dilution from acquisitions and divestitures of about $0.20 per share.

As we continue to build our manufacturing footprint around the world, we continue, I think, to head to a positive direction there. In terms of investment and structure, we want to make sure that we continue to pace ourselves to rightsize for what we see is the opportunity. So as you know, we currently have this project in place where we're looking at the structure of the organization so we'll be very mindful with that, and then as we specifically look at a market like China and we think about investments in the second half, we want to make sure that the profile that we have in terms of DMUs, et cetera is appropriate to what we see as the opportunities and where we continue to expand our brands. So we're going to be working on building our core distribution. We want to continue to deepen our distribution coverage. But at the same time, based on that pace, we'll also dictate how we activate our brands from the DME standpoint, et cetera. So I think those are some things that you'll continue to see."

Why are you considering and why shouldn't the long-term growth objectives come down? And second, if they're not, what's going to be better to help you get there?

We want to continue to invest there. In our other international markets sort of x-China, things are about where we thought they would be. Obviously, FX is a headwind that is beyond our ability to predict perfectly. And so before we add specificity, I would say to how we want to think about the long term, we really need to get our hands around some of these shorter-term issues. But in terms of our business model strategies that we have, we're still very committed to that and I guess one of the things I would say is when you look at a focused strategy like we have in our international businesses around some very attractive core markets, we don't have a legacy of businesses in every corner of the Earth. We get the significant advantage of those markets when they're doing really well and we feel when there could be some bumps along the way, but we still think it's the right approach.

So I just want to pick your brain a little bit, nto to criticize, it's obviously a great trend, but how sustainable is that? Because I know the chocolate category has very little private label but the history of food right, is when gross margins get too high, eventually, value-oriented competitors are going to sniff out an opportunity here. So I'm just curious, how do you balance that between the goal of taking margin and growing it and making sure that you're not creating a price umbrella to create or attract competition?"

And if you look at the scale that we have in North America and the value of high-quality chocolate that's available in North America, it's the best cost per pound of chocolate really anywhere in the world, of course, across the major manufacturers. And I think that's one of  the things that the value that the category offers has really been one of the things that's insulated it from significant own label or private label entry points. So that's really the biggest thing that's probably kept it there. I think another thing that we're thinking a little bit differently about, Ken, that maybe from some of the things we said in the past, while we still have the majority of our portfolio, which is both the good value and really mass position, we also are really spending a lot of time thinking about that premium segment as well and so we're really thinking about it a little bit more broadly in terms of total available share across the category.

Let me talk a little bit about North America overall and then I'll hit some of the highlights of some of the great programming that we have coming in the back half so that you can get a little bit more color underneath what's going on there. As we look at the year, certainly our core brands are doing really well, and a healthy core is a key foundation to our business. We believe our advertising is working. We're investing as you know year incrementally behind that to really support the pricing conversion. Our advertising appears to be working. We have shifted some of our spend to digital. We think that's a really smart move and while we don't have all of the robust analytics, we have on-base advertising, it appears to be working quite well. We have a new campaign on Hershey's that appears to be resonating really well to millennials and driving some nice growth there. As we came into the year, we said a lot of the year will be dependent on us having successful execution of the pricing and the price conversion is on track. So we feel great about that. As I look at innovation and I'll speak a little bit to the back half the year, there's a couple of factors that give us confidence in the back half and I'd say that's innovation, continued momentum on the core and strong visibility to our seasonal sell ins. Both Halloween and Holiday, we have very strong sell ins. We have the visibility to what the customers are going to buy so we know what those numbers look like. We feel great about that and as we look at our innovation, as you recall, we launched into Hershey’s Caramels, Ice Breakers Cool Blast, so they're really just hitting the marketplace and the results to date have been very positive. Cool Blasts, our trial in velocities are exceeding expectations. And the distribution was a bit slower than we anticipated so we have more to come in the back half so that should accelerate. Brookside snack bars is just launching now. And again, the velocities in market look quite strong but all the benefit of that volume will come in the back half. We have Kisses Deluxe that hits in Q4, Snack Bites and Snack Mix launching now and then the acquisition of especially KRAVE will really accelerate towards the back half the year as Hershey gets more involved with the integration and execution."

I think also inside there, you look at Brookside, obviously we're on the early side of Krave. Alone has been a good one. We've had some joint ventures, some's gone quite well and others we've chosen at particular times to exit from. The thing that I would tell you and I think what's important and as we look at this, if you were to put it within the context of our due diligence process, I don't think we've gone about it in any errant way. I think we use the best advisers, the best names and family names that you can think of in terms of who you would partner with on, looking at these things. I think the landscape in China is certainly a challenging one and we're certainly finding that out. At the same time, we're being, I think appropriate in terms of recognizing things when we understand them. And I don't think it's as if there's no value to the strategies we have in Canada. I think the other thing, Eric, that you don't see is that there's a lot of things that we do work on that we pass on. And we pass on it for exactly the kinds of things that you would expect that either once we get under the hood, they don't yield what we anticipated or where there's things that we're concerned about. So in terms of rigor and so forth, I don't think there's any lack of that. Our goal is to get as many of these things work as we possibly can. You're correct, M&A is going to be important to our overall growth, and you can rest assured that we're reviewing every aspect of everything along the way with regard to this particular acquisition to make sure we learn as much as we can going forward. I'd like to think that we don't have some dark cloud that follows us and somehow we're jinxed. But at any rate, that's really kind of how I think about it."

The first one, J.P., is just and this has nothing to do with Shanghai Golden Monkey. I want to focus on the chocolate operations. The chocolate category in that market is still a very small category relative to the size of the country, $2.7 billion. Your operation is even smaller there. And I think last year, it was $185 million or something like that. So I suppose what's so hard to understand from the outside is why aren't ongoing distribution gains the dominant factor in driving the business? Why is it that we're looking at I think in your script you gave a 4% number for Hershey and a 6% number for the category. I mean, I feel like Hershey's story in China is you're in 14 cities where you advertise or something like that and you should be in 100 cities. So what's -- what am I getting wrong here? And why is this growth not being dominated by distribution expansion across this incredibly large and hopefully, hungry for chocolate country?"

I guess the execution of accomplishing it is a bit of the pace and challenge. Let me just reset a little bit. If you think about our business in China in distribution build, as you rightly say, we continue to build out our distribution. If you look at our business, about 60% to 65% of our business is done in 3 channels. It's done in Tier 1 hypermarkets, it's done in supermarkets and about 15% of the business in both B2C and B2B is done in e-commerce. So our sort of Tier 1 development is pretty significant and specific, and so we've been building, if you go back over the last 5 years, you've kind of heard us talk about 10 cities and 35 cities, 110 cities but a lot of that is really focused in a very narrow channels versus maybe what we ultimately want to have happen. And those channels also happen to be ones that were most impacted by some of the macroeconomic influences. And then our portfolio in China tends to lend itself a bit more towards gifting than it does the everyday business. So when you put all of those things together, and our portfolio there is still relatively narrow. It has made us a bit more volatile to some of these forces and factors than I would like to see going forward. So your hypothesis of the importance of growing distribution is absolutely right, and that's what we're focused on, and that's what we want to ultimately be able to do with Shanghai Golden Monkey and HISL is to be able to get into the best exhibitors with the best footprint and pushing broader portfolio of our brands into distribution. So that's really where we're headed. That hasn't changed. While we're all frustrated sometimes by the bumps in the road along the way, certainly, certainly we're experiencing some of that but I think as we look over the long term, I continue to have the same commitment and confidence of how we're going to grow our business there. Your first comment is the one that I'd like to end on. This is about category building. It's not about fighting for market share. It's about participating in the growth of this category for the future in a very large and attractive market."

Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations which are subject to risks and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2014 filed with the SEC.
If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Within the Notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally.
These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes that presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.
As a result, we will discuss 2015 second quarter results, excluding net pretax charges of $282 million or $1.23 per share diluted, primarily related to a noncash impairment charge and costs associated with the business productivity initiative announced in June. Our discussion of any future projection will also exclude the impact of these net charges.
With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey."

Importantly, we're committed to our long-term strategic plan and believe the balance and performance of the strong North America business and attractive growth opportunities in key international markets should enable us to deliver solid growth over the long term.
Our scale and profitable North America business gives us flexibility in the near term while maintaining focus on building our brands in China, Mexico, Brazil and India. The investments we've made in North America over the last few years are paying dividends. Our focus on consumer capabilities and customer insights provide us with the framework to build our brands with retailers.
We're also working with innovative firms like Palantir, that are building our predictive analytical capabilities in the areas of consumer insights and enterprise connectivity.
The implementation of the U.S. price increase we announced last year is on track, and the related CMG volume elasticity is in line with our modeling. This was partially offset by increased levels of promotions and discounts related to the Spreads and the Baking Chips businesses.
Our overall year-to-date U.S. retail takeaway of 3.1% is in line with our expectations. However, this was impacted by a shorter Easter season. Looking at the everyday base CMG business, retail takeaway was up mid-single digits in the second quarter. This is a solid indicator that our advertising or full efforts is working. Additionally, our continued focus on core brands has resulted in market share growth across the Hershey's, Kit Kat, Brookside, Kisses and Ice Breakers franchises.
We continue to optimize and refine our North America marketing model and execution capabilities. We're focused on advertising and marketing returns and are optimizing our spending across the portfolio.
For example, we're increasing our investment in the highest return chocolate business and increasing digital within our media mix. We're also leveraging our precision marketing capability to accelerate growth by executing in-store programming against consumer and geographic preferences by store.
Where we're implementing these plans, those retailers are outperforming the market. Nielsen's second quarter measures do not encompass the entire Easter season in both the year-ago and current periods. Therefore, my remarks will refer to year-to-date marketplace performance for the 28 weeks ended July 11.
Year-to-date, CMG, that's candy, mint and gum, category growth in the xAOC+C channels was up plus 2.7%. The Hershey CMG retail takeaway for the year-to-date period through July 11, 2015, in channels that account for about 90% of our U.S. retail business was up 3.1%. Looking past the Easter time frame, as expected, our retail takeaway accelerated and is up 4.8% for the 8 weeks ending July 11.
Our overall market share increased to 31.3%, an increase of 0.1 points. Performance by segment is tracking, as expected, with share gains in chocolate, mint and gum. We're pleased with our chocolate performance, where our year-to-date market share is up 0.3 points. This is partially offset by non-chocolate candy performance w,here we lost market share, as anticipated, as we lapped prior-year Jolly Rancher line extensions and last year's launch of Lancaster.
We're also making progress within snacks. Brookside bars are now available, with initial demand and velocity to be on par with the category leaders. This launch as well as Snack Bites and Snack Mix products will expand our confection equities to source volume across the broader snacking space. Reese's Spreads is on track, as this flavor profile is differentiated versus the other chocolate spreads within the category. However, the overall jar segment of the chocolate spread category has slowed with household penetration flattish.
Yet in consumable segment, the spreads category is growing, although it's become more competitive. The KRAVE business and integration is on track versus our plans. KRAVE is growing faster than all major competitors, driven by distribution and velocity gains.
Items per store and merchandising is growing, and net sales should nearly double this year. Outside of the U.S. in our international markets beyond China, business is relatively on track with our plans. In Mexico, net sales in local currency are up mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year and in line with retail takeaway.
As expected, the category in Hershey continue to improve as we lapped the VAT tax that was instituted last year. In Brazil, net sales in local currency declined mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year due to the timing of Easter and last year's Reese's launch. But despite the tough macroeconomic environment year-to-date, the chocolate category growth in Brazil has been resilient and is up high-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year.
Our market share in Brazil is up 0.3 points, with Hershey's and Reese's continuing to gain traction. 
Now let me address the challenges that we're facing in China. Our chocolate performance this year has been impacted by macroeconomic challenges that we believe impacted shopping behavior. Recall, we gained market share in the first quarter, but our growth was lower than the historical performance and our own expectations.
And in the second quarter, while category growth returned to low-double digits, competitive activity increased as manufacturers responded to poor Chinese New Year sell-through. This resulted in higher levels of increased trade, promotional allowance and discounts that impacted net sales and profitability.
June year-to-date chocolate category growth in China was nearly 6%. Hershey year-to-date China chocolate retail takeaway was 4.3%, with market share up 0.1%. We believe the category will continue to increase at the low double-digit rate we saw in the second quarter, putting it on track to be up 8% to 10% for the full year.
Some of the initial work we've done to help ensure that we execute against our plan in China and get back to our winning ways includes the broader rollout of Brookside chocolates, distribution into smaller format stores and continued focus and acceleration of our e-commerce business.
Our e-commerce business, while small, is up 60% this year. We're partnering with key third-party online retailers like Tmall, Jingdong and Yihaodian and learning a lot about digital consumers in China that will help us going forward.
China is a priority market for us, and we'll be focused on executing against our core brand building business model. For 120 years, our company has persevered and prospered with great people, purpose and brands, and we believe this model will work in China as we look to gain share in this evolving country and category.
As it relates to Shanghai Golden Monkey, I'd like to address some of the factors leading to the estimated impairment charge that we announced in this morning's press release. As we've indicated previously, we acquired the Golden Monkey business to broaden our footprint in China by leveraging both the sales force and the regional and local distributor network in order to diversify Hershey's chocolate growth, which has historically been leveraged to Tier 1 hypermarkets.
Results have been disappointing. We initially thought this was primarily due to macroeconomic headwinds in China. As the integration has progressed and the situation on the ground evolved, we've come to understand that there are significant business issues that we need to address in order to achieve our goals.
Accounts receivable collection has remained challenging, and sales continued to slow in the second quarter. Our assessment of the distributor network has made it clear that the network is not as stable as we believe. And therefore, the related retail customer reach is not as broad as we believe it to be.
As a result, the sales forecast for the business in 2015, around $90 million is less than our initial expectations of at least $200 million. This disappointing performance is impacting profitability. Despite these near-term results, we remain committed to  the long-term success of this acquisition as well as the China market. We're taking steps to build the strong foundation for future success, including the appointment of a new chairman and general manager for Golden Monkey with solid China consumer packaged goods experience. We're also looking at the cost structure of different integration strategies that are intended to get the business back on track as quickly as possible.
We'll continue to assess and address these issues and their impact on the value of the business as we work towards acquiring the remaining 20% of the business, which we now anticipate will occur in the fourth quarter of 2015. The timing and terms of the second closing will be informed by the results of our ongoing assessment.
We estimate that our International and Other segment net sales will be about $1 billion this year, with the chocolate share nearly 10% in China, 14% in Mexico and 5% in Brazil. We like the future growth outlook and prospects in these markets, which are an integral part of our international profile.
Now to wrap up. Core brand merchandising, programming and innovation accelerates over the remainder of the year. With the exception of China, there's no change to our advertising and marketing methodology. In these same markets, we continue to refine our plans, and we expect North America advertising and relating consumer marketing expense to increase at a rate about 2x greater than the organic net sales growth rate.
And it's generating results. Patricia will provide you with all the details related to the full year outlook. But excluding China chocolate, M&A and unfavorable FX, net sales are expected to be up around 3.5% to 4%.
We feel confident in our North America business plans, where we generate the majority of the company's sales and earnings. The situation continues to evolve in China, and our outlook reflects all the inputs that are available to us today.
While further volatility could occur in this market, we wouldn't expect it to have a material impact on our cash flow and strong balance sheet. Our profitable and on track North America business more than offsets the expected dilution from acquisitions and divestitures, primarily Golden Monkey, of about $0.20 per share, which we expect will result in 2015 full year adjusted earnings per share diluted growth of 3% to 5%.
Let me end by saying that despite these challenges, I'm optimistic about our future. We're focused and know what we need to do to succeed. We're building strong plans that will put us in a position to win wherever we compete. I'm very pleased that we continue to work as a focused team across the entire company. We have experienced leaders in place who have strong records of success and are all focused on increasing value for our shareholders. Now let me turn it over to Patricia, who will provide some additional detail on our financial results."

Second quarter net sales of $1.58 billion were in line with our revised guidance and generated adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.78, an increase of 2.6% versus last year. Ex",1618,"Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Second quarter net sales of $1.58 billion were in line with our revised guidance and generated adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.78, an increase of 2.6% versus last year. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 1.3 points, net sales increased 1.3% versus the year-ago period. Pricing and net acquisitions and divestitures were a 5.8 percentage point and 1.4 percentage point benefit, partially offset by 3.6 points of volume elasticity related to the previously mentioned price increase and lower sales in China.
Promotional spending, driven by China direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances, was a 2.3 percentage point headwind. As J.P. stated, North America continues to perform well. As is typical, the second quarter is our smallest quarter as it relates to overall net sales growth given the launch and timing of new products and seasonal growth associated with Halloween and Holiday.
North America net sales increased by 1.8% versus last year. Excluding the 60-basis-point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Canada, net sales increased 2.4%. North America net sales were slightly better than expectations, primarily due to solid U.S. CMG performance that was partially offset by snacks and grocery softness, primarily due to increased spreads and baking chips competitive activity. Net price realization was 5.5 point benefit and was offset by volume of 3.6 percentage points due to snacks and grocery sales that were less than anticipated and elasticity related to the pricing action that was in line with estimates.
On a net basis, the Allan Candy Company and KRAVE acquisitions as well as the Mauna Loa divestiture was a 50-basis-point benefit.
Turning now to margins. Adjusted gross margins increased 130 basis points in the second quarter, driven by net price realization and supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by obsolescence, unfavorable sales mix and lower volumes. For the full year, we continue to expect that gross margin will increase 135 to 145 basis points, driven by price realization.
Operating profit in the second quarter increased 3.3% versus last year, resulting in operating profit margins of 18.3%. The increase was driven by gross margin gains and a decrease in advertising and related consumer marketing expense of about 3%, primarily in China.
As expected, North America operating profit increased double digits on a percentage basis versus last year and was ahead of plan. This was partially offset by international performance, again, primarily China. Excluding the acquisitions and divestitures, SM&A expenses, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, was about the same as the year-ago period. Now let me provide a brief update on our international business.
Total International and Other segment net sales for the second quarter declined to 12.1% versus last year. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates were a 6-point headwind, and the Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition was an 8-point benefit. The International and Other segment core business was off about 14 points, due primarily to China chocolate business performance, where sales declined $35 million. We believe China chocolate category performance was impacted by macroeconomic challenges and trends that are affecting consumer behavior, lower trips in Tier 1 hypermarkets, increased competitive activity and accelerated momentum of e-commerce and online purchases.
As J.P. stated, over the remainder of the year, we're focused on the broader rollout of Brookside chocolate's distribution into smaller format stores and continued focus and acceleration of our e-commerce business.
None of us are happy with the developments around the Golden Monkey acquisition and integration. Our latest outlook for the business is obviously different than the acquisition model. Our initial estimated noncash impairment charge of about $250 million reflects the write-down of the goodwill. There's a lot of in-country analysis and field work going on to assess the potential of the business and the value of the sales and distributor network. Once this work is complete, we'll have a final amount related to the impairment charge. We estimate full year Golden Monkey net sales of about $90 million, but this is subject to change based on the ongoing work mentioned previously.
On a constant currency basis, net sales in Mexico, Brazil and India were relatively in line with our expectations. Given the macroeconomic and competitive environment in Mexico and Brazil, we're pleased with our performance. Looking at year-to-date, because of Easter timing, local currency sales in Mexico and Brazil are up about 10% and 7%, respectively. Plans are in place that should result in similar net sales increases over the remainder of the year.
In India, Q2 local currency sales were off about 2%. The brands that we are investing in, Jolly Rancher, SOFIT and JUMPIN, are up double digits. This was offset by the legacy low-margin hard candy business, which we previously indicated we would rationalize.
Therefore, we expect total International and Other segment net sales, including foreign currency headwinds and net contribution from M&A to decline mid-single digits for the full year.
Moving down the P&L, second quarter interest expense of $18.9 million declined $2.4 million versus last year. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be in the $75 million to $80 million range. The adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 35.3%, relatively in line with our estimates. Last quarter, we stated that the full year adjusted net tax rate would be slightly lower than a year ago. Driven by U.S. government investment tax credits, we expect the tax rate to be about 30% in the second half of the year and around 32.5% for the full year.
However, there will be a corresponding offset or expense related to the write-down of the investment tax credit within the other income and expense line item. Hence, the net effect of the full year net income of the tax credits is only about $5 million.
For the second quarter of 2015, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 221 million shares, leading to an  adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.78 or an increase of 2.6% versus a year ago. Let me now provide a quick recap of year-to-date adjusted results.
Net sales increased 1.9% in the first half. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 3.1% versus the year-ago period. Operating profit decreased 2%, resulting in an operating profit margin of 19.4%. Year-to-date adjusted gross margin was 46.6% versus 46% last year or 60 basis points higher as a result of net price realization gains and supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher input costs and obsolescence. 
Adjusted earnings per share diluted in the first half decreased about 1.6% to $1.87 per share. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the and of the second quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year's second quarter by $80 million. Accounts receivable were higher by $20 million and remain extremely current. Inventory was higher by $19 million, and accounts payable declined by $41 million.
Total capital additions, including software, were $90 million in the second quarter. For the year, we continue to expect total capital expenditures to be about $375 million to $400 million, including the capital related to the Johor, Malaysia project of about $110 million. During the second quarter, depreciation and amortization was $60 million, in line with our estimates. Dividends paid were $115 million. Earlier today, we announced a dividend increase of 9%. We have strong North American marketplace position and remain confident about the long-term growth potential of our business.
In the second quarter, no shares have been purchased against the $250 million authorization approved in February of 2015. In the second quarter, the company repurchased $9 million of common shares or $143 million year-to-date to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options.
Cash and short-term investments at the and of the second quarter were $402 million. This was lower than a year ago, primarily due to the KRAVE and Golden Monkey acquisitions. The company continues to generate substantial free cash flow and has a strong balance sheet. It is well-positioned to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements and acquisitions.
As J.P. summarized, over the remainder of the year, net sales will be driven by strong Halloween and Holiday seasonal programming and the continued rollout of new products in North America. In addition, we have made adjustments to the China business strategy to address the changing environment. In North America, advertising and related consumer marketing is expected to increase about 2x the organic net sales growth rate.
These investments will enable us to build on our North America momentum, positioning us to deliver on our objectives. As a result, the company estimates full year net sales will increase about 1.5% to 2.5%, including a net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures of about 1 point and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of about 1.5 points. Excluding unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, full year net sales are expected to increase about 3% to 4%.
We continue to have a significant focus on gross margin, and expect solid North America price realization and productivity and cost savings to result in 2015 gross margin expansion of 135 to 145 basis points. Combined with the  $10 million to $15 million in savings from the productivity initiatives announced in June, we expect adjusted earnings per share diluted to be in the $4.10 to $4.18 range, an increase of 3% to 5% versus last year. This includes dilution from acquisitions and divestitures of about $0.20 per share.

And if you look at the scale that we have in North America and the value of high-quality chocolate that's available in North America, it's the best cost per pound of chocolate really anywhere in the world across the major manufacturers. And I think that's one of the things that the value, that the category offers has really been one of the things that's insulated it from significant owned label or private label entry points. So that's really the biggest thing that's probably kept it there. I think another thing that we're thinking a little bit differently about, Ken, that maybe from some of the things we said in the past, while we still have the majority of our portfolio, which is both the good value and really mass position, we also are really spending a lot of time thinking about the premium segment as well. And so we're really thinking about it a little bit more broadly in terms of total available share across the category. So I think that's another way that we look at within our core business expanding our footprint."

So I think in terms of if you look at that business on a weighted basis and do we still have value within some of those distributors, the fact of the matter is yes, and the strategy is right. At the same time, as you can imagine, as you take a significant number of distributors and you try to align them into a new business model, there's things that you've got to make changes. And we're addressing that quite transparently upfront. We want to get moving ahead with building the business.

Let me talk a little bit about North America overall, and then I'll hit some of the highlights of some of the great programming that we have coming in the back half so that you can get a little bit more color underneath what's going on there. As we look at the year, certainly our core brands are doing really well. And a healthy core is a key foundation to our business. We believe our advertising is working. We're investing, as you know, this year incrementally behind that to really support the pricing conversion. Our advertising appears to be working. We have shifted some of our spend to digital. We think that's a really smart move. And while we don't have all of the robust analytics we have on base advertising, it appears to be working quite well. We have a new campaign on Hershey that appears to be resonating really well to millennials and driving some nice growth there. As we came into the year, we said a lot of the year would be dependent on us having successful execution of the pricing. And the price conversion is on track, so we feel great about that. As I look at innovation, and I'll speak a little bit to the back half the year, there's a couple of factors that give us confidence in the back half. And I'd say that's innovation, continued momentum on the core and strong visibility to our seasonal sell-ins. Both Halloween and Holiday, we have very strong sell-ins. We have the visibility to what the customers are going to buy. So we know what those numbers look like. So I feel great about that. And as we look at our innovation, as you recall, we launched in Q2 Hershey's Caramels, Ice Breakers Cool Blasts. So they're really just hitting the marketplace. And the results to date have been very positive. Cool Blasts, our trial and velocities are exceeding expectations. And the distribution was a bit slower than we anticipated, so we have more to come in the back half. So that should accelerate. Brookside snack bars is just launching now. And again, the velocities in the market look quite strong, but all of the benefit of that volume will come in the back half. With Kisses Deluxe that hits in Q4, Snack Bites and Snack Mix launching now and then the acquisition of especially KRAVE will really accelerate towards the back half the year as Hershey gets more involved with the integration and execution."

Some's gone quite well and others we've chosen at particular times to exit from. The thing that I would tell you, and I think what's important as we look at this, if you were to put it within the context of our due diligence process, I don't think we've gone about it in any errant way. I mean, we use the best advisers, the best names and family names that you can think of in terms of who you would partner with on looking at these things. I think the landscape in China is certainly a challenging one, and we're certainly finding that out. At the same time, we're being, I think, appropriate in terms of recognizing things when we understand them. And I don't think it's as if there's no value to the strategies we have in Canada. I think the other thing, Eric, that you don't see is that there's a lot of things that we do work on that we pass on.

The chocolate category in that market is still a very small category relative to the size of the country, $2.7 billion. Your operation is even smaller there. And I think last year, it was $185 million or something like that. So I suppose what's so hard to understand from the outside is why aren't ongoing distribution gains the dominant factor in driving the business? Why is it that we're looking at, I think in your script you gave a 4% number for Hershey and a 6% number for the category. I mean, I feel like Hershey's story in China is you're in 14 cities where you advertise or something like that and you should be in 100 cities. So what's -- what am I getting wrong here? And why is this growth not being dominated by distribution expansion across this incredibly large and hopefully hungry-for-chocolate country?"

I guess, the execution of accomplishing it is a bit of the pace and challenge. So let me just reset a little bit. If you think about our business in China in distribution build, as you rightly say, we continue to build out our distribution. It's largely -- if you look at our business, about 60% to 65% of our business is done in 3 channels. It's done in Tier 1 hypermarkets, it's done in supermarkets and about 15% of the business in both B2C and B2B is done in e-commerce. So our sort of Tier 1 development is pretty significant and specific. And so we've been building, if you go back over the last 5 years, you've kind of heard us talk about 10 cities and 35 cities, 110 cities, but a lot of that is really focused in very narrow channels versus maybe what we ultimately want to have happen. And those channels also happen to be ones that were most impacted by some of the macroeconomic influences. And then our portfolio in China tends to lend itself a bit more towards gifting than it does the everyday business. So when you put all of those things together, and our portfolio there's still relatively narrow, it has made us a bit more vulnerable to some of these forces and factors than I would like to see going forward. So your hypothesis of the importance of growing distribution is absolutely right, and that's what we're focused on, and that's what we want to ultimately be able to do with Shanghai Golden Monkey and HISL is to be able to get into the best distributors with the best footprint and pushing a broader portfolio of our brands into distribution. So that's really where we're headed. That hasn't changed. While we're all frustrated sometimes by the bumps in the road along the way, certainly we're experiencing some of that. But I think as we look over the long term, I continue to have the same commitment and confidence of how we're going to grow our business there. And your first comment is the one that I'd like to end on. This is about category-building. It's not about fighting for market share.

And I think it was enthusiastically received, and we'll be introducing some of those to the market later in the fall and certainly into 2016. And we continue to see that as an important opportunity. So I'll just end with this. We love the business we're in. Confectionery is at the heart of everything that we do, and it's on one end of the snacking continuum. And we think it's one of the greatest categories there is. At the same time, we also see that consumers have a changing with food. We see snacking as an important occasion, and we think we have a go-to-market capability and an R&D capability to meet those needs. So if on one end, you look at indulgent and you were to imagine on the far end, functional, we see that we have a broadening role to play across that entire continuum. And I'm enthusiastic to share with you as we go forward what some of those things are."

Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risks and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2014 filed with the SEC.
If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Within the Notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally.
These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes that presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.
As a result, we will discuss 2015 second quarter results, excluding net pretax charges of $282 million or $1.23 per share diluted, primarily related to a noncash impairment charge and costs associated with the business productivity initiative announced in June. Our discussion of any future projection will also exclude the impact of these net charges.
With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey."

In our long-term strategic planning cycle, we know there's always the potential for volatility, particularly in international markets. The combination of macroeconomic influences and competitive activity in our core China chocolate business, along with disappointing Golden Monkey performance, have resulted in negative short-term results in this part of the business. I'll talk more about this in a few minutes.
Importantly, we're committed to our long-term strategic plan and believe the balance and performance of the strong North America business and attractive growth opportunities in key international markets should enable us to deliver solid growth over the long term.
Our scale and profitable North America business gives us flexibility in the near term while maintaining focus on building our brands in China, Mexico, Brazil and India. The investments we've made in North America over the last few years are paying dividends. Our focus on consumer capabilities and customer insights provide us with the framework to build our brands with retailers.
We're also working with innovative firms like Palantir that are building our predictive analytical capabilities in the areas of consumer insights and enterprise connectivity.
The implementation of the U.S. price increase we announced last year is on track, and the related CMG volume elasticity is in line with our modeling. This was partially offset by increased levels of promotions and discounts related to the Spreads and the Baking Chips businesses.
Our overall year-to-date U.S. retail takeaway of 3.1% is in line with our expectations. However, this was impacted by a shorter Easter season. Looking at the everyday base CMG business, retail takeaway was up mid-single digits in the second quarter. This is a solid indicator that our advertising or pull efforts is working. Additionally, our continued focus on core brands has resulted in market share growth across the Hershey's, Kit Kat, Brookside, Kisses and Ice Breakers franchises.
We continue to optimize and refine our North America marketing model and execution capabilities. We're focused on advertising and marketing returns and are optimizing our spending across the portfolio.
For example, we're increasing our investment in the highest-return chocolate business and increasing digital within our media mix. We're also leveraging our precision marketing capability to accelerate growth by executing in-store programming against consumer and geographic preferences by store.
Where we're implementing these plans, those retailers are outperforming the market. Nielsen's second quarter measures do not encompass the entire Easter season in both the year-ago and current periods. Therefore, my remarks will refer to year-to-date marketplace performance for the 28 weeks ended July 11.
Year-to-date, CMG, that's candy, mint and gum, category growth in the xAOC+C channels was up plus 2.7%. The Hershey CMG retail takeaway for the year-to-date period through July 11, 2015, in channels that account for about 90% of our U.S. retail business was up 3.1%. Looking past the Easter time frame, as expected, our retail takeaway accelerated and is up 4.8% for the 8 weeks ending July 11.
Our overall market share increased to 31.3%, an increase of 0.1 points. Performance by segment is tracking as expected, with share gains in chocolate, mint and gum. We're pleased with our chocolate performance, where our year-to-date market share is up 0.3 points. This is partially offset by non-chocolate candy performance where we lost market share, as anticipated, as we lapped prior-year Jolly Rancher line extensions and last year's launch of Lancaster.
We're also making progress within snacks. Brookside bars are now available, with initial demand and velocity to be on par with the category leaders. This launch as well as Snack Bites and Snack Mix products will expand our confection equities to source volume across the broader snacking space. Reese's Spreads is on track, as this flavor profile is differentiated versus the other chocolate spreads within the category. However, the overall jar segment of the chocolate spread category has slowed, with household penetration flattish.
The instant consumable segment of the spreads category is growing, although it's become more competitive. The KRAVE business and integration is on track versus our plans. KRAVE is growing faster than all major competitors, driven by distribution and velocity gains.
Items per store and merchandising is growing, and net sales should nearly double this year. Outside of the U.S. in our international markets beyond China, business is relatively on track with our plans. In Mexico, net sales in local currency are up mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year and in line with retail takeaway.
As expected, the category and Hershey continued to improve, as we lapped the VAT tax that was instituted last year. In Brazil, net sales in local currency declined mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year due to the timing of Easter and last year's Reese's launch. But despite the tough macroeconomic environment year-to-date, the chocolate category growth in Brazil has been resilient and is up high-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year.
Our market share in Brazil is up 0.3 points, with Hershey's and Reese's continuing to gain traction. 
Now let me address the challenges that we're facing in China. Our chocolate performance this year has been impacted by macroeconomic challenges that we believe impacted shopping behavior. Recall, we gained market share in the first quarter, but our growth was lower than the historical performance and our own expectations.
And in the second quarter, while category growth returned to low double digits, competitive activity increased as manufacturers responded to poor Chinese New Year sell-through. This resulted in higher levels of increased trade, promotional allowance and discounts that impacted net sales and profitability.
June year-to-date chocolate category growth in China was nearly 6%. Hershey year-to-date China chocolate retail takeaway was 4.3%, with market share off 0.1 points. We believe the category will continue to increase at the low double-digit rate we saw in the second quarter, putting it on track to be up 8% to 10% for the full year.
Some of the initial work we've done to help ensure that we execute against our plan in China and get back to our winning ways includes the broader rollout of Brookside chocolates, distribution into smaller-format stores and continued focus and acceleration of our e-commerce business.
Our e-commerce business, while small, is up 60% this year. We're partnering with key third-party online retailers like Tmall, Jingdong and Yihaodian and learning a lot about digital consumers in China that will help us going forward.
China is a priority market for us, and we'll be focused on executing against our core brand-building business model. For 120 years, our company has persevered and prospered with great people, purpose and brands, and we believe this model will work in China as we look to gain share in this evolving country and category.
As it relates to Shanghai Golden Monkey, I'd like to address some of the factors leading to the estimated impairment charge that we announced in this morning's press release. As we've indicated previously, we acquired the Golden Monkey business to broaden our footprint in China by leveraging both the sales force and the regional and local distributor network in order to diversify Hershey's chocolate growth, which has historically been leveraged to Tier 1 hypermarkets.
Results have been disappointing. We initially thought this was primarily due to macroeconomic headwinds in China. As the integration has progressed and the situation on the ground evolved, we've come to understand that there are significant business issues that we need to address in order to achieve our goals.
Accounts receivable collection has remained challenging, and sales continued to slow in the second quarter. Our assessment of the distributor network has made it clear that the network is not as stable as we believed. And therefore, the related retail customer reach is not as broad as we believed it to be.
As a result, the sales forecast for the business in 2015 at around $90 million is less than our initial expectations of at least $200 million. This disappointing performance is impacting profitability. Despite these near-term results, we remain committed to the long-term success of this acquisition as well as the China market. We're taking steps to build the strong foundation for future success, including the appointment of a new chairman and general manager for Golden Monkey with solid China consumer packaged goods experience. We're also looking at the cost structure of different integration strategies that are intended to get the business back on track as quickly as possible.
We'll continue to assess and address these issues and their impact on the value of the business as we work towards acquiring the remaining 20% of the business, which we now anticipate will occur in the fourth quarter of 2015. The timing and terms of the second closing will be informed by the results of our ongoing assessment.
We estimate that our International and Other segment net sales will be about $1 billion this year, with the chocolate share nearly 10% in China, 14% in Mexico and 5% in Brazil. We like the future growth outlook and prospects in these markets, which are an integral part of our international profile.
Now to wrap up. Core brand merchandising, programming and innovation accelerates over the remainder of the year. With the exception of China, there's no change to our advertising and marketing methodology. In these same markets, we continue to refine our plans, and we expect North America advertising and related consumer marketing expense to increase at a rate about 2x greater than the organic net sales growth rate.
And it's generating results. Patricia will provide you with all the details related to the full year outlook. But excluding China chocolate, M&A and unfavorable FX, net sales are expected to be up around 3.5% to 4%.
We feel confident in our North America business plans, where we generate the majority of the company's sales and earnings. The situation continues to evolve in China, and our outlook reflects all the inputs that are available to us today.
While further volatility could occur in this market, we wouldn't expect it to have a material impact on our cash flow and strong balance sheet. Our profitable and on-track North America business more than offsets the expected dilution from acquisitions and divestitures, primarily Golden Monkey, of about $0.20 per share, which we expect will result in 2015 full year adjusted earnings per share diluted growth of 3% to 5%.
Let me end by saying that despite these challenges, I'm optimistic about our future. We're focused and know what we need to do to succeed. We're building strong plans that will put us in a position to win wherever we compete. I'm very pleased that we continue to work as a focused team across the entire company. We have experienced leaders in place who have strong records of success and are all focused on increasing value for our shareholders. Now let me turn it over to Patricia, who will provide some additional detail on our financial results."

Ex",1622,"Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Second quarter net sales of $1.58 billion were in line with our revised guidance and generated adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.78, an increase of 2.6% versus last year. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 1.3 points, net sales increased 1.3% versus the year-ago period. Pricing and net acquisitions and divestitures were a 5.8 percentage point and 1.4 percentage point benefit, partially offset by 3.6 points of volume elasticity related to the previously mentioned price increase and lower sales in China.
Promotional spending, driven by China direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances, was a 2.3 percentage point headwind. As J.P. stated, North America continues to perform well. As is typical, the second quarter is our smallest quarter as it relates to overall net sales growth given the launch and timing of new products and seasonal growth associated with Halloween and Holiday.
North America net sales increased by 1.8% versus last year. Excluding the 60 basis point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Canada, net sales increased 2.4%. North America net sales were slightly better than expectations, primarily due to solid U.S. CMG performance that was partially offset by snacks and grocery softness, primarily due to increased Spreads and Baking Chips competitive activity. Net price realization was a 5.5 point benefit and was offset by volume of 3.6 percentage points due to snacks and grocery sales that were less than anticipated and elasticity related to the pricing action that was in line with estimates.
On a net basis, the Allan Candy Company and KRAVE acquisitions as well as the Mauna Loa divestiture was a 50 basis point benefit.
Turning now to margins. Adjusted gross margins increased 130 basis points in the second quarter, driven by net price realization and supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by obsolescence, unfavorable sales mix and lower volumes. For the full year, we continue to expect that gross margin will increase 135 to 145 basis points, driven by price realization.
Operating profit in the second quarter increased 3.3% versus last year, resulting in operating profit margins of 18.3%. The increase was driven by gross margin gains and a decrease in advertising and related consumer marketing expense of about 3%, primarily in China.
As expected, North America operating profit increased double digits on a percentage basis versus last year and was ahead of plan. This was partially offset by international performance, again, primarily China. Excluding the acquisitions and divestitures, SM&A expenses, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, was about the same as the year-ago period. Now let me provide a brief update on our international business.
Total International and Other segment net sales for the second quarter declined 12.1% versus last year. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates were a 6-point headwind, and the Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition was an 8-point benefit. The International and Other segment core business was off about 14 points, due primarily to China chocolate business performance, where sales declined $35 million. We believe China chocolate category performance was impacted by macroeconomic challenges and trends that are affecting consumer behavior, lower trips in Tier 1 hypermarkets, increased competitive activity and accelerated momentum of e-commerce and online purchases.
As J.P. stated, over the remainder of the year, we're focused on the broader rollout of Brookside chocolates, distribution into smaller-format stores and continued focus and acceleration of our e-commerce business.
None of us are happy with the developments around the Golden Monkey acquisition and integration. Our latest outlook for the business is obviously different than the acquisition model. Our initial estimated noncash impairment charge of about $250 million reflects the write-down of the goodwill. There's a lot of in-country analysis and field work going on to assess the potential of the business and the value of the sales and distributor network. Once this work is complete, we'll have a final amount related to the impairment charge. We estimate full year Golden Monkey net sales of about $90 million, but this is subject to change based on the ongoing work mentioned previously.
On a constant currency basis, net sales in Mexico, Brazil and India were relatively in line with our expectations. Given the macroeconomic and competitive environment in Mexico and Brazil, we're pleased with our performance. Looking at year-to-date, because of Easter timing, local currency sales in Mexico and Brazil are up about 10% and 7%, respectively. Plans are in place that should result in similar net sales increases over the remainder of the year.
In India, Q2 local currency sales were off about 2%. The brands that we are investing in, Jolly Rancher, SOFIT and JUMPIN, are up double digits. This was offset by the legacy low-margin hard candy business, which we previously indicated we would rationalize.
Therefore, we expect total International and Other segment net sales, including foreign currency headwinds and net contribution from M&A, to decline mid-single digits for the full year.
Moving down the P&L, second quarter interest expense of $18.9 million declined $2.4 million versus last year. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be in the $75 million to $80 million range. The adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 35.3%, relatively in line with our estimates. Last quarter, we stated that the full year adjusted net tax rate would be slightly lower than a year ago. Driven by U.S. government investment tax credits, we expect the tax rate to be about 30% in the second half of the year and around 32.5% for the full year.
However, there will be a corresponding offset or expense related to the write-down of the investment tax credit within the other income and expense line item. Hence, the net effect of the full year net income of the tax credits is only about $5 million.
For the second quarter of 2015, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 221 million shares, leading to an adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.78 or an increase of 2.6% versus a year ago. Let me now provide a quick recap of year-to-date adjusted results.
Net sales increased 1.9% in the first half. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 3.1% versus the year-ago period. Operating profit decreased 2%, resulting in an operating profit margin of 19.4%. Year-to-date adjusted gross margin was 46.6% versus 46% last year or 60 basis points higher as a result of net price realization gains and supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher input costs and obsolescence. 
Adjusted earnings per share diluted in the first half decreased about 1.6% to $1.87 per share. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the second quarter, net trading capital increased versus last year's second quarter by $80 million. Accounts receivable were higher by $20 million and remain extremely current. Inventory was higher by $19 million, and accounts payable declined by $41 million.
Total capital additions, including software, were $90 million in the second quarter. For the year, we continue to expect total capital expenditures to be about $375 million to $400 million, including the capital related to the Johor, Malaysia project of about $110 million. During the second quarter, depreciation and amortization was $60 million, in line with our estimates. Dividends paid were $115 million. Earlier today, we announced a dividend increase of 9%. We have strong North American marketplace position and remain confident about the long-term growth potential of our business.
In the second quarter, no shares have been purchased against the $250 million authorization approved in February of 2015. In the second quarter, the company repurchased $9 million of common shares or $143 million year-to-date to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options.
Cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter were $402 million. This was lower than a year ago, primarily due to the KRAVE and Golden Monkey acquisitions. The company continues to generate substantial free cash flow and has a strong balance sheet. It is well positioned to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements and acquisitions.
As J.P. summarized, over the remainder of the year, net sales will be driven by strong Halloween and Holiday seasonal programming and the continued rollout of new products in North America. In addition, we have made adjustments to the China business strategy to address the changing environment. In North America, advertising and related consumer marketing is expected to increase about 2x the organic net sales growth rate.
These investments will enable us to build on our North America momentum, positioning us to deliver on our objectives. As a result, the company estimates full year net sales will increase about 1.5% to 2.5%, including a net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures of about 1 point and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of about 1.5 points. Excluding unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, full year net sales are expected to increase about 3% to 4%.
We continue to have a significant focus on gross margin, and expect solid North America price realization and productivity and cost savings to result in 2015 gross margin expansion of 135 to 145 basis points. Combined with the $10 million to $15 million in savings from the productivity initiatives announced in June, we expect adjusted earnings per share diluted to be in the $4.10 to $4.18 range, an increase of 3% to 5% versus last year. This includes dilution from acquisitions and divestitures of about $0.20 per share.

In terms of investment and structure, we want to make sure that we continue to pace ourselves to rightsize for what we see as the opportunity. So as you know, we currently have this project in place, where we're looking at the structure of the organization. So we'll be very mindful of that. And then as we specifically look at a market like China, and we think about investments in the second half, we want to make sure that the profile that we have in terms of DMEs, et cetera, is appropriate to what we see as the opportunities and where we continue to expand our brands. So we're going to be working on building our core distribution. We want to continue to deepen our distribution coverage. But at the same time, based on that pace, we'll also dictate how we activate our brands from a DME standpoint, et cetera. So I think those are some things that you'll continue to see."

Obviously, FX is a headwind that is beyond our ability to predict perfectly.

But in terms of our business model, the strategies that we have, we're still very committed to that. And I guess, one of the things I would say is when you look at a focused strategy like we have in our international businesses around some very attractive core markets, we don't have a legacy of businesses in every corner of the Earth.

Your gross margins are going up at a time when many food companies are heading the other way. And if you have cocoa and milk dropping next year, which is possible, and you keep getting productivity, you're going to see another gross margin jump again. So I just wanted to pick your brain a little bit, not to criticize that because it's obviously a great trend, but how sustainable is that? Because I know the chocolate category has very little private label, but the history of food, right, is when gross margins get too high, eventually, value-oriented competitors are going to sniff out an opportunity here. So I'm just curious, how do you balance that between the goal of taking margin and growing it and making sure that you're not creating a price umbrella to create or attract competition?"

And if you look at the scale that we have in North America and the value of high-quality chocolate that's available in North America, it's the best cost per pound of chocolate really anywhere in the world across the major manufacturers. And I think that's one of the things that the value that the category offers has really been one of the things that's insulated it from significant owned-label or private-label entry points. So that's really the biggest thing that's probably kept it there. I think another thing that we're thinking a little bit differently about, Ken, that maybe from some of the things we said in the past, while we still have the majority of our portfolio, which is both a good value and really mass positioned, we also are really spending a lot of time thinking about the premium segment as well. And so we're really thinking about it a little bit more broadly in terms of total available share across the category.

Let me talk a little bit about North America overall, and then I'll hit some of the highlights of some of the great programming that we have coming in the back half so that you can get a little bit more color underneath what's going on there. As we look at the year, certainly our core brands are doing really well. And a healthy core is a key foundation to our business. We believe our advertising is working. We're investing, as you know, this year incrementally behind that to really support the pricing conversion. Our advertising appears to be working. We have shifted some of our spend to digital. We think that's a really smart move. And while we don't have all of the robust analytics we have on base advertising, it appears to be working quite well. We have a new campaign on Hershey that appears to be resonating really well with millennials and driving some nice growth there. As we came into the year, we said a lot of the year would be dependent on us having successful execution of the pricing. And the price conversion is on track, so we feel great about that. As I look at innovation, and I'll speak a little bit to the back half the year, there's a couple of factors that give us confidence in the back half. And I'd say that's innovation, continued momentum on the core and strong visibility to our seasonal sell-ins. Both Halloween and Holiday, we have very strong sell-ins. We have the visibility to what the customers are going to buy. So we know what those numbers look like. So I feel great about that. And as we look at our innovation, as you recall, we launched in Q2 Hershey's Caramels, Ice Breakers Cool Blasts. So they're really just hitting the marketplace. And the results to date have been very positive. Cool Blasts, our trial and velocities are exceeding expectations. And the distribution was a bit slower than we anticipated, so we have more to come in the back half. So that should accelerate. Brookside snack bars is just launching now. And again, the velocities in the market look quite strong, but all of the benefit of that volume will come in the back half. We have Kisses Deluxe that hits in Q4, Snack Bites and Snack Mix launching now and then the acquisition of especially KRAVE will really accelerate towards the back half the year as Hershey gets more involved with the integration and execution."

I mean, I feel like Hershey's story in China is you're in 14 cities where you advertise or something like that and you should be in 100 cities. So what's -- what am I getting wrong here? And why is this growth not being dominated by distribution expansion across this incredibly large and hopefully hungry-for-chocolate country?"

I guess, the execution of accomplishing it is a bit of the pace and challenge. So let me just reset a little bit. If you think about our business in China in distribution build, as you rightly say, we continue to build out our distribution. It's largely -- if you look at our business, about 60% to 65% of our business is done in 3 channels. It's done in Tier 1 hypermarkets, it's done in supermarkets and about 15% of the business in both B2C and B2B is done in e-commerce. So our sort of Tier 1 development is pretty significant and specific. And so we've been building -- if you go back over the last 5 years, you've kind of heard us talk about 10 cities and 35 cities, 110 cities, but a lot of that is really focused in very narrow channels versus maybe what we ultimately want to have happen. And those channels also happen to be ones that were most impacted by some of the macroeconomic influences. And then our portfolio in China tends to lend itself a bit more towards gifting than it does the everyday business. So when you put all of those things together, and our portfolio there's still relatively narrow, it has made us a bit more vulnerable to some of these forces and factors than I would like to see going forward. So your hypothesis of the importance of growing distribution is absolutely right, and that's what we're focused on, and that's what we want to ultimately be able to do with Shanghai Golden Monkey and HISL is to be able to get into the best distributors with the best footprint and pushing a broader portfolio of our brands into distribution. So that's really where we're headed. That hasn't changed. While we're all frustrated sometimes by the bumps in the road along the way, certainly we're experiencing some of that. But I think as we look over the long term, I continue to have the same commitment and confidence of how we're going to grow our business there. And your first comment is the one that I'd like to end on. This is about category building. It's not about fighting for market share. It's about participating in the growth of this category for the future in a very large and attractive market."

Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2014 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted in our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes that presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provide additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. As a result, we will discuss third quarter results, excluding net free tax charges of $142 million or $0.47 diluted, primarily related to the productivity initiative announced in June, a noncash impairment charge in China and costs associated with nearly extinguishment of debt. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges. 
With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey."

In the third quarter, our efforts were focused on ensuring successful execution of our seasonal plans, which are on track and should result in good Halloween and Holiday seasons. We were pleased with North America gross margin expansion that resulted in solid operating profit growth, however, organic net sales growth was less than expected. North America organic net sales increased 3.2%, ahead of CMG marketplace performance, primarily due to the timing of seasonal shipments and snack sales that don't get captured in the Nielsen CMG database. Hershey U.S. candy, mint and gum, or CMG, retail takeaway in the third quarter was about plus 0.3%, less than category growth, resulting in market share loss of 0.4 points. Lower-than-expected levels of merchandising and programming at select retailers led to consumption trends that were below our estimates. Mainstream snacking categories like salty, snack cakes and meat snacks also saw consumption slow in the third quarter versus the June and year-to-date trends. Additionally, consumer retail trips in the third quarter were lower, down almost 4%. 
By channel, trips performance was mixed. On a percentage basis versus last year trips, they declined high single digits in drug and convenience stores, low single digits in grocery and were up mid-single digits in club. Trends appear to have improved as we exited September. And in October, CMG in-store merchandising and programming has been executed and should result in Hershey share gains in the important Halloween season. 
Third quarter CMG category performance by segment was mixed. Ice Breakers Cool Blasts is doing very well. The Ice Breaker brand continues to drive both gum and mint category growth, and this period was no exception. Specifically, our third quarter gum and mint retail takeaway was about plus 9% and plus 16%, leading to solid market share gains in these segments. Chocolate category performance was soft in the third quarter, up 0.4%. Hershey chocolate retail takeaway was off minus 0.5%, resulting in a market share decline of 0.4 points. We believe our performance was impacted by a later-than-normal Labor Day, the aforementioned lower levels of trips in in-store merchandising and programming. We also have lower year-over-year advertising GRPs. In the fourth quarter, U.S. advertising GRPs will reach the highest level of the year and seasonal merchandising and programming is in place. Combined with the Reese's NCAA College Game Day promotion and the launch of Hershey's Kiss Deluxe, we expect improvement in chocolate marketplace trends in the fourth quarter. 
Non-chocolate candy, or NCC, category growth in the third quarter was plus 3.3%. In-store activity and merchandising within this segment of the category was greater than what we've seen in many years. Given the 2014 activity that we're lapping, the prior year launch of Lancaster caramels amounts and Jolly Rancher extensions, Hershey's NCC third quarter market share was off 1 point. We expect our NCC performance to improve in 2016 as we leverage the Allan Candy capabilities in the brands. 
We're also making progress within snacks and groceries. Brookside bars are now available with initial demand and velocity on par with the category leaders. And we'll continue to build on Brookside's equity in 2016 with the launch of 3 flavors of Brookside yogurt fruit and nut bars. We also had limited introductory launch of Hershey's Reese's and Payday Snack Bites and Snack Mix products. These sweet and salty offerings are off to a strong start and, in some cases, we've extended the brand and secured space in addition to the confectionary aisle. The early read is positive in the C-stores where we have distribution and front-end checkouts. 
Switching to meat snacks. As I stated earlier, category growth here also slowed a bit in the third quarter, although it was primarily due to underperformance of the mainstream portion of the category. Looking at premium, our artisan meat snacks were Krave plays, this subsegment of the category increased about 40% in the third quarter and was relatively in line with the growth rates of the 4-, 12- and 52-week periods. The Krave business and integration is progressing well, and retail takeaway is significantly outpacing the category, driven by velocity and distribution gains. Items per store and merchandising is growing, and net sales should nearly double this year. We feel good about our snacking and adjacency initiatives and believe meat snacks, snack bars as well as Snack Bites and Snack Mix products give us an opportunity to source volume and sales across the broader snacking category. 
Now for an update on our international business. Given the macroeconomic environment in our focus markets, broad category and Hershey growth was challenging. Combined third quarter constant currency net sales in Mexico and Brazil increased mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year in a very tough environment. Constant currency net sales in India declined, in line with estimates. And recall, this is expected as we phased out our sales of edible oil products. Importantly, India core brand sales increased high single digits on a percentage basis versus last year. 
The Shanghai Golden Monkey integration is progressing, and we've increased our resources on the ground as we move forward. We're very focused on integrating the business and executing against our solid plan. It's a bit too early to discuss our 2016 initiatives, but we're cautiously optimistic that we'll be able to leverage the core Golden Monkey products in the Chinese New Year period given that 2016 is the zodiac year of the monkey. In the third quarter, China chocolate net sales were relatively in line with our expectations. However, Q3 chocolate category growth of 4% was less than June year-to-date growth of 6%. It appears that the category continues to be impacted by macroeconomic challenges and trends that are affecting consumer shopping behavior and the acceleration of e-commerce and online purchases of broader consumer statements. These factors are leading to lower sales velocities in Tier 1 hypermarkets where the majority of our chocolate sales are derived and impacting the impulse-oriented chocolate category. We expect marketplace trends to slightly improve in Q4 but no longer expect the category to increase high single digits for the full year. 
We're making progress against the the initiatives we discussed earlier in the year. Distribution and velocity in the smaller format super and mini channels is on track, and Brookside ACV is increasing. As we entered the fourth quarter, Brookside advertising is on air. Displays are being activated at retail, and a digital campaign on WeChat has been established and we continue to build on our e-commerce momentum. We're particularly pleased with our online business, which in August was up 112% and was focused on Chinese Valentine's Day. For the year-to-date period, our China chocolate e-commerce retail takeaway is up about 55%. We have specific activity for the upcoming Singles Day and Holiday season and believe we're doing some of the right things here as evidenced by our market share gains in this evolving and important channel. So while challenging, China is a priority market for us, and I believe we're executing against the right fundamentals and are focused on building our business for the long term. 
In Mexico, net sales in local currency for the quarter and year-to-date periods are up high single digits on a percentage basis versus last year, driven by our chocolate business. Within the chocolate category, we're seeing good investments by all major manufacturers in the form of new products and core brand investments. As a result, our chocolate marketplace performance is like the category. Chocolate market share in the modern trade in Mexico for the year-to-date period is off as our retail takeaway of about 6% has lagged category growth of about 13%. 
In Brazil, local currency net sales has sequentially improved versus last quarter and are up low single digits. Although retail takeaway slowed in the third quarter given the challenged macroeconomic environment and increased competitive activity. Brazil chocolate market share for the year-to-date period is up 0.4 points. However, given my aforementioned comments, we would expect the macroeconomic environment in Brazil to pressure Q4 performance. 
Now to wrap up. Our #1 goal is to regain momentum in terms of Hershey's marketplace performance as it relates to retail takeaway and market share. Our fourth quarter and 2016 plans are focused, and the investment profile is concentrated in the areas where Hershey is advantaged. Specifically, you'll see core brand investments in the form of innovation and marketing, especially a greater focus on digital and a focus on in-store execution as it relates to merchandising and programming. Without getting into specific details related to 2016, our initial plans are balanced from a top and bottom line perspective. Next year, we lapped charges in China related to trade promotion that have pressured results this year. We'll also benefit from the productivity initiatives related to the organization simplification program announced in June and have good visibility, excuse me, into our cost structure as it relates to raw materials. We believe this setup gives us the flexibility to invest in core initiatives that drives growth while also building on our equities within the Snack Mix, snack bar and meat snack categories. At the same time, we're also doing strategic planning work in assessing our long-term targets. Acquiring the remaining 20% of Shanghai Golden Monkey impacts this, so it when this occurs, we'll be able to share our integration plan and potential cost savings as it relates to our combined businesses in China. In the fourth quarter, our seasonal business plans are strong and complement the activity related to core brand merchandising, programming and innovation. From my earlier comments, North America advertising and related consumer marketing expense accelerates, and we expect CMG retail takeaway trends to improve. Patricia will provide you with all of the details related to the full year outlook. But excluding unfavorable FX, 2015 total company net sales are expected to increase 1.5% to 2.5%. Solid gross margin expansion, driven by the very profitable U.S. business and other productivity and cost savings more than offsets greater-than-expected dilution from acquisition and divestitures and should result in 2015 full year adjusted earnings per share diluted growth towards low end of the 3% to 5% range. 
2015 has unfolded the way we had planned, but we remain focused on strong execution of our plans. Candy, mint and gum has one of the better-performing categories in the store for many years. It's a destination category, impulsive and very profitable for retailers. And as a result, it typically garners key floor space within the store as it relates to merchandising and programming. However, over the last 2 years, it appears that income bifurcation and expanded choice among snacking is having an impact on generating consistent CMG category growth. While overall consumer confidence is trending up, lower-income consumers continue to be fragile as income and wage growth has been minimal. Higher income and more confident consumers are driving premium growth, while cost-conscious consumers are driving the value segment. As indicated last quarter and in my remarks today, in 2016, we'll introduce candy products and programs that will leverage our ubiquitous distribution specifically targeting our core everyday candy business as well as the mass premium and value segments where we're currently underrepresented. I look forward to sharing these plans with you in January. We have strong financial resources and technical capabilities, and I have a passionate team of leaders and coworkers who are committed to winning in the marketplace. 
I'll now turn it over to Patricia, who will provide some additional detail on our financial results."

Pricing in net acquisitions and divestitures were 5.8 point and 0.5 benefit, partially offset by 4.3 points of lower volume related to pricing elasticity in North America and lower sales in China. As J.P. stated, North America gross margin and operating income growth was solid. However, U.S. marketplace consumption trends were less than our estimates and as a result, sales shipments were softer than expected. Excluding the 1.1 point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Canada, North America net sales increased 3.5% versus the year-ago period. Net price realization was a 6.9  point benefit and volume was off 3.7 points due to elasticity related to the pricing action. The volume impact was in line with estimates when adjusted for the trip declines that J.P. reference. On a net basis, the Allan Candy and Krave acquisitions and the Mauna Loa divestiture were a 30 basis point benefit. 
Total international another segment net sales for the third quarter declined 15% versus last year. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates were a 7.9 point headwind and the Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition, a 2.3 point benefit. The International and Other segment core business volume was off about 10 points due primarily to China chocolate business performance where sales declined $18 million. 
Turning now to margins. Adjusted gross margins increased 220 basis points in the third quarter, driven by net price realization and supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by international trade allowances primarily in China. Operating profit in the third quarter increased by 9.1% versus last year resulting in operating profit margins of 21.2%. The increase was driven by gross margin gains and lower SM&A, selling, marketing and administrative expenses. SM&A, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, increased about 2.8%. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, SM&A expenses, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, declined 2.8% as we remain focused on nonessential spending and look to leverage existing resources. By segment, North America operating profit increased low double digits on a percentage basis versus last year and is on plan. This was partially offset by international performance primarily China. 
Now let me provide a brief update on our international business. China chocolate category performance continues to be below the historical CAGR growth rate of 11% to 12%. In Q3, chocolate category performance was sluggish in both hyper and small format stores and impacted all major manufacturers, including those with innovations that have been driving the market. Over the remainder of the year, we're focused on the broader rollout of Brookside chocolate, distribution into smaller format stores and our e-commerce business. We're making progress in areas that will benefit the business over the long term. However, in the short term, chocolate results in China could remain pressured if lower hypermarket trips and category growth continues to track at these lower levels. This scenario could have an impact on our Chinese New Year sell-in assumptions over the remainder of the year. 
Shanghai Golden Monkey integration is slowly continuing, and we're finishing work that will indicate which distributors we'll invest with going forward. Golden Monkey gross sales for the full year are in line with previous estimates. However, we had some true-ups on sales promotions, and the current net sales estimate for Golden Monkey in 2015 is now around $80 million less than our prior expectations. These true-ups, plus an adjustment to the tax rate, which I'll discuss in a few moments, are the primary drivers of the increase in M&A dilution from about $0.20 to $0.35 per share diluted. On a local-currency basis, combined net sales in Mexico and Brazil increased to mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year. Year-to-date, local currency sales in Mexico and Brazil are up about 10% and 5%, respectively. The macroeconomic environment and competitive dynamics in Latin America continue to be a challenge, and we would expect this to be a headwind as it relates the fourth quarter performance. 
India third quarter local currency sales were off about 20% as we began the phaseout of edible oils, which were discontinued at the end of the third quarter. Excluding the edible oil business, India core business sales increased 7%. The brands that were investing behind, Jolly Rancher and Sofit continue to do well in the marketplace. 
Moving down the P&L. Third quarter interest expense of $18.6 million declined $2.5 million versus last year or 11.9%. For the full year, we expect interest expense to be at the low end of the $75 million to $80 million range. The adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 33.5%. This is greater than our previous estimate of about 30% due to the timing of the U.S. government investment tax credits we discussed last quarter and an adjustment to [indiscernible] related to Golden Monkey net operating loss carryforward. As a result, we expect the fourth quarter and full year tax rates to be about 31% and 33.5%, respectively. In the fourth quarter, we expect to record $35 million within the other income and expense line related to the U.S. government investment tax credits. Hence, the net effect on full year net income of the tax credits is about $5 million. For the third quarter of 2015, weighted-average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 220 million shares, down $3.8 million versus last year and a $0.02 benefit in the quarter resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.17 or an increase of 11.4% versus a year ago. 
Let me now provide a quick recap of year-to-date adjusted results. Year-to-date net sales increased 1.2%. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 2.7% versus the year-ago period. Operating profit increased about 2%, resulting in an operating profit margin of 20%. Year-to-date adjusted gross margin was 46.4% versus 45.2% last year or 120 basis points higher as a result of net price realization and supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher input costs and obsolescence. Year-to-date adjusted earnings per share diluted increased about 3.1% to $3.04 per share. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the third quarter, net trading capital decreased versus last year's third quarter by $39 million. Accounts receivable was lower by $26 million and remains extremely current. Inventory was lower by $87 million, and accounts payable declined by $74 million. Total capital additions, including software were $86 million in the third quarter and $238 million year-to-date. For the year, we expect total capital expenditures to be around $350 million. This is less than our previous forecast of $375 million to $400 million due to lower capital requirements related to the Johor, Malaysia project, which is now estimated to be about $80 million in 2015. 
During the third quarter, depreciation and amortization was $64 million, and dividends paid were $124 million. In the third quarter, the company repurchased $230 million of outstanding shares against the $250 million authorization approved in February, 2015. For the year-to-date period, the company repurchased $403 million of outstanding shares. In addition, the company repurchased $22 million of common shares in the quarter and $165 million year-to-date to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock option. 
Cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $344 million. This is lower than year ago, primarily due to acquisitions and the share buyback. The company continues to generate substantial free cash flow that has a very strong balance sheet. 
In the fourth quarter, North America in-store seasonal merchandising and programming is secured, and on-air advertises-- advertising reaches its highest point of the year. But as J.P. mentioned, lower consumer trips and the macroeconomic environment continue to be a challenge within the retail environment as we wind down the year and look to 2016. We're confident in our ability to execute that the retail level and provide consumers with CMG and snack products that can drive growth. As a result, we do expect North America marketplace performance to improve over the remainder of the year. Given year-to-date results, the aforementioned challenges in international markets and slightly higher-than-expected FX headwinds, we estimate that full year net sales will be about the same as to slightly up versus 2014. Including a net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures of about 1 point and excluding an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of at least 1.5  points, net sales are expected to increase 1.5% to 2%. This is the less than the low-end of the previously provided outlook of 3%. We continue to expect solid gross margin growth and 2015, driven by North America price realization. However, given year-to-date results and the impact of higher levels of international trade promotion, the company expects margin expansion at the low end of 135 to 145 basis point estimate. We're also focused on nonessential SM&A expenses and to leverage existing resources and given performance will also benefit from lower than estimated other employee-related costs. In addition, expected 2015 savings from the business productivity initiative announced in June is estimated to be around $25 million versus the previous estimate of $10 million to $15 million. As a result, we expect adjusted earnings per share diluted to be at the low end of the 3% to 5% range or approximately $4.10 per share diluted. This includes dilution from acquisitions and divestitures of about $0.35 per share, which is greater than the previous estimate of about $0.20 per share diluted.

So I think that as we continue to get greater clarity around at least our thinking, we think the consumer bifurcation has been an important driver. We're also seeing that there's expanded choice across the broader snacking continuum. As an example, snack bars, there's about 30% more SKUs in the category then there has been over the last couple of years, so we think we've had some trial there on some of those brands that has impacted some of our CMG brands. And then, of course, we've had the trips issue where we've seen a continuing decline in trips across the category on in every day and into consumable basis. That had a trending impact against our business as well. So I would think -- I think those are some things that we had to solve for. I feel good about the contribution we've had from innovation into our business over that period of time so it's continuing to contribute as we have hoped it would. And then I think as we move into 2016, we have to have a balanced approach, continue to execute against the fundamentals. I think the pricing is actually coming through about as we would have anticipated. And so really, it's about the magic elixir of volume and how do we continue to drive and bring consumers into the category. And I think those are all things that, as I look at 2016, will be in our favor. I would expect the international, we've got very -- the biggest impact we have against the business is, of course, FX. I don't know that we'll be in that environment forever, and then that we really hope to get ourselves in a good place in China that we can begin to benefit for the reasons that we had the acquisition there. So I agree we do, it's been unusual in 2015. It's the macroeconomic winds, but I think the fundamentals in the category for retailers continue to be attractive as a category and we have to execute well."

So I can't tell you that on a single Monday morning, the world changes, but I think the dynamics as a category continue to be attractive. Consumers are snacking more than they ever have before. We have to make sure our portfolios are attractive and we have to build grants within that. And I think history would suggest that we know how to do that.

So as you probably heard us talk before, we're heavily weighted to the hypermarket channel in China versus having deeper distribution. So even as we've grown our distribution, it's largely been in the Tier 1 cities and it's also been more weighted to hypermarkets. And the hypermarket channel has been more negatively impacted over the last 12 months dna have other channels. Although the total category across channels is down, we're not as well-represented in some of those channels that have actually done better than the hypermarket channel. So we have a weighting mix issue that's really impacted our business there, which is one of the things that interested us so much in Shanghai Golden Monkey is it gives us better and deeper distribution across smaller stores supermarkets and then also Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities where appropriate. So we think those factors are still relevant and that we'll benefit from that. Obviously, we had some struggles in terms of the start-up of Shanghai Golden Monkey, but the real drivers of why we made the acquisition still exist, the distribution channel is there, the manufacturing is there, the brand, et cetera. So we think as we go forward and getting control of that business, we'll definitely benefit from the greater penetration across all the channels. That's how I would think about what's happening there. And you have a faster evolution there probably than anyplace else in terms of e-commerce. So in our category, about 15% of the business is sold in e-commerce. We're right about where the category is. That piece of our business is growing very nicely, so we're participating in that channel development quite nicely. So those are several things that I would mention about China."

In the value segment, a lot of what happened this year was really around sugar confectionery and sweets, and we think the Allan Candy acquisition will enable us to do well there. We also think there were some manufacturers that probably benefited from the spot price of sugars. And based on things where manufactured, that could have given them an opportunity to invest in the category more so in the past. So the beauty of the Hershey brand is, it's one of the most accessible brands that there is chocolate in our country. For more manufactures, it's the best value per pound any place in the world. So I think frequency is something we have to make sure that we're driving. I think the portfolio is largely attractive in chocolate, but we need to work the high end.

We have a lot of responsibility in terms of category growth, so we have to innovate and grow and compete for consumer occasions, which are growing all the time across day parts, and so we have to participate in that.

Bilbrey, Chairman, President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with an overview of results, which will then be followed by a Q&A session. 
Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2014 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes that presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. 
As a result, we will discuss third quarter results, excluding net free tax charges of $140 million or $0.47 per share diluted, primarily related to the productivity initiative announced in June, a noncash impairment charge in China and costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges. 
With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey."
98873,313270368,883794,"The Hershey Company, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","The Hershey Company","Executives","Thanks, Mark. In the third quarter, our efforts were focused on ensuring successful execution of our seasonal plans, which are on track and should result in good Halloween and Holiday seasons. We were pleased with North America gross margin expansion that",1922,"Thanks, Mark. In the third quarter, our efforts were focused on ensuring successful execution of our seasonal plans, which are on track and should result in good Halloween and Holiday seasons. We were pleased with North America gross margin expansion that resulted in solid operating profit growth, however, organic net sales growth was less than expected. North America organic net sales increased 3.2%, ahead of CMG marketplace performance, primarily due to the timing of seasonal shipments and snack sales that don't get captured in the Nielsen CMG database. Hershey U.S. candy, mint and gum, or CMG, retail takeaway in the third quarter was about plus 0.3%, less than category growth, resulting in market share loss of 0.4 points. 
Lower-than-expected levels of merchandising and programming at select retailers led to consumption trends that were below our estimates. Mainstream snacking categories like salty, snack cakes and meat snacks also saw consumption slow in the third quarter versus the June year-to-date trends. Additionally, consumer retail trips in the third quarter were lower, down almost 4%. 
By channel, trips performance was mixed. On a percentage basis versus last year trips, they declined high single digits in drug and convenience stores, low single digits in grocery and were up mid-single digits in club. Trends appear to have improved as we exited September. And in October, CMG in-store merchandising and programming has been executed and should result in Hershey share gains in the important Halloween season. 
Third quarter CMG category performance by segment was mixed. Ice Breakers Cool Blasts is doing very well. The Ice Breaker brand continues to drive both gum and mint category growth, and this period was no exception. Specifically, our third quarter gum and mint retail takeaway was about plus 9% and plus 16%, leading to solid market share gains in these segments. Chocolate category performance was soft in the third quarter, up 0.4%. Hershey chocolate retail takeaway was off minus 0.5%, resulting in a market share decline of 0.4 points. 
We believe our performance was impacted by a later-than-normal Labor Day, the aforementioned lower levels of trips in in-store merchandising and programming. We also have lower year-over-year advertising GRPs. In the fourth quarter, U.S. advertising GRPs will reach the highest level of the year and seasonal merchandising and programming is in place. Combined with the Reese's NCAA College Game Day promotion and the launch of Hershey's Kiss Deluxe, we expect improvement in chocolate marketplace trends in the fourth quarter. 
Non-chocolate candy, or NCC, category growth in the third quarter was plus 3.3%. In-store activity and merchandising within this segment of the category was greater than what we've seen in many years. Given the 2014 activity that we're lapping, the prior year launch of Lancaster caramels and Jolly Rancher line extensions, Hershey's NCC third quarter market share was off 1 point. We expect our NCC performance to improve in 2016 as we leverage the Allan Candy capabilities and brands. 
We're also making progress within snacks and grocery. Brookside bars are now available with initial demand and velocity on par with the category leaders. And we'll continue to build on Brookside's equity in 2016 with the launch of 3 flavors of Brookside yogurt fruit and nut bars. We also had limited introductory launch of Hershey's, Reese's and PAYDAY Snack Bites and Snack Mix products. These sweet and salty offerings are off to a strong start, and in some cases, we've extended the brand and secured space in addition to the confectionary aisle. The early read is positive in the C-stores where we have distribution and front-end checkouts. 
Switching to meat snacks. As I stated earlier, category growth here also slowed a bit in the third quarter, although it was primarily due to underperformance of the mainstream portion of the category. Looking at premium, our artisan meat snacks where Krave plays, this subsegment of the category increased about 40% in the third quarter and was relatively in line with the growth rates of the 4-, 12- and 52-week periods. The Krave business and integration is progressing well, and retail takeaway is significantly outpacing the category, driven by velocity and distribution gains. Items per store and merchandising is growing, and net sales should nearly double this year. We feel good about our snacking and adjacency initiatives and believe meat snacks, snack bars as well as Snack Bites and Snack Mix products give us an opportunity to source volume and sales across the broader snacking category. 
Now for an update on our international business. Given the macroeconomic environment in our focus markets, broad category and Hershey growth was challenging. Combined third quarter constant currency net sales in Mexico and Brazil increased mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year in a very tough environment. Constant currency net sales in India declined, in line with estimates. And recall, this is expected as we phased out our sales of edible oil products. Importantly, India core brand sales increased high single digits on a percentage basis versus last year. 
The Shanghai Golden Monkey integration is progressing, and we've increased our resources on the ground as we move forward. We're very focused on integrating the business and executing against our selling plan. It's a bit too early to discuss our 2016 initiatives, but we're cautiously optimistic that we'll be able to leverage the core Golden Monkey products in the Chinese New Year period, given that 2016 is the zodiac year of the monkey. 
In the third quarter, China chocolate net sales were relatively in line with our expectations. However, Q3 chocolate category growth of 4% was less than June year-to-date growth of 6%. It appears that the category continues to be impacted by macroeconomic challenges and trends that are affecting consumer shopping behavior and the acceleration of e-commerce and online purchases of broader consumer statements. These factors are leading to lower sales velocities in Tier 1 hypermarkets where the majority of our chocolate sales are derived and impacting the impulse-oriented chocolate category. We expect marketplace trends to slightly improve in Q4 but no longer expect the category to increase high single digits for the full year. 
We're making progress against the initiatives we discussed earlier in the year. Distribution and velocity in the smaller format, super and mini channels is on track, and Brookside ACV is increasing. As we entered the fourth quarter, Brookside advertising is on air, displays are being activated at retail and a digital campaign on WeChat has been established and we continue to build on our e-commerce momentum. We're particularly pleased with our online business, which in August was up 112% and was focused on Chinese Valentine's Day. 
For the year-to-date period, our China chocolate e-commerce retail takeaway is up about 55%. We have specific activity for the upcoming Singles Day and Holiday season and believe we're doing some of the right things here as evidenced by our market share gains in this evolving and important channel. So while challenging, China is a priority market for us, and I believe we're executing against the right fundamentals and are focused on building our business for the long term. 
In Mexico, net sales in local currency for the quarter and year-to-date periods are up high single digits on a percentage basis versus last year, driven by our chocolate and Pelon Pelo Rico business. Within the chocolate category, we're seeing good investments by all major manufacturers in the form of new products and core brand investments. As a result, our chocolate marketplace performance is like the category. Chocolate market share in the modern trade in Mexico for the year-to-date period is off as our retail takeaway of about 6% has lagged category growth of about 13%. 
In Brazil, local currency net sales has sequentially improved versus last quarter and are up low single digits. Although retail takeaway slowed in the third quarter given the challenged macroeconomic environment and increased competitive activity, brazil chocolate market share for the year-to-date period is up 0.4 points. However, given my aforementioned comments, we would expect the macroeconomic environment in Brazil to pressure Q4 performance. 
Now to wrap up. Our #1 goal is to regain momentum in terms of Hershey's marketplace performance as it relates to retail takeaway and market share. Our fourth quarter and 2016 plans are focused, and the investment profile is concentrated in the areas where Hershey is advantaged. Specifically, you'll see core brand investments in the form of innovation and marketing, especially a greater focus on digital and a focus on in-store execution as it relates to merchandising and programming. Without getting into specific details related to 2016, our initial plans are balanced from a top and bottom line perspective. 
Next year, we lapped charges in China related to trade promotion that have pressured results this year. We'll also benefit from the productivity initiatives related to the organization simplification program announced in June and have good visibility, excuse me, into our cost structure as it relates to raw materials. We believe this setup gives us the flexibility to invest in core initiatives that drives growth while also building on our equities within the Snack Mix, snack bar and meat snack categories. At the same time, we're also doing strategic planning work in assessing our long-term targets. 
Acquiring the remaining 20% of Shanghai Golden Monkey impacts this. So when this occurs, we'll be able to share our integration plan and potential cost savings as it relates to our combined businesses in China. 
In the fourth quarter, our seasonal business plans are strong and complement the activity related to core brand merchandising, programming and innovation. From my earlier comments, North America advertising and related consumer marketing expense accelerates, and we expect CMG retail takeaway trends to improve. 
Patricia will provide you with all of the details related to the full year outlook. But excluding unfavorable FX, 2015 total company net sales are expected to increase 1.5% to 2.5%. Solid gross margin expansion, driven by the very profitable U.S. business and other productivity and cost savings more than offsets greater-than-expected dilution from acquisition and divestitures and should result in 2015 full year adjusted earnings per share diluted growth towards the low end of the 3% to 5% range. 
2015 has unfolded the way that we had planned, but we remain focused on strong execution of our plans. Candy, mint and gum has one of the better-performing categories in the store for many years. It's a destination category, impulsive and very profitable for retailers. As a result, it typically garners key floor space within the store as it relates to merchandising and programming. However, over the last 2 years, it appears that income bifurcation and expanded choice among snacking is having an impact on generating consistent CMG category growth. While overall consumer confidence is trending up, lower-income consumers continue to be fragile as income and wage growth has been minimal. Higher income and more confident consumers are driving premium growth while cost-conscious consumers are driving the value segment. As indicated last quarter and in my remarks today, in 2016, we'll introduce candy products and programs that will leverage our ubiquitous distribution specifically targeting our core everyday candy business as well as the mass premium and value segments where we're currently underrepresented. 
I look forward to sharing these plans with you in January. We have strong financial resources and technical capabilities, and I have a passionate team of leaders and coworkers who are committed to winning in the marketplace. 
I'll now turn it over to Patricia who will provide some additional detail on our financial results."

Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Third quarter net sales of $1.96 billion were in line with prior year and generated adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.17, an increase of $0.12 or 11.4% versus last year. Exc",1658,"Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Third quarter net sales of $1.96 billion were in line with prior year and generated adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.17, an increase of $0.12 or 11.4% versus last year. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 2 points, about 0.5 point greater than our estimates, net sales increased to 2%. Pricing in net acquisitions and divestitures were a 5.8 point and 0.5 benefit, partially offset by 4.3 points of lower volume related to pricing elasticity in North America and lower sales in China. 
As J.P. stated, North America gross margin and operating income growth was solid. However, U.S. marketplace consumption trends were less than our estimates, and as a result, sales shipments were softer than expected. Excluding the 1.1 point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Canada, North America net sales increased 3.5% versus the year-ago period. Net price realization was a 6.9  point benefit and volume was off 3.7 points due to elasticity related to the pricing action. The volume impact was in line with estimates when adjusted for the trip declines that J.P. referenced. On a net basis, the Allan Candy and Krave acquisitions and the Mauna Loa divestiture were a 30 basis point benefit. 
Total international and other segment net sales for the third quarter declined 15% versus last year. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates were a 7.9 point headwind; and the Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition, a 2.3 point benefit. The International and Other segment core business volume was off about 10 points due primarily to China chocolate business performance where sales declined $18 million. 
Turning now to margins. Adjusted gross margins increased 220 basis points in the third quarter, driven by net price realization and supply chain productivity and cost-savings initiatives, partially offset by international trade allowances primarily in China. 
Operating profit in the third quarter increased by 9.1% versus last year, resulting in operating profit margins of 21.2%. The increase was driven by gross margin gains and lower SM&A, selling, marketing and administrative expenses. SM&A, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, increased about 2.8%. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, SM&A expenses, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, declined 2.8% as we remain focused on nonessential spending and look to leverage existing resources. By segment, North America operating profit increased low double digits on a percentage basis versus last year and is on plan. This was partially offset by international performance primarily China. 
Now let me provide a brief update on our international business. China chocolate category performance continues to be below the historical CAGR growth rate of 11% to 12%. In Q3, chocolate category performance was sluggish in both hyper and small format stores and impacted all major manufacturers, including those innovations have been driving the market. 
Over the remainder of the year, we're focused on the broader rollout of Brookside chocolates, distribution into smaller format stores and our e-commerce business. We're making progress in areas that will benefit the business over the long term. However, in the short term, chocolate results in China could remain pressured if lower hypermarket trips and category growth continues to track at these lower levels. This scenario could have an impact on our Chinese New Year sell-in assumptions over the remainder of the year. 
Shanghai Golden Monkey integration is slowly continuing, and we're finishing work that will indicate which distributors we'll invest with going forward. Golden Monkey gross sales for the full year are in line with previous estimates. However, we had some true-ups on sales promotions, and the current net sales estimate for Golden Monkey in 2015 is now around $80 million less than our prior expectations. These true-ups, plus an adjustment to the tax rate, which I'll discuss in a few moments, are the primary drivers of the increase in M&A dilution from about $0.20 to $0.35 per share diluted. On a local-currency basis, combined net sales in Mexico and Brazil increased to mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year. Year-to-date, local currency sales in Mexico and Brazil are up about 10% and 5%, respectively. The macroeconomic environment and competitive dynamics in Latin America continue to be a challenge, and we would expect this to be a headwind as it relates to fourth quarter performance. 
India third quarter local currency sales were off about 20% as we began the phaseout of edible oils, which were discontinued at the end of the third quarter. Excluding the edible oil business, India core business sales increased 7%. The brands that were investing behind Jolly Rancher and SOFIT continue to do well in the marketplace. 
Moving down the P&L. Third quarter interest expense of $18.6 million declined $2.5 million versus last year or 11.9%. For the full year, we expect interest expense to be at the low end of the $75 million to $80 million range. The adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 33.5%. This is greater than our previous estimate of about 30% due to the timing of the U.S. government investment tax credits we discussed last quarter and an adjustment to tax rate related to Golden Monkey net operating loss carryforward. 
As a result, we expect the fourth quarter and full year tax rates to be about 31% and 33.5%, respectively. In the fourth quarter, we expect to record $35 million within the other income and expense line related to the U.S. government investment tax credits. Hence, the net effect on full year net income of the tax credits is about $5 million. For the third quarter of 2015, weighted-average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 220 million shares, down $3.8 million versus last year and a $0.02 benefit in the quarter resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.17 or an increase of 11.4% versus year ago. 
Let me now provide a quick recap of year-to-date adjusted results. Year-to-date net sales increased 1.2%. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 2.7% versus the year-ago period. Operating profit increased about 2%, resulting in an operating profit margin of 20%. Year-to-date adjusted gross margin was 46.4% versus 45.2% last year or 120 basis points higher as a result of net price realization and supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher input costs and obsolescence. Year-to-date adjusted earnings per share diluted increased about 3.1% to $3.04 per share. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the third quarter, net trading capital decreased versus last year's third quarter by $39 million. Accounts receivable was lower by $26 million and remains extremely current. Inventory was lower by $87 million, and accounts payable declined by $74 million. Total capital additions, including software, were $86 million in the third quarter and $238 million year-to-date. For the year, we expect total capital expenditures to be around $350 million. This is less than our previous forecast of $375 million to $400 million due to lower capital requirements related to the Johor, Malaysia project, which is now estimated to be about $80 million in 2015. 
During the third quarter, depreciation and amortization was $64 million, and dividends paid were $124 million. In the third quarter, the company repurchased $230 million of outstanding shares against the $250 million authorization approved in February 2015. For the year-to-date period, the company repurchased $403 million of outstanding shares. In addition, the company repurchased $22 million of common shares in the quarter and $165 million year-to-date to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock option. 
Cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $344 million. This is lower than year ago, primarily due to acquisitions and the share buyback. The company continues to generate substantial free cash flow that has a very strong balance sheet. 
In the fourth quarter, North America in-store seasonal merchandising and programming is secured, and on-air advertises-- advertising reaches its highest point of the year. But as J.P. mentioned, lower consumer trips and the macroeconomic environment continue to be a challenge within the retail environment as we wind down the year and look to 2016. We're confident in our ability to execute at the retail level and provide consumers with CMG and snack products that can drive growth. 
As a result, we do expect North America marketplace performance to improve over the remainder of the year. Given year-to-date results, the aforementioned challenges in international markets and slightly higher-than-expected FX headwinds, we estimate that full year net sales will be about the same as to slightly up versus 2014. 
Including a net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures of about 1 point and excluding an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of at least 1.5  points, net sales are expected to increase 1.5% to 2%. This is the less than the low end of the previously provided outlook of 3%. We continue to expect solid gross margin growth in 2015 driven by North America price realization. However, given year-to-date results and the impact of higher levels of international trade promotion, the company expects margin expansion at the low end of 135 to 145 basis point estimate. We're also focused on nonessential SM&A expenses and will leverage existing resources, and given performance, will also benefit from lower-than-estimated other employee-related costs. 
In addition, expected 2015 savings from the business productivity initiative announced in June is estimated to be around $25 million versus the previous estimate of $10 million to $15 million. As a result, we expect adjusted earnings per share diluted to be at the low end of the 3% to 5% range or approximately $4.10 per share diluted. This includes dilution from acquisitions and divestitures of about $0.35 per share, which is greater than the previous estimate of about $0.20 per share diluted.

You're guiding to better performance ahead, but why should we, on the outside, have a particularly high amount of confidence in that outlook? Because I know you said you're seeing better trends in October, but it feels like every quarter something unexpected starts to bite this category. So why should we have really a high level of confidence that 4Q will come in sort of as you're expecting? Is there anything particular that you're looking at that gives you that sort of upward trend than your outlook maybe?"

So I think that as we continue to get greater clarity around, at least, our thinking, we think the consumer bifurcation has been an important driver. We're also seeing that there's expanded choice across the broader snacking continuum. As an example, snack bars, there's about 30% more SKUs in the category then there has been over the last couple of years, so we think we've had some trial there on some of those brands that has impacted some of our CMG brands. 
And then, of course, we've had the trips issue where we've seen a continuing decline in trips across the category and on everyday and into consumable basis. That had a trending impact against our business as well. So I would think -- I think those are some things that we had to solve for. I feel good about the contribution we've had from innovation into our business over that period of time, so it's continued to contribute as we have hoped it would. And then I think as we move into 2016, we have to have a balanced approach, continue to execute against the fundamentals. I think the pricing is actually coming through about as we would have anticipated. And so really, it's about the magic elixir of volume and how do we continue to drive and bring consumers into the category. And I think those are all things that, as I look at 2016, will be in our favor. I would expect the international, we've got very -- the biggest impact we have against the business is, of course, FX. I don't know that we'll be in that environment for forever. And then, we really hope to get ourselves in a good place in China that we can begin to benefit for the reasons that we had the acquisition there. So I agree with you. It's been unusual in 2015. It's the macroeconomic winds, but I think the fundamentals in the category for retailers continue to be attractive as a category, and we have to execute well."

How is your level of confidence in the everyday business looking versus that seasonal business that's been so steady for the company over the past couple of years?"

We continue to execute well against season, so we expect in the important Halloween period that we're going to win share there. So I feel, as you say, we've done well there. I feel good about that. And the everyday business is really impacted by trips, so we really are going to have to see an environment where across retailers that trips begin to help us a bit where I think it's been a drag on the business overall here over the last 12 to 18 months."

So as you probably heard us talk before, we are heavily weighted to the hypermarket channel in China versus having deeper distribution. So even as we've grown our distribution, it's largely been in the Tier 1 cities, and it's also been more weighted to hypermarkets. And the hypermarket channel has been more negatively impacted over the last 12 months than have other channels. Although the total category across channels is down, but we're not as well-represented, and some of those channels have actually done better than the hypermarket channel. So we have a weighting mix issue that's really impacted our business there, which is one of the things that interested us so much in Shanghai Golden Monkey is it gives us better and deeper distribution across smaller stores, supermarkets and then also Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities where appropriate. So we think those factors are still relevant and that we'll benefit from that. Obviously, we've had some struggles in terms of the start-up of Shanghai Golden Monkey, but the real drivers of why we made the acquisition still exist. The distribution channel is there. The manufacturing is there, the brands, et cetera. So we think as we go forward and gaining control of that business, we'll definitely benefit from the greater penetration across all the channels. That's how I would think about what's happening there. And then you have a faster evolution there probably than any place else in terms of e-commerce. So in our category, about 15% of the business is sold in e-commerce. We're right about where the category is. That piece of our business is growing very nicely, so we're participating in that channel development quite nicely. So those are several things that I would mention about China."

We also think there were some manufacturers that probably benefited from the spot price of sugar. And based on where things are manufactured, that could have given them an opportunity to invest in the category more so in the past. So the beauty of the Hershey brand is, is it's one of the most accessible brand that there is -- chocolate in our country. From all manufacturers, it's the best value per pound at any place in the world. So I think frequency is something we have to make sure that we're driving.

So that's a starting point. If you look over the last decade or even longer, growth has always been a combination, almost equally split between price and volume. And as we go through this current period, it continues to track around that model.

So I don't think the historical norms have changed obviously in chocolate where we're a 45 share in the category. We have a lot of responsibility in terms of category growth, so we have to innovate and grow and compete for consumer occasions, which are growing all the time across day parts, and so we have to participate in that. But I don't think there's anything around the category itself that would cause us to think that price, et cetera, is different. Now if we move, to your point, if we move to a period of time where commodities are less of a driver around the price piece, as we've said historically, we're a gross margin-focused company, and we would have to make sure that we continue to do that to maintain the attractive gross margins that we have today.

Bilbrey, Chairman, President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with an overview of results, which will then be followed by a Q&A session. 
Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2014 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes that presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. 
As a result, we will discuss third quarter results, excluding net free tax charges of $140 million or $0.47 per share diluted, primarily related to the productivity initiative announced in June, a noncash impairment charge in China and costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges. 
With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey."

In the third quarter, our efforts were focused on ensuring successful execution of our seasonal plans, which are on track and should result in good Halloween and Holiday seasons. We were pleased with North America gross margin expansion that resulted in solid operating profit growth, however, organic net sales growth was less than expected. North America organic net sales increased 3.2%, ahead of CMG marketplace performance, primarily due to the timing of seasonal shipments and snack sales that don't get captured in the Nielsen CMG database. Hershey U.S. candy, mint and gum, or CMG, retail takeaway in the third quarter was about plus 0.3%, less than category growth, resulting in market share loss of 0.4 points. 
Lower-than-expected levels of merchandising and programming at select retailers led to consumption trends that were below our estimates. Mainstream snacking categories like salty, snack cakes and meat snacks also saw consumption slow in the third quarter versus the June year-to-date trends. Additionally, consumer retail trips in the third quarter were lower, down almost 4%. 
By channel, trips performance was mixed. On a percentage basis versus last year trips, they declined high single digits in drug and convenience stores, low single digits in grocery and were up mid-single digits in club. Trends appear to have improved as we exited September. And in October, CMG in-store merchandising and programming has been executed and should result in Hershey share gains in the important Halloween season. 
Third quarter CMG category performance by segment was mixed. Ice Breakers Cool Blasts is doing very well. The Ice Breaker brand continues to drive both gum and mint category growth, and this period was no exception. Specifically, our third quarter gum and mint retail takeaway was about plus 9% and plus 16%, leading to solid market share gains in these segments. Chocolate category performance was soft in the third quarter, up 0.4%. Hershey chocolate retail takeaway was off minus 0.5%, resulting in a market share decline of 0.4 points. 
We believe our performance was impacted by a later-than-normal Labor Day, the aforementioned lower levels of trips in in-store merchandising and programming. We also have lower year-over-year advertising GRPs. In the fourth quarter, U.S. advertising GRPs will reach the highest level of the year and seasonal merchandising and programming is in place. Combined with the Reese's NCAA College Game Day promotion and the launch of Hershey's Kiss Deluxe, we expect improvement in chocolate marketplace trends in the fourth quarter. 
Non-chocolate candy, or NCC, category growth in the third quarter was plus 3.3%. In-store activity and merchandising within this segment of the category was greater than what we've seen in many years. Given the 2014 activity that we're lapping, the prior year launch of Lancaster caramels and Jolly Rancher line extensions, Hershey's NCC third quarter market share was off 1 point. We expect our NCC performance to improve in 2016 as we leverage the Allan Candy capabilities and brands. 
We're also making progress within snacks and grocery. Brookside bars are now available with initial demand and velocity on par with the category leaders. And we'll continue to build on Brookside's equity in 2016 with the launch of 3 flavors of Brookside yogurt fruit and nut bars. We also had limited introductory launch of Hershey's, Reese's and PAYDAY Snack Bites and Snack Mix products. These sweet and salty offerings are off to a strong start, and in some cases, we've extended the brand and secured space in addition to the confectionary aisle. The early read is positive in the C-stores where we have distribution and front-end checkouts. 
Switching to meat snacks. As I stated earlier, category growth here also slowed a bit in the third quarter, although it was primarily due to underperformance of the mainstream portion of the category. Looking at premium, our artisan meat snacks where Krave plays, this subsegment of the category increased about 40% in the third quarter and was relatively in line with the growth rates of the 4-, 12- and 52-week periods. The Krave business and integration is progressing well, and retail takeaway is significantly outpacing the category, driven by velocity and distribution gains. Items per store and merchandising is growing, and net sales should nearly double this year. We feel good about our snacking and adjacency initiatives and believe meat snacks, snack bars as well as Snack Bites and Snack Mix products give us an opportunity to source volume and sales across the broader snacking category. 
Now for an update on our international business. Given the macroeconomic environment in our focus markets, broad category and Hershey growth was challenging. Combined third quarter constant currency net sales in Mexico and Brazil increased mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year in a very tough environment. Constant currency net sales in India declined, in line with estimates. And recall, this is expected as we phased out our sales of edible oil products. Importantly, India core brand sales increased high single digits on a percentage basis versus last year. 
The Shanghai Golden Monkey integration is progressing, and we've increased our resources on the ground as we move forward. We're very focused on integrating the business and executing against our selling plan. It's a bit too early to discuss our 2016 initiatives, but we're cautiously optimistic that we'll be able to leverage the core Golden Monkey products in the Chinese New Year period, given that 2016 is the zodiac year of the monkey. 
In the third quarter, China chocolate net sales were relatively in line with our expectations. However, Q3 chocolate category growth of 4% was less than June year-to-date growth of 6%. It appears that the category continues to be impacted by macroeconomic challenges and trends that are affecting consumer shopping behavior and the acceleration of e-commerce and online purchases of broader consumer statements. These factors are leading to lower sales velocities in Tier 1 hypermarkets where the majority of our chocolate sales are derived and impacting the impulse-oriented chocolate category. We expect marketplace trends to slightly improve in Q4 but no longer expect the category to increase high single digits for the full year. 
We're making progress against the initiatives we discussed earlier in the year. Distribution and velocity in the smaller format, super and mini channels is on track, and Brookside ACV is increasing. As we entered the fourth quarter, Brookside advertising is on air, displays are being activated at retail and a digital campaign on WeChat has been established and we continue to build on our e-commerce momentum. We're particularly pleased with our online business, which in August was up 112% and was focused on Chinese Valentine's Day. 
For the year-to-date period, our China chocolate e-commerce retail takeaway is up about 55%. We have specific activity for the upcoming Singles Day and Holiday season and believe we're doing some of the right things here as evidenced by our market share gains in this evolving and important channel. So while challenging, China is a priority market for us, and I believe we're executing against the right fundamentals and are focused on building our business for the long term. 
In Mexico, net sales in local currency for the quarter and year-to-date periods are up high single digits on a percentage basis versus last year, driven by our chocolate and Pelon Pelo Rico business. Within the chocolate category, we're seeing good investments by all major manufacturers in the form of new products and core brand investments. As a result, our chocolate marketplace performance is like the category. Chocolate market share in the modern trade in Mexico for the year-to-date period is off as our retail takeaway of about 6% has lagged category growth of about 13%. 
In Brazil, local currency net sales has sequentially improved versus last quarter and are up low single digits. Although retail takeaway slowed in the third quarter given the challenged macroeconomic environment and increased competitive activity, brazil chocolate market share for the year-to-date period is up 0.4 points. However, given my aforementioned comments, we would expect the macroeconomic environment in Brazil to pressure Q4 performance. 
Now to wrap up. Our #1 goal is to regain momentum in terms of Hershey's marketplace performance as it relates to retail takeaway and market share. Our fourth quarter and 2016 plans are focused, and the investment profile is concentrated in the areas where Hershey is advantaged. Specifically, you'll see core brand investments in the form of innovation and marketing, especially a greater focus on digital and a focus on in-store execution as it relates to merchandising and programming. Without getting into specific details related to 2016, our initial plans are balanced from a top and bottom line perspective. 
Next year, we lapped charges in China related to trade promotion that have pressured results this year. We'll also benefit from the productivity initiatives related to the organization simplification program announced in June and have good visibility, excuse me, into our cost structure as it relates to raw materials. We believe this setup gives us the flexibility to invest in core initiatives that drives growth while also building on our equities within the Snack Mix, snack bar and meat snack categories. At the same time, we're also doing strategic planning work in assessing our long-term targets. 
Acquiring the remaining 20% of Shanghai Golden Monkey impacts this. So when this occurs, we'll be able to share our integration plan and potential cost savings as it relates to our combined businesses in China. 
In the fourth quarter, our seasonal business plans are strong and complement the activity related to core brand merchandising, programming and innovation. From my earlier comments, North America advertising and related consumer marketing expense accelerates, and we expect CMG retail takeaway trends to improve. 
Patricia will provide you with all of the details related to the full year outlook. But excluding unfavorable FX, 2015 total company net sales are expected to increase 1.5% to 2.5%. Solid gross margin expansion, driven by the very profitable U.S. business and other productivity and cost savings more than offsets greater-than-expected dilution from acquisition and divestitures and should result in 2015 full year adjusted earnings per share diluted growth towards the low end of the 3% to 5% range. 
2015 has unfolded the way that we had planned, but we remain focused on strong execution of our plans. Candy, mint and gum has one of the better-performing categories in the store for many years. It's a destination category, impulsive and very profitable for retailers. As a result, it typically garners key floor space within the store as it relates to merchandising and programming. However, over the last 2 years, it appears that income bifurcation and expanded choice among snacking is having an impact on generating consistent CMG category growth. While overall consumer confidence is trending up, lower-income consumers continue to be fragile as income and wage growth has been minimal. Higher income and more confident consumers are driving premium growth while cost-conscious consumers are driving the value segment. As indicated last quarter and in my remarks today, in 2016, we'll introduce candy products and programs that will leverage our ubiquitous distribution specifically targeting our core everyday candy business as well as the mass premium and value segments where we're currently underrepresented. 
I look forward to sharing these plans with you in January. We have strong financial resources and technical capabilities, and I have a passionate team of leaders and coworkers who are committed to winning in the marketplace. 
I'll now turn it over to Patricia who will provide some additional detail on our financial results."

Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast.

Exc",1658,"Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Third quarter net sales of $1.96 billion were in line with prior year and generated adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.17, an increase of $0.12 or 11.4% versus last year. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 2 points, about 0.5 point greater than our estimates, net sales increased to 2%. Pricing in net acquisitions and divestitures were a 5.8 point and 0.5 benefit, partially offset by 4.3 points of lower volume related to pricing elasticity in North America and lower sales in China. 
As J.P. stated, North America gross margin and operating income growth was solid. However, U.S. marketplace consumption trends were less than our estimates, and as a result, sales shipments were softer than expected. Excluding the 1.1 point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Canada, North America net sales increased 3.5% versus the year-ago period. Net price realization was a 6.9  point benefit and volume was off 3.7 points due to elasticity related to the pricing action. The volume impact was in line with estimates when adjusted for the trip declines that J.P. referenced. On a net basis, the Allan Candy and Krave acquisitions and the Mauna Loa divestiture were a 30 basis point benefit. 
Total international and other segment net sales for the third quarter declined 15% versus last year. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates were a 7.9 point headwind; and the Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition, a 2.3 point benefit. The International and Other segment core business volume was off about 10 points due primarily to China chocolate business performance where sales declined $18 million. 
Turning now to margins. Adjusted gross margins increased 220 basis points in the third quarter, driven by net price realization and supply chain productivity and cost-savings initiatives, partially offset by international trade allowances primarily in China. 
Operating profit in the third quarter increased by 9.1% versus last year, resulting in operating profit margins of 21.2%. The increase was driven by gross margin gains and lower SM&A, selling, marketing and administrative expenses. SM&A, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, increased about 2.8%. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, SM&A expenses, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, declined 2.8% as we remain focused on nonessential spending and look to leverage existing resources. By segment, North America operating profit increased low double digits on a percentage basis versus last year and is on plan. This was partially offset by international performance primarily China. 
Now let me provide a brief update on our international business. China chocolate category performance continues to be below the historical CAGR growth rate of 11% to 12%. In Q3, chocolate category performance was sluggish in both hyper and small format stores and impacted all major manufacturers, including those innovations have been driving the market. 
Over the remainder of the year, we're focused on the broader rollout of Brookside chocolates, distribution into smaller format stores and our e-commerce business. We're making progress in areas that will benefit the business over the long term. However, in the short term, chocolate results in China could remain pressured if lower hypermarket trips and category growth continues to track at these lower levels. This scenario could have an impact on our Chinese New Year sell-in assumptions over the remainder of the year. 
Shanghai Golden Monkey integration is slowly continuing, and we're finishing work that will indicate which distributors we'll invest with going forward. Golden Monkey gross sales for the full year are in line with previous estimates. However, we had some true-ups on sales promotions, and the current net sales estimate for Golden Monkey in 2015 is now around $80 million less than our prior expectations. These true-ups, plus an adjustment to the tax rate, which I'll discuss in a few moments, are the primary drivers of the increase in M&A dilution from about $0.20 to $0.35 per share diluted. On a local-currency basis, combined net sales in Mexico and Brazil increased to mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year. Year-to-date, local currency sales in Mexico and Brazil are up about 10% and 5%, respectively. The macroeconomic environment and competitive dynamics in Latin America continue to be a challenge, and we would expect this to be a headwind as it relates to fourth quarter performance. 
India third quarter local currency sales were off about 20% as we began the phaseout of edible oils, which were discontinued at the end of the third quarter. Excluding the edible oil business, India core business sales increased 7%. The brands that were investing behind Jolly Rancher and SOFIT continue to do well in the marketplace. 
Moving down the P&L. Third quarter interest expense of $18.6 million declined $2.5 million versus last year or 11.9%. For the full year, we expect interest expense to be at the low end of the $75 million to $80 million range. The adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 33.5%. This is greater than our previous estimate of about 30% due to the timing of the U.S. government investment tax credits we discussed last quarter and an adjustment to tax rate related to Golden Monkey net operating loss carryforward. 
As a result, we expect the fourth quarter and full year tax rates to be about 31% and 33.5%, respectively. In the fourth quarter, we expect to record $35 million within the other income and expense line related to the U.S. government investment tax credits. Hence, the net effect on full year net income of the tax credits is about $5 million. For the third quarter of 2015, weighted-average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 220 million shares, down $3.8 million versus last year and a $0.02 benefit in the quarter resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.17 or an increase of 11.4% versus year ago. 
Let me now provide a quick recap of year-to-date adjusted results. Year-to-date net sales increased 1.2%. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 2.7% versus the year-ago period. Operating profit increased about 2%, resulting in an operating profit margin of 20%. Year-to-date adjusted gross margin was 46.4% versus 45.2% last year or 120 basis points higher as a result of net price realization and supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher input costs and obsolescence. Year-to-date adjusted earnings per share diluted increased about 3.1% to $3.04 per share. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the third quarter, net trading capital decreased versus last year's third quarter by $39 million. Accounts receivable was lower by $26 million and remains extremely current. Inventory was lower by $87 million, and accounts payable declined by $74 million. Total capital additions, including software, were $86 million in the third quarter and $238 million year-to-date. For the year, we expect total capital expenditures to be around $350 million. This is less than our previous forecast of $375 million to $400 million due to lower capital requirements related to the Johor, Malaysia project, which is now estimated to be about $80 million in 2015. 
During the third quarter, depreciation and amortization was $64 million, and dividends paid were $124 million. In the third quarter, the company repurchased $230 million of outstanding shares against the $250 million authorization approved in February 2015. For the year-to-date period, the company repurchased $403 million of outstanding shares. In addition, the company repurchased $22 million of common shares in the quarter and $165 million year-to-date to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock option. 
Cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $344 million. This is lower than year ago, primarily due to acquisitions and the share buyback. The company continues to generate substantial free cash flow that has a very strong balance sheet. 
In the fourth quarter, North America in-store seasonal merchandising and programming is secured, and on-air advertises-- advertising reaches its highest point of the year. But as J.P. mentioned, lower consumer trips and the macroeconomic environment continue to be a challenge within the retail environment as we wind down the year and look to 2016. We're confident in our ability to execute at the retail level and provide consumers with CMG and snack products that can drive growth. 
As a result, we do expect North America marketplace performance to improve over the remainder of the year. Given year-to-date results, the aforementioned challenges in international markets and slightly higher-than-expected FX headwinds, we estimate that full year net sales will be about the same as to slightly up versus 2014. 
Including a net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures of about 1 point and excluding an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of at least 1.5  points, net sales are expected to increase 1.5% to 2%. This is the less than the low end of the previously provided outlook of 3%. We continue to expect solid gross margin growth in 2015 driven by North America price realization. However, given year-to-date results and the impact of higher levels of international trade promotion, the company expects margin expansion at the low end of 135 to 145 basis point estimate. We're also focused on nonessential SM&A expenses and will leverage existing resources, and given performance, will also benefit from lower-than-estimated other employee-related costs. 
In addition, expected 2015 savings from the business productivity initiative announced in June is estimated to be around $25 million versus the previous estimate of $10 million to $15 million. As a result, we expect adjusted earnings per share diluted to be at the low end of the 3% to 5% range or approximately $4.10 per share diluted. This includes dilution from acquisitions and divestitures of about $0.35 per share, which is greater than the previous estimate of about $0.20 per share diluted.

Because I know you said you're seeing better trends in October, but it feels like every quarter something unexpected starts to bite this category. So why should we have really a high level of confidence that 4Q will come in sort of as you're expecting?

So I think that as we continue to get greater clarity around, at least, our thinking, we think the consumer bifurcation has been an important driver. We're also seeing that there's expanded choice across the broader snacking continuum. As an example, snack bars, there's about 30% more SKUs in the category then there has been over the last couple of years, so we think we've had some trial there on some of those brands that has impacted some of our CMG brands. 
And then, of course, we've had the trips issue where we've seen a continuing decline in trips across the category and on everyday and into consumable basis. That had a trending impact against our business as well. So I would think -- I think those are some things that we had to solve for. I feel good about the contribution we've had from innovation into our business over that period of time, so it's continued to contribute as we have hoped it would. And then I think as we move into 2016, we have to have a balanced approach, continue to execute against the fundamentals. I think the pricing is actually coming through about as we would have anticipated. And so really, it's about the magic elixir of volume and how do we continue to drive and bring consumers into the category. And I think those are all things that, as I look at 2016, will be in our favor. I would expect the international, we've got very -- the biggest impact we have against the business is, of course, FX. I don't know that we'll be in that environment for forever. And then, we really hope to get ourselves in a good place in China that we can begin to benefit for the reasons that we had the acquisition there. So I agree with you. It's been unusual in 2015. It's the macroeconomic winds, but I think the fundamentals in the category for retailers continue to be attractive as a category, and we have to execute well."

So I can't tell you that on a single Monday morning, the world changes, but I think the dynamics as a category continue to be attractive. Consumers are snacking more than they ever have before.

So as you probably heard us talk before, we are heavily weighted to the hypermarket channel in China versus having deeper distribution. So even as we've grown our distribution, it's largely been in the Tier 1 cities, and it's also been more weighted to hypermarkets. And the hypermarket channel has been more negatively impacted over the last 12 months than have other channels. Although the total category across channels is down, but we're not as well-represented, and some of those channels have actually done better than the hypermarket channel. So we have a weighting mix issue that's really impacted our business there, which is one of the things that interested us so much in Shanghai Golden Monkey is it gives us better and deeper distribution across smaller stores, supermarkets and then also Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities where appropriate. So we think those factors are still relevant and that we'll benefit from that. Obviously, we've had some struggles in terms of the start-up of Shanghai Golden Monkey, but the real drivers of why we made the acquisition still exist. The distribution channel is there. The manufacturing is there, the brands, et cetera. So we think as we go forward and gaining control of that business, we'll definitely benefit from the greater penetration across all the channels. That's how I would think about what's happening there. And then you have a faster evolution there probably than any place else in terms of e-commerce. So in our category, about 15% of the business is sold in e-commerce. We're right about where the category is. That piece of our business is growing very nicely, so we're participating in that channel development quite nicely. So those are several things that I would mention about China."

Sometimes, we'll be above, below, whatever. But given all of the moving parts that we've seen, historically, we've given our guidance on this third quarter call. There's a lot of moving parts. I wouldn't put, if by any means, all of that weighted into what's happening in China. I think it's really -- we want to make sure that we have a good sense of what 2016 and beyond looks like from a category standpoint, and we'll go from there and we'll probably talk about that in January."

Well, it's a relatively small piece, less than 10% of the total category consumption. We recognize that we have to do a better job there. In the value segment, a lot of what happened this year was really around sugar confectionery and sweets. And we think the Allan Candy acquisition will enable us to do well there. We also think there were some manufacturers that probably benefited from the spot price of sugar. And based on where things are manufactured, that could have given them an opportunity to invest in the category more so in the past. So the beauty of the Hershey brand is, is it's one of the most accessible brand that there is -- chocolate in our country. From all manufacturers, it's the best value per pound at any place in the world. So I think frequency is something we have to make sure that we're driving. I think the portfolio is largely attractive in chocolate, but we need to work on the high end. And in the low end, we need to work on the sweet side, and that can be channel-specific as well as across many other retailers. So that's how I'd like you to think about it."

So I don't think the historical norms have changed obviously in chocolate where we're a 45 share in the category. We have a lot of responsibility in terms of category growth, so we have to innovate and grow and compete for consumer occasions, which are growing all the time across day parts, and so we have to participate in that. But I don't think there's anything around the category itself that would cause us to think that price, et cetera, is different. Now if we move, to your point, if we move to a period of time where commodities are less of a driver around the price piece, as we've said historically, we're a gross margin-focused company, and we would have to make sure that we continue to do that to maintain the attractive gross margins that we have today.

Welcome to the Hershey Company's Third Quarter 2015 Conference Call. J.P. Bilbrey, Chairman, President and CEO; and Patricia Little, Senior Vice President and CFO, will provide you with an overview of our results, which will then be followed by a Q&A session. 
Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2014 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the Notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP. The company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the company believes that presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. 
As a result, we will discuss third quarter results, excluding net free tax charges of $140 million or $0.47 per share diluted, primarily related to the productivity initiative announced in June, a noncash impairment charge in China and costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges. 
With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to J.P. Bilbrey."
98873,313270368,884130,"The Hershey Company, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2015",2015-10-28,"Earnings Calls","The Hershey Company","Executives","Thanks, Mark. In the third quarter, our efforts were focused on ensuring successful execution of our seasonal plans, which are on track and should result in good Halloween and Holiday seasons. We were pleased with North America gross margin expansion that",1922,"Thanks, Mark. In the third quarter, our efforts were focused on ensuring successful execution of our seasonal plans, which are on track and should result in good Halloween and Holiday seasons. We were pleased with North America gross margin expansion that resulted in solid operating profit growth, however, organic net sales growth was less than expected. North America organic net sales increased 3.2%, ahead of CMG marketplace performance, primarily due to the timing of seasonal shipments and snack sales that don't get captured in the Nielsen CMG database. Hershey U.S. candy, mint and gum, or CMG, retail takeaway in the third quarter was about plus 0.3%, less than category growth, resulting in market share loss of 0.4 points. 
Lower-than-expected levels of merchandising and programming at select retailers led to consumption trends that were below our estimates. Mainstream snacking categories like salty, snack cakes and meat snacks also saw consumption slow in the third quarter versus the June year-to-date trends. Additionally, consumer retail trips in the third quarter were lower, down almost 4%. 
By channel, trips performance was mixed. On a percentage basis versus last year trips, they declined high single digits in drug and convenience stores, low single digits in grocery and were up mid-single digits in club. Trends appear to have improved as we exited September. And in October, CMG in-store merchandising and programming has been executed and should result in Hershey share gains in the important Halloween season. 
Third quarter CMG category performance by segment was mixed. Ice Breakers Cool Blasts is doing very well. The Ice Breaker brand continues to drive both gum and mint category growth, and this period was no exception. Specifically, our third quarter gum and mint retail takeaway was about plus 9% and plus 16%, leading to solid market share gains in these segments. Chocolate category performance was soft in the third quarter, up 0.4%. Hershey chocolate retail takeaway was off minus 0.5%, resulting in a market share decline of 0.4 points. 
We believe our performance was impacted by a later-than-normal Labor Day, the aforementioned lower levels of trips in in-store merchandising and programming. We also had lower year-over-year advertising GRPs. In the fourth quarter, U.S. advertising GRPs will reach the highest level of the year and seasonal merchandising and programming is in place. Combined with the Reese's NCAA College Game Day promotion and the launch of Hershey's Kiss Deluxe, we expect improvement in chocolate marketplace trends in the fourth quarter. 
Non-chocolate candy, or NCC, category growth in the third quarter was plus 3.3%. In-store activity and merchandising within this segment of the category was greater than what we've seen in many years. Given the 2014 activity that we're lapping, the prior year launch of Lancaster caramels and Jolly Rancher line extensions, Hershey's NCC third quarter market share was off 1 point. We expect our NCC performance to improve in 2016 as we leverage the Allan Candy capabilities and brands. 
We're also making progress within snacks and grocery. Brookside bars are now available with initial demand and velocity on par with the category leaders. And we'll continue to build on Brookside's equity in 2016 with the launch of 3 flavors of Brookside yogurt fruit and nut bars. We also had a limited introductory launch of Hershey's, Reese's and PAYDAY Snack Bites and Snack Mix products. These sweet and salty offerings are off to a strong start, and in some cases, we've extended the brand and secured space in addition to the confectionary aisle. The early read is positive in the C-stores where we have distribution and front-end checkouts. 
Switching to meat snacks. As I stated earlier, category growth here also slowed a bit in the third quarter, although it was primarily due to underperformance of the mainstream portion of the category. Looking at premium, our artisan meat snacks where Krave plays, this subsegment of the category increased about 40% in the third quarter and was relatively in line with the growth rates of the 4-, 12- and 52-week periods. The Krave business and integration is progressing well, and retail takeaway is significantly outpacing the category, driven by velocity and distribution gains. Items per store and merchandising is growing, and net sales should nearly double this year. We feel good about our snacking and adjacency initiatives and believe meat snacks, snack bars as well as Snack Bites and Snack Mix products give us an opportunity to source volume and sales across the broader snacking category. 
Now for an update on our International business. Given the macroeconomic environment in our focus markets, broad category and Hershey growth was challenging. Combined third quarter constant currency net sales in Mexico and Brazil increased mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year in a very tough environment. Constant currency net sales in India declined, in line with estimates. And recall, this was expected as we phased out our sales of edible oil products. Importantly, India core brand sales increased high single digits on a percentage basis versus last year. 
The Shanghai Golden Monkey integration is progressing, and we've increased our resources on the ground as we move forward. We're very focused on integrating the business and executing against our selling plan. It's a bit too early to discuss our 2016 initiatives, but we're cautiously optimistic that we'll be able to leverage the core Golden Monkey products in the Chinese New Year period, given that 2016 is the zodiac year of the monkey. 
In the third quarter, China chocolate net sales were relatively in line with our expectations. However, Q3 chocolate category growth of 4% was less than June year-to-date growth of 6%. It appears that the category continues to be impacted by macroeconomic challenges and trends that are affecting consumer shopping behavior and the acceleration of e-commerce and online purchases of broader consumer staples. These factors are leading to lower sales velocities in Tier 1 hypermarkets where the majority of our chocolate sales are derived and impacting the impulse-oriented chocolate category. We expect marketplace trends to slightly improve in Q4 but no longer expect the category to increase high single digits for the full year. 
We're making progress against the initiatives we discussed earlier in the year. Distribution and velocity in the smaller format, super and mini channels is on track, and Brookside ACV is increasing. As we entered the fourth quarter, Brookside advertising is on air, displays are being activated at retail and a digital campaign on WeChat has been established, and we continue to build on our e-commerce momentum. We're particularly pleased with our online business, which in August was up 112% and was focused on Chinese Valentine's Day. 
For the year-to-date period, our China chocolate e-commerce retail takeaway is up about 55%. We have specific activity for the upcoming Singles Day and Holiday season and believe we're doing some of the right things here as evidenced by our market share gains in this evolving and important channel. So while challenging, China is a priority market for us, and I believe we're executing against the right fundamentals and are focused on building our business for the long term. 
In Mexico, net sales in local currency for the quarter and year-to-date periods are up high single digits on a percentage basis versus last year, driven by our chocolate and Pelon Pelo Rico business. Within the chocolate category, we're seeing good investments by all major manufacturers in the form of new products and core brand investments. As a result, our chocolate marketplace performance has lagged the category. Chocolate market share in the modern trade in Mexico for the year-to-date period is off as our retail takeaway of about 6% has lagged category growth of about 13%. 
In Brazil, local currency net sales has sequentially improved versus last quarter and are up low single digits. Although retail takeaway slowed in the third quarter given the challenged macroeconomic environment and increased competitive activity. Brazil chocolate market share for the year-to-date period is up 0.4 points. However, given my aforementioned comments, we would expect the macroeconomic environment in Brazil to pressure Q4 performance. 
Now to wrap up. Our #1 goal is to regain momentum in terms of Hershey's marketplace performance as it relates to retail takeaway and market share. Our fourth quarter and 2016 plans are focused, and the investment profile is concentrated in the areas where Hershey is advantaged. Specifically, you'll see core brand investments in the form of innovation and marketing, especially a greater focus on digital and a focus on in-store execution as it relates to merchandising and programming. Without getting into specific details related to 2016, our initial plans are balanced from a top and bottom line perspective. 
Next year, we lap charges in China related to trade promotion that have pressured results this year. We'll also benefit from the productivity initiatives related to the organization simplification program announced in June and have good visibility into our cost structure as it relates to raw materials. We believe this setup gives us the flexibility to invest in core initiatives that drives growth while also building on our equities within the Snack Mix, snack bar and meat snack categories. At the same time, we're also doing strategic planning work in assessing our long-term targets. 
Acquiring the remaining 20% of Shanghai Golden Monkey impacts this. So when this occurs, we'll be able to share our integration plans and potential cost savings as it relates to our combined businesses in China. 
In the fourth quarter, our seasonal business plans are strong and complement the activity related to core brand merchandising, programming and innovation. From my earlier comments, North America advertising and related consumer marketing expense accelerates, and we expect CMG retail takeaway trends to improve. 
Patricia will provide you with all of the details related to the full year outlook. But excluding unfavorable FX, 2015 total company net sales are expected to increase 1.5% to 2.5%. Solid gross margin expansion, driven by the very profitable U.S. business and other productivity and cost savings more than offsets greater-than-expected dilution from acquisition and divestitures and should result in 2015 full year adjusted earnings per share diluted growth towards the low end of the 3% to 5% range. 
2015 hasn't unfolded the way that we had planned, but we remain focused on strong execution of our plans. Candy, mint and gum has been one of the better-performing categories in the store for many years. It's a destination category, impulsive and very profitable for retailers. As a result, it typically garners key floor space within the store as it relates to merchandising and programming. However, over the last 2 years, it appears that income bifurcation and expanded choice among snacking is having an impact on generating consistent CMG category growth. While overall consumer confidence is trending up, lower-income consumers continue to be fragile as income and wage growth has been minimal. Higher income and more confident consumers are driving premium growth while cost-conscious consumers are driving the value segment. As indicated last quarter and in my remarks today, in 2016, we'll introduce candy products and programs that will leverage our ubiquitous distribution, specifically targeting our core everyday candy business as well as the mass premium and value segments where we're currently underrepresented. 
I look forward to sharing these plans with you in January. We have strong financial resources and technical capabilities, and I have a passionate team of leaders and coworkers who are committed to winning in the marketplace. 
I'll now turn it over to Patricia who will provide some additional detail on our financial results."

Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Third quarter net sales of $1.96 billion were in line with prior year and generated adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.17, an increase of $0.12 or 11.4% versus last year. Exc",1657,"Thank you, J.P. Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast. Third quarter net sales of $1.96 billion were in line with prior year and generated adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.17, an increase of $0.12 or 11.4% versus last year. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 2 points, about 0.5 point greater than our estimates, net sales increased 2%. Pricing in net acquisitions and divestitures were a 5.8 point and 0.5 benefit, partially offset by 4.3 points of lower volume related to pricing elasticity in North America and lower sales in China. 
As J.P. stated, North America gross margin and operating income growth was solid. However, U.S. marketplace consumption trends were less than our estimates, and as a result, sales shipments were softer than expected. Excluding the 1.1 point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Canada, North America net sales increased 3.5% versus the year-ago period. Net price realization was a 6.9  point benefit and volume was off 3.7 points due to elasticity related to the pricing action. The volume impact was in line with estimates when adjusted for the trip declines that J.P. referenced. On a net basis, the Allan Candy and Krave acquisitions and the Mauna Loa divestiture were a 30 basis point benefit. 
Total international and other segment net sales for the third quarter declined 15% versus last year. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates were a 7.9 point headwind; and the Shanghai Golden Monkey acquisition, a 2.3 point benefit. The International and Other segment core business volume was off about 10 points due primarily to China chocolate business performance where sales declined $18 million. 
Turning now to margins. Adjusted gross margins increased 220 basis points in the third quarter, driven by net price realization and supply chain productivity and cost-savings initiatives, partially offset by international trade allowances primarily in China. 
Operating profit in the third quarter increased by 9.1% versus last year, resulting in operating profit margins of 21.2%. The increase was driven by gross margin gains and lower SM&A, selling, marketing and administrative expenses. SM&A, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, increased about 2.8%. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, SM&A expenses, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, declined 2.8% as we remain focused on nonessential spending and look to leverage existing resources. By segment, North America operating profit increased low double digits on a percentage basis versus last year and is on plan. This was partially offset by international performance, primarily China. 
Now let me provide a brief update on our international business. China chocolate category performance continues to be below the historical CAGR growth rate of 11% to 12%. In Q3, chocolate category performance was sluggish in both hyper and small format stores and impacted all major manufacturers, including those whose innovations have been driving the market. 
Over the remainder of the year, we're focused on the broader rollout of Brookside chocolates, distribution into smaller format stores and our e-commerce business. We're making progress in areas that will benefit the business over the long term. However, in the short term, chocolate results in China could remain pressured if lower hypermarket trips and category growth continues to track at these lower levels. This scenario could have an impact on our Chinese New Year sell-in assumptions over the remainder of the year. 
Shanghai Golden Monkey integration is slowly continuing, and we're finishing work that will indicate which distributors we'll invest with going forward. Golden Monkey gross sales for the full year are in line with previous estimates. However, we had some true-ups on sales promotion, and the current net sales estimate for Golden Monkey in 2015 is now around $80 million, less than our prior expectations. These true-ups, plus an adjustment to the tax rate, which I'll discuss in a few moments, are the primary drivers of the increase in M&A dilution from about $0.20 to $0.35 per share diluted. On a local-currency basis, combined net sales in Mexico and Brazil increased mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year. Year-to-date, local currency sales in Mexico and Brazil are up about 10% and 5%, respectively. The macroeconomic environment and competitive dynamics in Latin America continue to be a challenge, and we would expect it to be a headwind as it relates to fourth quarter performance. 
India third quarter local currency sales were off about 20% as we began the phaseout of edible oils, which were discontinued at the end of the third quarter. Excluding the edible oil business, India core business sales increased 7%. The brands that we're investing behind, Jolly Rancher and SOFIT, continue to do well in the marketplace. 
Moving down the P&L. Third quarter interest expense of $18.6 million declined $2.5 million versus last year or 11.9%. For the full year, we expect interest expense to be at the low end of the $75 million to $80 million range. The adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 33.5%. This is greater than our previous estimate of about 30% due to the timing of the U.S. government investment tax credits we discussed last quarter and an adjustment to tax rate related to Golden Monkey net operating loss carryforward. 
As a result, we expect the fourth quarter and full year tax rates to be about 31% and 33.5%, respectively. In the fourth quarter, we expect to record $35 million within the other income and expense line related to the U.S. government investment tax credits. Hence, the net effect on full year net income of the tax credits is about $5 million. For the third quarter of 2015, weighted-average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 220 million shares, down $3.8 million versus last year and a $0.02 benefit in the quarter resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $1.17 or an increase of 11.4% versus year ago. 
Let me now provide a quick recap of year-to-date adjusted results. Year-to-date net sales increased 1.2%. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 2.7% versus the year-ago period. Operating profit increased about 2%, resulting in an operating profit margin of 20%. Year-to-date adjusted gross margin was 46.4% versus 45.2% last year or 120 basis points higher as a result of net price realization and supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher input costs and obsolescence. Year-to-date adjusted earnings per share diluted increased about 3.1% to $3.04 per share. 
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the third quarter, net trading capital decreased versus last year's third quarter by $39 million. Accounts receivable was lower by $26 million and remains extremely current. Inventory was lower by $87 million, and accounts payable declined by $74 million. Total capital additions, including software, were $86 million in the third quarter and $238 million year-to-date. For the year, we expect total capital expenditures to be around $350 million. This is less than our previous forecast of $375 million to $400 million due to lower capital requirements related to the Johor, Malaysia project, which is now estimated to be about $80 million in 2015. 
During the third quarter, depreciation and amortization was $64 million, and dividends paid were $124 million. In the third quarter, the company repurchased $230 million of outstanding shares against the $250 million authorization approved in February 2015. For the year-to-date period, the company repurchased $403 million of outstanding shares. In addition, the company repurchased $22 million of common shares in the quarter and $165 million year-to-date to replace shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options. 
Cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $344 million. This is lower than year ago, primarily due to acquisitions and the share buyback. The company continues to generate substantial free cash flow that has a very strong balance sheet. 
In the fourth quarter, North America in-store seasonal merchandising and programming is secured, and on-air advertises -- advertising reaches its highest point of the year. But as J.P. mentioned, lower consumer trips and the macroeconomic environment continue to be a challenge within the retail environment as we wind down the year and look to 2016. We're confident in our ability to execute at the retail level and provide consumers with CMG and snack products that can drive growth. 
As a result, we do expect North America marketplace performance to improve over the remainder of the year. Given year-to-date results, the aforementioned challenges in international markets and slightly higher-than-expected FX headwinds, we estimate that full year net sales will be about the same as to slightly up versus 2014. 
Including a net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures of about 1 point and excluding an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of at least 1.5 points, net sales are expected to increase 1.5% to 2%. This is less than the low end of the previously provided outlook of 3%. We continue to expect solid gross margin growth in 2015 driven by North America price realization. However, given year-to-date results and the impact of higher levels of international trade promotion, the company expects margin expansion at the low end of 135 to 145 basis point estimate. We're also focused on nonessential SM&A expenses and will leverage existing resources, and given performance, will also benefit from lower-than-estimated other employee-related costs. 
In addition, expected 2015 savings from the business productivity initiative announced in June is estimated to be around $25 million versus the previous estimate of $10 million to $15 million. As a result, we expect adjusted earnings per share diluted to be at the low end of the 3% to 5% range or approximately $4.10 per share diluted. This includes dilution from acquisitions and divestitures of about $0.35 per share, which is greater than the previous estimate of about $0.20 per share diluted. 
Thank you for your time this morning. J.P., Mark and I will now take any questions you may have."

You're guiding to better performance ahead, but why should we, on the outside, have a particularly high amount of confidence in that outlook? Because I know you said you're seeing better trends in October, but it feels like every quarter something unexpected starts to bite this category. So why should we have really a high level of confidence that 4Q will come in sort of as you're expecting? Is there anything in particular that you're looking at that gives you that sort of upward trend than your outlook maybe?"

So I think that as we continue to get greater clarity around, at least, our thinking, we think the consumer bifurcation has been an important driver. We're also seeing that there's expanded choice across the broader snacking continuum. As an example, snack bars, there's about 30% more SKUs in the category then there has been over the last couple of years, so we think we've had some trial there on some of those brands that has impacted some of our CMG brands. 
And then, of course, we've had the trips issue where we've seen a continuing decline in trips across the category and on an everyday and into consumable basis. That had a trending impact against our business as well. So I would think -- I think those are some things that we have to solve for. I feel good about the contribution we've had from innovation into our business over that period of time, so it's continued to contribute as we have hoped it would. And then I think as we move into 2016, we have to have a balanced approach, continue to execute against the fundamentals. I think the pricing is actually coming through about as we would have anticipated. And so really, it's about the magic elixir of volume and how do we continue to drive and bring consumers into the category. And I think those are all things that, as I look to 2016, will be in our favor. I would expect the International, we've got very -- the biggest impact we have against the business is, of course, FX. I don't know that we'll be in that environment for forever. And then, we really hope to get ourselves in a good place in China that we can begin to benefit for the reasons that we had the acquisition there. So I agree with you. It's been unusual in 2015. Been some macroeconomic winds, but I think the fundamentals in the category for retailers continue to be attractive as a category, and we have to execute well."

So I can't tell you that on a single Monday morning, the world changes, but I think the dynamics as a category continue to be attractive. Consumers are snacking more than they ever have before. We have to make sure our portfolio's attractive and then we have to build grants within that. And I think history would suggest that we know how to do that.

We continue to execute well against season, so we expect in the important Halloween period that we're going to win share there. So I feel, as you say, we've done well there. I feel good about that. And the everyday business is really impacted by trips, so we really are going to have to see an environment where across retailers that trips begin to help us a bit where I think it's been a drag on the business overall here over the last 12 to 18 months."

So as you probably heard us talk before, we are heavily weighted to the hypermarket channel in China versus having deeper distribution. So even as we've grown our distribution, it's largely been in the Tier 1 cities, and it's also been more weighted to hypermarkets. And the hypermarket channel has been more negatively impacted over the last 12 months than have other channels. Although the total category across channels is down, but we're not as well-represented, and some of those channels have actually done better than the hypermarket channel. So we have a weighting mix issue that's really impacted our business there, which is one of the things that interested us so much in Shanghai Golden Monkey is it gives us better and deeper distribution across smaller stores, supermarkets and then also Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities where appropriate. So we think those factors are still relevant and that we'll benefit from that. Obviously, we've had some struggles in terms of the start-up of Shanghai Golden Monkey, but the real drivers of why we made the acquisition still exist. The distribution channel is there. The manufacturing is there, the brands, et cetera. So we think as we go forward and gain control of that business, we'll definitely benefit from the greater penetration across all the channels. That's how I would think about what's happening there. And then you have a faster evolution there probably than any place else in terms of e-commerce. So in our category, about 15% of the business is sold in e-commerce. We're right about where the category is. That piece of our business is growing very nicely, so we're participating in that channel development quite nicely. So those are several things that I would mention about China."

In the value segment, a lot of what happened this year was really around sugar confectionery and sweets. And we think the Allan Candy acquisition will enable us to do well there. We also think there were some manufacturers that probably benefited from the spot price of sugar. And based on where things are manufactured, that could have given them an opportunity to invest in the category more so in the past. So the beauty of the Hershey brand is, is it's one of the most accessible brands that there is. Its chocolate, in our country, from all manufacturers, it's the best value per pound of any place in the world. So I think frequency is something we have to make sure that we're driving.

And certainly, you've seen some of that in the numbers that we're talking about today and in terms of where we're spending and choosing to spend. So I think we'll continue that, that way. We also want to invest in markets where we're trying to grow our brands. And volume is always the magic elixir, so pace is important to think about. So where we see there's opportunities, we need to sort of go to the wall there. And when growth is a little tougher or less attractive, we need to moderate in those places as well. We'll continue to do that. But we want to be a consumer-centric, brand-building company, and we'll invest appropriately."

I think you've taken 3 either high single-digit or low double-digit price increases for good commodity-based reasons. It seems as though the commodity -- cocoa commodity prices have been reasonably steady albeit at peak levels for the last few years. Going forward, does it have to become much more volume/mix based because it'll be harder without a commodity-driven step-up to take more pricing? How are you thinking about the U.S. sales growth formula going forward?"

So that's a starting point. If you look over the last decade or even longer, growth has always been a combination, almost equally split between price and volume. And as we go through this current period, it continues to track around that model. So what we believe is, as I said earlier, the real influencers on the category are really around this trips issue that has impacted the business more than it has been on price. So I don't think the historical norms have changed obviously in chocolate where we're a 45 share in the category. We have a lot of responsibility in terms of category growth, so we have to innovate and grow and compete for consumer occasions, which are growing all the time across day parts, and so we have to participate in that. But I don't think there's anything around the category itself that would cause us to think that price, et cetera, is different. Now if we move, to your point, if we move into a period of time where commodities are less of a driver around the price piece, as we've said historically, we're a gross margin-focused company, and we would have to make sure that we continue to do that to maintain the attractive gross margins that we have today. But I wouldn't see us thinking about that significantly different."
