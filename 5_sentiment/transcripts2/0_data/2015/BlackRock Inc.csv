My pleasure to be here to present our fourth quarter and full year 2014 as-adjusted results. Overall, 2014 was another strong year for BlackRock's clients, shareholders and employees. We continue to drive sha",1932,"Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. My pleasure to be here to present our fourth quarter and full year 2014 as-adjusted results. 
Overall, 2014 was another strong year for BlackRock's clients, shareholders and employees. We continue to drive shareholder value by generating consistent organic growth, demonstrating the benefits of scale through operating leverage and systematically returning excess cash to our shareholders, even in an increasingly volatile macro environment. 
As Larry will discuss in more detail, our 2014 results highlights the stability and diversification of our business model and evidence the significant investments we've made in recent years to enhance the depth and breadth of our global platform. 
For the fourth quarter, BlackRock delivered earnings per share of $4.82 and operating income of $1.2 billion. 
Full year earnings per share of $19.34 was up 17% compared to 2013 and operating income of $4.6 billion was 13% higher.  
Non-operating results for the quarter reflected a $2 million decrease in the market value of our seat and coinvestments, down $63 million year-over-year, driven primarily by reduced economic investment portfolio and lower gains from investments in our hedge funds and fun to funds vehicles. 
Our 25.4% as-adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter benefited from $39 million of nonrecurring items. 
While we continue to estimate that 30% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for 2015, the actual effect of tax rate may differ as a consequence of additional nonrecurring items that arise during the year. 
BlackRock's fourth quarter results were driven by $88 billion of long-term net new business, our highest ever quarterly net flows, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 8.3%. 
For the full year 2014, BlackRock generated total long-term net new business of $181 billion, representing an organic growth rate of 4.5%. Together with net flows from our cash management business, BlackRock generated over $200 million of net inflows for the year. 
During 2014, we achieved organic asset growth of 11% in iShares, 11% in Retail and 1% in Institutional, in line with the growth targets we outlined at our June Investor Day. 
This resulted in organic-based fee growth in excess of organic AUM growth as we benefited from positive mix change associated with our faster growth, higher fee in our iShares businesses. 
Equally important, net long-term flows were diversified by asset class and region with positive flows across all categories for both the quarter and the full year. 
Fourth quarter revenue was flat from the year ago as growth in base fees and revenue from BlackRock Solutions was offset by a decrease in performance fees. 
Full year revenue grew 9% from 2013, driven by growth in base fees and revenue from BlackRock Solutions, both of which reached record levels in 2014. 
Fourth quarter base fees were 5% year-over-year as average AUM increased due to organic growth and market appreciation. However, base fees were down 3% compared to the third quarter due to a lower fourth quarter AUM entry rate, the continued impact of diversion data and ongoing dollar appreciation against foreign currencies. 
While the S&P 500 was up 2% on average during the fourth quarter, the MSE I world was down 2% with emerging markets and natural resources indexes lagging even further, down 8% and 12%, respectively. Such diversion beta impacts our financial results as only 34% for equity-based these are generated in U.S. markets. 
In addition, ongoing dollar appreciation led to a $59 billion decline and long-term AUM in the quarter. 
Performance fees for the quarter were $144 million, driven by a broad suite of single strategy hedge funds, real estate and hedge fund solutions offerings. Performance fee decreased $124 million from the fourth quarter of 2013, which included a large fees associated with the partial liquidation of a closed [indiscernible].  The decline also reflected relatively weaker performance across a variety of hedge fund products, in line with broader industry trends. 
BlackRock Solutions revenue of $170 million for the quarter was up 8% year-over-year and 3% sequentially due to increases in both Aladdin and FMA revenue. 
Our Aladdin business, which represented 75% of the BlackRock Solutions revenue in the quarter, grew 9% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. 
We completed a number of large, global implementations in 2014 and expect continued business momentum for trends favoring global investment platform consolidation and multi-asset risk solutions. 
Our FMA business ended 2014 with $161 million in revenues. While revenues benefited from meaningful transaction-based disposition activity during the year, our business model remains well positioned to help clients navigate and implement requirements that tended to CCAR and the new ECB single supervisory mechanism. 
Total expense for the fourth quarter was flat year-over-year as increase direct fund expense was offset by decreased levels of G&A expense. 
Full year compensation expense increased $273 million or 8%, reflecting higher headcount and higher incentive compensation, driven by higher operating income. 
Importantly, our compensation to revenue ratio declined 30 basis points in 2014 to 34.2%, driven by continued reshaping of our employee base and the benefits of scale across our platform. 
Fourth quarter G&A expense decreased $23 million year-over-year or 6%, reflecting lower professional services and other G&A expense and various lease exit cost included in the fourth quarter of 2013. 
Sequentially, quarterly G&A expense increased $61 million, primarily due to volatility and FX remeasurements, the planned seasonal uptick in year end marketing and promotional spend and closed-end fund launch costs associated with the $437 million BlackRock science and technology trust. 
Overall, total expense for 2014 increased 6% from a year ago compared to a 9% increase in revenue over the same period, resulting in an as-adjusted operating margin of 42.9% for the full year, a 150-basis-point increase over 2013 levels. 
Since closing the BGI merger at the end of 2009, we have expanded our operating margin by over 450 basis points while also significantly reinvesting in our business. 
In line with that commitment, on November 5, BlackRock entered into an agreement to acquire certain assets of BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors, the external investment adviser to BlackRock Kelso Capital Corporation. This transaction enhances our fixed-income platform to the addition of a middle market credit capability.  Pending BDC shareholder approval, we expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2015. 
During 2014, we returned approximately $2.3 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and $1 billion in share repurchases, representing a total payout ratio of 71%. 
As we enter 2015, we remain committed to a predictable and balanced approach to capital management. 
Consistent with this, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $2.18 per share of common stock, representing an increase of 13% over the 2014 level. Since instituting a dividend in 2003, BlackRock has grown its dividend by compound annual growth rate of approximately 22%. 
Our Board has also authorized the company to repurchase an additional 6 million shares under our existing share repurchase program, giving us authorization to repurchase a total of 9.4 million shares, including 3.4 million shares, which are remaining under our prior program announced in January 2013. 
Our consistent earnings growth and stable financial results reflected the benefits of our differentiated global business model. Fourth quarter net flows were positive in both our active and index franchises, as well as in each of our geographic regions with $62 billion from the Americas, $50 billion from EMEA and $11 billion from APAC. 
BlackRock's global retail franchise saw long-term net inflows of $23 billion during the fourth quarter, bringing full year inflows to $55 billion, representing 11% organic growth for the full year. 
As usual, fourth quarter retail flows reflect the seasonal impact of reinvested capital gains distributions. 
The fourth quarter U.S. retails flows of $21 billion were driven by strong fixed-income flows across a diverse set of products, including our top-performing total return in high-yield franchises and our flagship fixed-income opportunities fund. SIO was the leading unconstrained bond fund in the quarter with nearly $5 billion of quarterly net inflows. 
Our Multi-Asset Income fund or MAI continued its momentum with nearly $2 billion of flows in the fourth quarter making it the top multi-asset income fund in the industry ranked by 2014 flows. 
Fourth quarter international retail net inflows of $2 billion were driven by BlackRock's fixed income, multi-asset and index capabilities, which more than offset headwind and outgoing outflows from our European equities franchise. 
Global iShares generated over $44 billion of net new business in the fourth quarter and approximately $101 billion for the year, representing full year organic growth of 11%.
 iShares, once again, captured the #1 share of global ETF industry flows. 
During the fourth quarter, iShares' record fixed-income flows were broadly diversified by asset class, duration and geography. We continue to aggressively target growth in the fixed income ETF market, and we're the global world leader in fixed income inflows in 2014. 
Fourth quarter equity iShares flows of $24 billion were driven by flows into the course years with particular demand for U.S. equity exposures. The core segments remains an important growth channel for iShares posting on organic growth rate of 30% in 2014. 
Our Institutional business generated approximately $21 billion in long-term net inflows for the quarter and $25 billion of net inflows for the year, representing the highest quarterly and annual institutional flows we've seen in the past 5 years. 
The investments we've made in our diverse global platform positioned us well to meet the ever-changing needs of sophisticated institutional fund base, and we expect this momentum to continue in 2015. 
Barbelling continues to be a key theme as institution appliance fair cost effective beta exposure with alternatives and other high conviction alpha solutions to achieve encore related returns. 
We continue to see sizable asset allocation driven flows both into and out of institutional index products, resulting in net inflows of $20 billion in the quarter. 
Institutional Index equity flows were driven by clients looking to increase risk exposure while fixed-income inflows reflected asset allocation decisions and solutions based LDI activity. 
Institutional active net paste by positive flows of fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives. Fixed income net inflows of $3 billion were diversified across exposures, and we continue to see institutional demand for our unconstrained strategies. 
Multi-asset net inflows of $2 billion were highlighted by solutions based wins, as well as continued demand for our LifePath target dates suite. 
Excluding approximately $600 million of returned client capital, Institutional alternatives generated nearly $2 billion of net new business, led by hedge fund solutions and private equity solutions. 
In addition, we had another strong fund moderating quarter for liquid alternatives, raising nearly $3 billion in new commitments, reflecting ongoing momentum in infrastructure debt and renewable power. 
Over the last 2 years, we've raised more than $12 billion in commitments and have nearly $9 billion of committed capital to deploy for clients. 
While return of capital impacts our net flows immediately committed capital only translates to flows in AUM as those dollars are invested. 
Outflows from both scientific and fundamental active equities continued in the fourth quarter. Slight strong performance, client demand for scientific active equity remains muted. 
Fundamental active equity outflows continued and products which historical performance issues. However, these flows were partially offset by select wins in categories where new managers are building strong track records, including Large Cap Growth. 
In summary, in a year marked by periods of increased volatility, our diversified business continue to deliver solid and consistent financial results. We remain confident that our differentiated business model is well positioned to meet the needs of our clients and shareholders in the year to come. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

However, markets proved resi",2426,"Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call.  2014 closed with heightened volatility due to political and social instability and that volatility obviously is continuing today and in the new year. 
However, markets proved resilient in 2014. In the fourth quarter marked the eighth straight quarterly rise for the S&P 500 with that suggesting a rebound for the U.S. economy. 
As Gary discussed, the U.S. equity markets outperformed the merging European and Asian markets and certainly, outperformed natural resource markets.  And the U.S. dollar continued to appreciate relative to other currencies. This market divergence is likely to persist in 2015, creating both large challenges and large opportunities for our investors. 
Anemic global growth has led to an overdependence on politicians to implement reforms, to rebuild a global economies. But we've seen limited action globally from politicians, and as a result, we continue to rely on a Central Bank policies whether we're talking about Europe, China, Japan and even at this moment, even in the United States. 
This will also put more pressure on the U.S. dollar assets for rise higher, as well as the mixture of regional policies excesses and failures, again, increasing more global volatility. 
The technology revolution that most people always underestimate is so evident in the oil industry. And through this technology, the growth in supply of oil is outpacing demand, which has led to a period of volatile price discovery in the petroleum markets with greater than a 50% drop in oil prices. 
This has leading to a global redistribution of wealth, which people underestimate how this is going to transform the world. With the high-cost energy production economist experiencing major headwinds, countries like the U.S., like China, like India, will be seen huge benefits in stimulus. 
In countries that have seen currency devaluations such as Europe in recent months will experience only modest and moderate gains. We see more shocks at production decisions and the demand side equilibrium. But overall, this oil price movement should be a great benefit for the global economy. 
With a backdrop in a divergent market performance, volatility, regulatory reform, persistent low rates, our clients near long-term investment challenges are becoming more complex, but our goals at BlackRock steadfastly remain the same. We are a fiduciary and BlackRock is well positioned to address our clients' needs and deliver return for our shareholders in all market environments. 
The combination of our global multi-asset platform are inside in spot leadership in Aladdin are unified technology risk management platform has resulted in a more deeper client interactions than we have ever seen before. It has also enabled our investment team to collaborate ahead of key macro events that both protect assets, and in most cases, generate output for our clients. 
In the fourth quarter, BlackRock generated $88 billion of long-term net inflows, the strongest quarterly long term flows in our history. 
And for the full year, BlackRock saw long-term net inflows of $141 billion. And together with a net flows from our cash management business, we generated more than $200 billion in net inflows in 2014. 
But I want to emphasize one important thing, it's not about the magnitude or the scale of the assets that we raised, but I want to emphasize the composition of outflows, which we believe is much more important. 
For the year, we saw a $35 billion in active and $146 billion in index flows. We saw $52 billion in equities. We saw $96 billion in fixed income, $29 billion of flows and multi-asset and $4 billion in alternatives where we had -- where we put the money to use. 
We saw $55 billion of flows in retail, $101 billion of flows in iShares and $25 billion of flows institutionally. 
And we saw these flows in all regions, from all investor types, and importantly, in the face of wide range economic and investment conditions. What I'd like to highlight is there were more than -- there were 13 countries where we have net inflows in access of $1 billion in 2014. We now manage assets in excess of $1 billion for clients domiciled in over -- in 41 countries, demonstrating the increasingly global and differentiating nature of the BlackRock platform. 
In addition, we added our first Aladdin client base in Latin America and now have clients actively using the Aladdin system in 47 countries around the world. 
As the nature of our clients investment challenges change, so does the nature of the solution they require. More and more, a single investment product, asset class or style does not provide a sufficient long-term solution. BlackRock's business model, which was deliberately built to deliver a multi-faceted solution to clients. And BlackRock's ability to leverage these capabilities across our truly diverse global platform of actives and index, equities, fixed income, multi-asset and alternative strategies, all backed by Aladdin analytics and risk management has resulted in continued organic growth and revenue growth for the firm. 
BlackRock saw 27 distinct retail and iShares product, each generating more than $1 billion in net flows in the fourth quarter. 
For the year, 56 individual retail and iShares products generated more than $1 billion in net flows compared to 43 such products in 2013. The breadth of our platform is resonating with clients as it continues to seek a diverse set of global investment solutions. 
As Gary mentioned, we made significant long-term investments over the past few years in our people, our process and our platform, and those dividends, and those investments have paid off in 2014. And I strongly believe this will continue to differentiate BlackRock over time in an increasingly competitive industry. The strength of BlackRock's fixed-income business is an area where as investments are translating into differentiating results for our clients and for our firm. BlackRock was built on a foundation of superior fixed-income performance and now we have 91% of our active taxable fixed income platform outperforming the benchmark or peers for the 3-year period and no single category was the primary driver of the $96 billion inflows we gathered this year. 
Active index flows were diversified across high yield, unconstrained and core bond offerings and positive across all client businesses. And we saw several key buy list ads across categories in 2014. Our flagship Strategic Income Opportunities fund or SIO raised more than $13 billion in 2014, and we now manage more than $31 billion across our unconstrained fixed-income franchise for both retail and institutional clients. 
BlackRock saw increased client interest in our total return fund, which is in the top 3% of our peer group for 1 year, for 3 years and for 5 years. Total return generated $2 billion of net inflows in the quarter and represents a meaningful long-term opportunity for us. 
Fixed income is also a core strategic priority for BlackRock iShares, which led the industry in fixed ETF outflows for the quarter and for the year, driven by iShares constituting 15 of the top 25 fixed-income ETF by net flows in 2014. 
Assets across classes, BlackRock's iShares franchise, as I said earlier, generated more than $100 billion in net flows this year. And with the industry leader inflows in the United States, inflows in Europe and inflows globally. We continue to focus on growing global iShares market share and driving global expansion, and we expect client and product segmentation to drive the next wave of our iShares group. 
We saw a $32 billion inflows in our global Core Series in 2014 as buy-and-hold investors are increasingly turning to iShares for efficiently constructing larger portions of the portfolio. iShares use financial instrument where ETFs are providing a compelling alternative to individual securities, to swaps, to futures, and we're seeing a strong initial progress in this newly formed area of the marketplace. And clients are also using iShares in precision exposures to express targeted investment viewpoints to generate alpha with efficiency. 
In the fourth quarter, BlackRock kicked off iThinking, an innovative new initiative designed to help the still market insight to clear actionable ideas our clients and matching them with different iShares solutions. 
We continue to be product innovation was evident in December when we launched our CRV or our low carbon targeted ETF, designed for individuals and institutions who are focusing on environmental sustainable activity. The United Nations joint staff pension fund in university systems of Marilyn Foundation provided the initial funding for this ETF and BlackRock now manages more than $250 billion in socially responsible strategies across our global platform. 
2014 was a turning point for our institutional business and as we enter 2015 with substantial momentum. 
Our scale of our global presence enables BlackRock to interact with our increasingly sophisticated client base in a highly specialized manner and our financial institution group business is a great example. 
In 2014, BlackRock was selected management mandate spending multi-asset fixed-income infrastructure debt and full balance sheet outsourcing for global insurance clients, driven by regulatory changes, by M&A and investors are looking for better ways to navigate in this low interest rate environment. 
In conjunction with asset management mandates, many of these clients also chose to partner with BlackRock and Aladdin on the evaluation, on risk and advisory services and even acquisition support through our BlackRock Solutions business. BlackRock is the only firm in the industry that can bring all of these components together to meet the needs of our clients, and we do this as a dedicated -- with dedicated relationships and with investment teams who speak with our clients in their own language. We understand their industry, and we get partnered with them to create their needs to provide the most proper solutions to their issues. 
Another area where we are creating tailored outcomes is in the alternatives space, particularly in the emerging alternative solution business, where BlackRock is building a holistic multidimensional solution portfolio, leverages our full global platform. 
We've seen strong fundraising across our illiquid alternative product set as a targeted strategy we laid out on Investor Day unfolds. BlackRock raised nearly $6 billion of new commitments in 2014 across a variety of strategies, including private equity, hedge fund solutions, opportunistic credit, renewable power and infrastructure debt. 
We recently completed our annual institutional clients rebalancing survey, which indicated that institutions are looking to significantly increase allocations to real estate, including infrastructure. 
In the fourth quarter, BlackRock flows our second renewable power infrastructure fund positioning us as one of the leading renewable platforms in the industry. 2014, BlackRock raised commitment of nearly $800 million renewable power and $1 billion in infrastructure debt. Momentum in this space demonstrates BlackRock's proprietary transaction, sourcing capabilities and ability to act as an extension of our clients internal teams. The tangible impact of the investments made to date in our renewable power fund is also being felt by providing energy and electricity to more than 100,000 households. 
We continue to make progress on reinvigoration and globalization of our fundamental active equity business and have seen meaningful impact performance for some of our clients. We've seen a major improvement in the performance of our U.K. equity strategies, we generated top quartile performance as we hit our 3-year anniversary and our new management team in Asia equities and our European equity strategies has posted leading market share and solid broad-based 3 and 5-year investment performance. 
The most recent leg of our investment in this area was focused on U.S. equities. We hired a world-class group of investors with strong processes and track record for generating alpha. We're now in our second year of investment and seeing good progress and hopefully, we will improve on our investment performance.  Although we have a lot of work to do, and quite frankly, we're not at the space where I'd like to be at this moment. 
2014 was a challenging year for active managers with only 20% of the industry in U.S. active equity funds outperformed their benchmarks. We saw significant rise in volatility in the fourth quarter, but it was encouraging to see many of our active teams deliver stronger performance as the environment especially in December. 
Our basic value strategy achieved top quintile performance since the new manager inception. Our large cap series strategy has improved from a second -- to a second quartile from a fourth quartile and our U.S. opportunity strategy is in the top quintile over 3 years. 
While our active business continues to fill the impact of clients balancing high conviction alpha strategies now with index exposures, the breadth and diversity of our platform and the presence of the only skill player in both active and index around the world will differentiate us in the ability to give our clients the full menu of solutions they need. 
We expect investor preference to vary over time and BlackRock's ability to evolve along side our clients is critical for the future of our success. 
Before I open it up to questions, I'd like to take a moment to thank our employees for their hard work, incredible dedication in 2014 in helping our clients in the most complex investment challenges in the world by helping them provide solutions. 
I'd like to thank my entire management team, many of them who are thriving in their new role following successful organizational changes earlier this year. 
And I like to recognize some of the milestones that BlackRock achieved in 2014. In retail, we crossed over $500 billion in assets under management. In iShares, in 2014, we closed with more than $1 trillion in assets under management. In institutional, we garnered the best flows that we've seen in over 5 years. 
Since the financial crisis or essentially since the end of 2007, the final year of the pre-crisis earnings, BlackRock has grown EPS by 142% versus the S&P 500 growing at 76% and the S&P financial index growing at only 9%, highlighting both the differentiation of our business model and our ability to execute on key growth strategies. 
All of the areas I've spoken about, whether it's fixed income, iShares or financial institution group, alternatives, infrastructure are active equity platform, all our areas where we made significant strategic investments over time, and we'll be seeing the impact of those investments over time to our shareholders and to our clients. 
We will continue to make investments in BlackRock's future and keep very high margins and utilize a full scale of our Aladdin risk management and technology capabilities to meet our fiduciary duties to our clients and to deliver return for shareholders in 2015. 
With that, operator, let's open it up for questions."

We are still in the early stages, not only of institutions using the product, but retail using the product as well. So there are 3 segments, there is buy",402,"So the fixed income ETFs have been in the increased demand as people are learning about the product. We are still in the early stages, not only of institutions using the product, but retail using the product as well. So there are 3 segments, there is buy and hold segment where people are using ETFs as a part of their fixed-income portfolio for the beta and fixed income. And we have products that are focused on that. The second thing is that, as the financial markets change, ETFs are surrogate for many financial instruments that have because of regulatory reasons and liquidity reasons become very expensive and their surrogates, for example, in swaps and features where ETFs are now being used, in fact, more than features are being used. And as people learn about that, they add that into their portfolios. On the other side of that, there are also being used as we call it precision instruments for people for a specific allocation and ETFs provide that specific precision tool for them to be invested in. So this is just the beginning of where fixed income and ETFs go. And as you know, the fixed-income markets are much larger than the equity markets are. So we just see continued growth in that. So for retail, we're attacking that by adding on to our Core Series, where we are adding products that can offer the full suite to what the retail investor would need over the long-term in ETFs, whether that be in high yield, in corporates, in treasuries or just generic fixed income. And then on institutions, because they're looking for more of a trading vehicle and they're looking for the transparency and they're looking for the liquidity, we're adding more specific type of precision instruments for them. So I would tell you that the demand to learn about ETFs grows and grows, and we're just -- we just think that this is a market that we are very positive on going forward. And also for portfolio managers that are managing large portfolios, getting the beta exposure from ETFs is cheaper, it's more diversified, and it's more liquid than the alternative. And I might add that really important with you're in a low interest rate environment like we're in.

We are seeing -- I think much of it has to do with the continuation of performance that we generated with top-decile performance at our core business, our leading performance in our unconstrained fixed income, our top quartile, maybe top-decile performance and high yield. So across the board, the performance in all the different fixed-income products continues to be quite large. And we are seeing more and more clients who are just also using beta products for fixed income. So across the board, we are seeing that. But in terms of the aware we are seeing clients look to put more money to work, we are seeing increased activity in the demand contribution area where we've had some rather substantial wins. We continue to just see in terms of insurance companies, all at the beginning of the year, they get big infusions of cash. This is one of the fundamental reasons why we said rates would be going down in the first of the year, obviously, we don't  expect some of that activities that of occurred. But fundamentally, you always see some very large activities from insurance companies because of the beginning of the year. So it's across the board and it is geographically diverse too. So we think this is going to continue. But I must say, where rates are at this moment one more clients are going to be looking for different types of expressions of exposure. I do believe where rates are it's going to lead more and more clients searching things like infrastructure debt, other activities like that and this is one of the reasons why we are so heavily invested in our infrastructure teams. We will continue to see clients reaching for yield and high yield whether that's a good strategy or bad strategy. I mean, I specifically believe rates are going to stay lower longer. And I think the activities that you're seeing in Europe whether the courts approval of the ECB and the greater possibility of QE from the ECB but continually easing in Japan. And importantly, as Chairwoman Yellin has said she's going to be data dependent to what the Federal Reserve does. So I actually believe this creates more money and motion and more opportunity for BlackRock, especially with our flows."

And then more broadly as we think about margins, obviously, not notwithstanding some of the seasonality that we have in our own margins especially in the first quarter, margins more broadly are dependent on lots of things, especially the beta environment, the future business mix, the various reinvestment opportunities that we see in our business and obviously, the competitive compensation environment. So I don't -- our margin guidance really hasn't changed. As you know, we don't manage the business to a specific margin target, and we remain ever committed to generating operating leverage.

I mean, I think it's very hard in most cases to be closing our pension but let's step back why have we seen elevated pension closeout because you've had significant rallies in U.S. equities over the last 5 years, company have been closer to meeting their liabilities, and they have decided to minimize income statement volatility because of the issues related to the pension fund. So we are in dialogues with many people. Some of the firms have used annuities and working with insurance companies. As you said, we are in dialogue with many organizations some of the organizations are transforming the BB plans, the DC. As I said, we're seeing elevated growth in our DC business in the fourth quarter, we expect that in the first quarter. And we are having dialogues with many, many institutions worldwide about the profitability that I would just caution that with rates being so low, unless you see significant equity rallies, it becomes a little harder to do that or the companies are going to have to infuse some type of money to making sure that they're matched. But I would say, unquestionably, BlackRock's global platform, the ability of having our strength and target date in terms of DC plans and having LifePath in the DC side, we have a lot of components in working with our clients, whether it's LDI products, which obviously will create a de-risking. And obviously, we can help quite a bit in helping them think about to -- how pension funds ultimately transfer some of the risk. But I don't want to call it unify across the board. I do believe depending on where each company is related to the reliability and as you suggested quite correctly about the elongation of age, these are all being issues. We have actually had conversations with organizations that did LDI years ago and now how do they factor in this is elongated aging process and are they properly matched. So the one thing is very clear to companies that have done the de-risking. It is not a static one time event, they have to be constantly monitoring this depending on how their liabilities are changing. And as I said earlier, we're very involved in these dialogues and I do believe that this plays really well with our global platform of having great analytics with helping companies think about it. Or a long period of time we'd be involved with insurance companies and doing a lot of liability matching type of products for insurance companies that plays really well into LDI, other areas for us."

So the one area that we've done quite well is in the model based equity. We're still not seeing it really any flows, but we've now had 5 years of great success there. I do believe the traditional Fundamental Equity business is alive, it's not well, it had poor performances in industry and I think that you're alluding to. We are seeing great movement as an industry, movement out of maybe more of the fundamental investing into index. But I would say now, Bill, if you believe in a greater divergent market, a more powerful market, you would -- I have been asked many times questions related should I be in an index product with a great divergent because I can't capture some of the great opportunities that could be masked by the great failures. So when you think about the energy market, if you think about an emerging market world, contact, a China, India it's going to be hugely benefited by this. Countries like Russia, and Nigeria, potentially Brazil are going to be harmed by this. How do you play that? And so this is why more and more of our clients are asking about things about smart beta, factors. And so I do believe we're going to need to capture different ways of finding alpha. But importantly, in our actions related to Fundamental Equities, we have always said this is a 5-year project. 2015 begins the third year. We are committed to this. And if you do believe in the world of great divergence, if you believe in a world that one day you will have -- whatever day that will be -- higher rates, it generally mean historically, you would think this is a better environment for stockpicking and Fundamental Equities. So our model is purposely built and positioned to benefit in this active and passive world. But the one thing that I am going to be pretty loud about, I do believe the most neglected component of equity investing is basically model or factor based investing where we have a great platform. We've had great return, especially overseas. And I am very bullish on building this out as a component of our active equity area. And I'm quite frustrated, to frank, that we haven't seen the momentum that I thought we would. But this is an area where in my most recent meetings last week in Asia, every client asked me about factor based investing in a divergent world. So we'll see how this plays out, Bill. But I do believe in this divergent world, in the way we have built the model of BlackRock, we'll be a beneficiary of that."

And before Larry and Gary make their remarks, I want to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements and call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. And additionally, BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. 
So with that, let's begin the call. Gary?"

My pleasure to be here to present our fourth quarter and full year 2014 as adjusted results. Overall, 2014 was another strong year for BlackRock's clients, shareholders and employees. We continue to drive share",1937,"Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. My pleasure to be here to present our fourth quarter and full year 2014 as adjusted results. Overall, 2014 was another strong year for BlackRock's clients, shareholders and employees. We continue to drive shareholder value by generating consistent organic growth, demonstrating the benefits of scale through operating leverage and systematically returning excess cash to our shareholders, even in an increasingly volatile macro environment. As Larry will discuss in more detail, our 2014 results highlight the stability and diversification of our business model and evidence the significant investments we've made in recent years to enhance the depth and breadth of our global platform. 
For the fourth quarter, BlackRock delivered earnings per share of $4.82 and operating income of $1.2 billion. Full year earnings per share of $19.34 was up 17% compared to 2013 and operating income of $4.6 billion was 13% higher. Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected a $2 million decrease in the market value of our seed and co-investments, down $63 million year-over-year, driven primarily by a reduced economic investment portfolio and lower gains from investments in our hedge funds and fund of funds vehicles. Our 25.4% as adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter benefited from $39 million of nonrecurring items. While we continue to estimate that 30% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for 2015, the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of additional nonrecurring items that arise during the year. 
BlackRock's fourth quarter results were driven by $88 billion of long-term net new business, our highest ever quarterly net flows, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 8.3%. For the full year 2014, BlackRock generated total long-term net new business of $181 billion, representing an organic growth rate of 4.5%. Together with net flows from our cash management business, BlackRock generated over $200 billion of net inflows for the year. 
During 2014, we achieved organic asset growth of 11% in iShares, 11% in retail and 1% in institutional, in line with the growth targets we outlined at our June Investor Day. This resulted in organic-based fee growth in excess of organic AUM growth as we benefited from positive mix change associated with our faster-growing, higher fee retail and iShares businesses. Equally important, net long-term flows were diversified by asset class and region with positive flows across all categories for both the quarter and the full year. 
Fourth quarter revenue was flat with the year ago as growth in base fees and revenue from BlackRock Solutions was offset by a decrease in performance fees. Full year revenue grew 9% from 2013, driven by growth in base fees and revenue from BlackRock Solutions, both of which reached record levels in 2014. Fourth quarter base fees rose 5% year-over-year as average AUM increased due to organic growth and market appreciation. However, base fees were down 3% compared to the third quarter due to a lower fourth quarter AUM entry rate, the continued impact of divergent beta and ongoing dollar appreciation against foreign currencies. While the S&P 500 was up 2% on average during the fourth quarter, the MSCI World was down 2% with emerging markets and natural resources indices lagging even further, down 8% and 12%, respectively. Such divergent beta impacts our financial results as only 34% of our equity-based fees are generated in U.S. markets. In addition, ongoing dollar appreciation led to a $59 billion decline in long-term AUM in the quarter. 
Performance fees for the quarter were $144 million, driven by a broader suite of single-strategy hedge funds, real estate and hedge fund solutions offerings. Performance fee decreased $124 million from the fourth quarter of 2013, which included a large fee associated with a partial liquidation of a closed-end opportunistic fund. The decline also reflected relatively weaker performance across a variety of hedge fund products, in line with broader industry trends. 
BlackRock Solutions revenue of $170 million for the quarter was up 8% year-over-year and 3% sequentially due to increases in both Aladdin and FMA revenue. Our Aladdin business, which represented 75% of BlackRock Solutions' revenue in the quarter, grew 9% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. We completed a number of large global implementations in 2014 and expect continued business momentum from trends favoring global investment platform consolidation and multi-asset risk solutions. Our FMA business ended 2014 with $161 million in revenues. While revenues benefited from meaningful transaction-based disposition activity during the year, our business model remains well positioned to help clients navigate and implement requirements that tended to CCAR and the new ECB Single Supervisory Mechanism. 
Total expense for the fourth quarter was flat year-over-year as increased direct fund expense was offset by decreased levels of G&A expense. Full year compensation expense increased $273 million or 8%, reflecting higher headcount and higher incentive compensation, driven by higher operating income. Importantly, our compensation to revenue ratio declined 30 basis points in 2014 to 34.2%, driven by continued reshaping of our employee base and the benefits of scale across our platform. Fourth quarter G&A expense decreased $23 million year-over-year or 6%, reflecting lower professional services and other G&A expense and various lease exit costs included in the fourth quarter of 2013. Sequentially, quarterly G&A expense increased $61 million, primarily due to volatility and FX remeasurement, the planned seasonal uptick in year-end marketing and promotional spend and closed-end fund launch costs associated with the $437 million BlackRock Science and Technology Trust. Overall, total expense for 2014 increased 6% from a year ago compared to a 9% increase in revenue over the same period, resulting in an as adjusted operating margin of 42.9% for the full year, a 150 basis point increase over 2013 levels. 
Since closing the BGI merger at the end of 2009, we have expanded our operating margin by over 450 basis points while also significantly reinvesting in our business. In line with that commitment, on November 5, BlackRock entered into an agreement to acquire certain assets of BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors, the external investment adviser to BlackRock Kelso Capital Corporation. This transaction enhances our fixed income platform through the addition of a middle-market private credit capability. Pending BDC shareholder approval, we expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2015. 
During 2014, we returned approximately $2.3 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and $1 billion in share repurchases, representing a total payout ratio of 71%. As we enter 2015, we remain committed to a predictable and balanced approach to capital management. Consistent with this, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $2.18 per share of common stock, representing an increase of 13% over the 2014 level. Since instituting a dividend in 2003, BlackRock has grown its dividend at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 22%. Our board has also authorized the company to repurchase an additional 6 million shares under our existing share repurchase program, giving us authorization to repurchase a total of 9.4 million shares, including 3.4 million shares, which are remaining under our prior program announced in January 2013. 
Our consistent earnings growth and stable financial results reflect the benefits of our differentiated global business model. Fourth quarter net flows were positive in both our active and index franchises as well as in each of our geographic regions with $62 billion from the Americas, $50 billion from EMEA and $11 billion from APAC. BlackRock's global retail franchise saw long-term net inflows of $23 billion during the fourth quarter, bringing full year inflows to $55 billion, representing 11% organic growth for the full year. As usual, fourth quarter retail flows reflect the seasonal impact of reinvested capital gains distributions. The fourth quarter U.S. retails flows of $21 billion were driven by strong fixed income flows across a diverse set of products, including our top-performing Total Return and high-yield franchises and our flagship Strategic Income Opportunities Fund. SIO was the leading unconstrained bond fund in the quarter with nearly $5 billion of quarterly net inflows. Our Multi-Asset Income Fund or MAI continued its momentum with nearly $2 billion of flows in the fourth quarter, making it the top multi-asset income fund in the industry ranked by 2014 flows.  
Fourth quarter international retail net inflows of $2 billion were driven by BlackRock's fixed income, multi-asset and index capabilities, which more than offset headwinds and outgoing outflows from our European Equities franchise. Global iShares generated over $44 billion of net new business in the fourth quarter and approximately $101 billion for the year, representing full year organic growth of 11%. iShares once again captured the #1 share of global ETF industry flows. During the fourth quarter, iShares' record fixed income flows were broadly diversified by asset class, duration and geography. We continue to aggressively target growth in the fixed income ETF market, and we're the global world leader in fixed income inflows in 2014. Fourth quarter equity iShares flows of $24 billion were driven by flows into the Core Series with particular demand for U.S. equity exposures. The core segment remains an important growth channel for iShares, posting on organic growth rate of 30% in 2014. 
Our institutional business generated approximately $21 billion in long-term net inflows for the quarter and $25 billion of net inflows for the year, representing the highest quarterly and annual institutional flows we've seen in the past 5 years. The investments we've made in our diverse global platform position us well to meet the ever-changing needs of a sophisticated institutional client base, and we expect this momentum to continue in 2015. 
Barbelling continues to be a key theme as institutional appliance pair cost-effective beta exposure with alternatives and other high-conviction alpha solutions to achieve uncorrelated returns. We continue to see sizable asset allocation-driven flows both into and out of institutional index products, resulting in net inflows of $20 billion in the quarter. Institutional index equity flows were driven by clients looking to increase risk exposure while fixed income inflows reflected asset allocation decisions and solutions-based LDI activity. Institutional active net inflows were paced by positive flows into fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives. Fixed income net inflows of $3 billion were diversified across exposures, and we continue to see institutional demand for our unconstrained strategies. 
Multi-asset net inflows of $2 billion were highlighted by solutions-based wins as well as continued demand for our LifePath Target Date suite. Excluding approximately $600 million of returned client capital, institutional alternatives generated nearly $2 billion of net new business, led by hedge fund solutions and private equity solutions. In addition, we had another strong fund-raising quarter for illiquid alternatives, raising nearly $3 billion in new commitments, reflecting ongoing momentum in infrastructure debt and renewable power. Over the last 2 years, we've raised more than $12 billion in commitments and have nearly $9 billion of committed capital to deploy for clients. While return of capital impacts our net flows immediately, committed capital only translates to flows in AUM as those dollars are invested. 
Outflows from both Scientific and Fundamental Active Equities continued in the fourth quarter. Despite strong performance, client demand for Scientific Active Equity remains muted. Fundamental Active Equity outflows continued in products with historical performance issues. However, these flows were partially offset by select wins in categories where our new managers are building strong track records, including Large Cap Growth. 
In summary, in a year marked by periods of increased volatility, our diversified business continued to deliver solid and consistent financial results. We remain confident that our differentiated business model is well positioned to meet the needs of our clients and shareholders in the year to come. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. 2014 closed with heightened volatility due to political and social instability. And that volatility obviously is continuing today and in the new year. However, markets proved resilient in 2014, and the fourth quarter marked the eighth straight quarterly rise for the S&P 500 with that as suggesting a rebound for the U.S. economy. As Gary discussed, the U.S. equity markets outperformed emerging, European and Asian markets and certainly outperformed natural resource markets. And the U.S. dollar continued to appreciate relative to other currencies. This market divergence is likely to persist in 2015, creating both large challenges and large opportunities for our investors. 
Anemic global growth has led to an overdependence on politicians to implement reforms, to rebuild the global economies. But we've seen limited action globally from politicians. And as a result, we continue to rely on accommodative central bank policies, whether we're talking about Europe, China, Japan and even at this moment, even the United States. This will also put more pressure on the U.S. dollar and it will rise higher as well as a mixture of regional policies successes and failures, again increasing more global volatility. 
The technology revolution that most people always underestimate is so evident in the oil industry. And through this technology, the growth in supply of oil is outpacing demand, which has led to a period of volatile price discovery in the petroleum market with greater than a 50% drop in oil prices. This is leading to a global redistribution of wealth, which people underestimate how this is going to transform the world. With the high-cost energy production economies experiencing major headwinds, countries like the U.S., like China, like India, will be seeing huge benefits in stimulus. And countries that have seen currency devaluations, such as Europe in recent months, will experience only modest and moderate gains. We see more shocks at production decisions and the demand-side equilibrium. But overall, this oil price movement should be a great benefit for the global economy.  
With a backdrop of divergent market performance, volatility, regulatory reform, persistent low rates, our clients' near- and long-term investment challenges are becoming more complex, but our goals at BlackRock steadfastly remain the same. We are a fiduciary, and BlackRock is well positioned to address our clients' needs and deliver return for our shareholders in all market environments. The combination of our global multi-asset platform, our insight and thought leadership in Aladdin, our unified technology risk management platform has resulted in a more deeper client interactions than we have ever seen before. It has also enabled our investment team to collaborate ahead of key macro events to both protect assets, and in most cases, generate output for our clients. 
In the fourth quarter, BlackRock generated $88 billion of long-term net inflows, the strongest quarterly long-term flows in our history. And for the full year, BlackRock saw long-term net inflows of $141 billion. And together with the net flows from our cash management business, we generated more than $200 billion in net inflows in 2014. But I want to emphasize one important thing, it's not about the magnitude or the scale of the assets that we raised, but I want to emphasize the composition of the flows, which we believe is much more important. 
For the year, we saw $35 billion in active and $146 billion in index flows. We saw $52 billion in equities. We saw $96 billion in fixed income, $29 billion of flows in multi-asset and $4 billion in alternatives, where we had -- where we've put the money to use. We saw $55 billion of flows in retail, $101 billion of flows in iShares and $25 billion of flows institutionally. And we saw these flows in all regions, from all investor types, and importantly, in the face of wide range of economic and investment conditions. One thing I'd like to highlight is that there were more than -- there were 13 countries where we had net inflows in access of $1 billion in 2014. We now manage assets in excess of $1 billion for clients domiciled in over -- in 41 countries, demonstrating the increasingly global and differentiating nature of the BlackRock platform. In addition, we added our first Aladdin client base in Latin America and now have clients actively using the Aladdin system in 47 countries around the world. 
As the nature of our clients' investment challenges change, so does the nature of the solutions they require. More and more, a single investment product, asset class or style does not provide a sufficient long-term solution. BlackRock's business model, which was deliberately built to deliver a multifaceted solution to clients, and BlackRock's ability to leverage these capabilities across our truly diverse global platform of active and index, equities, fixed income, multi-asset and alternative strategies, all backed by Aladdin analytics and risk management, has resulted in continued organic growth and revenue growth for the firm. 
BlackRock saw 27 distinct retail and iShares products each generating more than $1 billion of net flows in the fourth quarter. For the year, 56 individual retail and iShares products generated more than $1 billion of net flows compared to 43 such products in 2013. The breadth of our platform is resonating with clients as they continue to seek a diverse set of global investment solutions. As Gary mentioned, we made significant long-term investments over the past few years in our people, our process and our platform. And those dividends and those investments have paid off in 2014. And I strongly believe this will continue to differentiate BlackRock over time in an increasingly competitive industry. 
The strength of BlackRock's fixed income business is an area where past investments are translating into differentiating results for our clients and for our firm. BlackRock was built on a foundation of superior fixed income performance, and now we have 91% of our active taxable fixed income platform outperforming the benchmarks or peers for the 3-year period and no single category was the primary driver of the $96 billion in flows we gathered this year. Active and index flows were diversified across high yield, unconstrained and core bond offerings and positive across all client businesses. And we saw several key buy list ads across categories in 2014. Our flagship Strategic Income Opportunities Fund or SIO raised more than $13 billion in 2014, and we now manage more than $31 billion across our unconstrained fixed income franchise for both retail and institutional clients. 
BlackRock saw increased client interest in our Total Return Fund, which is in the top 3% of our peer group for 1 year, for 3 years and for 5 years. Total Return generated $2 billion of net inflows in the quarter and represents a meaningful long-term opportunity for us. Fixed income is also a core strategic priority for BlackRock's iShares, which led the industry in fixed income ETF flows for the quarter and for the year, driven by iShares constituting 15 of the top 25 fixed income ETF by net flows in 2014. Assets across classes, BlackRock's iShares franchise, as I said earlier, generated more than $100 billion in net flows this year. And we're the industry leader in flows in the United States, in flows in Europe and in flows globally. We continue to focus on growing global iShares market share and driving global market expansion, and we expect client and product segmentation to drive the next wave of our iShares growth. 
We saw a $32 billion in flows in our global Core Series in 2014 as buy-and-hold investors are increasingly turning to iShares for efficiently constructing larger portions of their portfolio. iShares are used as financial instruments, where ETFs are providing a compelling alternative to individual securities, to swaps, to futures. And we're seeing strong initial progress in this newly formed area of the marketplace. And clients are also using iShares as precision exposures to express targeted investment viewpoints to generate alpha with efficiency. 
In the fourth quarter, BlackRock kicked off iThinking, an innovative new initiative designed to help distill market insight into clear, actionable ideas for our clients and matching them with different iShares solutions. We continued to be product innovation -- it was evident in December, when we launched our CRBN or our Low Carbon Target ETF, designed for individuals and institutions who are focusing on environmental sustainable activity. The United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund and the University System of Maryland Foundation provided the initial funding for this ETF. And BlackRock now manages more than $250 billion in socially responsible strategies across our global platform. 
2014 was a turning point for our institutional business, and as we enter 2015 with substantial momentum. Our scale and our global presence enables BlackRock to interact with our increasingly sophisticated client base in a highly specialized manner and our Financial Institutions Group business is a great example. In 2014, BlackRock was selected to manage mandates spanning multi-asset, fixed income, infrastructure debt and full balance sheet outsourcing for global insurance clients, driven by regulatory changes, by M&A and investors who are looking for better ways to navigate in this low interest rate environment. 
In conjunction with asset management mandates, many of these clients also chose to partner with BlackRock and Aladdin on evaluation, on risk and advisory services and even acquisition support through our BlackRock Solutions business. BlackRock is the only firm in the industry that can bring all of these components together to meet the needs of our clients, and we do this in a dedicated -- with dedicated relationships and with investment teams who speak with our clients in their own language, we understand their industry and we could partner with them to create their needs to provide the most proper solutions to their issues. 
Another area where we are creating tailored outcomes is in the alternative space, particularly in the emerging alternative solution business, where BlackRock is building a holistic, multidimensional solution portfolio that leverages our full global platform. We've seen strong fund-raising across our illiquid alternative product set as the targeted strategy we laid out on our Investor Day unfolds. BlackRock raised nearly $6 billion in new commitments in 2014 across a variety of strategies, including private equity, hedge fund solutions, opportunistic credit, renewable power and infrastructure debt. We recently completed our annual institutional clients rebalancing survey, which indicated that institutions are looking to significantly increase allocations to real estate, including infrastructure. 
In the fourth quarter, BlackRock closed our second renewable power infrastructure fund, positioning us as one of the leading global renewable platforms in the industry. 2014, BlackRock raised commitments of nearly $800 million in renewable power and $1 billion in infrastructure debt. Momentum in this space demonstrates BlackRock's proprietary transaction and sourcing capabilities and ability to act as an extension of our clients' internal teams. The tangible impact of the investments made to date in our renewable power fund is also being felt by providing energy and electricity to more than 100,000 households. 
We continue to make progress on the reinvigoration and globalization of our Fundamental Active Equity business and have seen meaningful impact on the performance for some of our clients. We've seen a major improvement in the performance of our U.K. equity strategies. We generated top quartile performance as we hit our 3-year anniversary in our new management team in Asian equities. And our European equity strategy has posted leading market share and solid broad-based 3- and 5-year investment performance. 
The most recent leg of our investments in this area was focused on U.S. equities. We hired a world-class group of investors with strong processes and track records for generating alpha. We're now in our second year of the investment and seeing good progress. And hopefully, we will improve on our investment performance, although we have a lot of work to do, and quite frankly we're not at the space where I would like to be at this moment. 2014 was a challenging year for active managers with only 20% of the industry U.S. active equity funds outperformed their benchmarks. We saw a significant rise in volatility in the fourth quarter, but it was encouraging to see many of our active teams delivered stronger performances in the environment, especially in December. Our basic value strategy is to achieve top quintile performance since the new manager inception. In our large cap series, the strategy has improved from a second -- to a second quartile from a fourth quartile. And our U.S. opportunity strategy is in the top quintile over 3 years. 
While our active business continues to feel the impact of clients balancing high-conviction alpha strategies now with index exposures, the breadth and diversity of our platform and the presence of the only scale player in both active and index around the world will differentiate us in the ability to give our clients the full menu of solutions they need. We expect investor preference to vary over time. And BlackRock's ability to evolve alongside our clients is critical in the future for our success. 
Before I open it up for questions, I would like to take a moment to thank our employees for their hard work, incredible dedication in 2014 in helping our clients in the most complex investment challenges in the world by helping them to provide solutions. I'd like to thank my entire management team, many of them who are thriving in their new role following successful organizational changes earlier this year. And I'd like to recognize some of the milestones that BlackRock achieved in 2014. In retail, we crossed over $500 billion in assets under management. In iShares in 2014, we closed with more than $1 trillion in assets under management. In institutional, we garnered the best flows that we've seen in over 5 years. Since the financial crisis or essentially since the end of 2007, the final year of the precrisis earnings, BlackRock has grown EPS by 142% versus the S&P 500 growing at 76% and the S&P Financials Index growing at only 9%, highlighting both the differentiation of our business model and our ability to execute on key growth strategies. 
All of the areas I've spoken about, whether it's fixed income, iShares, our Financial Institutions Group, alternatives, infrastructure, our active equity platform, all are areas where we made significant strategic investments over time, and we'll be seeing the impact of those investments over time to our shareholders and to our clients. We will continue to make investments in BlackRock's future and keep very high margins and utilize a full scale of our Aladdin risk management and technology capabilities to meet our fiduciary duties to our clients and to deliver return for shareholders in 2015. 
With that, operator, let's open it up for questions."

We are still in the early stages, not only of institutions using the product but retail using the product as well. So there are 3 segments. There is a buy-and-hold segment, where people are using ETFs as a part of their fixed income portfolio for the beta and fixed income. And we have products that are focused on that. The second thing is that, as the financial markets change, ETFs are a surrogate for many financial instruments that have, because of regulatory reasons and liquidity reasons, become very expensive. And they are surrogates, for example, in swaps and futures, where ETFs are now being used, in fact, more than futures are being used. And as people learn about that, they add that into their portfolios. On the other side of that, they are also being used as we call it precision instruments, where people are looking for a specific allocation and ETFs provide that specific precision tool for them to be invested in. So this is just the beginning of where fixed income ETFs go. And as you know, the fixed income markets are much larger than the equity markets are. So we just see continued growth in that. So for retail, we're attacking that by adding on to our Core Series, where we are adding products that can offer the full suite to what a retail investor would need over the long term in ETFs, whether that be in high yield, in corporates, in treasuries or just generic fixed income. And then on institutions, because they're looking for more of a trading vehicle and they're looking for the transparency and they're looking for the liquidity, we're adding more specific type of precision instruments for them. So I would tell you that the demand to learn about ETFs grows and grows, and we're just -- we just think this is a market that we're very positive on going forward. And also for portfolio managers that are managing large portfolios, getting the beta exposure from ETFs is cheaper, it's more diversified and it's more liquid than the alternative. And I might add that's really important when you're in a low interest rate environment like we're in. So we look forward to more growth in the fixed income and to be the leader in the ETFs in that area."

We are seeing -- I think much of it has to do with the continuation of performance that we have generated with some top decile performance in our core business, our leading performance in our unconstrained fixed income, our top quartile, maybe top decile, performance in high yield. So across the board, the performance in all the different fixed income products continues to be quite large. And we are seeing more and more clients who are just also using beta products for fixed income. So across the board, we are seeing that. But in terms of where we are seeing clients looking to put more money to work, we are seeing increased activity in the client contribution area, where we've had some rather substantial wins. We continue to see in terms of insurance companies, always at the beginning of the year, they get big infusions of cash. This is one of the fundamental reasons why we thought that rates would be going down in the first part of the year. Obviously, we didn't expect some of the activities that occurred. But fundamentally, you always see some very large activities from insurance companies because of the beginning of the year. So it's across the board and it's geographically diverse, too. So we think this is going to continue. But I must say, with where rates are at this moment, more and more clients are going to be looking for different types of expressions of exposure. I do believe with where rates are, it's going to lead to more and more clients searching things like infrastructure debt, other activities like that. And this is one of the reasons why we have so heavily invested in our infrastructure teams. We will continue to see clients reaching for yield and high yield, whether that's a good strategy or a bad strategy. I mean, I specifically believe rates are going to stay lower longer. And I think the activities that you're seeing in Europe, whether the court's approval of the OMT for the ECB and the greater possibility of QE from the ECB but continual easing in Japan. And importantly, as Chairwoman Yellen has said, she's going to be very data-dependent related to what the Federal Reserve does. So I actually believe this just creates more money in motion and more opportunity for BlackRock, especially with our flows."

And then more broadly as we think about margins, obviously not notwithstanding some of the seasonality that we have in our own margins especially in the first quarter, margins more broadly are dependent on lots of things, especially the beta environment, the future business mix, the various reinvestment opportunities that we see in our business and obviously the competitive compensation environment. So I don't -- our margin guidance really hasn't changed. As you know, we don't manage the business to a specific margin target, and we remain ever committed to generating operating leverage. We're also reinvesting in the business."

But let's step backwards again, why have we seen elevated pension closeouts? Because you've had significant rallies in U.S. equities over the last 5 years. Companies have been closer to meeting their liabilities. And they have a desire to minimize income statement volatility because of the issues related to the pension fund. So we are in dialogues with many people. Some of the firms have used annuities working with insurance companies. As you said, we are in dialogue with many organizations, some of the organizations are transforming their DB plans to DC. As I said, we're seeing elevated growth in our DC business in the fourth quarter, and we expect that in the first quarter. And we are having dialogues with many, many institutions worldwide about the possibility. But I would just caution that with rates being so low, unless you see significant equity rallies, it becomes a little harder to do that or the companies are going to have to infuse some type of money, making sure that they're matched. But I would say unquestionably, BlackRock's global platform, the ability of having our strength in target date and in terms of DC plans and having LifePath on the DC side, we have a lot of components in working with our clients, whether it's LDI products, which obviously will create a derisking. And obviously, we could help quite a bit in helping them think about how can a pension fund ultimately transfer some of the risk. But I don't want to call it unified across the board. I do believe depending on where each company is related to their reliability, and as you suggested quite correctly about the elongation of age, these are all big issues. We have actually had conversations with organizations that did LDI years ago, and now how do they factor in this is elongated aging process and are they properly matched. So the one thing is very clear to companies that have done the derisking. It is not a static, one-time event. They have to be constantly monitoring this, depending on how their liabilities are changing. And as I said earlier, we're very involved in these dialogues. And I do believe this plays really well with our global platform of having great analytics and helping companies think about it. A long period of time of being involved with insurance companies and doing a lot of liability matching type of products for insurance companies, that plays really well into LDI and other areas for us."

That's probably the -- that's the biggest, most recent type of dialogue. So the one area where we've done quite well is in the model-based equity. And we're still not seeing really any flows. But we have had now had 5 years of great success there. I do believe the traditional Fundamental Equity business is alive. It's not well, it had poor performances in industry, where I think that's what you're alluding to. We had seen great movement as an industry, movement out of maybe more of the fundamental investing into index. But I would say now, Bill, if you believe in a greater divergent market, a more volatile market, you would -- I have been asked many times, questions related, ""Should I be in an index product with that great divergent because I can't capture some of the great opportunities that could be masked by the great failures?"" So when you think about the energy market, if you think about an emerging market world context, China, India is going to be hugely benefited by this. Countries like Russia, Nigeria, potentially Brazil are going to be harmed by this. How do you play that? And so this is why more and more of our clients are asking about things about smart beta, factors. And so I do believe we're going to need to capture different ways of finding alpha. But importantly, in our actions related to Fundamental Equities, we have always said this is a 5-year project, 2015 begins the third year. We are committed to this. And if you do believe in the world of great divergence, if you believe in a world that one day you will have, whenever that day will be, higher rates, it generally mean -- historically, you would think this is a better environment for stock-picking and Fundamental Equities. So our model is purposely built and positioned to benefit in this active and passive world. But the one thing that I am going to be pretty loud about, I do believe the most neglected component of equity investing is basically model- or factor-based investing, where we have a great platform, we've had great return, especially overseas. And I am very bullish on building this out as a component of our active equity area. And I'm quite frustrated, to be frank, that we haven't seen the momentum that I would thought we would. But this is an area where in my most recent meetings last week in Asia, every client asked me about factor-based investing in a divergent world. And so we'll see how this plays out, Bill. But I do believe in this divergent world and the way we have built the model of BlackRock, we'll be a beneficiary of that."

And additionally, BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. 
So with that, let's begin the call. Gary?"
403413,280977127,746424,"BlackRock, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 15, 2015",2015-01-15,"Earnings Calls","BlackRock, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. My pleasure to be here to present our fourth quarter and full year 2014 as adjusted results. Overall, 2014 was another strong year for BlackRock's clients, shareholders and employees. We continue to drive share",1939,"Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. My pleasure to be here to present our fourth quarter and full year 2014 as adjusted results. Overall, 2014 was another strong year for BlackRock's clients, shareholders and employees. We continue to drive shareholder value by generating consistent organic growth, demonstrating the benefits of scale through operating leverage and systematically returning excess cash to our shareholders, even in an increasingly volatile macro environment. As Larry will discuss in more detail, our 2014 results highlight the stability and diversification of our business model and evidence the significant investments we've made in recent years to enhance the depth and breadth of our global platform. 
For the fourth quarter, BlackRock delivered earnings per share of $4.82 and operating income of $1.2 billion. Full year earnings per share of $19.34 was up 17% compared to 2013 and operating income of $4.6 billion was 13% higher. Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected a $2 million decrease in the market value of our seed and co-investments, down $63 million year-over-year, driven primarily by a reduced economic investment portfolio and lower gains from investments in our hedge funds and fund of funds vehicles. Our 25.4% as adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter benefited from $39 million of nonrecurring items. While we continue to estimate that 30% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for 2015, the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of additional nonrecurring items that arise during the year. 
BlackRock's fourth quarter results were driven by $88 billion of long-term net new business, our highest-ever quarterly net flows, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 8.3%. For the full year 2014, BlackRock generated total long-term net new business of $181 billion, representing an organic growth rate of 4.5%. Together with net flows from our cash management business, BlackRock generated over $200 billion of net inflows for the year. 
During 2014, we achieved organic asset growth of 11% in iShares, 11% in Retail and 1% in Institutional, in line with the growth targets we outlined at our June Investor Day. This resulted in organic-based fee growth in excess of organic AUM growth as we benefited from positive mix change associated with our faster-growing, higher fee Retail and iShares businesses. Equally important, net long-term flows were diversified by asset class and region with positive flows across all categories for both the quarter and the full year. 
Fourth quarter revenue was flat with the year ago as growth in base fees and revenue from BlackRock Solutions was offset by a decrease in performance fees. Full year revenue grew 9% from 2013, driven by growth in base fees and revenue from BlackRock Solutions, both of which reached record levels in 2014. Fourth quarter base fees rose 5% year-over-year as average AUM increased due to organic growth and market appreciation. However, base fees were down 3% compared to the third quarter due to a lower fourth quarter AUM entry rate, the continued impact of divergent beta and ongoing dollar appreciation against foreign currencies. While the S&P 500 was up 2% on average during the fourth quarter, the MSCI World was down 2% with emerging markets and natural resources indices lagging even further, down 8% and 12%, respectively. Such divergent beta impacts our financial results, as only 34% of our equity-based fees are generated in U.S. markets. In addition, ongoing dollar appreciation led to a $59 billion decline in long-term AUM in the quarter. 
Performance fees for the quarter were $144 million, driven by a broader suite of single-strategy hedge funds, real estate and hedge fund solutions offerings. Performance fees decreased $124 million from the fourth quarter of 2013, which included a large fee associated with the partial liquidation of a closed-end opportunistic fund. The decline also reflected relatively weaker performance across a variety of hedge fund products, in line with broader industry trends. 
BlackRock Solutions revenue of $170 million for the quarter was up 8% year-over-year and 3% sequentially due to increases in both Aladdin and FMA revenue. Our Aladdin business, which represented 75% of BlackRock Solutions' revenue in the quarter, grew 9% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. We completed a number of large global implementations in 2014 and expect continued business momentum from trends favoring global investment platform consolidation and multi-asset risk solutions. Our FMA business ended 2014 with $161 million in revenues. While revenues benefited from meaningful transaction-based disposition activity during the year, our business model remains well positioned to help clients navigate and implement requirements that tended [ph]  To CCAR and the new ECB Single Supervisory Mechanism. 
Total expense for the fourth quarter was flat year-over-year as increased direct fund expense was offset by decreased levels of G&A expense. Full year compensation expense increased $273 million or 8%, reflecting higher headcount and higher incentive compensation, driven by higher operating income. Importantly, our compensation to revenue ratio declined 30 basis points in 2014 to 34.2%, driven by continued reshaping of our employee base and the benefits of scale across our platform. Fourth quarter G&A expense decreased $23 million year-over-year or 6%, reflecting lower professional services and other G&A expense and various lease exit costs included in the fourth quarter of 2013. Sequentially, quarterly G&A expense increased $61 million, primarily due to volatility and FX remeasurement, the planned seasonal uptick in year-end marketing and promotional spend and closed-end fund launch costs associated with the $437 million BlackRock Science and Technology Trust. Overall, total expense for 2014 increased 6% from a year ago compared to a 9% increase in revenue over the same period, resulting in an as adjusted operating margin of 42.9% for the full year, a 150 basis point increase over 2013 levels. 
Since closing the BGI merger at the end of 2009, we have expanded our operating margin by over 450 basis points while also significantly reinvesting in our business. In line with that commitment, on November 5, BlackRock entered into an agreement to acquire certain assets of BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors, the external investment adviser to BlackRock Kelso Capital Corporation. This transaction enhances our fixed income platform through the addition of a middle-market private credit capability. Pending BDC shareholder approval, we expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2015. 
During 2014, we returned approximately $2.3 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and $1 billion in share repurchases, representing a total payout ratio of 71%. As we enter 2015, we remain committed to a predictable and balanced approach to capital management. Consistent with this, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $2.18 per share of common stock, representing an increase of 13% over the 2014 level. Since instituting a dividend in 2003, BlackRock has grown its dividend at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 22%. Our board has also authorized the company to repurchase an additional 6 million shares under our existing share repurchase program, giving us authorization to repurchase a total of 9.4 million shares, including 3.4 million shares, which are remaining under our prior program announced in January 2013. 
Our consistent earnings growth and stable financial results reflect the benefits of our differentiated global business model. Fourth quarter net flows were positive in both our active and index franchises as well as in each of our geographic regions with $62 billion from the Americas, $50 billion from EMEA and $11 billion from APAC. BlackRock's global Retail franchise saw long-term net inflows of $23 billion during the fourth quarter, bringing full year inflows to $55 billion, representing 11% organic growth for the full year. As usual, fourth quarter Retail flows reflect the seasonal impact of reinvested capital gains distributions. The fourth quarter U.S. Retail flows of $21 billion were driven by strong fixed income flows across a diverse set of products, including our top-performing Total Return and high-yield franchises and our flagship Strategic Income Opportunities Fund. SIO was the leading unconstrained bond fund in the fourth quarter with nearly $5 billion of quarterly net inflows. Our Multi-Asset Income Fund, or MAI, continued its momentum with nearly $2 billion of flows in the fourth quarter, making it the top multi-asset income fund in the industry ranked by 2014 flows.  
Fourth quarter international retail net inflows of $2 billion were driven by BlackRock's fixed income, multi-asset and index capabilities, which more than offset headwinds and ongoing outflows from our European Equities franchise. Global iShares generated over $44 billion of net new business in the fourth quarter and approximately $101 billion for the year, representing full year organic growth of 11%. iShares once again captured the #1 share of global ETF industry flows. During the fourth quarter, iShares' record fixed income flows were broadly diversified by asset class, duration and geography. We continue to aggressively target growth in the fixed income ETF market, and we're the global world leader in fixed income inflows in 2014. Fourth quarter equity iShares flows of $24 billion were driven by flows into the Core Series with particular demand for U.S. equity exposures. The core segment remains an important growth channel for iShares, posting on organic growth rate of 30% in 2014. 
Our institutional business generated approximately $21 billion in long-term net inflows for the quarter and $25 billion of net inflows for the year, representing the highest quarterly and annual institutional flows we've seen in the past 5 years. The investments we've made in our diverse global platform position us well to meet the ever-changing needs of a sophisticated institutional client base, and we expect this momentum to continue in 2015. 
Barbelling continues to be a key theme as institutional clients pair cost-effective beta exposure with alternatives and other high-conviction alpha solutions to achieve uncorrelated returns. We continue to see sizable asset allocation-driven flows both into and out of institutional index products, resulting in net inflows of $20 billion in the quarter. Institutional index equity flows were driven by clients looking to increase risk exposure while fixed income inflows reflected asset allocation decisions and solutions-based LDI activity. Institutional active net inflows were paced [ph] by positive flows into fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives. Fixed income net inflows of $3 billion were diversified across exposures, and we continued to see institutional demand for our unconstrained strategies. 
Multi-asset net inflows of $2 billion were highlighted by solutions-based wins as well as continued demand for our LifePath Target Date suite. Excluding approximately $600 million of returned client capital, institutional alternatives generated nearly $2 billion of net new business, led by hedge fund solutions and private equity solutions. In addition, we had another strong fund-raising quarter for illiquid alternatives, raising nearly $3 billion in new commitments, reflecting ongoing momentum in infrastructure debt and renewable power. Over the last 2 years, we've raised more than $12 billion in commitments and have nearly $9 billion of committed capital to deploy for clients. While return of capital impacts our net flows immediately, committed capital only translates into flows in AUM as those dollars are invested. 
Outflows from both Scientific and Fundamental Active Equities continued in the fourth quarter. Despite strong performance, client demand for Scientific Active Equity remains muted. Fundamental Active Equity outflows continued in products with historical performance issues. However, these flows were partially offset by select wins in categories where our new managers are building strong track records, including Large Cap Growth. 
In summary, in a year marked by periods of increased volatility, our diversified business continued to deliver solid and consistent financial results. We remain confident that our differentiated business model is well positioned to meet the needs of our clients and shareholders in the year to come. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. 2014 closed with heightened volatility due to political and social instability. And that volatility obviously is continuing today and in the new year. However, markets proved resilient in 2014, and the fourth quarter marked the eighth straight quarterly rise for the S&P 500 with that as suggesting a rebound for the U.S. economy. As Gary discussed, the U.S. equity markets outperformed emerging, European and Asian markets and certainly outperformed natural resource markets. And the U.S. dollar continued to appreciate relative to other currencies. This market divergence is likely to persist in 2015, creating both large challenges and large opportunities for our investors. 
Anemic global growth has led to an overdependence on politicians to implement reforms, to rebuild the global economies. But we've seen limited action globally from politicians. And as a result, we continue to rely on accommodative central bank policies, whether we're talking about Europe, China, Japan and even at this moment, even the United States. This will also put more pressure on the U.S. dollar, and it will rise higher, as well as a mixture of regional policies successes and failures, again increasing more global volatility. 
The technology revolution that most people always underestimate is so evident in the oil industry. And through this technology, the growth in supply of oil is outpacing demand, which has led to a period of volatile price discovery in the petroleum market with greater than a 50% drop in oil prices. This is leading to a global redistribution of wealth, which people underestimate how this is going to transform the world. With the high-cost energy production economies experiencing major headwinds, countries like the U.S., like China, like India, will be seeing huge benefits in stimulus. And countries that have seen currency devaluations, such as Europe in recent months, will experience only modest and moderate gains. We see more shocks at production decisions and the demand-side equilibrium. But overall, this oil price movement should be of great benefit for the global economy.  
With a backdrop of divergent market performance, volatility, regulatory reform, persistent low rates, our clients' near- and long-term investment challenges are becoming more complex. But our goals at BlackRock steadfastly remain the same. We are a fiduciary, and BlackRock is well positioned to address our clients' needs and deliver return for our shareholders in all market environments. The combination of our global multi-asset platform, our insight and thought leadership and Aladdin, our unified technology and risk management platform, has resulted in a more deeper client interactions than we have ever seen before. It has also enabled our investment team to collaborate ahead of key macro events to both protect assets and, in most cases, generate alpha for our clients. 
In the fourth quarter, BlackRock generated $88 billion of long-term net inflows, the strongest quarterly long-term flows in our history. And for the full year, BlackRock saw long-term net inflows of $141 billion. And together with the net flows from our cash management business, we generated more than $200 billion in net inflows in 2014. But I want to emphasize one important thing, it's not about the magnitude or the scale of the assets that we raised, but I want to emphasize the composition of the flows, which we believe is much more important. 
For the year, we saw $35 billion in active and $146 billion in index flows. We saw $52 billion in equities. We saw $96 billion in fixed income, $29 billion of flows in multi-asset and $4 billion in alternatives, where we had -- where we've put the money to use. We saw $55 billion of flows in retail, $101 billion of flows in iShares and $25 billion of flows institutionally. And we saw these flows in all regions, from all investor types, and importantly, in the face of wide range of economic and investment conditions. One thing I'd like to highlight is there were more than -- there were 13 countries where we had net inflows of excess of $1 billion in 2014. We now manage assets in excess of $1 billion for clients domiciled in over -- in 41 countries, demonstrating the increasingly global and differentiating nature of the BlackRock platform. In addition, we added our first Aladdin client base in Latin America and now have clients actively using the Aladdin system in 47 countries around the world. 
As the nature of our clients' investment challenges change, so does the nature of the solutions they require. More and more, a single investment product, asset class or style does not provide a sufficient long-term solution. BlackRock's business model, which was deliberately built to deliver a multifaceted solution to clients, and BlackRock's ability to leverage these capabilities across our truly diverse global platform of active and index, equities, fixed income, multi-asset and alternative strategies, all backed by Aladdin analytics and risk management, has resulted in continued organic growth and revenue growth for the firm. 
BlackRock saw 27 distinct retail and iShares products each generating more than $1 billion of net flows in the fourth quarter. For the year, 56 individual retail and iShares products generated more than $1 billion of net flows compared to 43 such products in 2013. The breadth of our platform is resonating with clients as they continue to seek a diverse set of global investment solutions. As Gary mentioned, we made significant long-term investments over the past few years in our people, our process and our platform. And those dividends and those investments have paid off in 2014. And I strongly believe this will continue to differentiate BlackRock over time in an increasingly competitive industry. 
The strength of BlackRock's fixed income business is an area where past investments are translating into differentiating results for our clients and for our firm. BlackRock was built on a foundation of superior fixed income performance, and now we have 91% of our active taxable fixed income platform outperforming the benchmarks or peers for the 3-year period. And no single category was the primary driver of the $96 billion in flows we gathered this year. Active and index flows were diversified across high yield, unconstrained and core bond offerings and positive across all client businesses. And we saw several key buy list adds across categories in 2014. Our flagship Strategic Income Opportunities Fund, or SIO, raised more than $13 billion in 2014, and we now manage more than $31 billion across our unconstrained fixed income franchise for both retail and institutional clients. 
BlackRock saw increased client interest in our Total Return Fund, which is in the top 3% of our peer group for 1 year, for 3 years and for 5 years. Total Return generated $2 billion of net inflows in the quarter and represents a meaningful long-term opportunity for us. Fixed income is also a core strategic priority for BlackRock's iShares, which led the industry in fixed income ETF flows for the quarter and for the year, driven by iShares constituting 15 of the top 25 fixed income ETFs by net flows in 2014. Assets across classes, BlackRock's iShares franchise, as I said earlier, generated more than $100 billion in net flows this year and was the industry leader in flows in the United States, in flows in Europe and in flows globally. We continue to focus on growing global iShares market share and driving global market expansion, and we expect client and product segmentation to drive the next wave of our iShares growth. 
We saw a $32 billion in flows in our global Core Series in 2014 as buy-and-hold investors are increasingly turning to iShares for efficiently constructing larger portions of their portfolio. iShares are used as financial instruments where ETFs are providing a compelling alternative to individual securities, to swaps, to futures. And we're seeing a strong initial progress in this newly formed area of the marketplace. And clients are also using iShares as precision exposures to express targeted investment viewpoints to generate alpha with efficiency. 
In the fourth quarter, BlackRock kicked off iThinking, an innovative new initiative designed to help distill market insight into clear, actionable ideas for our clients and matching them with different iShares solutions. We continued to be product innovation -- it was evident in December, when we launched our CRBN or our Low Carbon Targeted ETF, designed for individuals and institutions who are focusing on environmental sustainable activity. The United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund and the University System of Maryland Foundation provided the initial funding for this ETF. And BlackRock now manages more than $250 billion in socially responsible strategies across our global platform. 
2014 was a turning point for our institutional business, and as we enter 2015 with substantial momentum. Our scale and our global presence enables BlackRock to interact with our increasingly sophisticated client base in a highly specialized manner, and our Financial Institutions Group business is a great example. In 2014 BlackRock was selected to manage mandates spanning multi-asset, fixed income, infrastructure debt and full balance sheet outsourcing for global insurance clients, driven by regulatory changes, by M&A and investors who are looking for better ways to navigate in this low interest rate environment. 
In conjunction with asset management mandates, many of these clients also chose to partner with BlackRock and Aladdin on evaluation, on risk and advisory services and even acquisition support through our BlackRock Solutions business. BlackRock is the only firm in the industry that can bring all of these components together to meet the needs of our clients, and we do this in a dedicated -- with dedicated relationships and with investment teams who speak with our clients in their own language. We understand their industry and we can partner with them to create their needs to provide the most proper solutions to their issues. 
Another area where we are creating tailored outcomes is in the alternative space, particularly in the emerging alternative solution business, where BlackRock is building a holistic, multidimensional solution portfolio that leverages our full global platform. We've seen strong fund-raising across our illiquid alternative product set as the targeted strategy we laid out on our Investor Day unfolds. BlackRock raised nearly $6 billion in new commitments in 2014 across a variety of strategies, including private equity, hedge fund solutions, opportunistic credit, renewable power and infrastructure debt. We recently completed our annual institutional clients rebalancing survey, which indicated that institutions are looking to significantly increase allocations to real estate, including infrastructure. 
In the fourth quarter, BlackRock closed our second renewable power infrastructure fund, positioning us as one of the leading global renewable platforms in the industry. 2014, BlackRock raised commitments of nearly $800 million in renewable power and $1 billion in infrastructure debt. Momentum in this space demonstrates BlackRock's proprietary transaction sourcing capabilities and ability to act as an extension of our clients' internal teams. The tangible impact of the investments made to date in our renewable power fund is also being felt by providing energy and electricity to more than 100,000 households. 
We continue to make progress on the reinvigoration and globalization of our Fundamental Active Equity business and have seen meaningful impact on the performance for some of our clients. We've seen a major improvement in the performance of our U.K. equity strategies. We generated top quartile performance as we hit our 3-year anniversary in our new management team in Asian equities. And our European equity strategy has posted leading market share and solid broad-based 3- and 5-year investment performance. 
The most recent leg of our investments in this area was focused on U.S. equities. We hired a world-class group of investors with strong processes and track records for generating alpha. We're now in our second year of the investment and seeing good progress. And hopefully, we will improve on our investment performance, although we have a lot of work to do, and quite frankly we're not at the space where I would like to be at this moment. 2014 was a challenging year for active managers with only 20% of the industry U.S. active equity funds outperformed their benchmarks. We saw a significant rise in volatility in the fourth quarter, but it was encouraging to see many of our active teams deliver stronger performances in the environment, especially in December. Our basic value strategy achieved top quintile performance since the new manager inception. Our large cap series strategy has improved from a second -- to a second quartile from a fourth quartile. And our U.S. opportunity strategy is in the top quintile over 3 years. 
While our active business continues to feel the impact of clients balancing high-conviction alpha strategies now with index exposures, the breadth and diversity of our platform and the presence of the only scale player in both active and index around the world will differentiate us in the ability to give our clients the full menu of solutions they need. We expect investor preference to vary over time. And BlackRock's ability to evolve alongside our clients is critical in the future for our success. 
Before I open it up for questions, I would like to take a moment to thank our employees for their hard work, incredible dedication in 2014 in helping our clients in the most complex investment challenges in the world by helping them to provide solutions. I'd like to thank my entire management team, many of them who are thriving in their new role following successful organizational changes earlier this year. And I'd like to recognize some of the milestones that BlackRock achieved in 2014. In retail, we crossed over $500 billion in assets under management. In iShares in 2014, we closed with more than $1 trillion in assets under management. In institutional, we garnered the best flows that we've seen in over 5 years. Since the financial crisis, or essentially since the end of 2007, the final year of the pre-crisis earnings, BlackRock has grown EPS by 142% versus the S&P 500 growing at 76% and the S&P Financial Index growing at only 9%, highlighting both the differentiation of our business model and our ability to execute on key growth strategies. 
All of the areas I've spoken about, whether it's fixed income, iShares, our Financial Institutions Group, alternatives, infrastructure, our active equity platform, all are areas where we made significant strategic investments over time, and we'll be seeing the impact of those investments over time to our shareholders and to our clients. We will continue to make investments in BlackRock's future and keep very high margins and utilize a full scale of our Aladdin risk management and technology capabilities to meet our fiduciary duties to our clients and to deliver returns for shareholders in 2015. 
With that, operator, let's open it up for questions."

We are still in the early stages, not only of institutions using the product but retail using the product as well. So there are 3 segments. There is a buy-and-hold segment, where people are using ETFs as a part of their fixed income portfolio for the beta and fixed income. And we have products that are focused on that. The second thing is that, as the financial markets change, ETFs are a surrogate for many financial instruments that have, because of regulatory reasons and liquidity reasons, become very expensive. And they are surrogates, for example, in swaps and futures, where ETFs are now being used, in fact, more than futures are being used. And as people learn about that, they add that into their portfolios. On the other side of that, they are also being used as we call it, precision instruments, where people are looking for a specific allocation and ETFs provide that specific precision tool for them to be invested in. So this is just the beginning of where fixed income ETFs go. And as you know, the fixed income markets are much larger than the equity markets are. So we just see continued growth in that. So for retail, we're attacking that by adding on to our Core Series, where we are adding products that can offer the full suite to what a retail investor would need over the long term in ETFs, whether that be in high yield, in corporates, in treasuries or just generic fixed income. And then on institutions, because they're looking for more of a trading vehicle, and they're looking for the transparency and they're looking for the liquidity, we're adding more specific-type of precision instruments for them. So I would tell you that the demand to learn about ETFs grows and grows, and we're just -- we just think this is a market that we're very positive on going forward. And also for portfolio managers that are managing large portfolios, getting the beta exposure from ETFs is cheaper, it's more diversified and it's more liquid than the alternative. And I might add that's really important when you're in a low interest rate environment like we're in. So we look forward to more growth in the fixed income and to be the leader in the ETFs in that area."

We are seeing -- I think much of it has to do with the continuation of performance that we have generated with some top decile performance in our core business, our leading performance in our unconstrained fixed income, our top quartile, maybe top decile, performance in high yield. So across the board, the performance in all the different fixed income products continues to be quite large. And we are seeing more and more clients who are just also using beta products for fixed income. So across the board, we are seeing that. But in terms of where we are seeing clients looking to put more money to work, we are seeing increased activity in the client contribution area, where we've had some rather substantial wins. We continue to see in terms of insurance companies, always at the beginning of the year, they get big infusions of cash. This is one of the fundamental reasons why we thought that rates would be going down in the first part of the year. Obviously, we didn't expect some of the activities that occurred. But fundamentally, you always see some very large activities from insurance companies because of the beginning of the year. So it's across the board, and it's geographically diverse, too. So we think this is going to continue. But I must say, with where rates are at this moment, more and more clients are going to be looking for different types of expressions of exposure. I do believe with where rates are, it's going to lead to more and more clients searching things like infrastructure debt, other activities like that. And this is one of the reasons why we have so heavily invested in our infrastructure teams. We will continue to see clients reaching for yield and high yield, whether that's a good strategy or a bad strategy. I mean, I specifically believe rates are going to stay lower longer. And I think the activities that you're seeing in Europe, whether the court's approval of the OMT for the ECB and the greater possibility of QE from the ECB but continual easing in Japan. And importantly, as Chairwoman Yellen has said, she's going to be very data-dependent related to what the Federal Reserve does. So I actually believe this just creates more money in motion and more opportunity for BlackRock, especially with our flows."

And then more broadly as we think about margins, obviously notwithstanding some of the seasonality that we have in our own margins especially in the first quarter, margins more broadly are dependent on lots of things, especially the beta environment, the future business mix, the various reinvestment opportunities that we see in our business and obviously the competitive compensation environment. So I don't -- our margin guidance really hasn't changed. As you know, we don't manage the business to a specific margin target. And we remain ever committed to generating operating leverage.

And so we are embracing the concept of a better financial ecosystem for our clients. And if that means greater disclosure, greater transparency, we will embrace that.

But let's step back for a second. Why have we seen elevated pension closeouts? Because you've had significant rallies in U.S. equities over the last 5 years. Companies have been closer to meeting their liabilities. And they have a desire to minimize income statement volatility because of the issues related to the pension fund. So we are in dialogues with many people. Some of the firms have used annuities, working with insurance companies. As you said, we are in dialogue with many organizations, some of the organizations are transforming their DB plans to DC. As I said, we're seeing elevated growth in our DC business in the fourth quarter, and we expect that in the first quarter. And we are having dialogues with many, many institutions worldwide about the possibility. But I would just caution that with rates being so low, unless you see significant equity rallies, it becomes a little harder to do that or the companies are going to have to infuse some type of money, making sure that they're matched. But I would say unquestionably, BlackRock's global platform, the ability of having our strength in target date and in terms of DC plans and having LifePath on the DC side, we have a lot of components in working with our clients, whether it's LDI products, which obviously will create a derisking. And obviously, we could help quite a bit in helping them think about how can a pension fund ultimately transfer some of the risk. But I don't want to call it unified across the board. I do believe depending on where each company is related to their reliability, and as you suggested quite correctly about the elongation of age, these are all big issues. We have actually had conversations with organizations that did LDI years ago, and now how do they factor in this elongated aging process, and are they properly matched? So the one thing that is very clear to companies that have done the derisking: It is not a static, one-time event. They have to be constantly monitoring this, depending on how their liabilities are changing. And as I said earlier, we're very involved in these dialogues. And I do believe this plays really well with our global platform of having great analytics and helping companies think about it. A long period of time of being involved with insurance companies and doing a lot of liability-matching type of products for insurance companies, that plays really well into LDI and other areas for us."

That's probably the -- that's the biggest, most recent type of dialogue. So the one area where we've done quite well is in the model-based equity. And we're still not seeing really any flows. But we have had now had 5 years of great success there. I do believe the traditional Fundamental Equity business is alive. It's not well, it had poor performances in the industry, I think that's what you're alluding to. We have seen great movement as an industry, movement out of maybe more of the fundamental investing into index. But I would say now, Bill, if you believe in a greater divergent market, a more volatile market, you would -- I have been asked many times, questions related, ""Should I be in an index product with a great divergent? Because I can't capture some of the great opportunities, they're going to be masked by the great failures."" So when you think about the energy market, if you think about an emerging market world context, a China, India is going to be hugely benefited by this. Countries like Russia, Nigeria, potentially Brazil are going to be harmed by this. How do you play that? And so this is why more and more of our clients are asking about things about smart beta, factors. And so I do believe we're going to need to capture different ways of finding alpha. But importantly, in our actions related to Fundamental Equities, we have always said this is a 5-year project, 2015 begins the third year. We are committed to this. And if you do believe in the world of great divergence, if you believe in a world that one day you will have, whenever that day will be, higher rates, it generally mean -- historically, you would think this is a better environment for stock-picking and Fundamental Equities. So our model is purposely built and positioned to benefit in this active and passive world. But the one thing that I am going to be pretty loud about, I do believe the most neglected component of equity investing is basically model- or factor-based investing, where we have a great platform, we've had great returns, especially overseas. And I am very bullish on building this out as a component of our active equity area. And I'm quite frustrated, to be frank, that we haven't seen the momentum that I would have thought we would. But this is an area where in my most recent meetings last week in Asia, every client asked me about factor-based investing in a divergent world. And so we'll see how this plays out, Bill. But I do believe in this divergent world and the way we have built the model of BlackRock, we'll be a beneficiary of that."

My pleasure to be here to present our fourth quarter and full year 2014 as adjusted results. Overall, 2014 was another strong year for BlackRock's clients, shareholders and employees. We continue to drive share",1939,"Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. My pleasure to be here to present our fourth quarter and full year 2014 as adjusted results. Overall, 2014 was another strong year for BlackRock's clients, shareholders and employees. We continue to drive shareholder value by generating consistent organic growth, demonstrating the benefits of scale through operating leverage and systematically returning excess cash to our shareholders, even in an increasingly volatile macro environment. As Larry will discuss in more detail, our 2014 results highlight the stability and diversification of our business model and evidence the significant investments we've made in recent years to enhance the depth and breadth of our global platform. 
For the fourth quarter, BlackRock delivered earnings per share of $4.82 and operating income of $1.2 billion. Full year earnings per share of $19.34 was up 17% compared to 2013 and operating income of $4.6 billion was 13% higher. Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected a $2 million decrease in the market value of our seed and co-investments, down $63 million year-over-year, driven primarily by a reduced economic investment portfolio and lower gains from investments in our hedge funds and fund of funds vehicles. Our 25.4% as adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter benefited from $39 million of nonrecurring items. While we continue to estimate that 30% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for 2015, the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of additional nonrecurring items that arise during the year. 
BlackRock's fourth quarter results were driven by $88 billion of long-term net new business, our highest-ever quarterly net flows, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 8.3%. For the full year 2014, BlackRock generated total long-term net new business of $181 billion, representing an organic growth rate of 4.5%. Together with net flows from our cash management business, BlackRock generated over $200 billion of net inflows for the year. 
During 2014, we achieved organic asset growth of 11% in iShares, 11% in retail and 1% in institutional, in line with the growth targets we outlined at our June Investor Day. This resulted in organic-based fee growth in excess of organic AUM growth as we benefited from positive mix change associated with our faster-growing, higher fee retail and iShares businesses. Equally important, net long-term flows were diversified by asset class and region with positive flows across all categories for both the quarter and the full year. 
Fourth quarter revenue was flat with the year ago as growth in base fees and revenue from BlackRock Solutions was offset by a decrease in performance fees. Full year revenue grew 9% from 2013, driven by growth in base fees and revenue from BlackRock Solutions, both of which reached record levels in 2014. Fourth quarter base fees rose 5% year-over-year as average AUM increased due to organic growth and market appreciation. However, base fees were down 3% compared to the third quarter due to a lower fourth quarter AUM entry rate, the continued impact of divergent beta and ongoing dollar appreciation against foreign currencies. While the S&P 500 was up 2% on average during the fourth quarter, the MSCI World was down 2% with emerging markets and natural resources indices lagging even further, down 8% and 12%, respectively. Such divergent beta impacts our financial results, as only 34% of our equity-based fees are generated in U.S. markets. In addition, ongoing dollar appreciation led to a $59 billion decline in long-term AUM in the quarter. 
Performance fees for the quarter were $144 million, driven by a broader suite of single-strategy hedge funds, real estate and hedge fund solutions offerings. Performance fees decreased $124 million from the fourth quarter of 2013, which included a large fee associated with the partial liquidation of a closed-end opportunistic fund. The decline also reflected relatively weaker performance across a variety of hedge fund products, in line with broader industry trends. 
BlackRock Solutions revenue of $170 million for the quarter was up 8% year-over-year and 3% sequentially due to increases in both Aladdin and FMA revenue. Our Aladdin business, which represented 75% of BlackRock Solutions' revenue in the quarter, grew 9% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. We completed a number of large global implementations in 2014 and expect continued business momentum from trends favoring global investment platform consolidation and multi-asset risk solutions. Our FMA business ended 2014 with $161 million in revenues. While revenues benefited from meaningful transaction-based disposition activity during the year, our business model remains well positioned to help clients navigate and implement requirements that tended [ph] to CCAR and the new ECB Single Supervisory Mechanism. 
Total expense for the fourth quarter was flat year-over-year as increased direct fund expense was offset by decreased levels of G&A expense. Full year compensation expense increased $273 million or 8%, reflecting higher headcount and higher incentive compensation, driven by higher operating income. Importantly, our compensation to revenue ratio declined 30 basis points in 2014 to 34.2%, driven by continued reshaping of our employee base and the benefits of scale across our platform. Fourth quarter G&A expense decreased $23 million year-over-year or 6%, reflecting lower professional services and other G&A expense and various lease exit costs included in the fourth quarter of 2013. Sequentially, quarterly G&A expense increased $61 million, primarily due to volatility and FX remeasurement, the planned seasonal uptick in year-end marketing and promotional spend and closed-end fund launch costs associated with the $437 million BlackRock Science and Technology Trust. Overall, total expense for 2014 increased 6% from a year ago compared to a 9% increase in revenue over the same period, resulting in an as adjusted operating margin of 42.9% for the full year, a 150 basis point increase over 2013 levels. 
Since closing the BGI merger at the end of 2009, we have expanded our operating margin by over 450 basis points while also significantly reinvesting in our business. In line with that commitment, on November 5, BlackRock entered into an agreement to acquire certain assets of BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors, the external investment adviser to BlackRock Kelso Capital Corporation. This transaction enhances our fixed income platform through the addition of a middle-market private credit capability. Pending BDC shareholder approval, we expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2015. 
During 2014, we returned approximately $2.3 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and $1 billion in share repurchases, representing a total payout ratio of 71%. As we enter 2015, we remain committed to a predictable and balanced approach to capital management. Consistent with this, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $2.18 per share of common stock, representing an increase of 13% over the 2014 level. Since instituting a dividend in 2003, BlackRock has grown its dividend at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 22%. Our board has also authorized the company to repurchase an additional 6 million shares under our existing share repurchase program, giving us authorization to repurchase a total of 9.4 million shares, including 3.4 million shares, which are remaining under our prior program announced in January 2013. 
Our consistent earnings growth and stable financial results reflect the benefits of our differentiated global business model. Fourth quarter net flows were positive in both our active and index franchises as well as in each of our geographic regions with $62 billion from the Americas, $50 billion from EMEA and $11 billion from APAC. BlackRock's global retail franchise saw long-term net inflows of $23 billion during the fourth quarter, bringing full year inflows to $55 billion, representing 11% organic growth for the full year. As usual, fourth quarter retail flows reflect the seasonal impact of reinvested capital gains distributions. The fourth quarter U.S. retail flows of $21 billion were driven by strong fixed income flows across a diverse set of products, including our top-performing Total Return and high-yield franchises and our flagship Strategic Income Opportunities Fund. SIO was the leading unconstrained bond fund in the fourth quarter with nearly $5 billion of quarterly net inflows. Our Multi-Asset Income Fund, or MAI, continued its momentum with nearly $2 billion of flows in the fourth quarter, making it the top multi-asset income fund in the industry ranked by 2014 flows. 
Fourth quarter international retail net inflows of $2 billion were driven by BlackRock's fixed income, multi-asset and index capabilities, which more than offset headwinds and ongoing outflows from our European Equities franchise. Global iShares generated over $44 billion of net new business in the fourth quarter and approximately $101 billion for the year, representing full year organic growth of 11%. iShares once again captured the #1 share of global ETF industry flows. During the fourth quarter, iShares' record fixed income flows were broadly diversified by asset class, duration and geography. We continue to aggressively target growth in the fixed income ETF market, and we're the global world leader in fixed income inflows in 2014. Fourth quarter equity iShares flows of $24 billion were driven by flows into the Core Series with particular demand for U.S. equity exposures. The core segment remains an important growth channel for iShares, posting on organic growth rate of 30% in 2014. 
Our institutional business generated approximately $21 billion in long-term net inflows for the quarter and $25 billion of net inflows for the year, representing the highest quarterly and annual institutional flows we've seen in the past 5 years. The investments we've made in our diverse global platform position us well to meet the ever-changing needs of a sophisticated institutional client base, and we expect this momentum to continue in 2015. 
Barbelling continues to be a key theme as institutional clients pair cost-effective beta exposure with alternatives and other high-conviction alpha solutions to achieve uncorrelated returns. We continue to see sizable asset allocation-driven flows both into and out of institutional index products, resulting in net inflows of $20 billion in the quarter. Institutional index equity flows were driven by clients looking to increase risk exposure while fixed income inflows reflected asset allocation decisions and solutions-based LDI activity. Institutional active net inflows were paced [ph] by positive flows into fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives. Fixed income net inflows of $3 billion were diversified across exposures, and we continued to see institutional demand for our unconstrained strategies. 
Multi-asset net inflows of $2 billion were highlighted by solutions-based wins as well as continued demand for our LifePath Target Date suite. Excluding approximately $600 million of returned client capital, institutional alternatives generated nearly $2 billion of net new business, led by hedge fund solutions and private equity solutions. In addition, we had another strong fund-raising quarter for illiquid alternatives, raising nearly $3 billion in new commitments, reflecting ongoing momentum in infrastructure debt and renewable power. Over the last 2 years, we've raised more than $12 billion in commitments and have nearly $9 billion of committed capital to deploy for clients. While return of capital impacts our net flows immediately, committed capital only translates into flows in AUM as those dollars are invested. 
Outflows from both Scientific and Fundamental Active Equities continued in the fourth quarter. Despite strong performance, client demand for Scientific Active Equity remains muted. Fundamental Active Equity outflows continued in products with historical performance issues. However, these flows were partially offset by select wins in categories where our new managers are building strong track records, including Large Cap Growth. 
In summary, in a year marked by periods of increased volatility, our diversified business continued to deliver solid and consistent financial results. We remain confident that our differentiated business model is well positioned to meet the needs of our clients and shareholders in the year to come. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. 2014 closed with heightened volatility due to political and social instability. And that volatility obviously is continuing today and in the new year. However, markets proved resilient in 2014, and the fourth quarter marked the eighth straight quarterly rise for the S&P 500 with that as suggesting a rebound for the U.S. economy. As Gary discussed, the U.S. equity markets outperformed emerging, European and Asian markets and certainly outperformed natural resource markets. And the U.S. dollar continued to appreciate relative to other currencies. This market divergence is likely to persist in 2015, creating both large challenges and large opportunities for our investors. 
Anemic global growth has led to an overdependence on politicians to implement reforms, to rebuild the global economies. But we've seen limited action globally from politicians. And as a result, we continue to rely on accommodative central bank policies, whether we're talking about Europe, China, Japan and even at this moment, even the United States. This will also put more pressure on the U.S. dollar, and it will rise higher, as well as a mixture of regional policies successes and failures, again increasing more global volatility. 
The technology revolution that most people always underestimate is so evident in the oil industry. And through this technology, the growth in supply of oil is outpacing demand, which has led to a period of volatile price discovery in the petroleum market with greater than a 50% drop in oil prices. This is leading to a global redistribution of wealth, which people underestimate how this is going to transform the world. With the high-cost energy production economies experiencing major headwinds, countries like the U.S., like China, like India, will be seeing huge benefits in stimulus. And countries that have seen currency devaluations, such as Europe in recent months, will experience only modest and moderate gains. We see more shocks at production decisions and the demand-side equilibrium. But overall, this oil price movement should be of great benefit for the global economy. 
With a backdrop of divergent market performance, volatility, regulatory reform, persistent low rates, our clients' near- and long-term investment challenges are becoming more complex. But our goals at BlackRock steadfastly remain the same. We are a fiduciary, and BlackRock is well positioned to address our clients' needs and deliver return for our shareholders in all market environments. The combination of our global multi-asset platform, our insight and thought leadership and Aladdin, our unified technology and risk management platform, has resulted in a more deeper client interactions than we have ever seen before. It has also enabled our investment team to collaborate ahead of key macro events to both protect assets and, in most cases, generate alpha for our clients. 
In the fourth quarter, BlackRock generated $88 billion of long-term net inflows, the strongest quarterly long-term flows in our history. And for the full year, BlackRock saw long-term net inflows of $141 billion. And together with the net flows from our cash management business, we generated more than $200 billion in net inflows in 2014. But I want to emphasize one important thing, it's not about the magnitude or the scale of the assets that we raised, but I want to emphasize the composition of the flows, which we believe is much more important. 
For the year, we saw $35 billion in active and $146 billion in index flows. We saw $52 billion in equities. We saw $96 billion in fixed income, $29 billion of flows in multi-asset and $4 billion in alternatives, where we had -- where we've put the money to use. We saw $55 billion of flows in retail, $101 billion of flows in iShares and $25 billion of flows institutionally. And we saw these flows in all regions, from all investor types, and importantly, in the face of wide range of economic and investment conditions. One thing I'd like to highlight is there were more than -- there were 13 countries where we had net inflows of excess of $1 billion in 2014. We now manage assets in excess of $1 billion for clients domiciled in over -- in 41 countries, demonstrating the increasingly global and differentiating nature of the BlackRock platform. In addition, we added our first Aladdin client base in Latin America and now have clients actively using the Aladdin system in 47 countries around the world. 
As the nature of our clients' investment challenges change, so does the nature of the solutions they require. More and more, a single investment product, asset class or style does not provide a sufficient long-term solution. BlackRock's business model, which was deliberately built to deliver a multifaceted solution to clients, and BlackRock's ability to leverage these capabilities across our truly diverse global platform of active and index, equities, fixed income, multi-asset and alternative strategies, all backed by Aladdin analytics and risk management, has resulted in continued organic growth and revenue growth for the firm. 
BlackRock saw 27 distinct retail and iShares products each generating more than $1 billion of net flows in the fourth quarter. For the year, 56 individual retail and iShares products generated more than $1 billion of net flows compared to 43 such products in 2013. The breadth of our platform is resonating with clients as they continue to seek a diverse set of global investment solutions. As Gary mentioned, we made significant long-term investments over the past few years in our people, our process and our platform. And those dividends and those investments have paid off in 2014. And I strongly believe this will continue to differentiate BlackRock over time in an increasingly competitive industry. 
The strength of BlackRock's fixed income business is an area where past investments are translating into differentiating results for our clients and for our firm. BlackRock was built on a foundation of superior fixed income performance, and now we have 91% of our active taxable fixed income platform outperforming the benchmarks or peers for the 3-year period. And no single category was the primary driver of the $96 billion in flows we gathered this year. Active and index flows were diversified across high yield, unconstrained and core bond offerings and positive across all client businesses. And we saw several key buy list adds across categories in 2014. Our flagship Strategic Income Opportunities Fund, or SIO, raised more than $13 billion in 2014, and we now manage more than $31 billion across our unconstrained fixed income franchise for both retail and institutional clients. 
BlackRock saw increased client interest in our Total Return Fund, which is in the top 3% of our peer group for 1 year, for 3 years and for 5 years. Total Return generated $2 billion of net inflows in the quarter and represents a meaningful long-term opportunity for us. Fixed income is also a core strategic priority for BlackRock's iShares, which led the industry in fixed income ETF flows for the quarter and for the year, driven by iShares constituting 15 of the top 25 fixed income ETFs by net flows in 2014. Assets across classes, BlackRock's iShares franchise, as I said earlier, generated more than $100 billion in net flows this year and was the industry leader in flows in the United States, in flows in Europe and in flows globally. We continue to focus on growing global iShares market share and driving global market expansion, and we expect client and product segmentation to drive the next wave of our iShares growth. 
We saw a $32 billion in flows in our global Core Series in 2014 as buy-and-hold investors are increasingly turning to iShares for efficiently constructing larger portions of their portfolio. iShares are used as financial instruments where ETFs are providing a compelling alternative to individual securities, to swaps, to futures. And we're seeing a strong initial progress in this newly formed area of the marketplace. And clients are also using iShares as precision exposures to express targeted investment viewpoints to generate alpha with efficiency. 
In the fourth quarter, BlackRock kicked off iThinking, an innovative new initiative designed to help distill market insight into clear, actionable ideas for our clients and matching them with different iShares solutions. We continued to be product innovation -- it was evident in December, when we launched our CRBN or our Low Carbon Targeted ETF, designed for individuals and institutions who are focusing on environmental sustainable activity. The United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund and the University System of Maryland Foundation provided the initial funding for this ETF. And BlackRock now manages more than $250 billion in socially responsible strategies across our global platform. 
2014 was a turning point for our institutional business, and as we enter 2015 with substantial momentum. Our scale and our global presence enables BlackRock to interact with our increasingly sophisticated client base in a highly specialized manner, and our Financial Institutions Group business is a great example. In 2014 BlackRock was selected to manage mandates spanning multi-asset, fixed income, infrastructure debt and full balance sheet outsourcing for global insurance clients, driven by regulatory changes, by M&A and investors who are looking for better ways to navigate in this low interest rate environment. 
In conjunction with asset management mandates, many of these clients also chose to partner with BlackRock and Aladdin on evaluation, on risk and advisory services and even acquisition support through our BlackRock Solutions business. BlackRock is the only firm in the industry that can bring all of these components together to meet the needs of our clients, and we do this in a dedicated -- with dedicated relationships and with investment teams who speak with our clients in their own language. We understand their industry and we can partner with them to create their needs to provide the most proper solutions to their issues. 
Another area where we are creating tailored outcomes is in the alternative space, particularly in the emerging alternative solution business, where BlackRock is building a holistic, multidimensional solution portfolio that leverages our full global platform. We've seen strong fund-raising across our illiquid alternative product set as the targeted strategy we laid out on our Investor Day unfolds. BlackRock raised nearly $6 billion in new commitments in 2014 across a variety of strategies, including private equity, hedge fund solutions, opportunistic credit, renewable power and infrastructure debt. We recently completed our annual institutional clients rebalancing survey, which indicated that institutions are looking to significantly increase allocations to real estate, including infrastructure. 
In the fourth quarter, BlackRock closed our second renewable power infrastructure fund, positioning us as one of the leading global renewable platforms in the industry. 2014, BlackRock raised commitments of nearly $800 million in renewable power and $1 billion in infrastructure debt. Momentum in this space demonstrates BlackRock's proprietary transaction sourcing capabilities and ability to act as an extension of our clients' internal teams. The tangible impact of the investments made to date in our renewable power fund is also being felt by providing energy and electricity to more than 100,000 households. 
We continue to make progress on the reinvigoration and globalization of our Fundamental Active Equity business and have seen meaningful impact on the performance for some of our clients. We've seen a major improvement in the performance of our U.K. equity strategies. We generated top quartile performance as we hit our 3-year anniversary in our new management team in Asian equities. And our European equity strategy has posted leading market share and solid broad-based 3- and 5-year investment performance. 
The most recent leg of our investments in this area was focused on U.S. equities. We hired a world-class group of investors with strong processes and track records for generating alpha. We're now in our second year of the investment and seeing good progress. And hopefully, we will improve on our investment performance, although we have a lot of work to do, and quite frankly we're not at the space where I would like to be at this moment. 2014 was a challenging year for active managers with only 20% of the industry U.S. active equity funds outperformed their benchmarks. We saw a significant rise in volatility in the fourth quarter, but it was encouraging to see many of our active teams deliver stronger performances in the environment, especially in December. Our basic value strategy achieved top quintile performance since the new manager inception. Our large cap series strategy has improved from a second -- to a second quartile from a fourth quartile. And our U.S. opportunity strategy is in the top quintile over 3 years. 
While our active business continues to feel the impact of clients balancing high-conviction alpha strategies now with index exposures, the breadth and diversity of our platform and the presence of the only scale player in both active and index around the world will differentiate us in the ability to give our clients the full menu of solutions they need. We expect investor preference to vary over time. And BlackRock's ability to evolve alongside our clients is critical in the future for our success. 
Before I open it up for questions, I would like to take a moment to thank our employees for their hard work, incredible dedication in 2014 in helping our clients in the most complex investment challenges in the world by helping them to provide solutions. I'd like to thank my entire management team, many of them who are thriving in their new role following successful organizational changes earlier this year. And I'd like to recognize some of the milestones that BlackRock achieved in 2014. In retail, we crossed over $500 billion in assets under management. In iShares in 2014, we closed with more than $1 trillion in assets under management. In institutional, we garnered the best flows that we've seen in over 5 years. Since the financial crisis, or essentially since the end of 2007, the final year of the pre-crisis earnings, BlackRock has grown EPS by 142% versus the S&P 500 growing at 76% and the S&P Financial Index growing at only 9%, highlighting both the differentiation of our business model and our ability to execute on key growth strategies. 
All of the areas I've spoken about, whether it's fixed income, iShares, our Financial Institutions Group, alternatives, infrastructure, our active equity platform, all are areas where we made significant strategic investments over time, and we'll be seeing the impact of those investments over time to our shareholders and to our clients. We will continue to make investments in BlackRock's future and keep very high margins and utilize a full scale of our Aladdin risk management and technology capabilities to meet our fiduciary duties to our clients and to deliver returns for shareholders in 2015. 
With that, operator, let's open it up for questions."

We are still in the early stages, not only of institutions using the product but retail using the product as well. So there are 3 segments. There is a buy-and-hold segment, where people are using ETFs as a part of their fixed income portfolio for the beta and fixed income. And we have products that are focused on that. The second thing is that, as the financial markets change, ETFs are a surrogate for many financial instruments that have, because of regulatory reasons and liquidity reasons, become very expensive. And they are surrogates, for example, in swaps and futures, where ETFs are now being used, in fact, more than futures are being used. And as people learn about that, they add that into their portfolios. On the other side of that, they are also being used as we call it, precision instruments, where people are looking for a specific allocation and ETFs provide that specific precision tool for them to be invested in. So this is just the beginning of where fixed income ETFs go. And as you know, the fixed income markets are much larger than the equity markets are. So we just see continued growth in that. So for retail, we're attacking that by adding on to our Core Series, where we are adding products that can offer the full suite to what a retail investor would need over the long term in ETFs, whether that be in high yield, in corporates, in treasuries or just generic fixed income. And then on institutions, because they're looking for more of a trading vehicle, and they're looking for the transparency and they're looking for the liquidity, we're adding more specific-type of precision instruments for them. So I would tell you that the demand to learn about ETFs grows and grows, and we're just -- we just think this is a market that we're very positive on going forward. And also for portfolio managers that are managing large portfolios, getting the beta exposure from ETFs is cheaper, it's more diversified and it's more liquid than the alternative. And I might add that's really important when you're in a low interest rate environment like we're in. So we look forward to more growth in the fixed income and to be the leader in the ETFs in that area."

So across the board, the performance in all the different fixed income products continues to be quite large. And we are seeing more and more clients who are just also using beta products for fixed income. So across the board, we are seeing that. But in terms of where we are seeing clients looking to put more money to work, we are seeing increased activity in the client contribution area, where we've had some rather substantial wins. We continue to see in terms of insurance companies, always at the beginning of the year, they get big infusions of cash. This is one of the fundamental reasons why we thought that rates would be going down in the first part of the year. Obviously, we didn't expect some of the activities that occurred. But fundamentally, you always see some very large activities from insurance companies because of the beginning of the year. So it's across the board, and it's geographically diverse, too. So we think this is going to continue. But I must say, with where rates are at this moment, more and more clients are going to be looking for different types of expressions of exposure. I do believe with where rates are, it's going to lead to more and more clients searching things like infrastructure debt, other activities like that. And this is one of the reasons why we have so heavily invested in our infrastructure teams. We will continue to see clients reaching for yield and high yield, whether that's a good strategy or a bad strategy. I mean, I specifically believe rates are going to stay lower longer. And I think the activities that you're seeing in Europe, whether the court's approval of the OMT for the ECB and the greater possibility of QE from the ECB but continual easing in Japan. And importantly, as Chairwoman Yellen has said, she's going to be very data-dependent related to what the Federal Reserve does. So I actually believe this just creates more money in motion and more opportunity for BlackRock, especially with our flows."

I mean, I think that in terms of G&A, I think when we look at the fourth quarter on G&A, I mean, obviously it was slightly elevated by virtue of some closed-end fund launch costs and obviously some FX remeasurement. But I think once you kind of exclude those 2 items, I think the fourth quarter is generally a decent run rate for the year in terms of G&A. And then more broadly as we think about margins, obviously notwithstanding some of the seasonality that we have in our own margins especially in the first quarter, margins more broadly are dependent on lots of things, especially the beta environment, the future business mix, the various reinvestment opportunities that we see in our business and obviously the competitive compensation environment. So I don't -- our margin guidance really hasn't changed. As you know, we don't manage the business to a specific margin target. And we remain ever committed to generating operating leverage. We're also reinvesting in the business."

But let's step back for a second. Why have we seen elevated pension closeouts? Because you've had significant rallies in U.S. equities over the last 5 years. Companies have been closer to meeting their liabilities. And they have a desire to minimize income statement volatility because of the issues related to the pension fund. So we are in dialogues with many people. Some of the firms have used annuities, working with insurance companies. As you said, we are in dialogue with many organizations, some of the organizations are transforming their DB plans to DC. As I said, we're seeing elevated growth in our DC business in the fourth quarter, and we expect that in the first quarter. And we are having dialogues with many, many institutions worldwide about the possibility. But I would just caution that with rates being so low, unless you see significant equity rallies, it becomes a little harder to do that or the companies are going to have to infuse some type of money, making sure that they're matched. But I would say unquestionably, BlackRock's global platform, the ability of having our strength in target date and in terms of DC plans and having LifePath on the DC side, we have a lot of components in working with our clients, whether it's LDI products, which obviously will create a derisking. And obviously, we could help quite a bit in helping them think about how can a pension fund ultimately transfer some of the risk. But I don't want to call it unified across the board. I do believe depending on where each company is related to their reliability, and as you suggested quite correctly about the elongation of age, these are all big issues. We have actually had conversations with organizations that did LDI years ago, and now how do they factor in this elongated aging process, and are they properly matched? So the one thing that is very clear to companies that have done the derisking: It is not a static, one-time event. They have to be constantly monitoring this, depending on how their liabilities are changing. And as I said earlier, we're very involved in these dialogues. And I do believe this plays really well with our global platform of having great analytics and helping companies think about it. A long period of time of being involved with insurance companies and doing a lot of liability-matching type of products for insurance companies, that plays really well into LDI and other areas for us."

That's probably the -- that's the biggest, most recent type of dialogue. So the one area where we've done quite well is in the model-based equity. And we're still not seeing really any flows. But we have had now had 5 years of great success there. I do believe the traditional Fundamental Equity business is alive. It's not well, it had poor performances in the industry, I think that's what you're alluding to. We have seen great movement as an industry, movement out of maybe more of the fundamental investing into index. But I would say now, Bill, if you believe in a greater divergent market, a more volatile market, you would -- I have been asked many times, questions related, ""Should I be in an index product with a great divergent? Because I can't capture some of the great opportunities, they're going to be masked by the great failures."" So when you think about the energy market, if you think about an emerging market world context, a China, India is going to be hugely benefited by this. Countries like Russia, Nigeria, potentially Brazil are going to be harmed by this. How do you play that? And so this is why more and more of our clients are asking about things about smart beta, factors. And so I do believe we're going to need to capture different ways of finding alpha. But importantly, in our actions related to Fundamental Equities, we have always said this is a 5-year project, 2015 begins the third year. We are committed to this. And if you do believe in the world of great divergence, if you believe in a world that one day you will have, whenever that day will be, higher rates, it generally mean -- historically, you would think this is a better environment for stock-picking and Fundamental Equities. So our model is purposely built and positioned to benefit in this active and passive world. But the one thing that I am going to be pretty loud about, I do believe the most neglected component of equity investing is basically model- or factor-based investing, where we have a great platform, we've had great returns, especially overseas. And I am very bullish on building this out as a component of our active equity area. And I'm quite frustrated, to be frank, that we haven't seen the momentum that I would have thought we would. But this is an area where in my most recent meetings last week in Asia, every client asked me about factor-based investing in a divergent world. And so we'll see how this plays out, Bill. But I do believe in this divergent world and the way we have built the model of BlackRock, we'll be a beneficiary of that."

Revenue rose 2% to $2.7 billion, despite the negative FX impact on our nondollar-denominated base fees and over $70 million of transaction-related revenue in last year's first quarter. Operating income was $1.1 billion, 1% higher on a year-over-year basis.
Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $58 million of net investment gains, including a onetime gain of $40 million related to the fair value of our pre-existing interest in BlackRock Capital Advisors. Our 23.7% as-adjusted tax rate for the first quarter benefited from $69 million of nonrecurring items. We currently estimate that 30% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for the remainder of 2015.
BlackRock's first quarter results were driven by $70 billion of long-term net new flows, representing annualize organic growth rate of 6.5%. Growth was positive across all asset classes, investment styles, client types and regions. And organic revenue growth once again outpaced organic asset growth. Over the last 12 months, despite an increasingly volatile macro environment, BlackRock generated over $250 billion in total net new business, representing a 5% long-term organic growth rate, evidencing the stability of our highly diversified platform.
First quarter base fees rose 4% year-over-year as average AUM increased due to organic growth and market appreciation, despite almost $220 billion of negative FX impact associated with dollar appreciation against foreign currencies over the last 12 months. On a constant-currency basis, we estimate that base fees grew approximately 8% year-over-year. Base fees were roughly flat compared to the fourth quarter, primarily driven by a lower day count in the first quarter, entry rate headwinds and the continued impact of divergent beta and FX. Performance fees of $108 million were broad-based, but nonetheless, decreased $50 million from a year ago due to the impact of a large fee associated with the liquidation of an opportunistic mortgage fund.
BlackRock Solutions revenue of $147 million was down 5% year-over-year due primarily to declines in FMA transaction-related revenue and 14% sequentially due primarily to the timing of completed advisory assignments.
Our Aladdin business, which represented 86% of BlackRock Solution's revenue in the quarter, grew 13% year-over-year but was flat sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by several sizable clients going live on the Aladdin platform in 2014. While sequential results were impacted by the timing of recognition of certain revenues, as well as FX movements, we continue to see strong market demand for global investment platform consolidation and multi-asset risk solutions. The year-over-year revenue decline in our FMA business resulted in a meaningful transaction business position activity during 2014. We continue to believe that our FMA business model is well positioned to benefit from partnering with sophisticated financial institutions and governmental entities to address their most complex balance sheet, risk and governance challenges in the ever-changing political and regulatory climate.
Total expense rose $38 million year-over-year or 2%, driven primarily by increased G&A, AUM-related and direct fund expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was roughly flat year-over-year as the combination of a stronger dollar and a global employee base offset an increase in headcount. As we have previously noted, the first quarter adjusted compensation to revenue ratio generally runs higher than the full year due to the seasonality of payroll taxes.
G&A expense increased $26 million year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher marketing and promotional expense and the impact of a onetime real estate related benefit in last year's first quarter. Sequentially, G&A expense decreased $48 million, primarily reflecting seasonally lower marketing and promotional expense, lower foreign exchange remeasurement expense and closed-end fund launch cost incurred in the fourth quarter of 2014. Consistent with last year, aggregate G&A expense in the first quarter benefited from a delay in the timing of certain expense items, which will be incurred throughout the remainder of 2015.
We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment, on March 6, we acquired certain assets of BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors, enhancing our credit platform to the addition of middle market, private credit capability. We previously announced a 13% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2.18 per share of common stock and also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares during the first quarter. Based on what we know today, this increased level of quarterly share repurchases represents a reasonable run rate for the remainder of 2015.
Our consistent earnings growth and stable financial results reflect the benefits of our diverse platform, long-term client partnerships and commitment to investment performance. First quarter long-term net inflows were nearly evenly split between our active and index franchises and were positive in each of our geographic regions.
BlackRock's Global Retail franchise saw long-term net inflows of $14 billion, representing an 11% annualized organic growth rate. Flows were driven by continued strength and outcome-oriented offerings, including unconstrained fixed incomes and multi-asset strategies. Despite slower net flows in the U.S. mutual fund industry during the quarter, the diversity of our franchise and strong performance and active fixed income position BlackRock to continue to enhance its market share position. U.S. Retail flows of $7 billion reflected strong fixed income flows across a diverse set of products, including our top-decile total return and high-yield franchises and our flagship Strategic Income Opportunities Fund, which was again the industry-leading, unconstrained bond fund during the quarter.
International retail net inflows of $7 billion were paced by strong flows into our global unconstrained fixed income and multi-asset franchises. In addition, our leading European equities franchise benefited from a return to a risk-on environment and our top-quartile Asian equity funds gathered more than $800 million in aggregate flows during the quarter.
Global iShares generated over $35 billion of net new business in the first quarter, representing 14% annualized organic growth. iShares retained the #1 market share position of flows globally, with strong flows in each of our product segments: Core, position exposures, including our minimum volatility factor and currency headwind and financial instruments, where we saw ongoing momentum and replacing swaps and futures with ETFs. IShares results were led by fixed income net inflows of $19 billion [ph] and we again captured the #1 global market share of industry fixed income ETF flows. Equity flows of $17 billion were driven by flows into the Core Series and demand for international developed market and European exposures. IShares flows were also first [ph] globally, with particularly strong growth in Europe, where we are seeing broad-based acceleration in ETF adoption across all segments and all asset classes. European iShares flows of $15 billion in the quarter represented annualized organic growth of over 25%.
Our institutional business generated approximately $21 billion in long-term net inflows for the quarter, the highest institutional flows we've seen since the BGI acquisition. institutional index net inflows were led by strength in index equity, driven by defined contribution flows, offsetting outflows in our traditional defined benefit business. Institutional active net inflows of $18 billion reflect BlackRock's strong multi-asset capabilities and top-performing fixed income platform.
Multi-Asset inflows reflected significant solutions-based funding, particularly in the insurance outsourcing space, and strong demand for our dynamic diversified growth strategy and our LifePath target date series.
During the quarter, we also saw the funding of a $2 billion unconstrained fixed income separate account.
While institutional active equity flows were flat for the quarter, we saw inflows of nearly $2 billion into our scientific active equity business or 96% of assets are performing above benchmark over a 5-year period.
[indiscernible] continues to be a key theme as institutional clients [indiscernible] cost-effective data exposure with alternatives and other high conviction of solutions to achieve uncorrelated returns. Net of approximately $700 million of capital successfully returned to clients, institutional alternatives generated $1 billion of net new business, led by infrastructure and hedge fund solutions. In addition, we have another strong fundraising quarter for the liquid alternatives, raising more than $2 billion new commitments and now have over $10 billion in committed capital to deploy for clients. $800 million of net new flows from the recently announced ABR retransaction funded in April and are not included in first quarter results. In connection with this funding, we will incur a product placement fee of approximately $5 million in the second quarter.
In summary, in a quarter marked by continued volatility and divergent microtrends, our diversified business continue to deliver stable financial results.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

The investments we made in our people, the inves",2214,"Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Our strong performance over the last quarter is a result of the significant investments we made in our firm over the last few years. The investments we made in our people, the investments we made in our process, and importantly, the investments we made in our technology, all of which have been driven by our efforts to continually adapt to our changing market environments, the changing world environments and to meet the needs of our clients.
BlackRock has focused on helping our clients navigate an increasingly difficult, unpredictable and divergent financial and economic landscape. Investors today are faced with volatility in currencies and commodity markets. They are faced with sustained, low and even negative interest rates and shifting long-term macro trends, including longevity and the significant impact on technology on jobs. Divergent economic conditions and central bank actions have set currency markets into one of the most volatile periods on record, affecting both developed economies such as Japan and the Eurozone as well as the emerging markets. The relative value of the U.S. dollar and associated currency volatility is obviously having a rapid and material impact on large multinational companies, but it's also affecting smaller U.S. companies and consumers, who as a result of advancements in technology, are increasingly buying and selling products in a virtual global economy.
Historic low rates have been having a tremendous impact on how investors save for the future. The pool of funds in search of returns meet future liabilities is growing larger every day. This mix of growing assets, of shrinking supply, of low rates, is creating a dangerous imbalance, and the increasingly desperate search for yield is now the greatest single source of potential risk in a financial system.
At the same time, we're seeing powerful changes in longevity and retirement and advancements in technology, making the global economy in the way capital flows -- flow through it, and is this is having a major impact on how we and our clients are living, how our clients work and how we invest.
At BlackRock, we are constantly looking at the world and ourselves, to assess whether our platform, our services, our strategies can help our clients meet the challenges of evolving investment landscape. The need to anticipate changes and develop solutions is why we have deliberately equipped BlackRock's business model with such a wide range of capabilities, a capability no other asset manager possesses. The issue impacting financial markets are beyond our ability to control. But what we can control at BlackRock is how we respond to these issues, how we build out our platform, how we execute our strategies we've set forth for our business and how we deliver investment solutions to our clients.
BlackRock's first quarter results demonstrate that the investments we made to differentiate our platform over time are driving value for our clients and most certainly are driving value for our shareholders. In the first quarter, BlackRock generated $70 billion of long-term net inflows, representing a 6.5% quarterly annualized organic growth rate and a 5.5% organic growth rate over the last 12 months. Similar to our fourth quarter in 2014, we have a diverse composition of flows, something that was very, very important for me, as we -- as I think about our business. This composition flows is positive across our client base, positive across asset classes, regions and investment styles. Particularly, we're seeing a significant momentum in our active business, where we experienced the highest total active flows we've seen since 2007 at $32 billion, representing a 9% organic annualized organic growth rate in the first quarter. Roughly 2/3 of the asset BlackRock manages are related to retirement. It's the core of what we do. And particularly, we are focused on helping investors shift their focus away from the nest egg and towards an annual income in retirement. This is a difficult adjustment for many investors, but a critical one for helping our clients achieve their goals. They face significant challenges in a near-0 [ph] rate environment, where buying allegations alone are insufficient to meet the liability burdens of pension funds, to meet the needs of insurers and to meet the needs of our individual investors.
The diversity and strength of BlackRock's fixed income business is helping investors in all types to navigate that environment and drove $36 billion of net inflows across our global platform. We continue to benefit from strong performance across our fixed income business, where 91% of our active taxable fixed income AUM is above benchmark or peer median for a 3-year period. SIO is in the 14th percentile. High-yield bond is in the 10th percentile and Total Return is in the second percentile and the first percentile over 1 year. Clients also continue to adopt iShares fixed income ETFs as an efficient asset allocation and exposure tool. And iShares remains the global leader in fixed income in the first quarter, capturing the #1 market share flows of 53% with $19 billion of net inflows.
Today, investors are increasingly focused on outcome-oriented strategies that target specific goals, whether it's generating an income stream, preserving capital or growing assets within a certain risk profile. And they're moving beyond the bounds of traditional fixed income strategies into global, unconstrained or multi-asset strategies to achieve those objectives.
BlackRock's multi-asset platform a combination of our investment management expertise, a robust portfolio of construction business and superior risk management is all leveraging our unifying Aladdin platform, enabling us to provide investment strategies that will help our clients achieve the investment outcome in line with their needs and their objectives.
To counter low yields, retail investors are leveraging our Multi-Asset Income Fund, which cast a wide net across asset classes to tap into income opportunities both within and beyond bond and has a dynamic approach to balancing risk, return in income, while seeking to mitigate volatility. Institutional investors are similarly turning to our dynamic diversified growth fund for diversification for stable returns and also manage volatility.
Our ability to have deep and robust dialogue with our clients and to work closely with them and to provide some thought leadership is what is allowing us to provide more tailored customer strategies. And this is a very important component of what is transforming BlackRock with our clients, the breadth of products, as I said earlier, our risk management capabilities. And you dovetail it all together, we have a more and deeper dialogue with more clients than we've ever had in our 27-year history. We sell more than $9 billion of solution-based funding for insurance clients in the quarter, as they continue to search for holistic solutions to navigate a low-yield environment, be transformational partnerships for a culmination of a true, one BlackRock effort, and the resulting mandates span the best of our firm. From active to passive, to alternatives, all powered by risk management and Aladdin capabilities. These custom solution assignments leverage our complete platform, they build deeper and more robust relationships with our clients, and clients are finding out that no other firm in our industry has the capabilities to create this type of partnership and to replicate these type of capabilities.
One key area where we're continuing to build out those capabilities even further is in infrastructure. Infrastructure investments help our clients access an alternative asset class that provides inflation protection, diversification and the potential of our capital appreciation, and importantly, for so many of our clients, a long-duration return. A key aspect of our work has been to promote improved public-private partnerships, which jointly increase opportunities for investors and to help governments access much-needed sources of capital to drive economic growth to create countries that have a better economic future, to improve the quality of life of countries and to create job creation. This is a perfect marriage of building a base of clients and their capital with the needs of countries in building a better economic future. And this is one of the strong reasons why we are emphasizing infrastructure over the next coming years as a major component of our positioning at BlackRock, our positioning with our clients and our positioning with various countries of the world.
In March, we teamed with PEMEX, Mexico's national oil company, to finance 2 natural pipeline -- gas pipelines critical to Mexico's continued economic growth. The partnership builds upon the well-established track record of our existing infrastructure business. And by expanding our infrastructure footprint in Mexico, we'll offer BlackRock's local and international clients access to a previously untapped investment opportunities.
Another area where we continue to invest is technology, which has always been essential to our business model. Our Aladdin platform, which we transformed from an internal risk and investment management system to a revenue-generating business, providing a unique competitive advantage for BlackRock. Aladdin revenues grew 13% year-over-year and is increasing in value as third parties' operating platforms position BlackRock to consistently invest a growing stream of revenues into improving our technology and to expanding our technological offerings, to powering a constant upgrade cycle for the Aladdin community and driving a network effect benefits for our clients and for our shareholders.
Technology has not only shaped the way BlackRock serves clients through Aladdin and how we view risk management. It also drives the way we build investment solutions. Technology and data science are enabling BlackRock to combine our fundamental investment expertise with the best of our scientific and index investing to create innovative investment strategies. And we're investing in people with exceptional, strong backgrounds in data technology to drive this effort.
Another area where we've been building -- building out our capabilities is to meet our growing demand from investing offerings that have a measurable, positive social impact infrastructure as one of those capabilities. In the first quarter, we announced the launch of our new BlackRock Impact platform, which will truly unify the firm's approach to impact investing, where we currently manage more than $225 billion in assets.
As a fiduciary, BlackRock takes seriously our responsibility not only to provide the investment performance and the solutions our clients need, but we also are taking a leadership role in advocating for the best -- for our clients' best interests and those of the broader market and economy when it comes to long-term investments by the companies we invest on behalf of our clients. These efforts are led by our corporate governance team, which engages extensively with thousands of companies in order to help foster the best long-term outcome for those companies, and by doing so, increasing value for our clients. Our corporate governance team is the gold standard for the industry and is another key differentiating factor for BlackRock and our responsibilities with all our clients. As part of our engagement effort, earlier this week, I sent a letter to CEOs globally, including those of every company in the S&P 500, urging them to engage in key governance matters that, in our experience, supports long-term and sustainable financial performance. We recognize that some of the market dynamics I described earlier present an overwhelming challenge for companies working to reset short-term pressures, but companies can help diminish these pressures and improve their own positioning by developing and articulating a clear, convincing and creating a long-term strategy and long-term value. These efforts will help them attract long-term stakeholders and lay the foundations for a stronger, a more sustainable and more stable economic growth for our country and other countries around the world.
Once again, in the first quarter, we initiated some truly innovative and unique mandates that will drive our long-term value for our clients and our investors. Our PEMEX partnership is the first of its kind since Mexico passed its historical energy reforms in 2013. We announced several highly customized solution mandates to help our global insurance clients navigate historical challenging interest-rate environment. We partnered with ACE to launch a new vehicle that pairs the strength of their insurance businesses with our ability to provide best-in-class investment returns. And in Asia, we're expanding our relationships with some of the world's largest asset owners in new ways, in one big case, using Aladdin to better understand risk enhancing the quality of returns in client portfolio. And the second case, employing our transition management team to implement a landmark asset allocation changes that a client is undertaking in an effort to stimulate their nation's economy.
Individually and collectively, these mandates demonstrate the BlackRock creativity, BlackRock's innovation and the breadth that BlackRock provides for solution-oriented offerings. And more importantly, through that process, this creates and fosters deeper and more meaningful relationships with our clients, which will then allow us to have, in working with them, a larger share of their wallet. It is the strengthening of these relationships, our relentless focus on improving the firm that will drive our future growth and will drive and create long-term value for our shareholders.
Once again, I want to thank our employees for their continued, unwavering dedication in creating a better financial future for our clients. I want to thank the employees for being excellent students of the financial markets, to be prepared to answer questions for all our clients. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions."

We have -- we combined our retail and iShares sales force to provide what we call a client-centric approach. We are agnostic about beta products versus alpha products. We are trying to help and achieve outcomes. And I don't think we're harmed in any way related to do whatever proposal of the DOL. But this -- what DOL is doing is actually playing into our approach of how we are trying to navigate beta products and alpha products and mutual fund products with index antitheft products. So we're well positioned for that, but I do believe are well positioned because how we organize ourselves are related to client-centric approach."

So I would say the following, Glenn, I think, first of all, let's break it down. If we look the revenue side, obviously, the revenue was impacted, as we said, by about $70 million in the year-ago quarter that we would deem more opportunistic. So obviously, a big chunk of that came from the performance and then we had some significant transaction-related revenue in our FMA business. Obviously, then we got the FX impact and, on a constant-currency basis, we think that base fees on those would've been probably up closer to 8% year-over-year. On the expense side, and I think by the expense side, we're obviously benefiting, to a certain extent, from significant, nondollar expense that we have. We have about 5,800 employees that sit outside of the Americas that represents close to I think 47% or 48% of our total employee base. But obviously, notwithstanding that, there's still margin associated with our nondollar sources of profitability. So I think, what I would suggest to you, I hate to start to get into the so-called normalization because who knows what the true definition of normalization is, and that's a difficult concept. But I would say on a more recurring basis, if we thought about both our revenues and expenses, there's obviously been some timing differences that we also noted on the expense side versus last year in terms of the real estate credit. And taking into account FX more broadly, we look at our own business on a more normalized basis and would suggest that we see positive year-over-year margin improvement in operating leverage."

We are seeing more -- we have more dialogue on our model-based, factor-based products than we've had now in 5 years. I was frustrated, as you know, on other calls over the years that we have not seen as much flows in that area. I think as some fundamental products have underperformed and people are starting to recognize that our -- that 96% of our SAE products are above our peer medium over 5 years. And I think there is more interest today than we've seen in over 5 years for some type of model-based, factor-based investment strategies. You're seeing more and more in the mutual fund, even in some cases ETFs, more SmartBeta type of products. And I believe this is going to finally begin a period of substantial momentum in these areas. And so I do believe you're going to see shifts in that area as an industry more towards SmartBeta factor-based investing. I'm not suggesting fundamental is going away, it's not. But I believe we're positioned at BlackRock to benefit from that relooking at the scientific or model-based equity. We intend to be announcing some very substantial hires in this area. I talked about data management. We believe other sources of information like big data is going to be an important component on how one looks at investing. And so investing in these areas to -- for the fundamental and our scientific side, and this is probably -- this is going to be one of our more exciting offerings in the coming years. And this is an area that I believe is going to finally start seeing accelerated growth. So it's not a matter of share, Bill, if you ask, it's a function of -- the world is refocusing on these products, both on the retail side and the institutional side."

Of course, you know that the implementation date of all of these new products are around October of 2016.

And year-over-year, we have about $39 billion [ph] that's been added to cash funds. And that's about a 15% year-over-year growth. So there is still a lot of demand for money market-type product, and it will just change some of the nuances to be able to apply with the regulatory issues.

So there's 2 parts to that question. One is, people are looking on an institutional basis for precision exposures in particular areas like emerging markets, which would have a higher fee, versus buy-and-hold segments that are looking to supplement what they own with ETFs and what they call the Core Series. Now there is a difference in fee between the precision instruments like in emerging markets and the Core Series, which is more of a buy-and-hold segment. So quite frankly, we're seeing growth in both of those right now. But this is an area that is starting to gain attention and starting to mature. And what we're trying to do is develop a core set of products that is going to be for the buy-and-hold segment, and we continue to round that out. We've had over $12 billion that's going into that core segment. In the quarter, we've had about a 25% organic growth in this global core segment versus just a 14% overall market share in the iShares business. But the point here is that, there is a somewhat of a fee shift, but it's not that dramatic, and it's not the overriding factor in people buying these iShares. It's [indiscernible] filling out their portfolios in what they want. And of course, you have to be competitive in what they're buying. But we don't see, overall, dramatic change in the pricing on this or moving from high fee to lower fee, particularly within each operating segment."

So we're well positioned and it and we are increasingly working on more trends that are impacting in a favorable way for us. So keep in mind, what are the trends in DC? There's a greater trend towards open architecture. Really good for us in BlackRock. I mean, historically, we were [indiscernible] close architecture. More open architecture allows us to provide our products. Two, in DC, there's a greater demand for indexation. That's obviously plays into our strength. Three, as an innovator in target date, we're benefiting from that. So you add those 3 combinations, plus we have witnessed a lot of the $20 billion of flows because of our strong, active fixed income performance, we're seeing accelerated flows in those DC plans that are consistent and staying with the active strategy. So across the board, I would tell you, we have -- I mean, largest opportunities in DC than we've had in years and years and years. So much of that has to do, as I discussed earlier, our positioning, our strength in performance and fixed income and strength in designing target date products and moving towards indexation. And much of it has to do with, DC is not growing as a whole.

It has migrated to a little more corporate-based and activity-based. It isn't commentary that we are sending comments to the FSB related to that. I think there's going to be a long dialogue. There was a meeting earlier this week, and I think I saw reports related to it, related FSB meetings in New York with large investment management companies. I would say, from BlackRock's perspective, year ago, 1.5 years ago, it was pretty lonely for us that we were one of the few firms having those meetings and educating regulators related to the risk associated with asset managers. We always note importantly that the asset management industry represents less than 20% of the capital markets. Asset owners are principally the largest players. They manage their own money, and they play a significant role, too. So if you want to affect the ecosystem and making sure the ecosystem is safe and protected for society and for investors, as we said publicly and we continue to try to educate, it has to be activity-based. And today now, because of the efforts of the FSB, tens of asset managers are now working alongside us, industry groups are working alongside us. So I'm actually pretty thrilled that there is more -- there's more company, more people helping, spending time educating. I don't know what the solution or the outcome will be, but we look at this as a long-based process. We want to be construct there. That is our #1 responsibility and making sure that, in the end, it leads to a better, sounder financial system. We're all -- if we have that, talk about other issues related to long term, I think BlackRock is the biggest beneficiary of more participation by more people because we believe it's a safer environment to invest, we'll be all -- I'm all in favor of it. However, there are differences of opinion, and we are trying to push our opinions, but it's going to be a long process. It's going to be very public about how the process plays out. I don't feel any -- I actually believe the process is more robust now with more conversation than we've had in a long time. And we'll see how this all plays out, Ken. I don't -- I can't give you any degree of where this is moving internationally.

Obviously, with that, the long-term strategy, Michael, that's not something we're going to witness and see significant changes. That's a good example of a 5-, 7-year investment where we see on behalf of our clients. But it also has a very significant impact on our positioning in these various countries as a leader in the investment business. So you think about these investments, we are -- I think we're going to continue to build market share in retail. We witnessed that for 4 straight years. Two, I think it's fair to say that ETFs are in a secular growth period that is not over yet. We are the biggest beneficiary of that secular growth. And then three, which I said for many years, if we can begin to build a stronger relationship institutionally with more clients and building, not a product-based relationship, but cross-selling and solutions, we're going to start benefiting on the institutional side. So you add those together, it does allow us to have above industry, and I want to underscore it, above industry organic growth trends. And then if you add the amount of investments we're making, not just in alternative -- not just in infrastructure, but across the board in alternatives, where it's not really being showed up in the organic growth area because -- and as I said, we won $10 billion commitments, we don't, unlike a lot of the private equity firms, we don't show that in our AUM, but we identify the unfunded commitments. That's another good example of the power and the growth of the opportunity.

It's my pleasure to be here to present results for the first quarter of 2015. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. As usual, I will be focusing primarily on as adjusted results. We're committed to generating strong organic growth, demonstrating operating leverage and maintaining a consistent capital management policy as a framework for generating long-term shareholder value. Our first quarter results once again highlight the value of the investments we've made to assemble the industry's broadest suite of active and index investment offerings and to deliver differentiated, customized investment solutions to our clients. BlackRock delivered first quarter earnings per share of $4.89, up 10% compared to a year ago. Revenue rose 2% to $2.7 billion despite the negative FX impact on our nondollar-denominated base fees, and over $70 million of transaction-related revenue in last year's first quarter. Operating income was $1.1 billion, 1% higher on a year-over-year basis.
Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $58 million of net investment gains, including a onetime gain of $40 million related to the fair value of our pre-existing interest in BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors. Our 23.7% as-adjusted tax rate for the first quarter benefited from $69 million of nonrecurring items. We currently estimate that 30% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for the remainder of 2015.
BlackRock's first quarter results were driven by $70 billion of long-term net new flows, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 6.5%. Those were positive across all asset classes, investment styles, client types and regions, and organic revenue growth once again outpaced organic asset growth. Over the last 12 months, despite an increasingly volatile macro environment, BlackRock generated over $250 billion in total net new business, representing a 5% long-term organic growth rate, evidencing the stability of our highly diversified platform.
First quarter base fees rose 4% year-over-year, as average AUM increased due to organic growth and market appreciation, despite almost $220 billion of negative FX impact associated with dollar appreciation against foreign currencies over the last 12 months. On a constant-currency basis, we estimate that base fees grew approximately 8% year-over-year. Base fees were roughly flat compared to the fourth quarter, primarily driven by a lower day count in the first quarter, entry rate headwinds and the continued impact of divergent beta and FX. Performance fees of $108 million were broad-based, but nonetheless decreased $50 million from a year ago due to the impact of a large fee associated with the liquidation of an opportunistic mortgage fund.
BlackRock Solutions revenue of $147 million was down 5% year-over-year due primarily to declines in FMA transaction-related revenue, and 14% sequentially due primarily to the timing of completed advisory assignments.
Our Aladdin business, which represented 86% of BlackRock Solutions' revenue in the quarter, grew 13% year-over-year, but was flat sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by several sizable clients going live on the Aladdin platform in 2014. While sequential results were impacted by the timing and recognition of certain revenues, as well as FX movements, we continue to see strong market demand for global investment platform consolidation and multi-asset risk solutions. The year-over-year revenue decline in our FMA business resulted from a meaningful transaction-based disposition activity during 2014. We continue to believe that our FMA business model is well-positioned to benefit from partnering with sophisticated financial institutions and governmental entities to address their most complex balance sheet, risk and governance challenges in the ever-changing political and regulatory climate.
Total expense rose $38 million year-over-year, or 2%, driven primarily by increased G&A, AUM-related and direct fund expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was roughly flat year-over-year, as the combination of a stronger dollar and a global employee base offset an increase in headcount. As we have previously noted, the first quarter adjusted compensation to revenue ratio generally runs higher than the full year due to the seasonality of payroll taxes.
G&A expense increased $26 million year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher marketing and promotional expense and the impact of a onetime real estate-related benefit in last year's first quarter. Sequentially, G&A expense decreased $48 million, primarily reflecting seasonally lower marketing and promotional expense, lower foreign exchange remeasurement expense and closed-end fund launch costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2014. Consistent with last year, aggregate G&A expense in the first quarter benefited from a delay in the timing of certain expense items, which will be incurred throughout the remainder of 2015.
We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment, on March 6, we acquired certain assets of BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors, enhancing our credit platform through the addition of a middle market, private credit capability. We previously announced a 13% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2.18 per share of common stock and also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares during the first quarter. Based on what we know today, this increased level of quarterly share repurchases represents a reasonable run rate for the remainder of 2015.
Our consistent earnings growth and stable financial results reflect the benefits of our diverse platform, long-term client partnerships and commitment to investment performance. First quarter long-term net inflows were nearly evenly split between our active and index franchises and were positive in each of our geographic regions.
BlackRock's Global Retail franchise saw long-term net inflows of $14 billion, representing an 11% annualized organic growth rate. Flows were driven by continued strength and outcome-oriented offerings, including unconstrained fixed incomes and multi-asset strategies. Despite slower net flows in the U.S. mutual fund industry during the quarter, the diversity of our franchise and strong performance in active fixed income position BlackRock to continue to enhance its market share position. U.S. retail flows of $7 billion reflected strong fixed income flows across a diverse set of products, including our top-decile total return and high-yield franchises and our flagship, Strategic Income Opportunities Fund, which was again the industry-leading, unconstrained bond fund during the quarter.
International retail net inflows of $7 billion were paced by strong flows into our global unconstrained fixed income and multi-asset franchises. In addition, our leading European equities franchise benefited from a return to a risk-on environment, and our top-quartile Asian equity funds gathered more than $800 million in aggregate flows during the quarter.
Global iShares generated over $35 billion of net new business in the first quarter, representing 14% annualized organic growth. iShares retained the #1 market share position of flows globally, with strong flows in each of our product segments: core, position exposures, including our minimum volatility factor and currency hedge suite; and financial instruments, where we saw ongoing momentum in replacing swaps and futures with ETFs. iShares' results were led by fixed income net inflows of $19 billion, and we, again, captured the #1 global market share of industry fixed income ETF flows. Equity flows of $17 billion were driven by flows into the Core Series and demand for international developed market and European exposures. iShares' flows were also diversified globally, with particularly strong growth in Europe, where we are seeing broad-based acceleration in ETF adoption across all segments and all asset classes. European iShares flows of $15 billion in the quarter represented annualized organic growth of over 25%.
Our institutional business generated approximately $21 billion in long-term net inflows for the quarter, the highest institutional flows we have seen since the BGI acquisition. Institutional index net inflows were led by strength in index equity, driven by defined contribution flows, offsetting outflows in our traditional defined benefit business. Institutional active net inflows of $18 billion reflect BlackRock's strong multi-asset capabilities and top-performing fixed income platform.
Multi-Asset inflows reflected significant solutions-based funding, particularly in the insurance outsourcing space, and strong demand for our dynamic diversified growth strategy and our LifePath target date series.
During the quarter, we also saw the funding of a $2 billion unconstrained fixed income separate account.
While institutional active equity flows were flat for the quarter, we saw inflows of nearly $2 billion into our scientific active equity business, where 96% of assets are performing above benchmark over a 5-year period.
Our downy continues to be a key theme, as institutional clients' peer cost-effective beta exposure with alternatives and other high-conviction alpha solutions to achieve uncorrelated returns. Net of approximately $700 million of capital successfully returned to clients, institutional alternatives generated $1 billion of net new business, led by infrastructure and hedge fund solutions. In addition, we had another strong fundraising quarter for the liquid alternatives, raising more than $2 billion in new commitments and now have over $10 billion in committed capital to deploy for clients $800 million of net new flows from the recently announced ABR retransaction funded in April and are not included in first quarter results. In connection with this funding, we will incur a product placement fee of approximately $5 million in the second quarter.
In summary, in a quarter marked by continued volatility and divergent macro trends, our diversified business continue to deliver stable financial results.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Our strong performance over the last quarter is a result of the significant investments we made in our firm over the last few years, the investments we made in our people, the inves",2222,"Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Our strong performance over the last quarter is a result of the significant investments we made in our firm over the last few years, the investments we made in our people, the investments we made in our process and, importantly, the investments we made in our technology, all of which have been driven by our efforts to continually adapt to our changing market environments, the changing world environments and to meet the needs of our clients.
BlackRock has focused on helping our clients navigate an increasingly difficult, unpredictable and divergent financial and economic landscape. Investors today are faced with volatility in currencies and commodity markets. They're faced with sustained, low and even negative interest rates and shifting long-term macro trends, including longevity and the significant impact on technology on jobs. Divergent economic conditions and central bank actions have sent currency markets into one of the most volatile periods on record, affecting both developed economies, such as Japan and the Eurozone, as well as the emerging markets. The relative value of the U.S. dollar and associated currency volatility is obviously having a rapid and material impact on large multinational companies. But it's also affecting smaller U.S. companies and consumers, who as a result of advancements in technology, are increasingly buying and selling products in a virtual global economy.
Historic low rates have been having a tremendous impact on how investors save for the future. The pool of funds in search of returns to meet future liabilities is growing larger every day. This mix of growing assets, of shrinking supply, of low rates, is creating a dangerous imbalance, and the increasingly desperate search for yield is now the greatest single source of prudential risk in the financial system.
At the same time, we're seeing powerful changes in longevity and retirement and the advancements in technology, making the global economy in the way capital flows -- flow through it. And this is having a major impact on how we and our clients are living or how our clients work and how we invest.
At BlackRock, we are constantly looking at the world and ourselves to assess whether our platform, our services, our strategies can help our clients meet the challenges of evolving investment landscape. The need to anticipate changes and develop solutions is why we have deliberately equipped BlackRock's business model with such a wide range of capabilities, a capability no other asset manager possesses. The issue impacting financial markets are beyond our ability to control. But what we can control at BlackRock is how we respond to these issues, how we build out our platform, how we execute our strategies we've set forth for our business and how we deliver investment solutions to our clients.
BlackRock's first quarter results demonstrate that the investments we made to differentiate our platform over time are driving value for our clients, and most certainly are driving value for our shareholders. In the first quarter, BlackRock generated $70 billion of long-term net inflows, representing a 6.5% quarterly annualized organic growth rate and a 5.5% organic growth rate over the last 12 months. Similar to our fourth quarter in 2014, we had a diverse composition of flows, something that was very, very important for me, as we -- as I think about our business. This composition flows is positive across our client base, positive across asset classes, regions and investment styles. Particularly, we're seeing a significant momentum in our active business, where we experienced the highest total active flows we've seen since 2007 at $32 billion, representing a 9% organic -- annualized organic growth rate in the first quarter. Roughly 2/3 of the asset BlackRock manages are related to retirement. It's the core of what we do. And particularly, we are focused on helping investors shift their focus away from the nest egg and towards an annual income in retirement. This is a difficult adjustment for many investors, but a critical one for helping our clients achieve their goals. They face significant challenges in a near-0 rate environment. Core buying allegations alone are insufficient to meet the liability burdens of pension funds, to meet the needs of insurers and to meet the needs of our individual investors.
The diversity and strength of BlackRock's fixed income business is helping investors in all types to navigate that environment and drove $36 billion of net inflows across our global platform. We continue to benefit from strong performance across our fixed income business, where 91% of our active taxable fixed income AUM is above benchmark or peer median for a 3-year period. SIO is in the 14th percentile, high-yield bond is in the 10th percentile and Total Return is in the second percentile -- in the first percentile over one year. Clients also continue to adopt iShares fixed income ETFs as an efficient asset allocation and exposure tool. And iShares remains the global leader in fixed income in the first quarter, capturing the #1 market share of flows of 53%, with $19 billion of net inflows.
Today, investors are increasingly focused on outcome-oriented strategies that target specific goals, whether it's generating an income stream, preserving capital or growing assets within a certain risk profile. And they're moving beyond the bounds of traditional fixed income strategies into global, unconstrained or multi-asset strategies to achieve those objectives.
BlackRock's multi-asset platform, the combination of our investment management expertise, a robust portfolio of construction business and superior risk management, is all leveraging our unifying Aladdin platform, enabling us to provide investment strategies that will help our clients achieve the investment outcome in line with their needs and their objectives.
To counter low yields, retail investors are leveraging our Multi-Asset Income Fund, which casts a wide net across asset classes to tap into income opportunities, both within and beyond bond, and has a dynamic approach to balancing risk, return in income, while seeking to mitigate volatility. Institutional investors are similarly turning to our dynamic diversified growth fund for diversification, for stable returns and also manage volatility.
Our ability to have deep and robust dialogue with our clients and to work closely with them and to provide some thought leaderships is what is allowing us to provide more tailored, customized strategies. And this is a very important component of what is transforming BlackRock with our clients, the breadth of products, as I said earlier, our risk management capabilities. And you dovetail it all together, we have a more and deeper dialogue with more clients than we've ever had in our 27-year history. We sell more than $9 billion of solution-based funding for insurance clients in the quarter, as they continue to search for holistic solutions to navigate a low-yield environment, the transformational partnerships for the culmination of a true, one BlackRock effort, and the resulting mandates span the best of our firm, from active to passives, to alternatives, all powered by risk management and Aladdin capabilities. These custom solution assignments leverage our complete platform. They build deeper and more robust relationships with our clients, and clients are finding out that no other firm in our industry has the capabilities to create this type of partnership and to replicate this type of capabilities.
One key area where we are continuing to build out those capabilities even further is in infrastructure. Infrastructure investments help our clients access an alternative asset class that provides inflation protection, diversification and the potential of our capital appreciation and, importantly, for so many of our clients, a long-duration return. A key aspect of our work has been to promote improved public-private partnerships, which jointly increase opportunities for investors, and to help governments access much-needed sources of capital to drive economic growth, to create countries that have a better economic future, to improve the quality of life of countries and to create job creation. This is a perfect marriage of building a base of clients and their capital with the needs of countries in building a better economic future. And this is one of the strong reasons why we are emphasizing infrastructure over the next coming years as a major component of our positioning at BlackRock, our positioning with our clients and our positioning with various countries of the world.
In March, we teamed with PEMEX, Mexico's national oil company, to finance 2 natural pipelines, gas pipelines critical to Mexico's continued economic growth. The partnership builds upon the well-established track record of our existing infrastructure business. And by expanding our infrastructure footprint in Mexico, we'll offer BlackRock's local and international clients access to a previously untapped investment opportunities.
Another area where we continue to invest is technology, which has always been central to our business model, our Aladdin platform, which we transformed from an internal risk and investment management system to a revenue-generating business, providing a unique competitive advantage for BlackRock. Aladdin revenues grew 13% year-over-year, and has an increasing value as third parties' operating platforms position BlackRock to consistently invest a growing stream of revenues into improving our technology, into expanding our technological offerings, to powering in a constant upgrade cycle for the Aladdin community and driving a network effect benefits for our clients and for our shareholders.
Technology has not only shaped the way BlackRock serves clients through Aladdin and how we view risk management, it also drives the way we build investment solutions. Technology and data science are enabling BlackRock to combine our fundamental investment expertise with the best of our scientific and index investing to create innovative investment strategies. And we're investing in people with exceptional, strong backgrounds in data technology to drive this effort.
Another area where we've been building our -- building out our capabilities is to meet the growing demand from investment offerings that have a measurable, positive social impacts put infrastructure as one of those capabilities. In the first quarter, we announced the launch of our new BlackRock Impact platform, which will truly unify the firm's approach to impact investing, where we currently manage more than $225 billion in assets.
And as a fiduciary, BlackRock takes seriously our responsibilities not only to provide the investment performance and the solutions our clients need, but we also are taking a leadership role in advocating for the best -- for our clients' best interests and those of the broader market and economy when it comes to long-term investments by the companies we invest on behalf of our clients. These efforts are led by our corporate governance team, which engages extensively with thousands of companies in order to help foster the best long-term outcome for those companies and, by doing so, increasing value for our clients. Our corporate governance team is a gold standard for the industry and is another key differentiating factor for BlackRock and our responsibilities with all our clients. As part of our engagement effort, earlier this week, I sent a letter to CEOs globally, including those of every company in the S&P 500, urging them to engage on key governance matters that in our experience supports long-term and sustainable financial performance. We recognize that some of the market dynamics I described earlier present an overwhelming challenge for companies working to reset short-term pressures, but companies can help diminish these pressures and improve their own positioning by developing and articulating a clear, convincing and creating a long-term strategy and long-term value. These efforts will help them attract long-term stakeholders and lay the foundations for a stronger, a more sustainable and more stable economic growth for our country and other countries around the world.
Once again, in the first quarter, we initiated some truly innovative and unique mandates that will drive our long-term value for our clients and our investors. Our PEMEX partnership is the first of its kind since Mexico passed its historical energy reforms in 2013. We announced several highly customized solution mandates to help our global insurance clients navigate a historical challenging interest-rate environment. We partnered with ACE to launch a new vehicle that pairs the strengths of their insurance businesses with our ability to provide best-in-class investment returns. And in Asia, we're expanding our relationships with some of the world's largest asset owners in new ways, in one big case using Aladdin to better understand risk, enhancing the quality of returns in a client's portfolio; and the second case, employing our transition management team to implement a landmark asset allocation change that a client is undertaking in an effort to stimulate their nation's economy.
Individually and collectively, these mandates demonstrate the BlackRock creativity, BlackRock's innovation and the breadth that BlackRock provides for solution-oriented offerings. And more importantly, through that process, this creates and fosters deeper and more meaningful relationships with our clients, which will then allow us to have, in working with them, a larger share of their wallet. It is the strengthening of these relationships, our relentless focus on improving the firm that will drive our future growth and will drive and create long-term value for our shareholders.
Once again, I want to thank our employees for their continued, unwavering dedication in creating a better financial future for our clients. I want to thank the employees for being excellent students of the financial markets, to be prepared to answer questions for all our clients. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions."

But this -- what DOL's doing is actually playing into our approach of how we are trying to navigate beta products and alpha products, mutual fund products with index and ETF products. So we're well-positioned for that, but I do believe we're well-positioned because how we organize ourselves are related to client-centric approach."

If we look at the revenue side, obviously, the revenue was impacted, as we said, by about $70 million in the year-ago quarter that we would deem more opportunistic. So obviously, a big chunk of that came from the performance fee, and then we have some significant transaction-related revenue in our FMA business. Obviously, then we've got the FX impact. And we noted that on a constant-currency basis, we think that base fees alone would've been probably up closer to 8% year-over-year. Then the expense side, and I think on the expense side, we're obviously benefiting to a certain extent from significant nondollar expense that we have. We have about 5,800 employees that sit outside of the Americas that represents close to I think 47% or 48% of our total employee base. But obviously, notwithstanding that, there's still margin associated with our nondollar sources of profitability. So I think, what I would suggest to you, I hate to start to get into the so-called normalization because who knows what the tradition of normalization is, and that's a difficult concept. But I would say that on a more recurring basis, if we thought about our -- both our revenues and expenses, and there's obviously been some timing differences that we also noted on the expense side versus last year in terms of the real estate credit.

I think as some fundamental products have underperformed and people are starting to recognize that our -- that 96% of our SAE products are above our peer medium over 5 years. And I think there is more interest today than we've seen in over 5 years for some type of model-based, factor-based investment strategies. You're seeing more and more in the mutual fund, even in some cases ETFs, more smart beta type of products. And I believe this is going to finally begin a period of substantial momentum in these areas. And so I do believe you're going to be -- you're to see shifts in that area as an industry more towards smart beta factor-based investing. I'm not suggesting fundamental is going away, it's not. And so -- but I believe we're positioned at BlackRock to benefit from that relooking at the scientific or model-based equity. We intend to be announcing some very substantial hires in this area. I talked about data management. We believe other sources of information like big data is going to be an important component to how one looks at investing.

Right now, we're seeing more flows internationally than domestic. We're seeing more decline than in government. And if rates change, that will reverse. So we're taking an approach where we have gone out to our clients and are talking to them about the future regulation and preparing products for them that will make sense depending upon where rates are. So some of those things would be, for example, we're going to be ready with the constant and asset value government money market funds. And those will be without redemption gates or liquidity fees. We have the floating net asset value with institutional client money market fund. And we plan to maintain our largest private fund, which we have about $66.5 billion, and that's the temp on now the all prime institutional fund. And then we have others that we're preparing a floating rate short maturity institutional prime money market fund and a constant NAV government money market fund and short maturity national state-specific muni funds. We're also prepared to do separate accounts. So it really is going to depend upon where the regulation ends. Of course, you know that the implementation date of all of these new products are around October of 2016. So I think working together with our clients to make sure that we're prepared no matter where rates go is important for us. And year-over-year, we have about $39 billion that's been added into the cash funds. And that's about a 15% year-over-year growth. So there's still a lot of demand for money market-type product, and it will just change some of the nuances to be able to apply with the regulatory issues. But this is a big business for us, and we also see some of the smaller money market groups approaching us as well because scale in size is also going to be very important to be able to satisfy our clients' needs."

So there's 2 parts to that question. One is people are looking on an institutional basis for precision exposures in particular areas like emerging markets, which would have a higher fee, versus buy-and-hold segments that are looking to supplement what they own with ETFs and what they call the Core Series. Now there is a difference in fee between the precision instruments, like in emerging markets; and the Core Series, which is more of a buy-and-hold segment. So quite frankly, we're seeing growth in both of those right now. But this is an area that is starting to gain attention and starting to mature. And what we're trying to do is develop a core set of products that is going to be for the buy-and-hold segment. We continue to round that out. We've had over $12 billion that's going into that core segment. In the quarter, we've had about a 25% organic growth in this global core segment versus just a 14% overall market share in the iShares business. But the point here is that there is somewhat of a fee shift, but it's not that dramatic, and it's not the overriding factor in people buying these iShares. It's segmentation. It's filling out their portfolios in what they want. And then of course, you have to be competitive in what they're buying. But we don't see, overall, a dramatic change in the pricing on this or moving from high fee to lower fee, particularly within each segment."

We are increasingly working on more trends that are impacting in a favorable way for us. So keep in mind, what are the trends in DC? There's a greater trend towards open architecture, really good for us in BlackRock. I mean, historically, we were harmed by close architecture. More open architecture allows us to provide our products. Two, in DC, there's a greater demand for indexation. That obviously plays into our strength. Three, as an innovator in target date, we're benefiting from that. So you add those 3 combinations. Plus, we have witnessed a lot of the $20 billion of flows because of our strong, active fixed income performance. We're seeing accelerated flows in those DC plans that are consistent and staying with the active strategy. So across the board, I would tell you, we have -- I mean, as large of opportunities in DC than we've had in years and years and years. And it's -- much of it has to do, as I discussed earlier, our positioning, our strength in performance and fixed income, our strength in designing target date products and moving towards indexation. And much of it has to do with -- DC market's not growing as a whole.

And actually, we have pretty high aspirations for these. One of the ones that I'm a little disappointed in is the iBonds that we have because it really fits a client's portfolio so much better than buying individual bonds and taking the risk of the bid offer spread and having more liquidity and pricing, diversification and look through treatment. So I'm a little disappointed, but if I act on that and not propose the fund, I could tell you it took about 10 years to get our emerging markets fund off the ground and see real money come into it.

It has migrated a little bit to more corporate-based and activity-based. It isn't common perry that we are sending comments to the FSB related to that. I think there's going to be a long dialogue. There was a meeting earlier this week at -- I think I saw reports related to it, related to FSB meetings in New York with large investment management companies. I would say, from BlackRock's perspective, a year ago, 1.5 years ago, it was pretty lonely for us that we were one of the few firms having those meetings and educating regulators related to the risk associated with asset managers. We always note importantly that the asset management industry represents less than 20% of the capital markets. Asset owners are principally the largest players. They manage their own money, and they play a significant role, too. So if you want to affect the ecosystem and making sure the ecosystem is safe and protected for society and for investors, as we said publicly, and we continue to try to educate, it has to be activity-based. And today now, because of the efforts of the FSB, tens of asset managers are now working alongside us. Industry groups are working alongside with us. So I'm actually pretty thrilled that there is more than -- there's more company, more people helping, spending time educating. I don't know what the solution or the outcome will be, but we look at this as a long-based process. We want to be construct a Venice. They're our #1 responsibility in making sure that in the end, it leads to a better, sounder financial system. We're all -- if we have that, as I talk about other issues related to long term-ism, I think BlackRock's the biggest beneficiary of more participation by more people because they believe it's a safer environment to invest. We'll be all -- I'm all in favor of it. However, there are differences of opinions, and we are trying to push our opinions, but it's going to be a long process. It's going to be very public about how the process plays out. I don't feel any -- I actually believe the process is more robust now with more conversation than we've had in a long time. And we'll see how this all plays out, Ken. I don't -- I can't give you any degree of where this is moving internationally. It will be kind of odd as the FSOC is moving towards outcome -- activities. Now if the FSB comes with a different way, I would -- and question, is this a Europe versus U.S. phenomenon? It's interesting to know what Europe is doing with Google and other issues in technology in attacking U.S. technology companies. So I'm -- we're participating in this.

So I think we're now starting to witness the impact of having better performance in our active products, especially fixed income. Two, our expansion in the RIA channels in the buy-and-hold channel is now being exhibited in our mutual funds. It's being exhibited in our Core Series ETF products, and I can't underscore enough how we are building out and expanding our global platform. And I am using infrastructure also as a mechanism to get stronger within these various countries side by side, building our brand in those countries, building our opportunities in those countries. Well, obviously, that's a long-term strategy, Michael. That's not something that we're going to witness and see significant changes. That's a good example of a 5, 7-year investment where we see on behalf of our clients. But it is also has a very significant impact on our positioning in these various countries as a leader in the investment business. So you think about those investments. We are -- I think we're going to continue to build market share in retail. We witnessed that for 4 straight years. Two, I think it's fair to say that ETFs are in a secular growth period that is not over yet. We are the biggest beneficiary of that secular growth. And then three, which I said for many years, if we can begin to build a stronger relationship institutionally with more clients and building not a product-based relationship, but cross-selling of -- and solutions, we're going to start benefiting on the institutional side. So you add those together, it does allow us to have above-industry, and I want to underscore it, above-industry organic growth trends. And then if you add the amount of investments we're making not just in infrastructure, but across the board in alternatives, where it's not really -- is being showed up in the organic growth area because we, as I said, we won $10 billion commitments. We don't -- unlike a lot of the private equity firms, we don't show that in our AUM, but we identify the unfunded commitments. That's another good example of the power and the growth of the opportunity. So you tie this together, cross-selling products with institutions with better performance by providing solutions, by having even more market share opportunities in our Aladdin business, our iShares secular growth and our positioning in retail worldwide, plus better positioning, country by country, I think we're in a very good position to be leading above industry trend market share and market growth. Let me -- I'm sorry. Operator?"

It's my pleasure to be here to present results for the first quarter of 2015. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. As usual, I will be focusing primarily on as adjusted results. We're committed to generating strong organic growth, demonstrating operating leverage and maintaining a consistent capital management policy as a framework for generating long-term shareholder value. Our first quarter results once again highlight the value of the investments we've made to assemble the industry's broadest suite of active and index investment offerings and to deliver differentiated, customized investment solutions to our clients. BlackRock delivered first quarter earnings per share of $4.89, up 10% compared to a year ago. Revenue rose 2% to $2.7 billion despite the negative FX impact on our nondollar-denominated base fees, and over $70 million of transaction-related revenue in last year's first quarter. Operating income was $1.1 billion, 1% higher on a year-over-year basis.
Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $58 million of net investment gains, including a onetime gain of $40 million related to the fair value of our pre-existing interest in BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors. Our 23.7% as-adjusted tax rate for the first quarter benefited from $69 million of nonrecurring items. We currently estimate that 30% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for the remainder of 2015.
BlackRock's first quarter results were driven by $70 billion of long-term net new flows, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 6.5%. Flows were positive across all asset classes, investment styles, client types and regions, and organic revenue growth once again outpaced organic asset growth. Over the last 12 months, despite an increasingly volatile macro environment, BlackRock generated over $250 billion in total net new business, representing a 5% long-term organic growth rate, evidencing the stability of our highly diversified platform.
First quarter base fees rose 4% year-over-year, as average AUM increased due to organic growth and market appreciation, despite almost $220 billion of negative FX impact associated with dollar appreciation against foreign currencies over the last 12 months. On a constant-currency basis, we estimate that base fees grew approximately 8% year-over-year. Base fees were roughly flat compared to the fourth quarter, primarily driven by a lower day count in the first quarter, entry rate headwinds and the continued impact of divergent beta and FX. Performance fees of $108 million were broad-based, but nonetheless decreased $50 million from a year ago due to the impact of a large fee associated with the liquidation of an opportunistic mortgage fund.
BlackRock Solutions revenue of $147 million was down 5% year-over-year due primarily to declines in FMA transaction-related revenue, and 14% sequentially due primarily to the timing of completed advisory assignments.
Our Aladdin business, which represented 86% of BlackRock Solutions' revenue in the quarter, grew 13% year-over-year, but was flat sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by several sizable clients going live on the Aladdin platform in 2014. While sequential results were impacted by the timing and recognition of certain revenues, as well as FX movements, we continue to see strong market demand for global investment platform consolidation and multi-asset risk solutions. The year-over-year revenue decline in our FMA business resulted from meaningful transaction-based disposition activity during 2014. We continue to believe that our FMA business model is well-positioned to benefit from partnering with sophisticated financial institutions and governmental entities to address their most complex balance sheet, risk and governance challenges in the ever-changing political and regulatory climate.
Total expense rose $38 million year-over-year, or 2%, driven primarily by increased G&A, AUM-related and direct fund expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was roughly flat year-over-year, as the combination of a stronger dollar and a global employee base offset an increase in headcount. As we have previously noted, the first quarter adjusted compensation to revenue ratio generally runs higher than the full year due to the seasonality of payroll taxes.
G&A expense increased $26 million year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher marketing and promotional expense and the impact of a onetime real estate-related benefit in last year's first quarter. Sequentially, G&A expense decreased $48 million, primarily reflecting seasonally lower marketing and promotional expense, lower foreign exchange remeasurement expense and closed-end fund launch costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2014. Consistent with last year, aggregate G&A expense in the first quarter benefited from a delay in the timing of certain expense items, which will be incurred throughout the remainder of 2015.
We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment, on March 6, we acquired certain assets of BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors, enhancing our credit platform through the addition of a middle market, private credit capability. We previously announced a 13% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2.18 per share of common stock and also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares during the first quarter. Based on what we know today, this increased level of quarterly share repurchases represents a reasonable run rate for the remainder of 2015.
Our consistent earnings growth and stable financial results reflect the benefits of our diverse platform, long-term client partnerships and commitment to investment performance. First quarter long-term net inflows were nearly evenly split between our active and index franchises and were positive in each of our geographic regions.
BlackRock's Global Retail franchise saw long-term net inflows of $14 billion, representing an 11% annualized organic growth rate. Flows were driven by continued strength and outcome-oriented offerings, including unconstrained fixed income and multi-asset strategies. Despite slower net flows in the U.S. mutual fund industry during the quarter, the diversity of our franchise and strong performance in active fixed income position BlackRock to continue to enhance its market share position. U.S. retail flows of $7 billion reflected strong fixed income flows across a diverse set of products, including our top-decile total return and high-yield franchises and our flagship, Strategic Income Opportunities Fund, which was again the industry-leading, unconstrained bond fund during the quarter.
International retail net inflows of $7 billion were paced by strong flows into our global unconstrained fixed income and multi-asset franchises. In addition, our leading European equities franchise benefited from a return to a risk-on environment, and our top-quartile Asian equity funds gathered more than $800 million in aggregate flows during the quarter.
Global iShares generated over $35 billion of net new business in the first quarter, representing 14% annualized organic growth. iShares retained the #1 market share position of flows globally, with strong flows in each of our product segments: core, precision exposures, including our minimum volatility, factor and currency hedge suite; and financial instruments, where we saw ongoing momentum in replacing swaps and futures with ETFs. iShares' results were led by fixed income net inflows of $19 billion, and we, again, captured the #1 global market share of industry fixed income ETF flows. Equity flows of $17 billion were driven by flows into the Core Series and demand for international developed market and European exposures. iShares' flows were also diversified globally, with particularly strong growth in Europe, where we are seeing broad-based acceleration in ETF adoption across all segments and all asset classes. European iShares flows of $15 billion in the quarter represented annualized organic growth of over 25%.
Our institutional business generated approximately $21 billion in long-term net inflows for the quarter, the highest institutional flows we have seen since the BGI acquisition. Institutional index net inflows were led by strength in index equity, driven by defined contribution flows, offsetting outflows in our traditional defined benefit business. Institutional active net inflows of $18 billion reflected BlackRock's strong multi-asset capabilities and top-performing fixed income platform.
Multi-Asset inflows reflected significant solutions-based funding, particularly in the insurance outsourcing space, and strong demand for our dynamic diversified growth strategy and our LifePath target date series.
During the quarter, we also saw the funding of a $2 billion unconstrained fixed income separate account.
While institutional active equity flows were flat for the quarter, we saw inflows of nearly $2 billion into our scientific active equity business, where 96% of assets are performing above benchmark over a 5-year period.
Barbelling continues to be a key theme, as institutional clients' peer [ph] our cost-effective beta exposure with alternatives and other high-conviction alpha solutions to achieve uncorrelated returns. Net of approximately $700 million of capital successfully returned to clients, institutional alternatives generated $1 billion of net new business, led by infrastructure and hedge fund solutions. In addition, we had another strong fundraising quarter for illiquid alternatives, raising more than $2 billion in new commitments and now have over $10 billion in committed capital to deploy for clients $800 million of net new flows from the recently announced ABR retransaction funded in April and are not included in first quarter results. In connection with this funding, we will incur a product placement fee of approximately $5 million in the second quarter.
In summary, in a quarter marked by continued volatility and divergent macro trends, our diversified business continued to deliver stable financial results.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Our strong performance over the last quarter is a result of the significant investments we made in our firm over the last few years; the investments we made in our people, the inves",2228,"Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Our strong performance over the last quarter is a result of the significant investments we made in our firm over the last few years; the investments we made in our people, the investments we made in our process and, importantly, the investments we made in our technology, all of which have been driven by our efforts to continually adapt to our changing market environments, the changing world environments and to meet the needs of our clients.
BlackRock has focused on helping our clients navigate an increasingly difficult, unpredictable and divergent financial and economic landscape. Investors today are faced with volatility in currencies and commodity markets. They're faced with sustained, low and even negative interest rates and shifting long-term macro trends, including longevity and the significant impact on technology on jobs. Divergent economic conditions and central bank actions have sent currency markets into one of the most volatile periods on record, affecting both developed economies, such as Japan and the Eurozone, as well as the emerging markets. The relative value of the U.S. dollar and associated currency volatility is obviously having a rapid and material impact on large multinational companies. But it's also affecting smaller U.S. companies and consumers, who as a result of advancements in technology, are increasingly buying and selling products in a virtual global economy.
Historic low rates have been having a tremendous impact on how investors save for the future. The pool of funds in search of returns to meet future liabilities is growing larger every day. This mix of growing assets, of shrinking supply, of low rates, is creating a dangerous imbalance, and the increasingly desperate search for yield is now the greatest single source of prudential risk in the financial system.
At the same time, we're seeing powerful changes in longevity and retirement and the advancements in technology, making the global economy and the way capital flows -- flow through it. And this is having a major impact on how we and our clients are living, how our clients work and how we invest.
At BlackRock, we are constantly looking at the world and at ourselves to assess whether our platform, our services, our strategies can help our clients meet the challenges of an evolving investment landscape. The need to anticipate changes and develop solutions is why we have deliberately equipped BlackRock's business model with such a wide range of capabilities, a capability no other asset manager possesses. The issues impacting financial markets are beyond our ability to control. But what we can control at BlackRock is how we respond to these issues, how we build out our platform, how we execute our strategies we've set forth for our business and how we deliver investment solutions to our clients.
BlackRock's first quarter results demonstrate that the investments we made to differentiate our platform over time are driving value for our clients, and most certainly are driving value for our shareholders. In the first quarter, BlackRock generated $70 billion of long-term net inflows, representing a 6.5% quarterly annualized organic growth rate and a 5.5% organic growth rate over the last 12 months. Similar to our fourth quarter in 2014, we had a diverse composition of flows, something that was very, very important for me, as we -- as I think about our business. This composition of flows is positive across our client base, positive across asset classes, regions and investment styles. Particularly, we're seeing a significant momentum in our active business, where we experienced the highest total active flows we've seen since 2007 at $32 billion, representing a 9% organic -- annualized organic growth rate in the first quarter. Roughly 2/3 of the assets BlackRock manages are related to retirement. It's the core of what we do. And particularly, we are focused on helping investors shift their focus away from the nest egg and towards an annual income in retirement. This is a difficult adjustment for many investors, but a critical one for helping our clients achieve their goals. They face significant challenges in a near-0 rate environment. Core buying allocations alone are insufficient to meet the liability burdens of pension funds, to meet the needs of insurers and to meet the needs of our individual investors.
The diversity and strength of BlackRock's fixed income business is helping investors in all types to navigate that environment and drove $36 billion of net inflows across our global platform. We continue to benefit from strong performance across our fixed income business, where 91% of our active taxable fixed income AUM is above benchmark or peer median for a 3-year period. SIO is in the 14th percentile, high-yield bond is in the 10th percentile and Total Return is in the second percentile -- in the first percentile over 1 year. Clients also continue to adopt iShares fixed income ETFs as an efficient asset allocation and exposure tool. And iShares remains the global leader in fixed income in the first quarter, capturing the #1 market share of flows of 53%, with $19 billion of net inflows.
Today, investors are increasingly focused on outcome-oriented strategies that target specific goals, whether it's generating an income stream, preserving capital or growing assets within a certain risk profile. And they're moving beyond the bounds of traditional fixed income strategies into global, unconstrained or multi-asset [ph] strategies to achieve those objectives.
BlackRock's multi-asset platform, the combination of our investment management expertise, a robust portfolio of construction business and superior risk management, is all leveraging our unifying Aladdin platform, enabling us to provide investment strategies that will help our clients achieve the investment outcome in line with their needs and their objectives.
To counter low yields, retail investors are leveraging our Multi-Asset Income Fund, which casts a wide net across asset classes to tap into income opportunities, both within and beyond bonds, and has a dynamic approach to balancing risk, return in income, while seeking to mitigate volatility. Institutional investors are similarly turning to our dynamic diversified growth fund for diversification, for stable returns and also manage volatility.
Our ability to have deep and robust dialogue with our clients and to work closely with them and to provide some thought leadership is what is allowing us to provide more tailored, customized strategies. And this is a very important component of what is transforming BlackRock with our clients, the breadth of products, as I said earlier, our risk management capabilities. And you dovetail it all together, we have a more and deeper dialogue with more clients than we've ever had in our 27-year history. We saw more than $9 billion of solution-based funding for insurance clients in the quarter, as they continue to search for holistic solutions to navigate a low-yield environment. These transformational partnerships were the culmination of a true, one BlackRock effort, and the resulting mandates span the best of our firm; from active to passives, to alternatives, all powered by risk management and Aladdin capabilities. These custom solution assignments leverage our complete platform. They build deeper and more robust relationships with our clients, and clients are finding out that no other firm in our industry has the capabilities to create this type of partnership and to replicate these type of capabilities.
One key area where we are continuing to build out those capabilities even further is in infrastructure. Infrastructure investments help our clients access an alternative asset class that provides inflation protection, diversification and the potential for capital appreciation and, importantly for so many of our clients, a long-duration return. A key aspect of our work has been to promote improved public-private partnerships, which jointly increase opportunities for investors, and to help governments access much-needed sources of capital to drive economic growth, to create countries to have a better economic future, to improve the quality of life of countries and to create job creation. This is a perfect marriage of building a base of clients and their capital with the needs of countries in building a better economic future. And this is one of the strong reasons why we are emphasizing infrastructure over the next coming years as a major component of our positioning at BlackRock, our positioning with our clients and our positioning with various countries of the world.
In March, we teamed with PEMEX, Mexico's national oil company, to finance 2 natural pipelines -- gas pipelines critical to Mexico's continued economic growth. The partnership builds upon the well-established track record of our existing infrastructure business. And by expanding our infrastructure footprint in Mexico, we'll offer BlackRock's local and international clients access to a previously untapped investment opportunity.
Another area where we continue to invest is technology, which has always been central to our business model, our Aladdin platform, which we transformed from an internal risk and investment management system to a revenue-generating business, providing a unique competitive advantage for BlackRock. Aladdin revenues grew 13% year-over-year, and is increasing value as third parties' operating platforms position BlackRock to consistently invest a growing stream of revenues into improving our technology, into expanding our technological offerings, to powering a constant upgrade cycle for the Aladdin community and driving a network effect benefits for our clients and for our shareholders.
Technology has not only shaped the way BlackRock serves clients through Aladdin and how we view risk management, it also drives the way we build investment solutions. Technology and data science are enabling BlackRock to combine our fundamental investment expertise with the best of our scientific and index investing to create innovative investment strategies. And we're investing in people with exceptional, strong backgrounds in data technology to drive this effort.
Another area where we've been building our -- building out our capabilities is to meet the growing demand for investment offerings that have a measurable, positive social impact. I would put infrastructure as one of those capabilities. In the first quarter, we announced the launch of our new BlackRock Impact platform, which will truly unify the firm's approach to impact investing, where we currently manage more than $225 billion in assets.
And as a fiduciary, BlackRock takes seriously our responsibilities not only to provide the investment performance and the solutions our clients need, but we also are taking a leadership role in advocating for the best -- for our clients' best interests and those of the broader market and economy when it comes to long-term investments by the companies we invest on behalf of our clients. These efforts are led by our corporate governance team, which engages extensively with thousands of companies in order to help foster the best long-term outcome for those companies and, by doing so, increasing value for our clients. Our corporate governance team is a gold standard for the industry and is another key differentiating factor for BlackRock and our responsibilities with all our clients. As part of our engagement effort, earlier this week, I sent a letter to CEOs globally, including those of every company in the S&P 500, urging them to engage on key governance matters that in our experience supports long-term and sustainable financial performance. We recognize that some of the market dynamics that I described earlier present an overwhelming challenge for companies working to reset short-term pressures, but companies can help diminish these pressures and improve their own positioning by developing and articulating a clear, convincing and creating a long-term strategy and long-term value. These efforts will help them attract long-term stakeholders and lay the foundations for a stronger, a more sustainable and more stable economic growth for our country and other countries around the world.
Once again, in the first quarter, we initiated some truly innovative and unique mandates that will drive our long-term value for our clients and our investors. Our PEMEX partnership is the first of its kind since Mexico passed its historical energy reforms in 2013. We announced several highly customized solution mandates to help our global insurance clients navigate a historically challenging interest-rate environment. We partnered with ACE to launch a new vehicle that pairs the strengths of their insurance businesses with our ability to provide best-in-class investment returns. And in Asia, we're expanding our relationships with some of the world's largest asset owners in new ways, in one big case using Aladdin to better understand risk, and enhancing the quality of returns in a client's portfolio; and a second case, employing our transition management team to implement a landmark asset allocation change that a client is undertaking in an effort to stimulate their nation's economy.
Individually and collectively, these mandates demonstrate the BlackRock creativity, BlackRock's innovation and the breadth that BlackRock can provide for solution-oriented offerings. And more importantly, through that process, this creates and fosters deeper and more meaningful relationships with our clients, which will then allow us to have, in working with them, a larger share of their wallet. It is the strengthening of these relationships, our relentless focus on improving the firm that will drive our future growth and will drive and create long-term value for our shareholders.
Once again, I want to thank our employees for their continued, unwavering dedication in creating a better financial future for our clients. I want to thank the employees for being excellent students of the financial markets to be prepared to answer questions for all our clients. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions."

We've combined our retail and iShares sales force to provide what we call a client-centric approach. We are agnostic about beta products versus alpha products. We are trying to help and achieve outcomes and I don't think we're harmed in any way related to whatever is proposed in the DOL. But this -- what DOL's doing is actually playing into our approach of how we are trying to navigate beta products and alpha products, mutual fund products with index and ETF products. So we're well-positioned for that, but I do believe we're well-positioned because how we organize our sales force will lend to a client-centric approach."

So I would say the following, Glenn. I think, first of all, let's break it down. If we look at the revenue side, obviously, the revenue was impacted, as we said, by about $70 million in the year-ago quarter that we would deem more opportunistic. So obviously, a big chunk of that came from the performance fee, and then we had some significant transaction-related revenue in our FMA business. Obviously, then we've got the FX impact. And we noted that on a constant-currency basis, we think that base fees alone would've been probably up closer to 8% year-over-year. Then we looked at the expense side, and I think on the expense side, we're obviously benefiting to a certain extent from significant nondollar expense that we have. We have about 5,800 employees that sit outside of the Americas that represents close to I think 47% or 48% of our total employee base. But obviously, notwithstanding that, there's still margin associated with our nondollar sources of profitability. So I think, what I would suggest to you, I hate to start to get into the so-called normalization because who knows what the definition of normalization is, and that's a difficult concept. But I would say that on a more recurring basis, if we thought about our -- both our revenues and expenses, and there's obviously been some timing differences that we also noted on the expense side versus last year in terms of the real estate credit. And taking into account FX more broadly, we look at our own business on a more normalized basis and would suggest that we see positive year-over-year margin improvement and operating leverage."

And I think there is more interest today than we've seen in over 5 years for some type of model-based, factor-based investment strategies.

And I believe this is going to finally begin a period of substantial momentum in these areas.

Right now, we're seeing more flows internationally than domestic. We're seeing more decline than in government. And if rates change, that will reverse. So we're taking an approach where we have gone out to our clients and are talking to them about the future regulation and preparing products for them that will make sense depending upon where rates are. So some of those things would be, for example, we're going to be ready with constant net asset value government money market funds. And those will be without redemption gates or liquidity fees. We have the floating net asset value institutional client money market fund. And we plan to maintain our largest private fund, which we have about $66.5 billion invested temp [ph] fund, and that will be our prime institutional fund. And then we have others that we're preparing a floating rate short maturity institutional prime money market fund and a constant NAV government money market fund and short maturity national state-specific muni funds. We're also prepared to do separate accounts. So it really is going to depend upon where the regulation ends. Of course, you know that the implementation date of all of these new products are around October of 2016. So I think working together with our clients to make sure that we're prepared no matter where rates go is important for us. And year-over-year, we have about $39 billion that's been added into the cash funds. And that's about a 15% year-over-year growth. So there's still a lot of demand for a money market-type product, and it will just change some of the nuances to be able to apply with the regulatory issues. But this is a big business for us, and we also see some of the smaller money market groups approaching us as well because scale and size is also going to be very important to be able to satisfy our clients' needs."

So there's 2 parts to that question. One is people are looking on an institutional basis for precision exposures in particular areas like emerging markets, which would have a higher fee, versus buy-and-hold segments that are looking to supplement what they own with ETFs and what they call the Core Series. Now there is a difference in fee between the precision instruments, like in emerging markets; and the Core Series, which is more of a buy-and-hold segment. So quite frankly, we're seeing growth in both of those right now. But this is an area that is starting to gain attention and starting to mature. And what we're trying to do is develop a core set of products that is going to be for the buy-and-hold segment. We continue to round that out. We've had over $12 billion that's going into that core segment. In the quarter, we've had about a 25% organic growth in this global core segment versus just a 14% overall market share in the iShares business. But the point here is that there is somewhat of a fee shift, but it's not that dramatic, and it's not the overriding factor in people buying these iShares. It's segmentation. It's filling out their portfolios in what they want. And then of course, you have to be competitive in what they're buying. But we don't see an overall, dramatic change in the pricing on this or moving from high fee to lower fee, particularly in each segment."

And so we are very comfortable with the mix of business and how business is evolving. But more, we are winning new clients that we did not have or more buy-and-hold, where this was not where BlackRock had its -- had great market share. And as we penetrate more and more of the independent advisers that historically was more the landscape of a Vanguard, we're starting to see increased flows in our Core Series. So it's not that we are seeing a substitution with some of our clients, we're penetrating more in different clients. As Rob said, we're penetrating more buy-and-hold clients, too.

We are increasingly working on more trends that are impacting in a favorable way for us. So keep in mind, what are the trends in DC? There's a greater trend towards open architecture, really good for us in BlackRock. I mean, historically, we were harmed by closed architecture. More open architecture allows us to provide our products. Two, in DC, there's a greater demand for indexation. That obviously plays into our strength. Three, as an innovator in target date, we're benefiting from that. So you add those 3 combinations. Plus, we have witnessed in a lot of the $20 billion of flows because of our strong, active fixed income performance, we're seeing accelerated flows in those DC plans that are consistent and staying with the active strategy. So across the board, I would tell you, we have, probably, as large of opportunities in DC than we've had in years and years and years. And it's -- much of it has to do, as I discussed earlier, our positioning, our strength in performance and fixed income, our strength in designing target date products, a movement towards indexation. And much of it has to do with -- DC market's not growing as a whole. In fact, there's a belief that DC can slowly start decreasing as the men and women are getting closer to retirement are spending what they accrued.

And actually, we have pretty high aspirations for these. One of the ones that I'm a little disappointed in is the iBonds that we have because it really fits a client's portfolio so much better than buying individual bonds and taking the risk of the bid-offer spread and having more liquidity and pricing, diversification and look-through treatment. So I'm a little disappointed, but if I act on that and not propose the fund, I can tell you it took about 10 years to get our emerging markets fund off the ground and see real money come into it. So we're just going to go out there if we think it's a good product, talk to our clients, make sure we have the awareness, show them the positives of it, be able to evaluate the performance.

It has migrated a little bit to more corporate-based and activity-based. It is in comment period that we are sending comments to the FSB related to that. I think there's going to be a long dialogue. There was a meeting earlier this week at -- I think I saw reports related to it, related to the FSB meetings in New York with large investment management companies. I would say, from BlackRock's perspective, a year ago, 1.5 years ago, it was pretty lonely for us that we were one of the few firms having those meetings and educating regulators related to the risk associated with asset managers. We always note importantly that the asset management industry represents less than 20% of the capital markets. Asset owners are principally the largest players. They manage their own money, and they play a significant role, too. So if you want to affect the ecosystem and making sure the ecosystem is safe and protected for society and for investors, as we've said publicly, and we continue to try to educate, it has to be activity-based. And today now, because of the efforts of the FSB, tens of asset managers are now working alongside us. Industry groups are working alongside with us. So I'm actually pretty thrilled that there is more than -- there's more company, more people helping, spending time, educating. I don't know what the solution or the outcome will be, but we look at this as a long-based process. We want to be constructive.

So I think we're now starting to witness the impact of having better performance in our active products, especially fixed income. Two, our expansion in the RIA channels in the buy-and-hold channel is now being exhibited in our mutual funds. It's being exhibited in our Core Series ETF products, and I can't underscore enough how we are building out and expanding our global platform. And I am using infrastructure also as a mechanism to get stronger within these various countries side by side, building our brand in those countries, building our opportunities in those countries. Obviously, that's a long-term strategy, Michael. That's not something that we're going to witness and see significant changes. That's a good example of a 5, 7-year investment where we see on behalf of our clients. But it is also has a very significant impact on our positioning in these various countries as a leader in the investment business. So you think about those investments. We are -- I think we're going to continue to build market share in retail. We witnessed that for 4 straight years. Two, I think it's fair to say that ETFs are in a secular growth period that is not over yet. We are the biggest beneficiary of that secular growth. And then three, which I said for many years, if we can begin to build a stronger relationship institutionally with more clients and building, not a product-based relationship, but cross-selling of -- and solutions, we're going to start benefiting on the institutional side. So you add those together, it does allow us to have above-industry, and I want to underscore it, above-industry organic growth trends. And then if you add the amount of investments we're making not just in infrastructure, but across the board in alternatives, where it's not really -- is being shown up in the organic growth area because we, as I said, we want $10 billion commitments. We don't -- unlike a lot of the private equity firms, we don't show that in our AUM, but we identify the unfunded commitments. That's another good example of the power and the growth of the opportunity. So you tie this together, cross-selling products with institutions with better performance by providing solutions, by having even more market share opportunities in our Aladdin business, our iShares secular growth and our positioning in retail worldwide, plus better positioning, country by country, I think we're in a very good position to be leading above industry-trend market share and market growth.

It's my pleasure to be here to present results for the first quarter of 2015. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. As usual, I will be focusing primarily on as adjusted results. We're committed to generating strong organic growth, demonstrating operating leverage and maintaining a consistent capital management policy as a framework for generating long-term shareholder value. Our first quarter results once again highlight the value of the investments we've made to assemble the industry's broadest suite of active and index investment offerings and to deliver differentiated, customized investment solutions to our clients. BlackRock delivered first quarter earnings per share of $4.89, up 10% compared to a year ago. Revenue rose 2% to $2.7 billion despite the negative FX impact on our nondollar-denominated base fees, and over $70 million of transaction-related revenue in last year's first quarter. Operating income was $1.1 billion, 1% higher on a year-over-year basis.
Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $58 million of net investment gains, including a onetime gain of $40 million related to the fair value of our pre-existing interest in BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors. Our 23.7% as-adjusted tax rate for the first quarter benefited from $69 million of nonrecurring items. We currently estimate that 30% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for the remainder of 2015.
BlackRock's first quarter results were driven by $70 billion of long-term net new flows, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 6.5%. Flows were positive across all asset classes, investment styles, client types and regions, and organic revenue growth once again outpaced organic asset growth. Over the last 12 months, despite an increasingly volatile macro environment, BlackRock generated over $250 billion in total net new business, representing a 5% long-term organic growth rate, evidencing the stability of our highly diversified platform.
First quarter base fees rose 4% year-over-year, as average AUM increased due to organic growth and market appreciation, despite almost $220 billion of negative FX impact associated with dollar appreciation against foreign currencies over the last 12 months. On a constant-currency basis, we estimate that base fees grew approximately 8% year-over-year. Base fees were roughly flat compared to the fourth quarter, primarily driven by a lower day count in the first quarter, entry rate headwinds and the continued impact of divergent beta and FX. Performance fees of $108 million were broad-based, but nonetheless decreased $50 million from a year ago due to the impact of a large fee associated with the liquidation of an opportunistic mortgage fund.
BlackRock Solutions revenue of $147 million was down 5% year-over-year due primarily to declines in FMA transaction-related revenue, and 14% sequentially due primarily to the timing of completed advisory assignments.
Our Aladdin business, which represented 86% of BlackRock Solutions' revenue in the quarter, grew 13% year-over-year, but was flat sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by several sizable clients going live on the Aladdin platform in 2014. While sequential results were impacted by the timing and recognition of certain revenues, as well as FX movements, we continue to see strong market demand for global investment platform consolidation and multi-asset risk solutions. The year-over-year revenue decline in our FMA business resulted from meaningful transaction-based disposition activity during 2014. We continue to believe that our FMA business model is well-positioned to benefit from partnering with sophisticated financial institutions and governmental entities to address their most complex balance sheet, risk and governance challenges in the ever-changing political and regulatory climate.
Total expense rose $38 million year-over-year, or 2%, driven primarily by increased G&A, AUM-related and direct fund expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was roughly flat year-over-year, as the combination of a stronger dollar and a global employee base offset an increase in headcount. As we have previously noted, the first quarter adjusted compensation to revenue ratio generally runs higher than the full year due to the seasonality of payroll taxes.
G&A expense increased $26 million year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher marketing and promotional expense and the impact of a onetime real estate-related benefit in last year's first quarter. Sequentially, G&A expense decreased $48 million, primarily reflecting seasonally lower marketing and promotional expense, lower foreign exchange remeasurement expense and closed-end fund launch costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2014. Consistent with last year, aggregate G&A expense in the first quarter benefited from a delay in the timing of certain expense items, which will be incurred throughout the remainder of 2015.
We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment, on March 6, we acquired certain assets of BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors, enhancing our credit platform through the addition of a middle market, private credit capability. We previously announced a 13% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2.18 per share of common stock and also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares during the first quarter. Based on what we know today, this increased level of quarterly share repurchases represents a reasonable run rate for the remainder of 2015.
Our consistent earnings growth and stable financial results reflect the benefits of our diverse platform, long-term client partnerships and commitment to investment performance. First quarter long-term net inflows were nearly evenly split between our active and index franchises and were positive in each of our geographic regions.
BlackRock's Global Retail franchise saw long-term net inflows of $14 billion, representing an 11% annualized organic growth rate. Flows were driven by continued strength and outcome-oriented offerings, including unconstrained fixed income and multi-asset strategies. Despite slower net flows in the U.S. mutual fund industry during the quarter, the diversity of our franchise and strong performance in active fixed income position BlackRock to continue to enhance its market share position. U.S. retail flows of $7 billion reflected strong fixed income flows across a diverse set of products, including our top-decile total return and high-yield franchises and our flagship, Strategic Income Opportunities Fund, which was again the industry-leading, unconstrained bond fund during the quarter.
International retail net inflows of $7 billion were paced by strong flows into our global unconstrained fixed income and multi-asset franchises. In addition, our leading European equities franchise benefited from a return to a risk-on environment, and our top-quartile Asian equity funds gathered more than $800 million in aggregate flows during the quarter.
Global iShares generated over $35 billion of net new business in the first quarter, representing 14% annualized organic growth. iShares retained the #1 market share position of flows globally, with strong flows in each of our product segments: core, precision exposures, including our minimum volatility, factor and currency hedge suite; and financial instruments, where we saw ongoing momentum in replacing swaps and futures with ETFs. iShares' results were led by fixed income net inflows of $19 billion, and we, again, captured the #1 global market share of industry fixed income ETF flows. Equity flows of $17 billion were driven by flows into the Core Series and demand for international developed market and European exposures. iShares' flows were also diversified globally, with particularly strong growth in Europe, where we are seeing broad-based acceleration in ETF adoption across all segments and all asset classes. European iShares flows of $15 billion in the quarter represented annualized organic growth of over 25%.
Our institutional business generated approximately $21 billion in long-term net inflows for the quarter, the highest institutional flows we have seen since the BGI acquisition. Institutional index net inflows were led by strength in index equity, driven by defined contribution flows, offsetting outflows in our traditional defined benefit business. Institutional active net inflows of $18 billion reflected BlackRock's strong multi-asset capabilities and top-performing fixed income platform.
Multi-Asset inflows reflected significant solutions-based funding, particularly in the insurance outsourcing space, and strong demand for our dynamic diversified growth strategy and our LifePath target date series.
During the quarter, we also saw the funding of a $2 billion unconstrained fixed income separate account.
While institutional active equity flows were flat for the quarter, we saw inflows of nearly $2 billion into our scientific active equity business, where 96% of assets are performing above benchmark over a 5-year period.
Barbelling continues to be a key theme, as institutional clients' peer [ph] our cost-effective beta exposure with alternatives and other high-conviction alpha solutions to achieve uncorrelated returns. Net of approximately $700 million of capital successfully returned to clients, institutional alternatives generated $1 billion of net new business, led by infrastructure and hedge fund solutions. In addition, we had another strong fundraising quarter for illiquid alternatives, raising more than $2 billion in new commitments and now have over $10 billion in committed capital to deploy for clients $800 million of net new flows from the recently announced ABR retransaction funded in April and are not included in first quarter results. In connection with this funding, we will incur a product placement fee of approximately $5 million in the second quarter.
In summary, in a quarter marked by continued volatility and divergent macro trends, our diversified business continued to deliver stable financial results.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Our strong performance over the last quarter is a result of the significant investments we made in our firm over the last few years; the investments we made in our people, the inves",2228,"Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Our strong performance over the last quarter is a result of the significant investments we made in our firm over the last few years; the investments we made in our people, the investments we made in our process and, importantly, the investments we made in our technology, all of which have been driven by our efforts to continually adapt to our changing market environments, the changing world environments and to meet the needs of our clients.
BlackRock has focused on helping our clients navigate an increasingly difficult, unpredictable and divergent financial and economic landscape. Investors today are faced with volatility in currencies and commodity markets. They're faced with sustained, low and even negative interest rates and shifting long-term macro trends, including longevity and the significant impact on technology on jobs. Divergent economic conditions and central bank actions have sent currency markets into one of the most volatile periods on record, affecting both developed economies, such as Japan and the Eurozone, as well as the emerging markets. The relative value of the U.S. dollar and associated currency volatility is obviously having a rapid and material impact on large multinational companies. But it's also affecting smaller U.S. companies and consumers, who as a result of advancements in technology, are increasingly buying and selling products in a virtual global economy.
Historic low rates have been having a tremendous impact on how investors save for the future. The pool of funds in search of returns to meet future liabilities is growing larger every day. This mix of growing assets, of shrinking supply, of low rates, is creating a dangerous imbalance, and the increasingly desperate search for yield is now the greatest single source of prudential risk in the financial system.
At the same time, we're seeing powerful changes in longevity and retirement and the advancements in technology, making the global economy and the way capital flows -- flow through it. And this is having a major impact on how we and our clients are living, how our clients work and how we invest.
At BlackRock, we are constantly looking at the world and at ourselves to assess whether our platform, our services, our strategies can help our clients meet the challenges of an evolving investment landscape. The need to anticipate changes and develop solutions is why we have deliberately equipped BlackRock's business model with such a wide range of capabilities, a capability no other asset manager possesses. The issues impacting financial markets are beyond our ability to control. But what we can control at BlackRock is how we respond to these issues, how we build out our platform, how we execute our strategies we've set forth for our business and how we deliver investment solutions to our clients.
BlackRock's first quarter results demonstrate that the investments we made to differentiate our platform over time are driving value for our clients, and most certainly are driving value for our shareholders. In the first quarter, BlackRock generated $70 billion of long-term net inflows, representing a 6.5% quarterly annualized organic growth rate and a 5.5% organic growth rate over the last 12 months. Similar to our fourth quarter in 2014, we had a diverse composition of flows, something that was very, very important for me, as we -- as I think about our business. This composition of flows is positive across our client base, positive across asset classes, regions and investment styles. Particularly, we're seeing a significant momentum in our active business, where we experienced the highest total active flows we've seen since 2007 at $32 billion, representing a 9% organic -- annualized organic growth rate in the first quarter. Roughly 2/3 of the assets BlackRock manages are related to retirement. It's the core of what we do. And particularly, we are focused on helping investors shift their focus away from the nest egg and towards an annual income in retirement. This is a difficult adjustment for many investors, but a critical one for helping our clients achieve their goals. They face significant challenges in a near-0 rate environment. Core buying allocations alone are insufficient to meet the liability burdens of pension funds, to meet the needs of insurers and to meet the needs of our individual investors.
The diversity and strength of BlackRock's fixed income business is helping investors in all types to navigate that environment and drove $36 billion of net inflows across our global platform. We continue to benefit from strong performance across our fixed income business, where 91% of our active taxable fixed income AUM is above benchmark or peer median for a 3-year period. SIO is in the 14th percentile, high-yield bond is in the 10th percentile and Total Return is in the second percentile -- in the first percentile over 1 year. Clients also continue to adopt iShares fixed income ETFs as an efficient asset allocation and exposure tool. And iShares remains the global leader in fixed income in the first quarter, capturing the #1 market share of flows of 53%, with $19 billion of net inflows.
Today, investors are increasingly focused on outcome-oriented strategies that target specific goals, whether it's generating an income stream, preserving capital or growing assets within a certain risk profile. And they're moving beyond the bounds of traditional fixed income strategies into global, unconstrained or multi-asset [ph] strategies to achieve those objectives.
BlackRock's multi-asset platform, the combination of our investment management expertise, a robust portfolio of construction business and superior risk management, is all leveraging our unifying Aladdin platform, enabling us to provide investment strategies that will help our clients achieve the investment outcome in line with their needs and their objectives.
To counter low yields, retail investors are leveraging our Multi-Asset Income Fund, which casts a wide net across asset classes to tap into income opportunities, both within and beyond bonds, and has a dynamic approach to balancing risk, return in income, while seeking to mitigate volatility. Institutional investors are similarly turning to our dynamic diversified growth fund for diversification, for stable returns and also manage volatility.
Our ability to have deep and robust dialogue with our clients and to work closely with them and to provide some thought leadership is what is allowing us to provide more tailored, customized strategies. And this is a very important component of what is transforming BlackRock with our clients, the breadth of products, as I said earlier, our risk management capabilities. And you dovetail it all together, we have a more and deeper dialogue with more clients than we've ever had in our 27-year history. We saw more than $9 billion of solution-based funding for insurance clients in the quarter, as they continue to search for holistic solutions to navigate a low-yield environment. These transformational partnerships were the culmination of a true, one BlackRock effort, and the resulting mandates span the best of our firm; from active to passives, to alternatives, all powered by risk management and Aladdin capabilities. These custom solution assignments leverage our complete platform. They build deeper and more robust relationships with our clients, and clients are finding out that no other firm in our industry has the capabilities to create this type of partnership and to replicate these type of capabilities.
One key area where we are continuing to build out those capabilities even further is in infrastructure. Infrastructure investments help our clients access an alternative asset class that provides inflation protection, diversification and the potential for capital appreciation and, importantly for so many of our clients, a long-duration return. A key aspect of our work has been to promote improved public-private partnerships, which jointly increase opportunities for investors, and to help governments access much-needed sources of capital to drive economic growth, to create countries to have a better economic future, to improve the quality of life of countries and to create job creation. This is a perfect marriage of building a base of clients and their capital with the needs of countries in building a better economic future. And this is one of the strong reasons why we are emphasizing infrastructure over the next coming years as a major component of our positioning at BlackRock, our positioning with our clients and our positioning with various countries of the world.
In March, we teamed with PEMEX, Mexico's national oil company, to finance 2 natural pipelines -- gas pipelines critical to Mexico's continued economic growth. The partnership builds upon the well-established track record of our existing infrastructure business. And by expanding our infrastructure footprint in Mexico, we'll offer BlackRock's local and international clients access to a previously untapped investment opportunity.
Another area where we continue to invest is technology, which has always been central to our business model, our Aladdin platform, which we transformed from an internal risk and investment management system to a revenue-generating business, providing a unique competitive advantage for BlackRock. Aladdin revenues grew 13% year-over-year, and is increasing value as third parties' operating platforms position BlackRock to consistently invest a growing stream of revenues into improving our technology, into expanding our technological offerings, to powering a constant upgrade cycle for the Aladdin community and driving a network effect benefits for our clients and for our shareholders.
Technology has not only shaped the way BlackRock serves clients through Aladdin and how we view risk management, it also drives the way we build investment solutions. Technology and data science are enabling BlackRock to combine our fundamental investment expertise with the best of our scientific and index investing to create innovative investment strategies. And we're investing in people with exceptional, strong backgrounds in data technology to drive this effort.
Another area where we've been building our -- building out our capabilities is to meet the growing demand for investment offerings that have a measurable, positive social impact. I would put infrastructure as one of those capabilities. In the first quarter, we announced the launch of our new BlackRock Impact platform, which will truly unify the firm's approach to impact investing, where we currently manage more than $225 billion in assets.
And as a fiduciary, BlackRock takes seriously our responsibilities not only to provide the investment performance and the solutions our clients need, but we also are taking a leadership role in advocating for the best -- for our clients' best interests and those of the broader market and economy when it comes to long-term investments by the companies we invest on behalf of our clients. These efforts are led by our corporate governance team, which engages extensively with thousands of companies in order to help foster the best long-term outcome for those companies and, by doing so, increasing value for our clients. Our corporate governance team is a gold standard for the industry and is another key differentiating factor for BlackRock and our responsibilities with all our clients. As part of our engagement effort, earlier this week, I sent a letter to CEOs globally, including those of every company in the S&P 500, urging them to engage on key governance matters that in our experience supports long-term and sustainable financial performance. We recognize that some of the market dynamics that I described earlier present an overwhelming challenge for companies working to reset short-term pressures, but companies can help diminish these pressures and improve their own positioning by developing and articulating a clear, convincing and creating a long-term strategy and long-term value. These efforts will help them attract long-term stakeholders and lay the foundations for a stronger, a more sustainable and more stable economic growth for our country and other countries around the world.
Once again, in the first quarter, we initiated some truly innovative and unique mandates that will drive our long-term value for our clients and our investors. Our PEMEX partnership is the first of its kind since Mexico passed its historical energy reforms in 2013. We announced several highly customized solution mandates to help our global insurance clients navigate a historically challenging interest-rate environment. We partnered with ACE to launch a new vehicle that pairs the strengths of their insurance businesses with our ability to provide best-in-class investment returns. And in Asia, we're expanding our relationships with some of the world's largest asset owners in new ways, in one big case using Aladdin to better understand risk, and enhancing the quality of returns in a client's portfolio; and a second case, employing our transition management team to implement a landmark asset allocation change that a client is undertaking in an effort to stimulate their nation's economy.
Individually and collectively, these mandates demonstrate the BlackRock creativity, BlackRock's innovation and the breadth that BlackRock can provide for solution-oriented offerings. And more importantly, through that process, this creates and fosters deeper and more meaningful relationships with our clients, which will then allow us to have, in working with them, a larger share of their wallet. It is the strengthening of these relationships, our relentless focus on improving the firm that will drive our future growth and will drive and create long-term value for our shareholders.
Once again, I want to thank our employees for their continued, unwavering dedication in creating a better financial future for our clients. I want to thank the employees for being excellent students of the financial markets to be prepared to answer questions for all our clients. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions."

We are trying to help and achieve outcomes and I don't think we're harmed in any way related to whatever is proposed in the DOL.

So I would say the following, Glenn. I think, first of all, let's break it down. If we look at the revenue side, obviously, the revenue was impacted, as we said, by about $70 million in the year-ago quarter that we would deem more opportunistic. So obviously, a big chunk of that came from the performance fee, and then we had some significant transaction-related revenue in our FMA business. Obviously, then we've got the FX impact. And we noted that on a constant-currency basis, we think that base fees alone would've been probably up closer to 8% year-over-year. Then we looked at the expense side, and I think on the expense side, we're obviously benefiting to a certain extent from significant nondollar expense that we have. We have about 5,800 employees that sit outside of the Americas that represents close to I think 47% or 48% of our total employee base. But obviously, notwithstanding that, there's still margin associated with our nondollar sources of profitability. So I think, what I would suggest to you, I hate to start to get into the so-called normalization because who knows what the definition of normalization is, and that's a difficult concept. But I would say that on a more recurring basis, if we thought about our -- both our revenues and expenses, and there's obviously been some timing differences that we also noted on the expense side versus last year in terms of the real estate credit. And taking into account FX more broadly, we look at our own business on a more normalized basis and would suggest that we see positive year-over-year margin improvement and operating leverage."

I think as some fundamental products have underperformed and people are starting to recognize that our -- that 96% of our SAE products are above our peer medium over 5 years. And I think there is more interest today than we've seen in over 5 years for some type of model-based, factor-based investment strategies.

And I believe this is going to finally begin a period of substantial momentum in these areas.

Right now, we're seeing more flows internationally than domestic. We're seeing more decline than in government. And if rates change, that will reverse. So we're taking an approach where we have gone out to our clients and are talking to them about the future regulation and preparing products for them that will make sense depending upon where rates are. So some of those things would be, for example, we're going to be ready with constant net asset value government money market funds. And those will be without redemption gates or liquidity fees. We have the floating net asset value institutional client money market fund. And we plan to maintain our largest private fund, which we have about $66.5 billion invested temp [ph] fund, and that will be our prime institutional fund. And then we have others that we're preparing a floating rate short maturity institutional prime money market fund and a constant NAV government money market fund and short maturity national state-specific muni funds. We're also prepared to do separate accounts. So it really is going to depend upon where the regulation ends. Of course, you know that the implementation date of all of these new products are around October of 2016. So I think working together with our clients to make sure that we're prepared no matter where rates go is important for us. And year-over-year, we have about $39 billion that's been added into the cash funds. And that's about a 15% year-over-year growth. So there's still a lot of demand for a money market-type product, and it will just change some of the nuances to be able to apply with the regulatory issues. But this is a big business for us, and we also see some of the smaller money market groups approaching us as well because scale and size is also going to be very important to be able to satisfy our clients' needs."

So there's 2 parts to that question. One is people are looking on an institutional basis for precision exposures in particular areas like emerging markets, which would have a higher fee, versus buy-and-hold segments that are looking to supplement what they own with ETFs and what they call the Core Series. Now there is a difference in fee between the precision instruments, like in emerging markets; and the Core Series, which is more of a buy-and-hold segment. So quite frankly, we're seeing growth in both of those right now. But this is an area that is starting to gain attention and starting to mature. And what we're trying to do is develop a core set of products that is going to be for the buy-and-hold segment. We continue to round that out. We've had over $12 billion that's going into that core segment. In the quarter, we've had about a 25% organic growth in this global core segment versus just a 14% overall market share in the iShares business. But the point here is that there is somewhat of a fee shift, but it's not that dramatic, and it's not the overriding factor in people buying these iShares. It's segmentation. It's filling out their portfolios in what they want. And then of course, you have to be competitive in what they're buying. But we don't see an overall, dramatic change in the pricing on this or moving from high fee to lower fee, particularly in each segment."

And so we are very comfortable with the mix of business and how business is evolving. But more, we are winning new clients that we did not have or more buy-and-hold, where this was not where BlackRock had its -- had great market share. And as we penetrate more and more of the independent advisers that historically was more the landscape of a Vanguard, we're starting to see increased flows in our Core Series.

We are increasingly working on more trends that are impacting in a favorable way for us. So keep in mind, what are the trends in DC? There's a greater trend towards open architecture, really good for us in BlackRock. I mean, historically, we were harmed by closed architecture. More open architecture allows us to provide our products. Two, in DC, there's a greater demand for indexation. That obviously plays into our strength. Three, as an innovator in target date, we're benefiting from that. So you add those 3 combinations. Plus, we have witnessed in a lot of the $20 billion of flows because of our strong, active fixed income performance, we're seeing accelerated flows in those DC plans that are consistent and staying with the active strategy. So across the board, I would tell you, we have, probably, as large of opportunities in DC than we've had in years and years and years. And it's -- much of it has to do, as I discussed earlier, our positioning, our strength in performance and fixed income, our strength in designing target date products, a movement towards indexation. And much of it has to do with -- DC market's not growing as a whole. In fact, there's a belief that DC can slowly start decreasing as the men and women are getting closer to retirement are spending what they accrued.

And actually, we have pretty high aspirations for these. One of the ones that I'm a little disappointed in is the iBonds that we have because it really fits a client's portfolio so much better than buying individual bonds and taking the risk of the bid-offer spread and having more liquidity and pricing, diversification and look-through treatment. So I'm a little disappointed, but if I act on that and not propose the fund, I can tell you it took about 10 years to get our emerging markets fund off the ground and see real money come into it. So we're just going to go out there if we think it's a good product, talk to our clients, make sure we have the awareness, show them the positives of it, be able to evaluate the performance.

It has migrated a little bit to more corporate-based and activity-based. It is in comment period that we are sending comments to the FSB related to that. I think there's going to be a long dialogue. There was a meeting earlier this week at -- I think I saw reports related to it, related to the FSB meetings in New York with large investment management companies. I would say, from BlackRock's perspective, a year ago, 1.5 years ago, it was pretty lonely for us that we were one of the few firms having those meetings and educating regulators related to the risk associated with asset managers. We always note importantly that the asset management industry represents less than 20% of the capital markets. Asset owners are principally the largest players. They manage their own money, and they play a significant role, too. So if you want to affect the ecosystem and making sure the ecosystem is safe and protected for society and for investors, as we've said publicly, and we continue to try to educate, it has to be activity-based. And today now, because of the efforts of the FSB, tens of asset managers are now working alongside us. Industry groups are working alongside with us. So I'm actually pretty thrilled that there is more than -- there's more company, more people helping, spending time, educating. I don't know what the solution or the outcome will be, but we look at this as a long-based process. We want to be constructive. That is our #1 responsibility in making sure that in the end, it leads to a better, sounder financial system. We're all -- if we have that, as I talked about other issues related to long term-ism, I think BlackRock's the biggest beneficiary of more participation by more people because they believe it's a safer environment to invest. We'll be all -- I'm all in favor of it. However, there are differences of opinions, and we are trying to push our opinions, but it's going to be a long process. It's going to be very public about how the process plays out. I don't feel any -- I actually believe the process is more robust now with more conversation than we've had in a long time. And we'll see how this all plays out, Ken. I don't -- I can't give you any degree of where this is moving internationally. It would be kind of odd as the FSOC is moving towards outcome -- activities that the FSB comes with a different way. I would -- the question is, is this a Europe versus U.S. phenomenon? It's interesting to know what Europe is doing with Google and other issues in technology, attacking U.S. technology companies. So I'm -- we're participating in this. We're going to be good corporate citizens, and we're trying to do our best in education."

Two, our expansion in the RIA channels in the buy-and-hold channel is now being exhibited in our mutual funds. It's being exhibited in our Core Series ETF products, and I can't underscore enough how we are building out and expanding our global platform. And I am using infrastructure also as a mechanism to get stronger within these various countries side by side, building our brand in those countries, building our opportunities in those countries. Obviously, that's a long-term strategy, Michael. That's not something that we're going to witness and see significant changes. That's a good example of a 5, 7-year investment where we see on behalf of our clients. But it is also has a very significant impact on our positioning in these various countries as a leader in the investment business. So you think about those investments. We are -- I think we're going to continue to build market share in retail. We witnessed that for 4 straight years. Two, I think it's fair to say that ETFs are in a secular growth period that is not over yet. We are the biggest beneficiary of that secular growth. And then three, which I said for many years, if we can begin to build a stronger relationship institutionally with more clients and building, not a product-based relationship, but cross-selling of -- and solutions, we're going to start benefiting on the institutional side. So you add those together, it does allow us to have above-industry, and I want to underscore it, above-industry organic growth trends. And then if you add the amount of investments we're making not just in infrastructure, but across the board in alternatives, where it's not really -- is being shown up in the organic growth area because we, as I said, we want $10 billion commitments. We don't -- unlike a lot of the private equity firms, we don't show that in our AUM, but we identify the unfunded commitments. That's another good example of the power and the growth of the opportunity. So you tie this together, cross-selling products with institutions with better performance by providing solutions, by having even more market share opportunities in our Aladdin business, our iShares secular growth and our positioning in retail worldwide, plus better positioning, country by country, I think we're in a very good position to be leading above industry-trend market share and market growth.

It's my pleasure to be here to present the results for the second quarter of 2015. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results.  A",1654,"Thank you Matt, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to be here to present the results for the second quarter of 2015. 
Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results.  As usual, I'll be focusing primarily on our as adjusted results. 
Our second quarter results, again, demonstrates the value of the investments we've made to assemble the industry's broadest and most global suite of active and index investment offerings and to deliver differentiated customize investment solutions to our clients.  Our business model was purposely designed to deliver differentiated results in the current volatile market environment. 
Second quarter revenue of $2.9 billion was 5%  higher than a year ago while operating income of $1.2 billion was 10% higher on a year-over-year basis. 
Earnings per share of $4.96 were up 1% compared to a year ago, reflecting lower nonoperating results and a higher normalized tax rate in the current quarter. 
Nonoperating results for the quarter reflects $3 million of net investment losses, largely driven by net losses on unhedged or partially hedged multi-asset and fixed income investments. Recall that our first quarter nonoperative results included a onetime gain of $40 million related to the fair value of our pre-existing interest in BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors. 
Our as adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 30.1% compared to an as adjusted tax rate of 24.8% in last year's second quarter that benefited from several favorable nonrecurring items.  We currently estimate that 30% remains a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2015. 
Second quarter long term net outflows of $7 billion reflected elevated market volatility as $24 billion of net new business from active in iShares products was more than offset by $31 billion of low fee Institutional Index outflows. While this resulted in an all organic acid growth rate significantly less than our target for the quarter, our annualized long term organic-based fee growth rate was in excess of  5% as each of our retail and iShares businesses, along with the active component of our Institutional business generated positive organic growth in the second quarter. 
Over the last 12 months, notwithstanding the increasingly unsettled microenvironments, BlackRock's highly diversified platform generated approximately $180 billion of long term net new business, representing a 4% long term organic AUM growth rate and a 6% organic-based fee growth rate as faster growth in our higher fee channels continues to contribute to a favorable overall change in our base fee mix. 
We previously discussed the importance of organic-based fee growth rate to our business and we're always thinking about ways to improve our disclosure to help investors and analysts better understand our business. 
As you will note on Page 2 of our earnings supplement, we have now expanded our financial disclosure to include organic-based fee growth on a trailing 12-month basis to better reflect this positive mix change over time. 
Second quarter-based fees rose 4$ year-over-year as the average AUM increased due to organic growth of market depreciation despite $191 billion of negative FX impact associated with dollar appreciation against foreign currencies over the last 12 months. 
On a constant-currency basis, we estimate that quarter-based fees were approximately 8% year-over-year. 
Sequentially, based fees were up 6%, reflecting organic-based fee growth, the effect of 1 additional day in the quarter and seasonally higher securities lending fees. 
Performance fees of $136 million were up 18% from the year ago reflecting strong alpha generation in certain equity products that locked annually in the second quarter. 
BlackRock Solutions revenue of $161 million was up 10%, both year-over-year and sequentially. Our Aladdin business, which represented 80% of BRS revenue in the quarter were 14% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase is driven by several sizeable clients going live on the Aladdin platform over the last 12 months.  We continue to see strong market demand for global investment platform consolidation and multi-risk solutions. 
Revenue in our Financial Markets Advisory business was flat year-over-year reflecting the positive impact of residual disposition activity in last year's second quarter, but up $11 million sequentially driven by increased revenue from several advisory assignments associated with Bed CCAR diagnostics. 
Other income declined $9 million from a year ago, reflecting lower 12 B 1 fees and the impact of real estate related disposition fees a year ago. 
Total expense rose $12 million year-over-year or 1%, driven primarily by revenue-related items including incentive compensation of AUM related expense which were largely offset by a decline in G&A expense. 
Compensation and benefits includes $65 million year-over-year of 7% due to higher headcount and incentive compensation, partially offset by the impact of a stronger dollar. 
G&A expense decreased $65 million year-over-year as a result of lower levels of marketing spend in the current quarter and the impact of elevated legal and regulatory expense in the last year's second quarter. 
Sequentially, G&A expense decreased $27 million from the first quarter, driven by lower levels of marketing spend. 
Second quarter G&A expense also included a previously disclosed $4 million product placement fees associated with the recently announced ABR refunding. 
Our second quarter as adjusted operating margin of 44.9% was positively impacted by the lower level of quarterly G&A spend. 
Looking forward, we continue to anticipate a higher more normalized level of G&A spend during the second half of 2015. 
We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. 
In line with that commitment, on June 12, BlackRock announced the acquisition of e-Quadrada, the leading independently manage infrastructure investment business in Mexico. We expect to close this acquisition in the fourth quarter of this year. 
During the second quarter, we also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares and refinanced $750 million of debt with a 10 year, $700 million euro denominated notes during a 1.25% coupon. This represented our first euro-denominated debt issuance better aligning our capital structure with our global business. 
Our consistent earnings growth and stable financial results reflect the benefits of our diverse platform, long term client partnerships and commitment to investment performance. 
Second quarter long term net flows were impacted by over $30 billion of low fee institutional index outflows, which massed almost $13 billion of active inflows driven by our improving Fundamental Equity performance, top-tier fixed income performance and strength in our multi-asset and alternatives businesses. 
BlackRock's global retail franchise saw long term net inflows of $11 million, representing 8% annualized organic growth for the quarter and 10% organic asset growth over the last 12 months. 
Flows were driven by continued strength in outcome oriented offerings, including unconstrained fixed income and multi-asset strategies. 
International retail net inflows have driven $3 billion replaced by strong flows into global unconstrained fixed income and the international equities. 
For the quarter, our leading European equities franchise generated nearly $2 billion of net inflows while our top quartile Asian equities franchise gathered more than $1 billion in new assets. 
Leadership in these areas contributed to BlackRock maintaining its year-to-date #1 ranking in cross-border mutual fund flows and its market-leading position in the United Kingdom. 
U.S. Retail inflows of more than $7 billion reflected strong fixed income flows [indiscernible] broad-based even in a period of rising rates. Despite a challenging quarter for industry close and U.S. active mutual funds, the depth and breadth of our franchise position BlackRock to continue to grow market share as we ranked in the top 5 U.S. Retail industry flows for the quarter and saw a strong demand for iShares from U.S. Retail clients. 
Globalize iShares a generated $11 billion of net new flows, representing 4% annualized organic growth for the quarter and 11% organic growth over the last 12 months. 
While the ETF industry experienced quarterly volatility amid uncertainty in global economic growth and central bank policies, year-to-date flows for both iShares and the ETF industry remain on record territory. IShares retained its #1 global market share position for the first half of the year and remains well ahead of the competition in global fixed income flows. 
iShares' equity inflows of $9 billion were led by flows into non-U.S. equity exposures including our ETA and Japan funds. 
We continue to see heightened investor focus on risk management as our currency hedge funds gather nearly $4 billion and our minimum volatility funds raised more than $2 billion during the quarter. 
iShares fixed income inflows are approximately $2 billion reflected flows into investment-grade corporate and emerging markets bonds, offset by outflows from treasuries and high-yield as investors reposition portfolio submits global rate movements. 
Our Institutional business experience $29 billion in quarterly long term net outflows, primarily driven by $35 billion of low fee index equity outflows from several large clients looking to reallocate, rebalance or meet their cash needs. 
As previously mentioned, these low fee index outflows had a limited impact on organic-based fee growth for the quarter. 
Institutional act of net inflows of more than $2 billion reflects the BlackRock's strong multi-asset and alternatives capabilities, offset by outflows and active equities. Multi-asset inflows of more than $4 billion were driven by solutions based funding, particularly in the insurance outsourcing space and continued strong demand for our life [indiscernible] target this year. 
Excluding return of capital of approximately $1 billion net inflows of $2.3 billion into core institutional alternatives were broad-based including alternative solutions, hedge funds, real asset and fund to fund offerings. 
Fundraising momentum continued with an additional $1 billion of illiquid alternative commitments raised in the second quarter, bringing total unfunded commitments a source of future net inflows to approximately $11 billion. 
Active equity outflows of nearly $2 billion resulted from a single sub-advisory redemption. 
Overall, BlackRock's second quarter reflected continued growth and stability in a more volatile environment and once again demonstrated the value of our highly differentiated and diversified platform. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry"

Our second quarter results were driven by client's continued trust in BlackRock to help them navigate an increasingly unpredictable financial and economic landscape. Uncertainty and anticipation around the first Fed rate hike in 9 years and concern related to the possible impact of a Greek Eurozone exits has led to persistent volatility in currencies and risk asset prices and global interest rates. 
Turmoil in China's equity market has reached unprecedented levels and the impact of intervention is yet to be fully understood by our markets. 
Falling commodity prices continue to put pressure in commodity exporting economies and both governments and corporations are being meaningful impacted by relative currency valuations. 
Constrained liquidity conditions are further magnifying market stress and volatility and I believe this elevated volatility will be going forward and I believe a part of the market. 
Both asset allocation to beta and alpha products and active management will be material drivers of returns for investors as they look to stay ahead of the changing market dynamics. Each of those are the drivers impacted client behavior in the second quarter as we saw a shift inflows from a range of high-performing active products and iShares position exposures while experiencing redemptions and low fee broad market index accounts. The investments we made in our platform over time, once again, has enabled BlackRock to create this highly differentiated Investment Solutions across asset classes, investment styles and geographies for our clients. 
At BlackRock, we are focused on delivering our best thinking and resources to our clients in our portfolio management teams. The BlackRock Investment Institute continues to lead that discussion as evidenced by our recent client call on Greece, which was attended by nearly 3,000 clients. This level of engagement by our clients is translating into an increase partnership with BlackRock to meet their investment needs and more clients throughout the world are looking for BlackRock and BlackRock's ideas, which we believe over a long cycle world will lead to a more share of wallet with these clients. 
Our internal culture of the information sharing and our relentless focus on risk management and performance in our active businesses is also enhancing BlackRock's ability to generate alpha on behalf of our clients and has resulted in strength across our active platform in performance and in flows. 
We've been very vocal about addressing the performance challenges in our active equity business. More than 3 years ago, we began upgrading our portfolio of management teams in our Asian in our U.S. fundamental active equity franchises. While we knew these changes will result in a near-term outflows and it would take our team many years to build the performance track record, we have the conviction based on past successes in revamping our active fixed income business and we kept our focus on the long term for our clients. 
We've bought a new portfolio manager who is currently responsible for more than $50 billion in assets and those managers are delivering on their objectives of generating high-quality risk-adjusted returns. 
We've not only hired new talent, we invested in technology, we elevated young talent from organic growth internally and lengthy global equity platform together to more effectively leverage the benefit of BlackRock. 
Since the respect to start dates, those managers have generated more than $2 billion in alpha for BlackRock clients. As a global firm, our objective is constantly outperform across our fundamental active equity platform and we've seen top performance in a range of products and regions. 
For the 3-year period, in the United States, our basic value fund is in 11th percentile. 
In Europe, our European value fund in the fourth percentile. And in Asia, our Asian Dragon fund is in the 16th percentile. 
In the second quarter, BlackRock saw improvement in our overall fundamental active equity performance figures with 78% and 61% of our AUM is above market or peer medium for the 1- and 3-year period. 
A strong long term track records for European and Asian equity franchises, as Gary discussed, is translated into flows raising more than $3 billion collectively in the second quarter. We still have work to do with our fundamental active team but we remain highly confident in the enhancements we made with the team that we have on board and we are very encouraged by the direction the business is being -- is headed. 
We also saw continued strength and generation of strong performance across our model or Scientific Active Equity platform. With 85% and 95% of our assets above benchmark or peer medium for 1- and 3-year period. 
In our interactive fixed income performance remains strong across the platform with 89% of our assets above benchmark or peer medium for the 3-year period, translating into continued momentum in flows. 
Again, it's a divergent and volatile backdrop in a challenged quarter for industry flows, BlackRock saw a total of net long term outflows of $7 billion. As $24 billion in net inflows into active and iShares strategies was offset by a $31 billion net outflows in these low fee institutional index strategies. 
Importantly, from a regional perspective, we saw $18 billion of net inflows in the Americas, offset by a net outflows of $25 billion from international clients who are more directly exposed to all the macro challenges that I discussed. 
As Gary discussed, focusing solely on organic asset flows, this is a critical component of our story. BlackRock generated long term organic base fee growth of 5% in the second quarter, reflecting the effectiveness of our differentiated business model and the combination of active and indexed on a single platform. As higher fee active flows drove robust revenue growth more than offsetting any revenue loss from our index outflows. 
In the second quarter, we saw sizable institutional index equity outflows driven by redemptions from international and official institutional clients due to a variety of cash needs and asset allocation decisions. A number of those outflows [indiscernible] from our institutional clients however, a bit offset by inflows by the same clients into BlackRock's active strategies. This is a very important component that we all shall be focusing on because as we discussed how we are building our unique business model, having the ability to have clients internally move assets around, whether it's from beta to active or active to beta, this allows us to continue to build deeper and more elongated relationships with our clients. 
Year-to-date, we desire to reallocate or address cash needs growth. 10 of our largest clients will redeem over $40 billion in institutional index assets. However, those same clients reinvested across BlackRock's active equity and fixed income multi-asset and also alternative strategies resulting in a positive net revenue impact for the firm. This demonstrates the value, as I said earlier, of a deep, strategic relationship we remained with our clients and validates strongly the strength of our solution-oriented business model. 
Second quarter active net inflows of $13 billion was driven by fixed income multi-asset and alternatives. 
We remain bullish on the opportunities in active fixed income as investors stock though a prolonged low rate environment searching for both yield and capital preservation. 
BlackRock generated $9 billion of active fixed income net flows across unconstrained high yield and total return strategies. 
The breadth and diversity of BlackRock's fixed income platform resonated in the second quarter as clients repositioned assets to achieve their investment goals. For example, our iShares high yield range saw net outflows of $1.8 billion in the quarter. The top performance we have in our active high yield franchise position us to capture $2.4 billion in net inflows. 
Alternatives was also a contributor to inflows and organic base fee growth in the quarter with $2 billion in net inflows. Alternative flows were led by alternative solutions where BlackRock is leveraging our differentiated models and our market position to construct outcome-oriented, multi-alternative portfolios for clients. 
BlackRock continues to build out our capabilities and infrastructure which is an important asset class that provides long term returns for our clients. 
In the second quarter, BlackRock announced the acquisition of Mexico's leading independent managed infrastructure investment firm. This acquisition advanced BlackRock's growth strategy all throughout Latin America obviously and including Mexico. And demonstrates our firm strong commitment to being a leader infrastructure investments. This is a continuation of the expansion of our infrastructure footprint in Mexico following the partnership with PEMEX  we announced in March. We also believe that building out our infrastructure platforms throughout the globe will make us a stronger and a more meaningful leading player in each local market and I believe it's very imperative to understand infrastructure investing for BlackRock will lead us to have a stronger mutual footprint as we grow our businesses worldwide and as I said repeatedly over years and years, we need to be a local firm in every country to build the trust and the strength as we become much more of a global platform firm. 
Technology remains a key area of focus and investment for BlackRock across all aspects of our business to enhance our investment process, client service, operational efficiencies and in unifying Aladdin technology platform. Aladdin generated 14% revenue growth year-over-year and Aladdin's growing value as a third-party platform positions BlackRock to invest a consistent and growing stream of revenues into improving our technology and expanding our offerings. And indeed, more and more clients are looking for risk management platforms as more investors need to go more global, the need for a moment robust Capital Market-focused technology platform is more imperative today than any other time and BlackRock Solutions Aladdin is becoming the driving risk management platform that more and more clients are looking to take on. 
The next step in the evolution of our business and ability to generate Alpha is the further harnessing technology that create innovative investment strategies for our clients. 
Over the last few years, we have become increasingly focused in becoming a data-driven company. Available data is exploding for the financial services industry and the true winners will be the firm that can extract information and package it into innovative solutions that generate alpha and outcomes for our clients. 
We recently hired Dr. Andrew Ang to be head of our new factor-based strategy group. Andrew joins us from Columbia business school and is an innovator, in fact, he's been based investing in portfolio construction. 
Technology is also going to become a more important part of our adopting to our evolving fixed income landscape. Throughout the quarter, there've been elevated focus on the state of the fixed income markets. There are a variety of dynamics set play including extraordinary monetary policy, increased bond issuance and regulatory reform which is contributes to reduce dealer inventories and lower turnover. 
While media attention has only spiked in recent months, BlackRock has been focusing on the issues for several years, how to enhance our training capabilities, how to enhance our portfolio construction risk management as well as being a thought leader on the topic. 
Going forward, it is important for all market participants to recognize we can't turn back the clock. We need to shift the dial to look forward and focus on solutions. BlackRock hopes to play a constructive role in helping our clients meet the challenges of today's market environment. 
We're also making recommendations on what the regulators and market participants can do to help improve the market ecosystem using a three-pronged approach including modernizing the market structure, addressing liquidity challenges at the product level and embracing product innovation, like fixed income ECS. 
As our clients investment challenges evolves so does the nature of the solutions they required. BlackRock's business model was deliberately built to deliver a multifaceted solution to our clients. And I don't believe any other investment firm can provide this multifaceted solution. 
BlackRock's ability to leverage these capabilities across a diverse global platform of active and indexed equities, fixed income, multi-asset and alternative strategies, all backed by Aladdin Analytics, risk management advisory capabilities, leading investment performance and client service, makes sense here, continues to result in improved outcomes for our clients and our shareholders. 
As always, I want to thank our employees for their continued dedication to working at -- to create a better financial future for our clients. 
With that, I'll open it up for questions."

I think as we've talked about at length, what you guys -- the fee rates are constantly changing for us. It's a function of not only the organic component which I think we are now demonstrating to everybody that is in our control and as we continue to see stronger growth in our higher fee retailing iShares businesses which carry higher fee rates on an organic basis, nothing changes in the world we were expecting overall theory to be accretive for us. In other words, obviously organic revenue growth in excess of organic AUM growth obviously helps that over time. However, we can't control things like divergent data and FX and obviously, as we've talked about over time, that will have an impact depending on where we go. And this quarter, it happened to help us but in other quarters, it has hurt us over time. As you know U.S. equities rose about 5% over the last year. In terms of U.S. benchmark AUM, that's about 32% of our equity-based fees, but in fact, it's the lowest fee geography for us at around 13 basis points. On an FX adjusted basis, year-over-year we saw EM in Europe down between 10% and 12% each, commodity is down close to 30% and those buckets are about another 1/3 of our equity bases fees and have an average fee raise significantly higher around 46 basis points. So in this case, year-over-year the overall fee rate was down about 0.6 points or roughly it's about 22 basis points due to that. But we benefited from some of that. In the current quarter also, we had better mix and we had an additional day, which basically helped the sequential fee rate up close to 0.9 basis points."

What I think is really illustrative of all the hard work we've done over the last few years is we are now part of that dialogue and more and more clients that we are able to do this. As we suggested, a lot of them money in terms of the outflows were smart cash need driven by our clients for rainy day issues. And it's raining in some of the commodity-based economies. And so they're utilizing some of that. I think one of the things that is important to understand, I don't think the market understood how much was that were generated by all these large institutions internationally into the equity markets and in some cases, it's turned because they have needs for domestic needs. But we are seeing -- we have more increased dialogue on multi-assets in European equities, Asian equities, alternatives than we've ever had in the history of the firm. So the dialogue is more robust and certainly, a lot more complete and I think that's a component of the story. As Gary said, we can't control FX, we can't control divergent data. As Gary suggested, there has been quite a bit of divergent data in the commodity base up. Even in the last few weeks of June, first few weeks of July, we've seen more divergent data again. And so, we can't control that, but we certainly have -- and probably the key issue that we can control, deeper, more robust conversation with more clients worldwide."

Obviously -- let me just step back and say, a, if the market is a safer, stronger market and more people believe that the market is a great place, if regulation does add greater safety and soundness in the minds of more and more investors, will be the biggest beneficiary. So our whole approach to regulatory conversation is somewhat different than with some the other leaders in the industry. We are -- we have traditionally -- and I continue to believe -- we will continue to do that tradition of having a deep dialogue with regulators using our international knowledge of what's going on and helping them try to understand what would be the best way to make it safer and sounder dialogue. So I don't  want to say the conversation is going to be more relaxed in the future because we need to still work with the regulators understanding what are the potential issues. As the world becomes more dependent on capital markets and that's happening now as of the ecosystem change with higher capital standards with banks and more and more enterprises, whether it's companies or individuals for using capital markets for raising capital, both debt and equity, we need a safe and sound ecosystem and if it needs to have it more supervision in some of the activities, we may be in favor of that. So we are going to work towards building a safer and sounder capital markets and we have enjoyed the relationships with the regulators and obviously, they don't have to listen to us. They are our regulators but by having what I would call a constructive dialogue, I believe it allows us to be part of the conversation and hopefully, this will lead to a better outcome."

Hey, higher rates will lead to more players in fixed income not less. And I'll get into that in a minute. Secondarily, 70% of our fixed income investors are pension and insurance companies. They're not influenced by market moves. They're trying to match the liability and that's the problem. The narrative -- they're not the players who are going flip around the interest rates. But the true component is, so many pension funded insurance have worked so hard by lower interest rates. In some cases, we know many insurance companies have actually a wide gap  -- the liabilities are longer than their assets -- so if we actually saw rising rate environment, this is quite additive to the balance sheet of insurance companies. If we saw a rise in interest rates, especially in the short end, the pension funds liabilities were look less onerous because it's all based on their funding rate and the capital rate they're used for the short term rates. In fact, many pension funds, if we saw a real spike in interest rates would -- de fees a lot of their pension liabilities. So higher rates actually is good for most long term investors and they're not particularly concerned about rising rates and are going to have money because the liability -- they bought these fixed interest items against certain fixed base liabilities and so they're not going to be that harmed on it. Now they may have accounting treatment differentials, but it's not going to be a big issue. It -- and for those who believe they want to navigate around the potentiality of higher rates, they're going to navigate from a long dated asset -- longer duration fixed income product to a shorter duration one. So -- and for those who still need to be in more long duration, but they're going to go into more of the unconstrained products that we are the leading driver inflows. So I -- I think people just forget -- they're implying that everybody's a hedge fund when higher rates means everybody's -- abandoning bond funds. Now some individuals, we're in fixed income because of safety and soundness. They don't generally whip them around either. They're generally holding them to maturity. But another thing, Alex, that I think that we are miscalculating, too, more and more moneys are going to fund contribution plans. More and more defined contribution plans are using target date types of structures and last I checked, we're living longer but more importantly, were all aging, at least I am. And as age, you're going to have a higher component of fixed income. So I would tell you fundamentally, demographically and all the things that were structurally seeing the way people are positioned, higher rates is not a bad thing for the fixed income market for the core investors."

And I wouldn't -- I really wouldn't read too much entered into a trend basis, it was simply low G&A quarter relative to historical spend levels.

I do believe retirement -- in inadequacy in retirement is going to be the big story in the coming years. I do believe the elevated savings rates that we're just seeing so far in the first 6 months possibly could be related to people starting to become more aware that they have an in adequate retirement plan. So we will be vigilant and outspoken on retirement issues. Look, related specifically -- your question, the need of investors are going to be differing. We all want good out -- good investment outcomes and we need to make sure that we, as an industry, provide client choice -- hopefully, client choice with low-cost. Cost is -- can't be primary because we have to be outcome heightened focus. Obviously, outcome-focused would cause -- is the emphasis and not the other way around. So the DLLs indicated interest for comments, so we submitted a commentary. We're going to have to wait and see how this all plays out. I don't think -- I don't believe we understand our habit of information to know how this will all play out. I think this will be evolving but we are working constructively with the DoL.

It's just that it's been more one-sided because it's more demand right now. So there really isn't the large secondary market. I don't call that a liquid, I call that over demand for yield securities because of the environment. So as interest rates rise, that will change a bit, but we think that, this has been providing good opportunity in the marketplace and just think of how large the fixed income market is and when you take a look at that, any percentage, any small percentage increase in ETFs so the the Fixed Income Markets is going to be very substantial and very large.

So this is one of the -- people don't understand -- when they talk about it, they just don't talk about the market dynamics. So for every buyer, there's a seller. You're not creating or redeeming the underlying assets. So for -- during a market opening, the ETFs is providing more liquidity. When you think about a mutual fund, a mutual fund in bonds is accumulating buyers and sellers throughout the day and at the final end of the day, they find out if they have to sell their underlying stocks -- our excuse me, bonds at the end of the day or the next morning because of the cash. So the ETFs actually is as Rob suggested, a provider of liquidity. It also creates the transparency of where the markets are and it's -- there's another surprise to me on the narrative. The narrative that you are able to transact bond sales and purchases in mass. By utilizing one stock, you're able to reduce the underlying assets and the need for a lot of sales of bonds, a lot of purchases bonds inter-day. And that's why a major component of why ETFs are additive to the liquidity and more importantly, they create transparency. And we've been telling the story for years. We've witnessed it. The Federal Reserve actually came up with a research report -- this is more related emerging market equities on the same concept that a provider liquidity. So we're still dismayed at the narrative."

It's my pleasure to be here to present results for the second quarter of 2015. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. As usua",1632,"Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to be here to present results for the second quarter of 2015. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. As usual, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. 
Our second quarter results, again, demonstrates the value of the investments we've made to assemble the industry's broadest and most global suite of active and index investment offerings and to deliver differentiated, customized investment solutions to our clients. Our business model was purposely designed to deliver differentiated results in the current volatile market environment. 
Second quarter revenue of $2.9 billion was 5% higher than a year ago while operating income of $1.2 billion was 10% higher on a year-over-year basis. Earnings per share of $4.96 were up 1% compared to a year ago, reflecting lower nonoperating results and a higher normalized tax rate in the current quarter. 
Nonoperating results for the quarter reflect $3 million of net investment losses, largely driven by net losses on unhedged or partially hedged multi-asset and fixed income seed investments. Recall that our first quarter nonoperating results included a onetime gain of $40 million related to the fair value of our pre-existing interest in BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors. 
Our as-adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 30.1% compared to an as-adjusted tax rate of 24.8% in last year's second quarter that benefited from several favorable nonrecurring items. We currently estimate that 30% remains a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2015. 
Second quarter long-term net outflows of $7 billion reflected elevated market volatility as $24 billion of net new business from active and iShares products was more than offset by $31 billion of low-fee institutional index outflows. While this resulted in an organic asset growth rate significantly less than our target for the quarter, our annualized, long-term organic based fee growth rate was in excess of 5% as each of our retail and iShares businesses, along with the active component of our institutional business generated positive organic growth in the second quarter. 
Over the last 12 months, notwithstanding the increasingly unsettled macro environment, BlackRock's highly diversified platform generated approximately $180 billion of long-term net new business, representing a 4% long-term organic AUM growth rate and a 6% organic base fee growth rate as faster growth in our higher-fee channels continues to contribute to a favorable overall change in our base fee mix. 
We previously discussed the importance of organic base fee growth rate to our business, and we're always thinking about ways to improve our disclosure to help investors and analysts better understand our business. As you will note on Page 2 of our earnings supplement, we have now expanded our financial disclosure to include organic base fee growth on a trailing 12-month basis to better reflect this positive mix change over time. 
Second quarter-based fees rose 4% year-over-year as the average AUM increased due to organic growth of market depreciation despite $191 billion of negative FX impact associated with dollar appreciation against foreign currencies over the last 12 months. On a constant-currency basis, we estimate that quarterly base fees were approximately 8% year-over-year. Sequentially, base fees were up 6%, reflecting organic base fee growth, the effect of one additional day in the quarter and seasonally higher securities lending fees. Performance fees of $136 million were up 18% from a year ago, reflecting strong alpha generation in certain equity products that locked annually in the second quarter. 
BlackRock Solutions revenue of $161 million was up 10%, both year-over-year and sequentially. Our Aladdin business, which represented 80% of BRS revenue in the quarter, grew 14% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase is driven by several sizeable clients going live on the Aladdin platform over the last 12 months. We continue to see strong market demand for global investment platform consolidation and multi-risk solutions. 
Revenue in our Financial Markets Advisory business was flat year-over-year reflecting the positive impact of residual disposition activity in last year's second quarter, but up $11 million sequentially, driven by increased revenue from several advisory assignments associated with Fed CCAR diagnostics. Other income declined $9 million from a year ago, reflecting lower 12b-1 fees and the impact of real estate-related disposition fees a year ago. 
Total expense rose $12 million year-over-year or 1%, driven primarily by revenue-related items, including incentive compensation of AUM-related expense, which were largely offset by a decline in G&A expense. Compensation and benefits increased $65 million year-over-year or 7%, due to higher headcount and incentive compensation, partially offset by the impact of a stronger dollar. 
G&A expense decreased $65 million year-over-year as a result of lower levels of marketing spend in the current quarter and the impact of elevated legal and regulatory expense in the last year's second quarter. Sequentially, G&A expense decreased $27 million from the first quarter, driven by lower levels of marketing spend. Second quarter G&A expense also included a previously disclosed $4 million product placement fee associated with the recently announced ABR refunding. 
Our second quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 44.9% was positively impacted by the lower level of quarterly G&A spend. Looking forward, we continue to anticipate a higher, more normalized level of G&A spend during the second half of 2015. 
We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment, on June 12, BlackRock announced the acquisition of I Cuadrada, the leading independently managed infrastructure investment business in Mexico. We expect to close this acquisition in the fourth quarter of this year. 
During the second quarter, we also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares and refinanced $750 million of debt with a 10-year, $700 million euro-denominated note bearing a 1.25% coupon. This represented our first euro-denominated debt issuance, better aligning our capital structure with our global business. 
Our consistent earnings growth and stable financial results reflect the benefits of our diverse platform, long-term client partnerships and commitment to investment performance. Second quarter long-term net flows were impacted by over $30 billion of low-fee institutional index outflows, which masked almost $13 billion of active inflows, driven by our improving Fundamental Equity performance, top-tier fixed income performance and strength in our multi-asset and alternatives businesses. BlackRock's global retail franchise saw long-term net inflows of $11 million, representing 8% annualized organic growth for the quarter and 10% organic asset growth over the last 12 months. Flows were driven by continued strength in outcome-oriented offerings, including unconstrained fixed income and multi-asset strategies. 
International retail net inflows have risen $3 billion, were paced by strong flows into global unconstrained fixed income and international equities. For the quarter, our leading European equities franchise generated nearly $2 billion of net inflows while our top-quartile Asian equity franchise gathered more than $1 billion in new assets. Leadership in these areas contributed to BlackRock maintaining its year-to-date #1 ranking in cross-border mutual fund flows and its market-leading position in the United Kingdom. 
U.S. retail inflows of more than $7 billion reflected strong fixed income flows [indiscernible] broad based even in a period of rising rates. Despite a challenging quarter for industry flows of U.S. active mutual funds, the depth and breadth of our franchise position BlackRock to continue to grow market share as we ranked in the top-5 U.S. retail industry flows for the quarter and saw a strong demand for iShares from U.S. retail clients. 
Global iShares generated $11 billion of net new flows, representing 4% annualized organic growth for the quarter and 11% organic growth over the last 12 months. While the ETF industry experienced quarterly volatility amid uncertainty in global economic growth and central bank policies, year-to-date flows for both iShares and the ETF industry remain in record territory. IShares retained its #1 global market share position for the first half of the year and remains well ahead of the competition in global fixed income flows. iShares' equity inflows of $9 billion were led by flows into non-U.S. equity exposures, including our ETA and Japan funds. 
We continue to see heightened investor focus on risk management as our currency hedge funds gather nearly $4 billion, and our minimum volatility funds raised more than $2 billion during the quarter. 
iShares fixed income inflows of approximately $2 billion reflected flows into investment-grade corporate and emerging markets bonds, offset by outflows from treasuries and high yield as investors reposition portfolio amidst global rate movements. 
Our institutional business experienced $29 billion in quarterly long-term net outflows, primarily driven by $35 billion of low-fee index equity outflows from several large clients looking to reallocate, rebalance or meet their cash needs. As previously mentioned, these low-fee index outflows had a limited impact on organic base fee growth for the quarter. 
Institutional active net inflows of more than $2 billion reflected BlackRock's strong multi-asset and alternatives capabilities, offset by outflows in active equities. Multi-asset inflows of more than $4 billion were driven by solutions-based funding, particularly in the insurance outsourcing space, and continued strong demand for our LifePath target [indiscernible]. 
Excluding return of capital of approximately $1 billion, net inflows of $2.3 billion into core institutional alternatives were broad based, including alternative solutions, hedge funds, real asset and fund-to-fund offerings. Fund-raising momentum continued with an additional $1 billion of illiquid alternative commitments raised in the second quarter, bringing total unfunded commitments, a source of future net inflows, to approximately $11 billion. Active equity outflows of nearly $2 billion resulted from a single sub-advisory redemption. 
Overall, BlackRock's second quarter reflected continued growth and stability in a more volatile environment and once again demonstrated the value of our highly differentiated and diversified platform. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry"

And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Our second quarter results were driven by clients' continued trust in BlackRock to help them navigate an increasingly unpredictable financial and economic landscape. Uncertai",2049,"Thank you, Gary. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Our second quarter results were driven by clients' continued trust in BlackRock to help them navigate an increasingly unpredictable financial and economic landscape. Uncertainty and anticipation around the first Fed rate hike in 9 years and concern related to the possible impact of a Greek Eurozone exit has led to persistent volatility in currencies, in risk asset prices and global interest rates. 
Turmoil in China's equity market has reached unprecedented levels and the impact of intervention is yet to be fully understood by our markets. Falling commodity prices continue to put pressure on commodity exporting economies. And both governments and corporations are being meaningful impacted by relative currency valuations. 
Constrained liquidity conditions are further magnifying market stress and volatility, and I believe this elevated volatility will be going forward and I believe, a part of the market. Both asset allocation to beta and alpha products and active management will be material drivers of returns for investors as they look to stay ahead of the changing market dynamics. 
Each of those drivers impacted client behavior in the second quarter, as we saw a shift in flows from a range of high-performing active products and iShares precision exposures, while experiencing redemptions in low-fee broad market index accounts. The investments we made in our platform over time, once again, has enabled BlackRock to create this highly differentiated Investment Solutions across asset classes, investment styles and geographies for our clients. 
At BlackRock, we are focused on delivering our best thinking and resources to our clients in our portfolio management teams. The BlackRock Investment Institute continues to lead that discussion, as evidenced by our recent client call on Greece, which was attended by nearly 3,000 clients. This level of engagement by our clients is translating into increased partnership with BlackRock to meet their investment needs. And more clients throughout the world are looking for BlackRock and BlackRock's ideas, which we believe over a long cycle, will lead to more share of wallet with these clients. Our internal culture of information sharing and our relentless focus on risk management and performance in our active businesses is also enhancing BlackRock's ability to generate alpha on behalf of our clients and has resulted in strength across our active platform in performance and in flows. 
We've been very vocal about addressing the performance challenges in our active equity business. More than 3 years ago, we began upgrading our portfolio of management teams in our Asian and our U.S. fundamental active equity franchises. While we knew these changes will result in a near-term outflows and it would take our team many years to build a performance track record, we have the conviction based on past successes in revamping our active fixed income business and we kept our focus on the long term for our clients. 
We've hired new portfolio manager, who are currently responsible for more than $50 billion in assets. And those managers are delivering on their objectives of generating high-quality risk-adjusted returns. We not only hired new talent, we invested in technology, we elevated young talent from organic growth internally and linked the global equity platform together to more effectively leverage the benefits to BlackRock. Since their respective start dates, those managers have generated more than $2 billion in alpha for BlackRock clients. 
As a global firm, our objective is to constantly outperform across our fundamental active equity platform, and we've seen top performance in a range of products and regions. For the 3-year period, in the United States, our Basic Value Fund is in the 11th percentile. In Europe, our European Value Fund is in the fourth percentile. And in Asia, our Asian Dragon Fund is in the 16th percentile. 
In the second quarter, BlackRock saw improvement in our overall fundamental active equity performance figures, with 78% and 61% of our AUM is above market or peer medium for the 1- and 3-year period. 
And strong long-term track records for our European and Asian equity franchises, as Gary discussed, is translated into flows, raising more than $3 billion collectively in the second quarter. We still have work to do with our fundamental active team, but we remain highly confident in the enhancements we made with the team that we have on board. And we are very encouraged by the direction the business is being -- is headed. We also saw continued strength and generation of strong performance across our model or scientific active equity platform, with 85% and 95% of our assets above benchmark or peer medium for 1- and 3-year period. And in our active fixed income, performance remains strong across the platform with 89% of our assets above benchmark or peer medium for the 3-year period, translating into continued momentum in flows. 
Against a divergent and volatile backdrop and a challenged quarter for industry flows, BlackRock saw a total of net long-term outflows of $7 billion. As $24 billion in net inflows into active and iShares strategies was offset by a $31 billion net outflows in these low-fee institutional index strategies. Importantly, from a regional perspective, we saw $18 billion of net inflows in the Americas, offset by a net outflows of $25 billion from international clients, who are more directly exposed to all the macro challenges that I discussed. 
As Gary discussed, focusing solely on organic asset flows, this is a critical component of our story. BlackRock generated long-term organic base fee growth of 5% in the second quarter, reflecting the effectiveness of our differentiated business model and the combination of active and index on a single platform. As higher-fee active flows drove robust revenue growth more than offsetting any revenue loss from our index outflows. 
In the second quarter, we saw sizable institutional index equity outflows driven by redemptions from international and official institutional clients due to a variety of cash needs and asset allocation decisions. A number of those outflows from institutional clients, however, have been offset by inflows by the same clients into BlackRock's active strategies. This is a very important component that we all should be focusing on because, as we discuss how we are building our unique business model, having the ability to have clients internally move assets around, whether it's from beta to active or active to beta, this allows us to continue to build deeper and more elongated relationships with our clients. 
Year-to-date, a desire to reallocate or address cash needs drove 10 of our largest clients to redeem over $40 billion in institutional index assets. However, those same clients reinvested across BlackRock's active equity and fixed income multi-asset and also alternative strategies resulting in a positive net revenue impact for the firm. This demonstrates the value, as I said earlier, of a deep, strategic relationship we remain with our clients and validates strongly the strength of our solution-oriented business model. 
Second quarter active net inflows of $13 billion was driven by fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives. We remain bullish on the opportunities in active fixed income, as investors stuck to a prolonged low-rate environment searching for both yield and capital preservation. BlackRock generated $9 billion of active fixed income net flows across unconstrained high yield and total return strategies. 
The breadth and diversity of BlackRock's fixed income platform resonated in the second quarter, as clients repositioned assets to achieve their investment goals. For example, our iShares high-yield range saw net outflows of $1.8 billion in the quarter. The top performance we have in our active high yield franchise positioned us to capture $2.4 billion in net inflows. 
Alternatives was also a contributor to inflows and organic base fee growth in the quarter, with $2 billion in net inflows. Alternative flows were led by Alternative Solutions where BlackRock is leveraging our differentiated model and our market position to construct outcome-oriented, multi-alternative portfolios for our clients. 
BlackRock continues to build out our capabilities in infrastructure, which is an important asset class that provides long term returns for our clients. 
In the second quarter, BlackRock announced the acquisition of Mexico's leading independent managed infrastructure investment firm. This acquisition advanced BlackRock's growth strategy all throughout Latin America, obviously and including Mexico, and demonstrates our firm, strong commitment to being a leader infrastructure investments. This is a continuation of the expansion of our infrastructure footprint in Mexico following the partnership with PEMEX we announced in March. We also believe that building out our infrastructure platforms throughout the globe will make us a stronger and a more meaningful leading player in each local market. And I believe it's very imperative to understand infrastructure investing for BlackRock will lead us to have a stronger mutual footprint as we grow our businesses worldwide. And as I said repeatedly over years and years, we need to be a local firm in every country to build the trust and the strength as we become much more of a global platform firm. 
Technology remains a key area of focus and investment for BlackRock across all aspects of our business to enhance our investment process, client service, operational efficiencies and our unifying Aladdin technology platform. Aladdin generated 14% revenue growth year-over-year, and Aladdin's growing value as a third-party platform positions BlackRock to invest a consistent and growing stream of revenues into improving our technology and expanding our offerings. And indeed, more and more clients are looking for risk management platforms. As more investors need to go more global, the need for a more robust capital market-focused technology platform is more imperative today than any other time. And BlackRock Solutions' Aladdin is becoming the driving risk management platform that more and more clients are looking to take on. 
The next step in the evolution of our business and ability to generate alpha is to further harnessing technology to create innovative investment strategies for our clients. Over the last few years, we have become increasingly focused in becoming a data-driven company. Available data is exploding for the financial services industry, and the true winners will be the firms that can extract information and package it into innovative solutions that generate alpha and outcomes for our clients. 
We recently hired Dr. Andrew Ang to be our head of our new factor-based strategy group. Andrew joins us from Columbia Business School and is an innovator in factor-based investing and portfolio construction. 
Technology is also going to become a more important part of our adopting to our evolving fixed income landscape. Throughout the quarter, there've been elevated focus on the state of the fixed income markets. There are a variety of dynamics at play, including extraordinary monetary policy, increased bond issuance and regulatory reform, which has contributed to reduced dealer inventories and lower turnover. While media attention has only spiked in recent months, BlackRock has been focusing on the issues for several years: How to enhance our training capabilities. How to enhance our portfolio construction and risk management as well as being a thought leader on the topic. 
Going forward, it is important for all market participants to recognize that we can't turn back the clock. We need to shift the dialogue to look forward and focus on solutions. BlackRock hopes to play a constructive role in helping our clients meet the challenges of today's market environment. We are also making recommendations on what the regulators and market participants can do to help improve the market ecosystem using a three-prong approach, including modernizing the market structure, addressing liquidity challenges at the product level and embracing product innovation, like fixed income ETFs. 
As our clients' investment challenges evolve, so does the nature of the solutions they require. BlackRock's business model was deliberately built to deliver a multi-facet solution to our clients. And I don't believe any other investment firm can provide this multifaceted solution. BlackRock's ability to leverage these capabilities across a diverse global platform of active and index equities, fixed income, multi-asset and alternative strategies, all backed by Aladdin analytics, risk management advisory capabilities, leading investment performance in client service -- big sentence here, continues to result in improved outcomes for our clients and our shareholders. As always, I want to thank our employees for their continued dedication to working -- to create a better financial future for our clients. 
With that, I'll open it up for questions."

I think as we've talked about at length with you guys, the fee rates are constantly changing for us. It's a function of not only the organic component, which I think we're now demonstrating to everybody, that is in our control. And as we continue to see stronger growth in our higher fee retailing iShares businesses, which carry higher fee rates on an organic basis, if nothing else changes in the world, we would expect the overall fee rate to be accretive for us. In other words, obviously, organic revenue growth in excess of organic AUM growth obviously helps that over time. However, we can't control things like divergent beta and FX. And obviously, as we've talked about over time, that will have an impact depending on where we go. In this quarter, it happened to help us. But in other quarters, it has hurt us over time. 
As you know U.S. equities rose about 5% over the last year. In terms of U.S. benchmark AUM, that's about 32% of our equity base fees. But in fact, it's the lowest fee geography for us at around 13 basis points. On an FX adjusted basis, year-over-year we saw EM in Europe down between 10% and 12% each. Commodity is down close to 30% and those buckets are about another third of our equity base fees and have average fee rates significantly higher, around 46 basis points. So in this case, year-over-year the overall fee rate was down about 0.6 points, or roughly it's about 22 basis points due to that. But we benefited from some of that. In the current quarter also, we had better mix and we had an additional day, which basically helped the sequential fee rate up close to 0.9 basis points."

What I think is really illustrative of all the hard work we've done in the last few years is we are now part of that dialogue and more and more clients that we are able to do this. As we suggested, a lot of the money that was -- in terms of the outflows, was more cash-need driven by our clients for rainy day issues. And it's raining in some of the commodity-based economies and so they're utilizing some of that. I think one of the things that is important to understand, I don't think the market understood how much flows that were generated by these large institutions internationally into the equity markets and in some cases, it's turned because they have need for domestic needs. But we are seeing -- we have more increased dialogue on multi-assets in European equities, Asian equities, alternatives than we've ever had in the history of the firm. So the dialogue is more robust and certainly, a lot more complete and I think that's a component of the story. As Gary said, we can't control FX. We can't control divergent beta. As Gary suggested, there has been quite a bit of divergent beta in the commodity based stuff. Even in the last few weeks of June, the first few weeks of July, we've seen more divergent beta again. And so, we can't control that, but we certainly have -- and probably the key issue that we can control: deeper, more robust conversation with more clients worldwide."

Obviously -- let me just step back and say: a, if the market is a safer, stronger market and more people believe that the market is a great place, if regulation does add greater safety and soundness in the minds of more and more investors, we'll be the biggest beneficiary. So our whole approach to regulatory conversation is somewhat different than with some the other leaders in the industry. We are -- we have traditionally, and I continue to believe we will continue to do that tradition of having a deep dialogue with regulators using our international knowledge of what's going on and helping them try to understand what would be the best way to make a safer and sounder dialogue. So I don't want to say the conversation is going to be more relaxed in the future, because we need to still work with the regulators, understanding what are the potential issues as the world becomes more dependent on capital markets. And that's happening now. As the ecosystem change with higher capital standards with banks, and more and more enterprises, whether it's companies or individuals are using capital markets for raising capital, both debt and equity, we need a safe and sound ecosystem. And if it means to having more supervision in some of the activities, we may be in favor of that. So we are going to work towards building a safer and sounder capital markets, and we have enjoyed deep relationships with the regulators. And obviously, they don't have to listen to us. They are our regulators and -- but by having what I would call a constructive dialogue, I believe it allows us to be part of the conversation. And hopefully, this will lead to a better outcome."

And I'll",507,"So I find this humorous narrative of -- there was a big article a couple of days ago. I think even Barron had a big article about, oh, what's going to happen in fixed income. Hey, higher rates will lead to more players in fixed income, not less. And I'll get into that in a minute. Secondarily, 70% of our fixed income investors are pension and insurance companies. They're not influenced by market moves. They're trying to match a liability. And that's the problem with the narrative. They're not the players who are going whip around the interest rates. They're -- but the true component is, so many pension-funded insurance companies work so hard by lower interest rates. In some cases, we know many insurance companies have actually a wide gap. Their liabilities are longer than their assets. So if we actually saw a rising rate environment, this is actually quite additive to the balance sheets of insurance companies. If we saw a rise in interest rates, especially in the short end, the pension funds' liabilities will look less onerous because it's all based on their funding rate and the capital rate they used for their short-term rates. In fact, many pension funds, if we saw a real spike in interest rates, would de-fees [ph] a lot of their pension liabilities. So higher rates actually is good for most long-term investors and they're not particularly concerned about rising rates and they're going to have money because their liability -- they bought these fixed interest items against certain fixed-based liabilities and so they're not going to be that harmed on it. Now they may have some accounting treatment differentials, but it's not going to be a big issue. It -- and for those who believe they want to navigate around the potentiality of higher rates, they're going to navigate from a long-dated asset -- longer-duration fixed income product to a shorter duration one. So -- and for those who still need to be in more long duration, but they're going to go into more of the unconstrained products that we are the leading driver in flows. So I think people just forget -- they're implying that everybody's a hedge fund when higher rates means everybody's going to be abandoning bond funds. Now some individuals -- we're in fixed income because of safety and soundness. They don't generally whip them around either. They're going to hold them to maturity. But another thing, Alex, that I think we are miscalculating, too: More and more money is going in defined contribution plans. More and more defined contribution plans are using target-date types of structures. And last I checked, we're living longer but more importantly, we're all aging, at least I am. And as you age, you're going to have a higher component of fixed income. So I would tell you, fundamentally, demographically and all the things that we're structurally seeing the way people are positioned, higher rates is not a bad thing for the fixed income market for the core investors."

Look, I think as we look at the quarter, I think there's no question that our second quarter margin benefited from a low level of G&A spend. If you recall last quarter, where many of you pointed out a year-over-year decline in our operating margin, we communicated to you that we felt our reported year-over-year margin comparison really understated the operating leverage in the business. And I think this quarter, frankly, we had the opposite. I think that our 250 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion is overstated by a lower level of G&A spend that, frankly, is not likely sustainable. 
Look, part of the lower level of G&A spend in the quarter is better financial discipline in the current environment. But part of it is, frankly, simply expenses that came in lower than we expected. And I wouldn't -- I really wouldn't read too much into it on a trend basis. It was simply a low G&A quarter relative to historical spend levels. 
Looking forward, I think I would say we continue to anticipate a higher, more normalized level of G&A spend in the second half of the year. And at this time, we're not intending to ""push out"", I think the words that you may have used, to reduce second quarter spend into the back half of the year."

So it's become not only a way to express your view in the market, but you can express it in a much more precise way. So a lot of the flows that we're seeing are coming from this new usage. .
One of the new usage is, as you cite, is that ETFs became cheaper to use than futures. So we've seen a lot of institutions now as they become aware of that and we go out and talk about it, they are coming to us and asking us how they can use ETFs to better express their views in the marketplace. So we're seeing flows coming in from that as well as just the generic core. And as you know, the 2 segments are, certainly, the buy-and-hold segment, and we have introduced the core ETFs for that, and we're seeing growth in that to the tune of about $3.8 billion, which is a 7% organic growth in the quarter. So we're very excited as that continues to grow. 
But at the same time, we're seeing those who are utilizing those for trading activities to express their views, continue to grow as well. And a lot of that is in the high-yield area where they're expressing their views, positive or negative, so you see flows in that. And then you just see people that are actually looking at ETFs as a replacement also for their mutual fund business as well. So I think there is lots of opportunities in this. We're just beginning to scratch the surface in new uses for this. We continue to think that it's going to continue to grow going forward. And we want to be the innovator, using ETFs to innovate and to solve people's issues in their portfolios."

And we think it actually enhances the liquidity of the markets because of the transparency. So you know what the underlying securities are so there's a market in those, and then there's a market on those as a whole.

So we think it enhances the liquidity and, therefore, we think this market could continue to grow. So we don't really -- I wouldn't agree with you on illiquidity in the corporate bond market. It's just that it's been more one-sided because there's more demand right now. So there really isn't the large secondary market. I don't call that illiquid. I call that over demand for yield securities because of the environment. So if interest rates rise, that will change a bit. But we think that, this has been providing good opportunity in the marketplace. And just think of how large the fixed income market is and when you take a look at that, any percentage, any small percentage increase in ETFs, so the fixed income market is going to be very substantial and very large.

So this is one of the -- people don't -- when they talk about this, they're just not talking about the market dynamics. So for every buyer, there's a seller. You're not creating or redeeming the underlying assets. So for -- during a market opening, the ETF is providing more liquidity. 
When you think about a mutual fund, a mutual fund in bonds is accumulating buyers and sellers throughout the day and at the final end of the day, they find out if they have to sell their underlying stocks -- or excuse me, bonds at the end of the day or the next morning to get the cash. So the ETF actually is, as Rob suggested, a provider of liquidity. It also creates the transparency of where the markets are and it's -- there's another surprise to me on the narrative, the narrative that you are able to transact bond sales and purchases in mass. By utilizing one stock, you're able to reduce the underlying assets and the need for a lot of sales of bonds, a lot of purchases bond inter-day. And that's a major component of why ETFs are additive to the liquidity and more importantly, they create transparency. And we've been telling the story for years. We've witnessed it. The Federal Reserve actually came up with a research report -- this is more related to emerging market equities, on the same construct that it provided liquidity.

Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. As",1636,"Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to be here to present the results for the second quarter of 2015. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. As usual, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. 
Our second quarter results, again, demonstrate the value of the investments we've made to assemble the industry's broadest and most global suite of active and index investment offerings and to deliver differentiated, customized investment solutions to our clients. Our business model was purposely designed to deliver differentiated results in the current volatile market environment. 
Second quarter revenue of $2.9 billion was 5% higher than a year ago, while operating income of $1.2 billion was 10% higher on a year-over-year basis. Earnings per share of $4.96 were up 1% compared to a year ago, reflecting lower nonoperating results and a higher normalized tax rate in the current quarter. 
Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $3 million of net investment losses, largely driven by net losses on unhedged or partially hedged multi-asset and fixed income seed investments. Recall that our first quarter nonoperating results included a onetime gain of $40 million related to the fair value of our pre-existing interest in BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors. 
Our as-adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 30.1%, compared to an as-adjusted tax rate of 24.8% in last year's second quarter that benefited from several favorable nonrecurring items. We currently estimate that 30% remains a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2015. 
Second quarter long-term net outflows of $7 billion reflected elevated market volatility, as $24 billion of net new business from active and iShares products was more than offset by $31 billion of low-fee institutional index outflows. While this resulted in an organic asset growth rate significantly less than our target for the quarter, our annualized, long-term organic base fee growth rate was in excess of 5%, as each of our retail and iShares businesses, along with the active component of our institutional business, generated positive organic growth in the second quarter. 
Over the last 12 months, notwithstanding the increasingly unsettled macro environment, BlackRock's highly diversified platform generated approximately $180 billion of long-term net new business, representing a 4% long-term organic AUM growth rate and a 6% organic base fee growth rate, as faster growth in our higher-fee channels continues to contribute to a favorable overall change in our base fee mix. 
We previously discussed the importance of organic base fee growth rate to our business, and we're always thinking about ways to improve our disclosure to help investors and analysts better understand our business. As you will note on Page 2 of our earnings supplement, we have now expanded our financial disclosure to include organic base fee growth on a trailing 12-month basis to better reflect this positive mix change over time. 
Second quarter base fees rose 4% year-over-year as the average AUM increased due to organic growth and market appreciation, despite $191 billion of negative FX impact associated with dollar appreciation against foreign currencies over the last 12 months. On a constant-currency basis, we estimate that quarterly base fees were approximately 8% year-over-year. Sequentially, base fees were up 6%, reflecting organic base fee growth, the effect of one additional day in the quarter and seasonally higher securities lending fees. Performance fees of $136 million were up 18% from a year ago, reflecting strong alpha generation in certain equity products that lock annually in the second quarter. 
BlackRock Solutions revenue of $161 million was up 10%, both year-over-year and sequentially. Our Aladdin business, which represented 80% of BRS revenue in the quarter, grew 14% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase is driven by several sizeable clients going live on the Aladdin platform over the last 12 months. We continue to see strong market demand for global investment platform consolidation and multi-risk solutions. 
Revenue in our Financial Markets Advisory business was flat year-over-year, reflecting the positive impact of residual disposition activity in last year's second quarter, but up $11 million sequentially, driven by increased revenue from several advisory assignments associated with Fed CCAR diagnostics. Other income declined $9 million from a year ago, reflecting lower 12b-1 fees and the impact of real estate-related disposition fees a year ago. 
Total expense rose $12 million year-over-year or 1%, driven primarily by revenue-related items, including incentive compensation of AUM-related expense, which were largely offset by a decline in G&A expense. Compensation and benefits increased $65 million year-over-year or 7%, due to higher headcount and incentive compensation, partially offset by the impact of a stronger dollar. 
G&A expense decreased $65 million year-over-year as a result of lower levels of marketing spend in the current quarter and the impact of elevated legal and regulatory expense in last year's second quarter. Sequentially, G&A expense decreased $27 million from the first quarter, driven by lower levels of marketing spend. Second quarter G&A expense also included a previously disclosed $4 million product placement fee associated with the recently announced ABR refunding. 
Our second quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 44.9% was positively impacted by the lower level of quarterly G&A spend. Looking forward, we continue to anticipate a higher, more normalized level of G&A spend during the second half of 2015. 
We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment, on June 12, BlackRock announced the acquisition of I Cuadrada, the leading independently managed infrastructure investment business in Mexico. We expect to close this acquisition in the fourth quarter of this year. 
During the second quarter, we also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares and refinanced $750 million of debt with a 10-year, EUR 700 million euro-denominated note bearing a 1.25% coupon. This represented our first euro-denominated debt issuance, better aligning our capital structure with our global business. 
Our consistent earnings growth and stable financial results reflect the benefits of our diverse platform, long-term client partnerships and commitment to investment performance. Second quarter long-term net flows were impacted by over $30 billion of low-fee institutional index outflows, which masked almost $13 billion of active inflows, driven by our improving Fundamental Equity performance, top-tier fixed income performance and strength in our multi-asset and alternatives businesses. BlackRock's global retail franchise saw long-term net inflows of $11 billion, representing 8% annualized organic growth for the quarter and 10% organic asset growth over the last 12 months. Flows were driven by continued strength in outcome-oriented offerings, including unconstrained fixed income and multi-asset strategies. 
International retail net inflows have risen $3 billion, were paced [ph] by strong flows into global unconstrained fixed income and international equities. For the quarter, our leading European equities franchise generated nearly $2 billion of net inflows while our top-quartile Asian equity franchise gathered more than $1 billion in new assets. Leadership in these areas contributed to BlackRock maintaining its year-to-date #1 ranking in cross-border mutual fund flows and its market-leading position in the United Kingdom. 
U.S. retail inflows of more than $7 billion reflected strong fixed income flows [indiscernible] broad-based, even in a period of rising rates. Despite a challenging quarter for industry flows into U.S. active mutual funds, the depth and breadth of our franchise position BlackRock to continue to grow market share as we ranked in the top 5 in U.S. retail industry flows for the quarter and saw a strong demand for iShares from U.S. retail clients. 
Global iShares generated $11 billion of net new flows, representing 4% annualized organic growth for the quarter and 11% organic growth over the last 12 months. While the ETF industry experienced quarterly volatility amid uncertainty in global economic growth and central bank policies, year-to-date flows for both iShares and the ETF industry remain in record territory. IShares retained its #1 global market share position for the first half of the year and remains well ahead of the competition in global fixed income flows. iShares' equity inflows of $9 billion were led by flows into non-U.S. equity exposures, including our EFA and Japan funds. 
We continue to see heightened investor focus on risk management as our currency hedge funds gather nearly $4 billion and our minimum volatility funds raised more than $2 billion during the quarter. 
iShares fixed income inflows of approximately $2 billion reflected flows into investment-grade corporate and emerging markets bonds, offset by outflows from treasuries and high yield as investors reposition portfolios amidst global rate movements. 
Our institutional business experienced $29 billion in quarterly long-term net outflows, primarily driven by $35 billion of low-fee index equity outflows from several large clients looking to reallocate, rebalance or meet their cash needs. As previously mentioned, these low-fee index outflows had a limited impact on organic base fee growth for the quarter. 
Institutional active net inflows of more than $2 billion reflected BlackRock's strong multi-asset and alternatives capabilities, offset by outflows in active equities. Multi-asset inflows of more than $4 billion were driven by solutions-based funding, particularly in the insurance outsourcing space, and continued strong demand for our LifePath Target Date series. 
Excluding return of capital of approximately $1 billion, net inflows of $2.3 billion into core institutional alternatives were broad-based, including alternative solutions, hedge funds, real asset and fund-to-fund offerings. Fund-raising momentum continued, with an additional $1 billion of illiquid alternative commitments raised in the second quarter, bringing total unfunded commitments, a source of future net inflows, to approximately $11 billion. Active equity outflows of nearly $2 billion resulted from a single sub-advisory redemption. 
Overall, BlackRock's second quarter reflected continued growth and stability in a more volatile environment and once again demonstrated the value of our highly differentiated and diversified platform. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry"

And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Our second quarter results were driven by clients' continued trust in BlackRock to help them navigate an increasingly unpredictable financial and economic landscape. Uncertai",2051,"Thank you, Gary. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Our second quarter results were driven by clients' continued trust in BlackRock to help them navigate an increasingly unpredictable financial and economic landscape. Uncertainty and anticipation around the first Fed rate hike in 9 years and concern related to the possible impact of a Greek Eurozone exit has led to persistent volatility in currencies, in risk asset prices and global interest rates. 
Turmoil in China's equity market has reached unprecedented levels and the impact of intervention is yet to be fully understood by our markets. Falling commodity prices continue to put pressure on commodity exporting economies. And both governments and corporations are being meaningful impacted by relative currency valuations. 
Constrained liquidity conditions are further magnifying market stress and volatility, and I believe this elevated volatility will be going forward and I believe, a part of the market. Both asset allocation to beta and alpha products and active management will be material drivers of returns for investors as they look to stay ahead of the changing market dynamics. 
Each of those drivers impacted client behavior in the second quarter, as we saw a shift in flows from a range of high-performing active products and iShares precision exposures, while experiencing redemptions in low-fee broad market index accounts. The investments we made in our platform over time, once again, has enabled BlackRock to create this highly differentiated investment solutions across asset classes, investment styles and geographies for our clients. 
At BlackRock, we are focused on delivering our best thinking and resources to our clients in our portfolio management teams. The BlackRock Investment Institute continues to lead that discussion, as evidenced by our recent client call on Greece, which was attended by nearly 3,000 clients. This level of engagement by our clients is translating into increased partnership with BlackRock to meet their investment needs. And more clients throughout the world are looking for BlackRock and BlackRock's ideas, which we believe over a long cycle, will lead to more share of wallet with these clients. Our internal culture of information sharing and our relentless focus on risk management and performance in our active businesses is also enhancing BlackRock's ability to generate alpha on behalf of our clients and has resulted in strength across our active platform in performance and in flows. 
We've been very vocal about addressing the performance challenges in our active equity business. More than 3 years ago, we began upgrading our portfolio management teams in our Asian and our U.S. fundamental active equity franchises. While we knew these changes will result in a near-term outflows and it would take our team many years to build the performance track records, we have the conviction, based on past successes in revamping our active fixed income business and we kept our focus on the long term for our clients. 
We brought in new portfolio managers who are currently responsible for more than $50 billion in assets. And those managers are delivering on their objectives of generating high-quality, risk-adjusted returns. We not only hired new talent, we invested in technology, we elevated young talent from organic growth internally and linked the global equity platform together to more effectively leverage the benefits to BlackRock. Since their respective start dates, those managers have generated more than $2 billion in alpha for BlackRock clients. 
As a global firm, our objective is to constantly outperform across our fundamental active equity platform, and we've seen top performance in a range of products and regions. For the 3-year period, in the United States, our Basic Value Fund is in the 11th percentile. In Europe, our European Value Fund is in the fourth percentile. And in Asia, our Asian Dragon Fund is in the 16th percentile. 
In the second quarter, BlackRock saw improvement in our overall fundamental active equity performance figures, with 78% and 61% of our AUM is above market or peer median for the 1- and 3-year period. 
And strong long-term track records for our European and Asian equity franchises, as Gary discussed, is translated into flows, raising more than $3 billion collectively in the second quarter. We still have work to do with our fundamental active team, but we remain highly confident in the enhancements we made with the team that we have on board and we are very encouraged by the direction the business is being -- is headed. We also saw continued strength and generation of strong performance across our model or scientific active equity platform, with 85% and 95% of our assets above benchmark or peer median for 1- and 3-year period. And in our active fixed income, performance remains strong across the platform, with 89% of our assets above benchmark or peer median for the 3-year period, translating into continued momentum in flows. 
Against a divergent and volatile backdrop and a challenged quarter for industry flows, BlackRock saw a total net long-term outflows of $7 billion, as $24 billion in net inflows into active and iShares strategies was offset by a $31 billion net outflows in these low-fee institutional index strategies. Importantly, from a regional perspective, we saw $18 billion of net inflows in the Americas, offset by a net outflows of $25 billion from international clients, who are more directly exposed to all the macro challenges that I discussed. 
As Gary discussed, focusing solely on organic asset flows, this is a critical component of our story. BlackRock generated long-term organic base fee growth of 5% in the second quarter, reflecting the effectiveness of our differentiated business model and the combination of active and index on a single platform, as higher-fee active flows drove robust revenue growth more than offsetting any revenue loss from our index outflows. 
In the second quarter, we saw sizable institutional index equity outflows driven by redemptions from international and official institutional clients due to a variety of cash needs and asset allocation decisions. A number of those outflows from institutional clients, however, have been offset by inflows by the same clients into BlackRock's active strategies. This is a very important component that we all should be focusing on, because as we discussed, how we are building our unique business model, having the ability to have clients internally move assets around, whether it's from beta to active or active to beta, this allows us to continue to build deeper and more elongated relationships with our clients. 
Year-to-date, a desire to reallocate or address cash needs drove 10 of our largest clients to redeem over $40 billion in institutional index assets. However, those same clients reinvested across BlackRock's active equity and fixed income, multi-asset and also alternative strategies, resulting in a positive net revenue impact for the firm. This demonstrates the value, as I said earlier, of a deep, strategic relationship we remain with our clients and validates strongly the strength of our solution-oriented business model. 
Second quarter active net inflows of $13 billion was driven by fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives. We remain bullish on the opportunities in active fixed income, as investors stuck to a prolonged low-rate environment searching for both yield and capital preservation. BlackRock generated $9 billion of active fixed income net flows across unconstrained high-yield and total return strategies. 
The breadth and diversity of BlackRock's fixed income platform resonated in the second quarter, as clients repositioned assets to achieve their investment goals. For example, our iShares high-yield range saw net outflows of $1.8 billion in the quarter. The top performance we have in our active high yield franchise positioned us to capture $2.4 billion in net inflows. 
Alternatives was also a contributor to inflows and organic base fee growth in the quarter, with $2 billion in net inflows. Alternative flows were led by Alternative Solutions, where BlackRock is leveraging our differentiated model and our market position to construct outcome-oriented, multi-alternative portfolios for our clients. 
BlackRock continues to build out our capabilities in infrastructure, which is an important asset class that provides long term returns for our clients. 
In the second quarter, BlackRock announced the acquisition of Mexico's leading independent managed infrastructure investment firm. This acquisition advanced BlackRock's growth strategy all throughout Latin America, obviously and including Mexico, and demonstrates our firm, strong commitment of being a leader in infrastructure investments. This is a continuation of the expansion of our infrastructure footprint in Mexico following the partnership with PEMEX we announced in March. We also believe that building out our infrastructure platforms throughout the globe will make us a stronger and a more meaningful leading player in each local market. And I believe it's very imperative to understand infrastructure investing for BlackRock will lead us to have a stronger mutual fund footprint as we grow our businesses worldwide. And as I said repeatedly over years and years, we need to be a local firm in every country to build the trust and the strength as we become much more of a global platform firm. 
Technology remains a key area of focus and investment for BlackRock across all aspects of our business to enhance our investment process, client service, operational efficiencies and our unifying Aladdin technology platform. Aladdin generated 14% revenue growth year-over-year, and Aladdin's growing value as a third-party platform positions BlackRock to invest a consistent and growing stream of revenues into improving our technology and expanding our offerings. And indeed, more and more clients are looking for risk management platforms. As more investors need to go more global, the need for a more robust capital market-focused technology platform is more imperative today than any other time. And BlackRock Solutions' Aladdin is becoming the driving risk management platform that more and more clients are looking to take on. 
The next step in the evolution of our business and ability to generate alpha is to further harnessing technology to create innovative investment strategies for our clients. Over the last few years, we have become increasingly focused in becoming a data-driven company. Available data is exploding for the financial services industry, and the true winners will be the firms that can extract information and package it into innovative solutions that generate alpha and outcomes for our clients. 
We recently hired Dr. Andrew Ang to be our head of our new factor-based strategy group. Andrew joins us from Columbia Business School and is an innovator in factor-based investing and portfolio construction. 
Technology is also going to become a more important part of our adopting to our evolving fixed income landscape. Throughout the quarter, there have been elevated focus on the state of the fixed income markets. There are a variety of dynamics at play, including extraordinary monetary policy, increased bond issuance and regulatory reform, which has contributed to reduced dealer inventories and lower turnover. While media attention has only spiked in recent months, BlackRock has been focusing on the issues for several years: How to enhance our training capabilities, how to enhance our portfolio construction and risk management, as well as being a thought leader on the topic. 
Going forward, it is important for all market participants to recognize that we can't turn back the clock. We need to shift the dialogue to look forward and focus on solutions. BlackRock hopes to play a constructive role in helping our clients meet the challenges of today's market environment. We are also making recommendations on what the regulators and market participants can do to help improve the market ecosystem using a three-prong approach, including modernizing the market structure, addressing liquidity challenges at the product level and embracing product innovation, like fixed income ETFs. 
As our clients' investment challenges evolve, so does the nature of the solutions they require. BlackRock's business model was deliberately built to deliver a multifaceted solution to our clients. And I don't believe any other investment firm can provide this multifaceted solution. BlackRock's ability to leverage these capabilities across a diverse global platform of active and index equities, fixed income, multi-asset and alternative strategies, all backed by Aladdin analytics, risk management and advisory capabilities, leading investment performance in client service -- big sentence here -- continues to result in improved outcomes for our clients and our shareholders. As always, I want to thank our employees for their continued dedication to working to create a better financial future for our clients. 
With that, I'll open it up for questions."

I think as we've talked about at length with you guys, the fee rates are constantly changing for us. It's a function of not only the organic component, which I think we're now demonstrating to everybody, that is in our control. And as we continue to see stronger growth in our higher-fee retail and iShares businesses, which carry higher fee rates on an organic basis. If nothing else changes in the world, we would expect the overall fee rate to be accretive for us. In other words, obviously, organic revenue growth in excess of organic AUM growth obviously helps that over time. However, we can't control things like divergent beta and FX. And obviously, as we've talked about over time, that will have an impact depending on where we go. In this quarter, it happened to help us. But in other quarters, it has hurt us over time. 
As you know, U.S. equities rose about 5% over the last year. In terms of U.S. benchmark AUM, that's about 32% of our equity base fees. But in fact, it's the lowest fee geography for us at around 13 basis points. On an FX-adjusted basis, year-over-year we saw EM and Europe down between 10% and 12% each, commodities down close to 30% and those buckets are about another third of our equity base fees and have average fee rates significantly higher, around 46 basis points. So in this case, year-over-year, the overall fee rate was down about 0.6 points, or roughly to about 22 basis points due to that. But we benefited from some of that in the current quarter, also, we had better mix and we had an additional day, which basically helped the sequential fee rate up close to 0.9 basis points."

What I think is really illustrative of all the hard work we've done in the last few years is we are now part of that dialogue and more and more clients that we are able to do this. As we suggested, a lot of the money that was -- in terms of the outflows, was more cash-need driven by our clients for rainy day issues. And it's raining in some of the commodity-based economies and so they're utilizing some of that. I think one of the things that is important to understand, I don't think the market understood how much flows that were generated by these large institutions internationally into the equity markets and in some cases, it's turned because they have need for domestic needs. But we are seeing -- we have more increased dialogue on multi-assets in European equities, Asian equities, alternatives, than we've ever had in the history of the firm. So the dialogue is more robust and certainly, a lot more complete and I think that's a component of the story. As Gary said, we can't control FX. We can't control divergent beta. As Gary suggested, there has been quite a bit of divergent beta in the commodity-based stuff. Even in the last few weeks of June, the first few weeks of July, we've seen more divergent beta again. And so, we can't control that, but we certainly have -- and probably the key issue that we can control, deeper, more robust conversation with more clients worldwide."

Obviously -- let me just step back and say: a, if the market is a safer, stronger market and more people believe that the market is a great place, if regulation does add greater safety and soundness in the minds of more and more investors, we'll be the biggest beneficiary. So our whole approach to regulatory conversation is somewhat different than with some of the other leaders in the industry. We are -- we have traditionally, and I continue to believe we will continue to that tradition, of having a deep dialogue with regulators, using our international knowledge of what's going on and helping them try to understand what would be the best way to make this safer and sounder dialogue. So I don't want to say the conversation is going to be more relaxed in the future, because we need to still work with the regulators, understanding what are the potential issues. As the world becomes more dependent on capital markets, and that's happening now, as the ecosystem change with higher capital standards with banks, and more and more enterprises, whether it's companies or individuals are using capital markets for raising capital, both debt and equity, we need a safe and sound ecosystem. And if it means to having more supervision in some of the activities, we may be in favor of that. So we are going to work towards building a safer and sounder capital markets, and we have enjoyed deep relationships with the regulators. And obviously, they don't have to listen to us. They are our regulators and -- but by having what I would call a constructive dialogue, I believe it allows us to be part of the conversation. And hopefully, this will lead to a better outcome."

They're -- but the true component is, so many pension funds and insurance companies were so harmed by lower interest rates. In some cases, we know many insurance companies have actually a wide gap, their liabilities are longer than their assets. So if we actually saw a rising rate environment, this is actually quite additive to the balance sheets of insurance companies. If we saw a rise in interest rates, especially in the short end, the pension funds' liabilities will look less onerous because it's all based on their funding rate and the capital rate they use for their short-term rates. In fact, many pension funds, if we saw a real spike in interest rates, would defease a lot of their pension liability. So higher rates, actually, is good for most long-term investors and they're not particularly concerned about rising rates and they're going to have money, because their liability, they bought these fixed interest items against certain fixed-based liabilities and so they're not going to be that harmed on it. Now they may have some accounting treatment differentials, but it's not going to be a big issue. It -- and for those who believe they want to navigate around the potentiality of higher rates, they're going to navigate from a long-dated asset -- longer-duration fixed income product to a shorter duration one. So -- and for those who still need to be in more long duration, but they're going to go into more of the unconstrained products that we are the leading driver in flows. So I think people just forget -- they're implying that everybody's a hedge fund when higher rates means everybody's going to be abandoning bond funds. Now some individuals were in fixed income because of safety and soundness. They don't generally whip them around either. They're going to hold them to maturity. But another thing, Alex, that I think we are miscalculating, too, more and more money is going into defined contribution plans. More and more defined contribution plans are using target-date types of structures. And last I checked, we're living longer, but more importantly, we're all aging, at least I am. And as you age, you're going to have a higher component of fixed income. So I would tell you, fundamentally, demographically and all the things that we're structurally seeing the way people are positioned, higher rates is not a bad thing for the fixed income market for the core investors."

Look, I think as we look at the quarter, I think there's no question that our second quarter margin benefited from a lower level of G&A spend. If you'll recall last quarter, where many of you pointed out a year-over-year decline in our operating margin, we communicated to you that we felt our reported year-over-year margin comparison really understated the operating leverage in the business. And I think this quarter, frankly, we had the opposite. I think that our 250 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion is overstated by a lower level of G&A spend that, frankly, is not likely sustainable. 
Look, part of the lower level of G&A spend in the quarter is better financial discipline in the current environment. But part of it is, frankly, simply expenses that came in lower than we expected. And I wouldn't -- I really wouldn't read too much into it on a trend basis. It was simply a low G&A quarter relative to historical spend levels. 
Looking forward, I think I would say we continue to anticipate a higher, more normalized level of G&A spend in the second half of the year. And at this time, we're not intending to ""push out"", I think the words that you may have used, to reduce second quarter spend into the back half of the year."

So it's become not only a way to express your view in the market, but you can express it in a much more precise way. So a lot of the flows that we're seeing are coming from this new usage. .
One of the new usage is, as you cite, is that ETFs became cheaper to use than futures. So we've seen a lot of institutions now as they become aware of that and we go out and talk about it, they are coming to us and asking us how they can use ETFs to better express their views in the marketplace. So we're seeing flows coming in from that, as well as just the generic core. And as you know, the 2 segments are, certainly, the buy-and-hold segment, and we have introduced the core ETFs for that, and we're seeing growth in that to the tune of about $3.8 billion, which is a 7% organic growth in the quarter. So we're very excited as that continues to grow. 
But at the same time, we're seeing those who are utilizing those for trading activities to express their views, continue to grow as well. And a lot of that is in the high-yield area, where they're expressing their views, positive or negative, so you see flows in that. And then you just see people that are actually looking at ETFs as a replacement also for their mutual fund business as well. So I think there is lots of opportunities in this. We're just beginning to scratch the surface in new uses for this. We continue to think that it's going to continue to grow going forward.

It's just that it's been more one-sided because there's more demand right now. So there really isn't the large secondary market. I don't call that illiquid. I call that over demand for yield securities because of the environment. So if interest rates rise, that will change a bit.

So this is one of the -- people don't -- when they talk about this, they're just not talking about the market dynamics. So for every buyer, there's a seller. You're not creating or redeeming the underlying assets. So for -- during the market opening, the ETF is providing more liquidity. 
When you think about a mutual fund, a mutual fund in bonds is accumulating buys and sells throughout the day and at the final end of the day, they find out if they have to sell their underlying stocks -- or excuse me, bonds, at the end of the day or the next morning to get the cash. So the ETF actually is, as Rob suggested, a provider of liquidity. It also creates the transparency of where the markets are and it's -- there's another surprise to me on the narrative, the narrative that you are able to transact bond sales and purchases en masse. By utilizing one stock, you're able to reduce the underlying assets and the need for a lot of sales of bonds, or a lot of purchases of bonds, inter-day. And that's a major component of why ETFs are additive to the liquidity and more importantly, they create transparency. And we've been telling the story for years. We've witnessed it. The Federal Reserve actually came out with a research report -- this is more related to emerging market equities, on the same construct that it provided liquidity. So we're still dismayed at the narrative."

This is Gary Shedlin. It's my pleasure to be here to present results for the third quarter of 2015.Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and busine",1475,"Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. This is Gary Shedlin. It's my pleasure to be here to present results for the third quarter of 2015.
Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. And as usual, I will be focusing primarily on our as adjusted results.
Against a challenging market backdrop, BlackRock's third quarter results demonstrate the stability of our diverse global platform, highlighted by continued organic growth, stable operating margins and systematic capital return. Third quarter revenue of $2.9 billion was 2% higher than a year ago, while operating income of $1.2 billion was up 1%.
Earnings per share of $5 were down 4% compared to a year ago, reflecting lower nonoperating results and a higher tax rate in the current quarter.
Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $6 million of net investment gains, largely driven by gains in private equity and real estate investments, which offset market-driven losses on certain hedge funds and unhedged or partially hedged multi-asset and fixed income seed investments.
Our as adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 29.3% compared to a 26.2% a year ago, reflecting several variable nonrecurring items. We currently estimate that 30% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2015. And based on what we know today, reflecting changes in our geographic business mix, estimate that 31% is a reasonable projected tax rate for 2016.
BlackRock generated $35 billion of quarterly long-term net flows, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 3%. Flows were positive across investment styles and client types, reinforcing the value of our broad-based, diversified business model. In a volatile market characterized by double-digit quarterly declines in a number of global equity indices and significant FX movement, clients continue to look to BlackRock for strong risk management and long-term investment solutions. In total, market depreciation and FX impact reduced the value of our assets under management by approximately $265 billion [ph] during the quarter.
Over the last 12 months, BlackRock generated approximately $186 billion of long-term net new business, representing a 4% long-term organic AUM growth rate and a 6% organic base fee growth rate as faster growth in our higher fee channels contributed to a favorable overall change in our base fee mix.
Third quarter base fees were approximately flat year-over-year despite over $200 billion of negative FX impact to market depreciation over the last 12 months. On a constant-currency basis, we estimate that quarterly base fees grew approximately 3% year-over-year. Sequentially, base fees were down 3% due to lower quarterly average AUM, a seasonal decline in securities lending activity and the impact of divergent beta on our fee rate as emerging and commodities market underperformed developed market. Going forward, our fourth quarter entry base fee level will be impacted as we enter the quarter with lower spot AUM than our average AUM for the third quarter.
Performance fees of $208 million were up 56% from a year ago, and while broad-based, benefited from a single European hedge fund that delivered exceptional full year performance and loss in the third quarter. BlackRock Solutions revenue of $167 [ph] million was up 1% year-over-year and 4% sequentially.
Aladdin revenue, which represented 81% of BRS revenue in the quarter, were 11% year-over-year, driven by several sizable client implementations and has now more than doubled since 2009.
Strong connectivity between our BRS and institutional client teams is facilitating improved dialogue with our most sophisticated clients as we continue to see increased demand for global investment platform consolidation and multi-risk solutions.
Revenue in our financial markets advisory business was down $11 million from a year ago but flat sequentially as revenue in the third quarter of 2014 reflected the impact of several large ECB AQR advisory assignments. Despite lower levels of opportunistic revenue post financial crisis, FMA is benefiting from a more stable revenue profile, driven by an increase number of mandates and more repeat engagements in the current market environment.
Total expense rose $48 million year-over-year or 3%, driven primarily by compensation expense which increased $52 million from a year ago due to higher headcount, higher levels of performance fees and increased deferred compensation expense, partially offset by the impact of a stronger dollar.
G&A expense decreased $7 million from a year ago due to lower levels of marketing spend, offset by a lower benefit from the FX impact remeasuring dollar exposures held overseas to their respective functional currencies. Recall that our GAAP G&A expense a year ago reflected an additional $50 million [ph] charge related to production of indemnification asset, which has been excluded from our as adjusted results. Sequentially, G&A expense increased $7 million primarily due to higher levels of professional fees in the third quarter.
Our third quarter as adjusted operating margin of 0.3.9% [ph] reflected expense awareness in the current market environment. Looking forward, we continue to be mindful of our discretionary level of spend as markets evolve but currently anticipate a higher level of G&A spend during the fourth quarter driven by seasonal factors and transaction-related expense associated with recently consummated acquisitions. As we stated in the past, we do not manage the business to a specific margin target. We do remain keenly focused on delivering long-term value to our shareholders and will work to strike an appropriate balance between strategic investment needs and prudent discretionary expense management. We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders in a consistent, systematic manner. In line with that commitment, we closed the acquisitions of Cuadrada, the leading independently managed infrastructure investment business in Mexico, and FutureAdvisor, a leader in digital wealth management, earlier this month. We do not expect these transactions to have a material impact on BlackRock's consolidated financial results.
During the third quarter, we also repurchase an additional $275 million worth of shares and view that as a good planning rate for the remainder of the year.
In a quarter where our clients faced significant market volatility, BlackRock generated $50 billion of total net flows, including $35 billion of long-term net inflows reflecting the benefits of a diverse investment and distribution platform and a commitment to alpha generation. BlackRock's Global Retail franchise saw long-term net inflows of $7 billion, positive across all asset classes, representing 5% annualized organic growth for the quarter and 10% organic growth over the last 12 months.
International retail net flows of $5 billion were paced by strong flows into international equities and unconstrained fixed income, highlighting the global nature of our platform. BlackRock's U.S. retail business generated long-term inflows of $2 billion, demonstrating resilience in what was a challenging quarter for the U.S. mutual fund industry. BlackRock's flows were led by broad-based fixed income activity or strong and consistent performance across a platform can use to differentiate us despite industry outflows in a number of product categories, including unconstrained fixed income and high yield.
Global iShares generated $23 billion of net new flows, representing 9% annualized organic growth for the quarter and 12% organic growth over the last 12 months. iShares value proposition, especially with respect to liquidity and transparency, was extremely evident in a market characterized by heightened volatility and year-to-date flows remained in record territory. IShares fixed income inflows of $18 billion reflected ongoing adoption of ETFs as a means of rapidly accessing and investing in fixed income markets. IShares equity inflows of $5 billion were led by flows into developed market exposures, including our Japan and Eurozone funds. We saw increased investor focus on risk awareness smart beta products, with our minimum volatility funds raising more than $2 billion during the quarter and gaining the #1 ranking within the domestic product category. Our institutional client business saw over $5 billion in quarterly long-term net inflows, driven by higher fee active offerings as clients increasingly partnered with BlackRock to generate alpha across active solutions and alternative mandates.
Institutional active net inflows of $6 billion reflected over $4 billion of across fixed income strategies and nearly $2 billion into core alternatives and marked our sixth consecutive quarter of active institutional inflows. Alternatives flows were broad-based, including infrastructure, private equity, real estate, fund to fund and alternative solutions offerings. In addition, strong fundraising momentum continued with an additional $1 billion of liquid alternative commitments raised in the third quarter, bringing total unfunded commitments and source of future inflows to approximately $11 billion.
Overall, our third quarter results reflect the benefits of the investments we've made to build a differentiated, global business model. Diversification across investment styles, distribution channels, products and geographies enables us to serve clients irrespective of market environment or investment preference. Our goal remains to deliver consistent and differentiated growth over time.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Our third quarter results were driven by clients' continued trust in BlackRock's ability to manage risk and deliver holistic investment solutions as they look to achieve long-term goals and navigate uncertainty in an increasingly volatile economic environment. A slowing economy in China, persistent weakness in commodity prices, uncertainty around the Fed's decision on rates and continued fluctuation in currency valuation has contributed to significant declines in global markets. Emerging-market equities were down 19%. Natural resources stocks were down 23%. And European and U.S. indexes were -- fell 9% and 7%, respectively, in just the last quarter.
Government actions continue to influence markets as central banks policies have caused imbalances in interest rates and currencies. Emerging-market currencies have experienced significant volatility falling nearly 9% in the third quarter before rallying over the past several days. More than ever, our clients value the model we built at BlackRock. BlackRock's global, multiproduct platform, our market-leading risk management capabilities through Aladdin and our focus on long-term solutions enable us to have a more robust conversation with more clients as they address portfolio composition and asset allocation. These conversations are not just focused on what products BlackRock can sell. They are focused on outcomes our clients are looking for and how we could bring together capabilities across our global platform to help our clients achieve their goals. This approach has resulted in a stronger, longer-lasting relationships with our clients than ever before, which truly contributed to more than the $50 billion of inflows this quarter.
Clients not only turn to BlackRock to manage assets, but to help them understand the longer-term impact on developments in the financial landscape. The BlackRock Investment Institute continues to lead that discussion and hosted several client calls in the third quarter to address market volatility, with BII's most widely attended call reaching more than 4,000 client participants. This heightened level of client engagement is translating into consistent growth, and BlackRock saw $35 billion of long-term net flows in the quarter, positive across, as Gary suggested, in investment styles and client types. The fact that we are seeing such diverse inflows in a volatile market speaks to the power of our platform that we built over time at BlackRock and the differentiating experience we provide to our clients.
We continue to grow our global distribution footprint and product set to serve a diverse set of clients with a holistic range of outcome-oriented solutions as clients are looking for income and uncorrelated returns in the current investment environment.
In the U.S., we anticipate client demand for income-focused products. And since they were launched, our strategic income opportunity and multi-asset income funds have garnered more flows to the third quarter than any fund in these categories with more than $35 billion of total inflows.
Building upon the strength of these funds in the U.S., our global versions of BlackRock unconstrained fixed income and Multi-Asset Income funds are gaining momentum with clients internationally. Year-to-date [indiscernible] our global unconstrained offering saw net inflows of $3.8 billion. And our global multi-asset income fund saw net inflows of more than $1.4 billion.
On the institutional side. Client demand for active fixed income and alternative strategies continues to drive positive organic base fee growth. For example, while official institutional clients have generally been environmentally-driven net sellers and low fee index equity exposures, we have seen enhanced demand from the same clients for our active and alternative products and solutions, which have driven positive overall revenue growth among these clients this year. And this is some focus that we've talked about over a year, having clients navigate from index into active and back and forth. And the biggest differentiating feature BlackRock today versus a few years ago, we have both active and [indiscernible] products.
BlackRock recognizes that even the most comprehensive and global set of solutions will be insufficient without strong investment performance. As a global forum, our objective is to outperform consistently while our entire investment -- throughout our entire investment platform. We remain focused on embracing a team-oriented approach, leveraging our connectivity, our knowledge sharing forums and translating all this information into insights from technology and big data to drive top-tier performance across all asset categories and investment strategies.
We've seen consistency in areas where we were strong and improvement in areas where we've been reinvesting in talent. In our scientific active equity business, 97% of the AUM performed above benchmark or peer medium for the 3-year period. And in our active taxable fixed income business, 90% of assets performed above benchmark or peer medium for 3-year period. Over the last few years, we've invested in our fundamental equity business in hiring new talent, in technology and in unifying this global equity platform to be more effective to tap the resources entirely throughout BlackRock.
We're seeing the benefit of this investment. And in our Fundamental Active Equity business, 80% and 58% of our AUM is now above benchmark, our peer medium for the 1-year and 3-year, respectively.
And importantly, our global platform continues to deliver results. BlackRock's European and BlackRock's Asian Fundamental Equities platforms have 99% and 91% of their assets, respectively, above benchmark's or peer medium for the 3-year period.
Investors continue to turn to iShares amidst the heightened volatility to gain market exposures and enhanced portfolio construction. And iShares saw, as Gary discussed, $23 billion in net total inflows. IShares captured the #1 market share of the net new business globally in the U.S. and in Europe and in the third quarter and year-to-date. IShares flows were driven by fixed income as investors utilize fixed income ETFs as an effective tool for diversification and liquidity. Equity flows were driven by $5 billion into European-listed iShares, and we saw positive inflows in Canada and Asia Pacific as well.
Extreme market volatility resulted in a disjointed market open on August 24. Lack of pricing clarity, widespread delayed stock openings and an unprecedented number of trading halts impacted a large number of both U.S.-listed single name stock and equity ETFs. We have spoken with many different market participants. And based on our own experience, and these conversations we have made several recommendations with respect to U.S. equity market structure in a Viewpoint article titled, ""U.S. Equity Market Structure Lessons"" from August 24, which we published on our website last week. Demand for iShares remained strong, and net iShares flows following August 24 has been robust at nearly $25 billion through yesterday.
Despite near-term market fluctuations, we continue to focus on the long run by investing in areas that we believe will result in a more complete offering for our clients and delivering value for our shareholders. Over the last 2 years, our institutional clients rebalancing survey indicated that institutes plan to increase allocations to real assets. We continue to expand our real asset offerings, including BlackRock's infrastructure platform, which provides clients with current income diversification, income protection and potential for capital appreciation, while helping to drive economic growth and job creation. As Gary mentioned earlier this month, we closed on the acquisition of I Cuadrada, Mexico's leading infrastructure investment firm, and BlackRock now manages nearly $7 billion in infrastructure investments on behalf of clients worldwide.
Technology is another area where we built on our existing strength through recent investments to enhance the way we serve our clients. We continue to enhance our Aladdin platform by building out our multi-asset capabilities, driving 11% revenue growth year-over-year. And we're seeing growing demand as investors become more focused on risk management and the evolving financial and regulatory landscape.
Earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of FutureAdvisor, a leading digital wealth management platform. As consumers increasingly engage with technology to invest, BlackRock and FutureAdvisor, our position to empower our distribution partners to better serve their clients by combining FutureAdvisor's high-quality technology-enabled advice with BlackRock's multi-asset investment capabilities, our proprietary technology, and most importantly, our risk analytics.
We've built and continue to invest in our platform and our people so that we can have a deeper dialogue with our clients and deliver consistent results, for our shareholders, especially through times of heightened uncertainty.
On a very personal note, as many of you know, Charlie Hallac, who was named our Co-President last year, passed away in September, following a lengthy battle against cancer. Charlie is missed by many of his friends across BlackRock. Our greatest tribute to him will be to carry forward his life work by continuing to deliver excellence to our clients, to constantly innovate, and more importantly, to look relentlessly for ways to evolve, as Charlie always did.
Finally, I want to thank our employees for their continued focus and dedication in creating better financial futures for our clients.
So let's now open it up for questions."

There's some very large movements from some clients that are actively moving out of government securities into more risk-oriented securities. That's pretty well advertised about me going into the specifics of that. We've seen some clients, because of cash needs, have been selling products. So I think Asia Pac has been dominated more by 3 or 4 large institutions moving around. I think I'll talk about the whole ecosystem of the markets. And then what we saw, as we saw more consistent flows in Asia Pac, iShares. We are seeing actually more utilization of dollar assets today related to our institutional clients. And I would say -- and in some parts of Asia, as Rob suggested, in the fourth quarter, there's more and more movement towards multi-asset. So I don't see any major change in the specifics of BlackRock in the third quarter. We did have index outflows in APAC. However, as I suggested in my formal speech, some of these clients moved into more active products. And so we had actually a more positive overall revenue growth in that region. So I would say nothing that was extraordinary, just some large actions. And I think you're going to see a consistent growth out of Asia Pac overall as some of the major clients are looking to invest in more global products away from their host products or host country products. So we feel good about Asia Pacific and Australia right now."

I think it's very important that we have better disclosure on liquidity for all funds. We have better disclosures on stressing funds. There's certainly more and more dialogue about one directional trades worldwide from the regulators. And so I actually believe the SEC's leading this effort and trying to come up with the appropriate analysis to help guide investors, understand the embedded issues, risks or opportunities in mutual funds. So we look at this as a net positive that we're always in favor of better disclosure. The one cautionary thing we would say to any regulator, ""Let's not make retail products less competitive than institutional products."" So for instance, the base suggested that a mutual fund product should have a higher cash buffer, and that would probably mean most institutional clients would move to a separate account. We may not achieve what we're trying to achieve. So we are in favor of better disclosures. I think through better disclosures, you're going to have better processes. Possibly stress testing of fund, depending on the methodologies. That may work, too. So we have an open mind. And I don't know, Bill, exactly where it's going, but we want to play a constructive role globally on these issues. If I would say, as we talked about over the last few years, regulators worldwide have gone from analysis of firms related to city designation to activities. So we were a big supporter of that as a firm. And these are the type of activities that most certainly the regulators are going to be focusing on. And as I said, we are -- we have constructive, positive dialogue with the regulators throughout the world on this. So we'll wait and see."

So some of it's from changes in regulation, but a lot of it is due to education and people having knowledge that iShares can actually play a big role in achieving the results that people want in their portfolio."

And this is one of the key elements of what I think is differentiating BlackRock. We're focusing on helping clients meet the needs of their liabilities. Many clients have liabilities that are very long-dated. Many clients have underinvested, and so they actually have a gap between their length of the duration of their liabilities versus the duration of their bonds. As interest rates rise, if they rise, I think they will rise one day, we are actually going to see an accelerated movement towards clients buying longer-duration assets. And that's -- I mean -- I'm not talking about trading strategies, but clients that are pension-fund-oriented or long-dated insurance type of product, they're going to use the opportunity to buy different long-dated assets. Clients who are more interested in any trade, obviously they're going to get out of the long duration and move into low duration or something like our Strategic Income Opportunity Fund where they're not going to be -- they're not going to be constrained to a duration. It will be an unconstrained product. So what the third quarter saw, we saw lots of movement. We saw some clients were adding duration. We saw some clients were reducing duration. We saw some clients taking advantage -- and this is one thing that I haven't seen in the narrative -- we saw -- we have clients taking advantage of the rising high-yield market because high yield underperformed in the third quarter, and we saw clients moving back into high yield because the coupon and risk-adjusted basis in some categories are achieving their needs to match their liabilities. So this is a -- this is an important component of why we have differentiated ourselves because we are working with our clients trying to keep the narrative on what is their outcome that they're seeking. It's not about trading in and out. It is about how can they best achieve and the composition of assets to meet their liabilities. And by continuing to drive home this concept of long-term-ism and outcomes instead of the noise of the moment has allowed us to have deeper dialogue. And I think the flows in fixed income have shown the results of having deeper dialogues and focus on outcomes."

There's lots of other multi-asset discussions and solutions that are going on around the firm that frankly fit into a lot of other categories. But as you talked about bundle products like LifePath and Global Al, which obviously 2 of our flagship products, they did see flattish flows in the quarter. And I think while we would say that MAI's flows were not as strong as prior quarters, it still was positive to the tune of $500 million, and it still remains our top selling -- or the top-selling Multi-Asset Income Fund since its launch about 3 years ago. Larry talked about SIOs and other similar products, which is a fixed-income products, and obviously that, and in addition to that, with LBI and some other things, we've seen very positive flows there. But there's no question that as we saw some slow inflows, whether it was MAI, DDG, or even LifePath, we did see some slows -- some slowing of the flows. I think it's early for us to figure out whether, in particular, the target date, that that is an industry phenomena or not. Obviously, we did see unprecedented volatility. I think if we actually look across a lot of those products with respect to the different dates, we definitely did see more flows in so-called near-term maturity dates as opposed to the long term, which may suggest that as people who are looking to basically approach retirement more quickly, they saw volatility and were deciding to eliminate some of the equity exposure in the near term. But I think we'll be watching that very closely and see to what extent those change direction in the next few quarters."

So as you know, now ETFs are being used as a surrogate for futures across many institutional account. So we think that's going to continue. And how big can that be? Just think about the size of the futures market. And certainly, regulation is going to play a big role in that as well. So as capital costs are going up for a lot of institutions, ETFs are starting to play a bigger role. So that's sort of where we're at.

Whether it's just active equity management, active fixed income or alternatives, we have those dialogues.

High yield has somewhat less liquidity than investment-grade product. A treasury fund has more liquidity than an investment-grade corporate product. You are paid a higher income for those types of returns. And I do believe having a measurement, hopefully it's a dynamic measurement, a dynamic measurement will allow investors -- and we're talking mostly retail. Investors having a better understanding. And so if we can come up with the metrics that is dynamic, that is informative about the liquidity of any one product and differentiating that liquidity amongst different funds. Because some funds, some different -- some mutual funds have systematically always -- even in the asset categories of, let's say, high yields, hasn't consistently invested in the lower-grade high yield with less liquidity. Some mutual funds have invested in the higher-grade high yield that had more liquidity. And so some form of dynamic measurement is probably good. I don't -- I actually believe -- once again, as investors are becoming more informed and they better understand the risks and the returns, I actually believe it will be to greater investments in different asset categories. This is something we should all embrace. So I don't -- as I said, I look at this as a positive. It's a constructive way of analyzing. We just need to make sure that we don't cause so much problems at all. Institutions running out of mutual funds and go to separate accounts, and we may not be achieving everything that is necessary. But we want smart investors. Smart investor is better for the entire asset management industry. We should not run away from markets that are opaque. We should always be trying to find ways of making more transparency in terms of risk. In terms of Aladdin, greater risk analytics, whether it's liquidity analytics or stress test analytics, is a very large positive for the future direction and needs of clients utilizing Aladdin. As I said in my prepared remarks, Aladdin is growing 11% a year. We are in deep dialogue with many clients right now, and I feel very good about how Aladdin is the risk management platform of choice by so many investors worldwide."

It is too early for me to really go into detail how we are navigating it.

Once again, through this technology, if we could increase the knowledge base of products, increase the knowledge base of information through this technology, we will have deeper and more robust conversations. If we can, our hope is to -- and our intention is to link our FutureAdvisor technology with our Aladdin technology to help our distribution partners to have both better risk analytics and most -- and better client interface information so they can be providing better guidance to their clients. This is a long-term investment for us. We're more excited about the investment today than we were as we thought about making the investment. And as I said earlier, we are thrilled with the response by our distribution partners to have more engagement utilizing this technology. So it's too early to really get into any details, but our management team and FutureAdvisor's are running around the country right now having many dialogues and conversations alongside our BlackRock Solutions team. So -- but it is very important to note -- because they never really talk about it -- putting Aladdin -- putting FutureAdvisor into our BlackRock Solutions platform really gives us this ability to really create a third-party platform to provide independent information for our clients that's very similar to what BlackRock-Aladdin does for our clients, independent risk management. So we look at this as a great stepping stone for a deeper connection with our RIAs and all our distribution platform."

This is Gary Shedlin. It's my pleasure to be here to present results for the third quarter of 2015.Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and busine",1472,"Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. This is Gary Shedlin. It's my pleasure to be here to present results for the third quarter of 2015.
Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results, and as usual, I will be focusing primarily on our as adjusted results.
Against a challenging market backdrop, BlackRock's third quarter results demonstrate the stability of our diverse global platform, highlighted by continued organic growth, stable operating margins and systematic capital return. Third quarter revenue of $2.9 billion was 2% higher than a year ago, while operating income of $1.2 billion was up 1%.
Earnings per share of $5 were down 4% compared to a year ago, reflecting lower nonoperating results and a higher tax rate in the current quarter.
Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $6 million of net investment gains, largely driven by gains on private equity and real estate investments, which offset market-driven losses on certain hedge funds and unhedged or partially hedged multi-asset and fixed income seed investments.
Our as adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 29.3% compared to a 26.2% a year ago, reflecting several favorable nonrecurring items. We currently estimate that 30% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2015. And based on what we know today, reflecting changes in our geographic business mix, estimate that 31% is a reasonable projected tax rate for 2016.
BlackRock generated $35 billion of quarterly long-term net flows, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 3%. Flows were positive across investment styles and client types, reinforcing the value of our broad-based, diversified business model. In a volatile market characterized by double-digit quarterly declines in a number of global equity indices and significant FX movement, clients continued to look to BlackRock for strong risk management and long-term investment solutions. In total, market depreciation and FX impact reduced the value of our assets under management by approximately $265 billion during the quarter.
Over the last 12 months, BlackRock generated approximately $186 billion of long-term net new business, representing a 4% long-term organic AUM growth rate and a 6% organic base fee growth rate as faster growth in our higher fee channels contributed to a favorable overall change in our base fee mix.
Third quarter base fees were approximately flat year-over-year despite over $200 billion of negative FX impact to market depreciation over the last 12 months. On a constant-currency basis, we estimate that quarterly base fees grew approximately 3% year-over-year. Sequentially, base fees were down 3% due to lower quarterly average AUM, a seasonal decline in securities lending activity and the impact of divergent beta on our fee rate as emerging and commodities markets underperformed developed markets. Going forward, our fourth quarter entry base fee level will be impacted as we enter the quarter with lower spot AUM than our average AUM for the third quarter.
Performance fees of $208 million were up 56% from a year ago, and while broad-based, benefited from a single European hedge fund that delivered exceptional full year performance and loss in the third quarter. BlackRock Solutions revenue of $167 million was up 1% year-over-year and 4% sequentially.
Aladdin revenue, which represented 81% of BRS revenue in the quarter, were 11% year-over-year, driven by several sizable client implementations and has now more than doubled since 2009.
Strong connectivity between our BRS and institutional client teams is facilitating improved dialogue with our most sophisticated clients as we continue to see increased demand for global investment platform consolidation and multi-risk solutions.
Revenue in our financial markets advisory business was down $11 million from a year ago, but flat sequentially as revenue in the third quarter of 2014 reflected the impact of several large ECB AQR advisory assignments. Despite lower levels of opportunistic revenue post financial crisis, FMA is benefiting from a more stable revenue profile, driven by an increased number of mandates and more repeat engagements in the current market environment.
Total expense rose $48 million year-over-year or 3%, driven primarily by compensation expense which increased $52 million from a year ago due to higher headcount, higher levels of performance fees and increased deferred compensation expense, partially offset by the impact of a stronger dollar.
G&A expense decreased $7 million from a year ago, due to lower levels of marketing spend, offset by a lower benefit from the FX impact remeasuring dollar exposures held overseas to their respective functional currencies. Recall that our GAAP G&A expense a year ago reflected an additional $50 million charge related to the production of an indemnification asset, which has been excluded from our as adjusted results. Sequentially, G&A expense increased $7 million primarily due to higher levels of professional fees in the third quarter.
Our third quarter as adjusted operating margin of 43.9% reflected expense awareness in the current market environment. Looking forward, we continue to be mindful of our discretionary level of spend as markets evolve, but currently anticipate a higher level of G&A spend during the fourth quarter, driven by seasonal factors and transaction-related expense associated with recently consummated acquisitions. As we stated in the past, we do not manage the business to a specific margin target. We do remain keenly focused on delivering long-term value to our shareholders and will work to strike an appropriate balance between strategic investment needs and prudent discretionary expense management. We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders in a consistent, systematic manner. In line with that commitment, we closed the acquisitions of I Cuadrada, the leading independently-managed infrastructure investment business in Mexico, and FutureAdvisor, a leader in digital wealth management, earlier this month. We do not expect these transactions to have a material impact on BlackRock's consolidated financial results.
During the third quarter, we also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares, and view that as a good planning rate for the remainder of the year.
In a quarter where our clients faced significant market volatility, BlackRock generated $50 billion of total net flows, including $35 billion of long-term net inflows, reflecting the benefits of a diverse investment and distribution platform and a commitment to alpha generation. BlackRock's Global Retail franchise saw long-term net inflows of $7 billion, positive across all asset classes, representing 5% annualized organic growth for the quarter and 10% organic growth over the last 12 months.
International retail net flows of $5 billion were paced by strong flows into international equities and unconstrained fixed income, highlighting the global nature of our platform. BlackRock's U.S. retail business generated long-term inflows of $2 billion, demonstrating resilience in what was a challenging quarter for the U.S. mutual fund industry. BlackRock's flows were led by broad-based fixed income activity or strong and consistent performance across the platform continues to differentiate us despite industry outflows in a number of product categories, including unconstrained fixed income and high yield.
Global iShares generated $23 billion of net new flows, representing 9% annualized organic growth for the quarter and 12% organic growth over the last 12 months. IShares value proposition, especially with respect to liquidity and transparency, was extremely evident in a market characterized by heightened volatility and year-to-date flows remained in record territory. IShares fixed income inflows of $18 billion reflected ongoing adoption of ETFs as a means of rapidly accessing and investing in fixed income markets. IShares equity inflows of $5 billion were led by flows into developed market exposures, including our Japan and Eurozone funds. We saw increased investor focus on risk aware smart beta products, with our minimum volatility funds raising more than $2 billion during the quarter and gaining the #1 ranking within the domestic product category. Our institutional client business saw over $5 billion in quarterly long-term net inflows, driven by higher fee active offerings as clients increasingly partnered with BlackRock to generate alpha across active solutions and alternative mandates.
Institutional active net inflows of $6 billion reflected over $4 billion of cross fixed income strategies and nearly $2 billion into core alternatives and marked our sixth consecutive quarter of active institutional inflows. Alternatives flows were broad-based, including infrastructure, private equity, real estate, fund to fund and alternative solutions offerings. In addition, strong fundraising momentum continued with an additional $1 billion of illiquid alternative commitments raised in the third quarter, bringing total unfunded commitments, a source of future inflows, to approximately $11 billion.
Overall, our third quarter results reflect the benefits of the investments we've made to build a differentiated, global business model. Diversification across investment styles, distribution channels, products and geographies enables us to serve clients irrespective of market environment or investment preference. Our goal remains to deliver consistent and differentiated growth over time.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Our third quarter results were driven by clients' continued trust in BlackRock's ability to manage risk and deliver holistic investment solutions as they look to achieve long-term goals and navigate uncertainty in an increasingly volatile economic environment. A slowing economy in China, persistent weakness in commodity prices, uncertainty around the Fed's decision on rates and continued fluctuation in currency valuation has contributed to a significant decline in global markets. Emerging-market equities were down 19%. Natural resources stocks were down 23%. And European and U.S. indexes were -- fell 9% and 7%, respectively, in just the last quarter.
Government actions continue to influence markets as central banks policies have caused imbalances in interest rates and currencies. Emerging-market currencies have experienced significant volatility, falling nearly 9% in the third quarter before rallying a little past the several days. More than ever, our clients value the model we built at BlackRock. BlackRock's global, multiproduct platform, our market-leading risk management capabilities through Aladdin and our focus on long-term solutions enables us to have a more robust conversation with more clients as they address portfolio composition and asset allocation. These conversations are not just focused on what products BlackRock can sell. They are focused on outcomes our clients are looking for, and how we could bring together capabilities across our global platform to help our clients achieve their goals. This approach has resulted in a stronger, longer-lasting relationships with our clients than ever before, which truly contributed to more than the $50 billion of net inflows this quarter.
Clients not only turn to BlackRock to manage assets, but to help them to understand the longer-term impact on developments in the financial landscape. The BlackRock Investment Institute continues to lead that discussion and hosted several client calls in the third quarter to address market volatility, with BII's most widely-attended call reaching more than 4,000 client participants. This heightened level of client engagement is translating into consistent growth, and BlackRock saw $35 billion of long-term net flows in the quarter, positive across, as Gary suggested, in investment styles and client types. The fact that we are seeing such diverse inflows in a volatile market speaks to the power of our platform that we built over time at BlackRock and the differentiating experience we provide to our clients.
We continue to grow our global distribution footprint and product set to serve a diverse set of clients with a holistic range of outcome-oriented solutions as clients are looking for income and uncorrelated returns in the current investment environment.
In the U.S., we anticipate client demand for income-focused products. And since they were launched, our strategic income opportunity and multi-asset income funds have garnered more flows through the third quarter than any fund in these categories, with more than $35 billion of total inflows.
Building upon the strength of these funds in the U.S., our global versions of BlackRock unconstrained fixed income and multi-asset income funds are gaining momentum with clients internationally. Year-to-date FIGO, our global unconstrained offering saw net inflows of $3.8 billion. And our global Multi-Asset Income Fund saw net inflows of more than $1.4 billion.
On the institutional side, client demand for active fixed income and alternative strategies continues to drive positive organic base fee growth. For example, while official institutional clients have generally been environmentally-driven net sellers and low fee index equity exposures, we have seen enhanced demand from the same clients for our active and alternative products and solutions, which have driven positive overall revenue growth among these clients this year. And this is some focus that we've talked about over a year, having clients navigate from index into active and back and forth, and the biggest differentiating feature of BlackRock today versus a few years ago, we have both active and passive products.
BlackRock recognizes that even the most comprehensive and global set of solutions will be insufficient without strong investment performance. As a global firm, our objective is to outperform consistently while our entire investment -- throughout our entire investment platform. We remain focused on embracing a team-oriented approach, leveraging our connectivity, our knowledge sharing forums and to translating all this information into insights from technology and big data to drive top-tier performance across all asset categories and investment strategies.
We've seen consistency in areas where we were strong and improvement in areas where we've been reinvesting in talent. In our scientific active equity business, 97% of the AUM performed above benchmark or peer medium for the 3-year period. And in our active taxable fixed income business, 90% of assets performed above benchmark or peer medium for the 3-year period. Over the last few years, we've invested in our fundamental equity business in hiring new talent, in technology and in unifying this global equity platform to be more effective to tap the resources entirely throughout BlackRock.
We're seeing the benefit of this investment. And in our Fundamental Active Equity business, 80% and 58% of our AUM is now above benchmark, our peer medium for the 1-year and 3-year, respectively.
And importantly, our global platform continues to deliver results. BlackRock's European and BlackRock's Asian Fundamental Equities platforms have 99% and 91% of their assets, respectively, above benchmarks or peer medium for the 3-year period.
Investors continue to turn to iShares amidst the heightened volatility to gain market exposures and enhanced portfolio construction. And iShares saw, as Gary discussed, $23 billion in net total inflows. IShares captured the #1 market share of the net new business globally in the U.S. and in Europe, and in the third quarter year-to-date. IShares flows were driven by fixed income as investors' utilized fixed income ETFs as an effective tool for diversification and liquidity. Equity flows were driven by $5 billion into European-listed iShares, and we saw positive inflows in Canada and Asia Pacific as well.
Extreme market volatility resulted in a disjointed market, open on August 24. Lack of pricing clarity, widespread delayed in stock openings and an unprecedented number of trading halts impacted a large number of both U.S.-listed single name stocks and equity ETFs. We have spoken with many different market participants, and based on our own experience, and these conversations we have made several recommendations with respect to U.S. equity market structure in a Viewpoint article titled, U.S. Equity Market Structure Lessons from August 24, which we published on our website last week. Demand for iShares has remained strong, and net iShares flows following August 24 has been robust at nearly $25 billion through yesterday.
Despite near-term market fluctuations, we continue to focus on the long run by investing in areas that we believe will result in a more complete offering for our clients and delivering value for our shareholders. Over the last 2 years, our institutional clients rebalancing survey indicated that institutes plan to increase allocations to real assets. We continue to expand our real asset offerings, including BlackRock's infrastructure platform, which provides clients with current income diversification, income protection and potential for capital appreciation, while helping to drive economic growth and job creation. As Gary mentioned earlier this month, we closed on the acquisition of I Cuadrada, Mexico's leading infrastructure investment firm, and BlackRock now manages nearly $7 billion in infrastructure investments on behalf of clients worldwide.
Technology is another area where we've built on our existing strength through recent investments to enhance the way we serve our clients. We continue to enhance our Aladdin platform by building out our multi-asset capabilities, driving 11% revenue growth year-over-year. And we're seeing growing demand as investors become more focused on risk management and the evolving financial and regulatory landscape.
Earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of FutureAdvisor, a leading digital wealth management platform. As consumers increasingly engage with technology to invest, BlackRock and FutureAdvisor, our position to empower our distribution partners to better serve their clients by combining FutureAdvisor's high-quality technology-enabled advice with BlackRock's multi-asset investment capabilities, our proprietary technology, and most importantly, our risk analytics.
We've built and continue to invest in our platform and our people, so that we can have a deeper dialogue with our clients and deliver consistent results, for our shareholders, especially through times of heightened uncertainty.
On a very personal note, as many of you know, Charlie Hallac, who was named our Co-President last year, passed away in September, following a lengthy battle against cancer. Charlie is missed by many of his friends across BlackRock. Our greatest tribute to him will be to carry forward his life work by continuing to deliver excellence to our clients, to constantly innovate, and more importantly, to look relentlessly for ways to evolve, as Charlie always did.
Finally, I want to thank our employees for their continued focus and dedication in creating better financial futures for our clients.
So let's now open it up for questions."

That has settled down. Certainly, newcomers in the market may look to use price as one of the ways to enter the market, but I haven't seen that really in the last quarter. Going forward, I think smart beta is one of the areas that's going to continue to be a successful product and a necessary product. We currently have about $125 billion in client assets across a variety of factor-based products and smart beta products. We actually, recently hired Dr. Andrew Ang, and he is going to lead our factor-based strategies group, so that we can lead in the factor-based investing and portfolio construction. And we're going to combine our skill set and his systematic investment skill set, along with Aladdin, to focus on the factor and the smart beta area. So I think you are astute in seeing that that's something that clients are going to look for. We have already have a number of these. One is our minimum volatility fund. We've raised about $2 billion. And we are the leader in U.S. ETFs in the smart beta area. But just to step back on the price, please keep in mind that price is only one reason of why people buy ETFs. They're looking for precision or what you're discussing, a new approach in smart beta or factor investing. They're certainly looking for liquidity, which means you have to have a fund that has some sort of a size. And depending upon the type of investor, they could be a core investor, which we call a buy-and-hold, or they're looking to be more active. So price is important, but it's one -- only one aspect. And I just haven't seen the price pressure that we've seen a year ago and up to the first half of this year."

There are some very large movements from some clients that are actively moving out of government securities into more risk-oriented securities. That's pretty well advertised about me going into the specifics of that. We have seen some clients, because of cash needs, have been selling products. So I think Asia Pac has been dominated more by 3 or 4 large institutions moving around. I think I'm talking about the whole ecosystem of the markets. And then what we saw, as I -- we saw more consistent flows in Asia Pac, iShares. We are seeing actually more utilization of dollar assets today related to our institutional clients. And I would say -- and in some parts of Asia, as Rob suggested, in the fourth quarter, there's more and more movement towards multi-asset. So I don't see any major change in the specifics of BlackRock in the third quarter. We did have index outflows in the APAC, and however, as I suggested in my formal speech, some of these clients moved into more active products. And so we had actually, a positive overall revenue growth in that region. So I would say nothing that was extraordinary, just some large actions. And I think you're going to see a consistent growth out of Asia Pac overall as some of the major clients are looking to invest in more global products away from their host products or host country products, so we feel good about Asia Pacific and Australia right now."

I think it's very important that we have better disclosure on liquidity for all funds. We have better disclosures on stressing funds. There's certainly more and more dialogue about one directional trades worldwide from the regulators. And so I actually believe the SEC is leading this effort and trying to come up with the appropriate analysis to help guide investors, understand the embedded issues, risk or opportunities in mutual funds. So we look at this as a net positive that we're always in favor of better disclosure. The one cautionary thing we would say to any regulator, let's not make retail products less competitive than institutional products. So for instance, the base suggested that a mutual fund product should have a higher cash buffer, and that would probably mean most institutional clients would move to a separate account, we may not achieve what we're trying to achieve. So we are in favor of better disclosures. I think through better disclosures, you're going to have better processes, possibly stress testing of fund, depending on the methodologies. That may work too. So we have an open mind. And I don't know, Bill, exactly where it's going, but we want to play a constructive role globally on these issues. If I would say, as we talked about over the last few years, regulators worldwide have gone from analysis of firms related to city designation to activities, so -- and we were a big supporter of that as a firm, and these are the type of activities that most certainly the regulators are going to be focusing on. As I said, we are -- we have constructive, positive dialogue with the regulators throughout the world on this. So we'll wait and see."

The global products are also seeing some demand. So some of it's from changes in regulation, but a lot of it is due to education and people having knowledge that iShares can actually play a big role in achieving the results that people want in their portfolio."

We're focusing on helping clients meet the needs of their liabilities. Many clients have liabilities that are very long-dated. Many clients have under-invested, and so they actually have a gap between their length of the duration of their liabilities versus the duration of their bonds. As interest rates rise, if they rise, I think they will rise one day, we are actually going to see an accelerated movement towards clients buying longer-duration assets, and that's -- I mean I'm not talking about trading strategies, but clients that are pension-fund-oriented or long-dated insurance type of product, they're going to use an opportunity to buy different long-dated assets. Clients who are more interested in any trade, obviously, they're going to get out of a long duration and move into low duration or something like our Strategic Income Opportunity Fund, where they're not going to be -- they're not going to be constrained to a duration. It will be an unconstrained product. So what the third quarter saw, we saw lots of movement. We saw some clients were adding duration. We saw some clients were reducing duration. We saw some clients taking advantage -- and this is one thing that I haven't seen in the narrative -- we saw -- we have clients were taking advantage of the rising high-yield market because high yield underperformed in the third quarter, and we saw clients are moving back into high yield because the coupon and risk-adjusted basis in some categories are achieving their needs to match their liabilities. So this is a -- this is an important component of why, I believe we have differentiated ourselves because we are working with our clients, trying to keep the narrative on what is their outcome that they're seeking. It's not about trading in and out. It is about how can they best achieve the composition of assets to meet their liabilities. And by continuing to drive home this concept of long-term-ism and outcomes instead of the noise at the moment has allowed us to have deeper dialogue. And I think the flows in fixed income have shown the results of having deeper dialogues and focus on outcomes."

MAI, and keep in mind, I think, also there's just one other additional point is that when we talk about multi-asset that you're looking at in the context of our reporting, we're really talking about bundled outcome products that I think you're talking about. There's lots of other multi-asset discussions and solutions that are going on around the firm that frankly fit into lots of other categories. But as you talked about bundle products like LifePath and Global Al, which obviously 2 of our flagship products, they did see flattish flows in the quarter. And I think while we would say that MAI's flows were not as strong as prior quarters, it still was positive to the tune of $500 million, and it still remains our top selling -- or the top-selling Multi-Asset Income Fund since its launch about 3 years ago. Larry talked a lot about SIOs and other similar products, which is a fixed-income product, and obviously that, and in addition to that, with LBI and some other things, we've seen very positive flows there, but there's no question that as we saw some slow inflows, where there was MAI, DDG or even LifePath, we did see some slows -- some slowing of the flows. I think it's early for us to figure out whether, in particular, around target date, that, that is an industry phenomena or not. Obviously, we did see unprecedented volatility. I think that if we actually look across a lot of those products with respect to the different dates, we definitely did see more flows in so-called near-term maturity dates as opposed to the long term, which may suggest that as people who are looking to basically approach retirement more quickly, they saw volatility and were deciding to eliminate some of the equity exposure in the near term, but I think we'll be watching that very closely and see to what extent those change direction in the next few quarters."

So as you know, now ETFs are being used as a surrogate for futures across many institutional account. So we think that's going to continue. And how big can that be? Just think about the size of the futures market. And certainly, regulation is going to play a big role in that as well. So as capital cost are going up for a lot of institutions, ETFs are starting to play a bigger role. So that's sort of where we're at.

I believe, today, we have more dialogue. We have deeper dialogues with clients worldwide that is going to allow us, if the opportunity prevails, when a client is looking to reduce beta exposures, to go into other forms of alpha exposures. Whether it's just active equity management, active fixed income or alternatives, we have those dialogues, and I -- once again, I do believe the third quarter is starting to show that evidence that we're able to navigate. Rob and I spend a great deal of time on the road. We have -- we're constantly reminded that if we can provide this holistic solution to our clients, and we can provide a deeper analysis what the needs of our clients, we have seen consistently that we're able to have a broader product range solution for our clients.

If you look specifically in the third quarter, we had -- we grew many different types of alternatives. We had $2 billion in positive flows. We had another $1 billion in forward commitments.

On the surface, it will change the relationships with the distribution partners with their clients. We have to adapt our business with our distribution partners on that business. I think one thing is very clear how these all plays out. It means greater emphasis in beta products and ETFs. But until we see how this is rolled out, and we've had comments on it that are very public about our opinions related to the DOL fiduciary role, I would also say that if investors build more confidence because of -- however the DOL rule plays out. But if investors feel more confident that they can invest fairly, securely, we're all benefited by that. Now I'm not sure how that will play out, but we've always believed if we could have a marketplace where our clients feel more secure, that they have an opportunity to earn a fair return over a long cycle, everyone will be benefited by that, the clients, obviously, our distribution partners and investment management team. So we -- once again, we try to take a constructive approach to the SEC, mindful that some of the SEC fiduciary rules would change the relationships with our distribution partners, and we try to work with the regulators in terms of finding a sensible solution that meets the challenges of our distribution partners, the asset manager, but importantly, giving the end client the trust that they need in terms of investing for the future."

Now on top of that, the Scientific Access Equity Group, the more [indiscernible] driven and model-driven portfolios, the 3-year record, which is what a lot of the consultants look at, the 98% of the assets are above the benchmark or peer median.

You are paid a higher income for those types of returns, and I do believe having a measurement, hopefully, it's a dynamic measurement, a dynamic measurement will allow investors -- and we're talking mostly retail, investors having a better understanding. And so if we can come up with a metrics that is dynamic, that is informative about the liquidity of any one product and differentiating that liquidity amongst different funds, because some funds, some different -- some mutual funds have systematically always -- even in the asset categories of, let's say, high yields, hasn't consistently invested in the lower-grade high yield with less liquidity, and some mutual funds have invested in the higher-grade high yield that had more liquidity, and so some form of dynamic measurement is probably good. I don't -- I actually believe -- once again, as investors are becoming more informed and they better understand the risks and the returns, I actually believe it will be to greater investments in different asset categories. This is something we should all embrace. So I don't -- as I said, I look at this as a positive. It's a constructive way of analyzing. We just need to make sure that we don't cause so much problems at all, institutions running out of mutual funds and go to separate accounts, and we may not be achieving everything that is necessary, but we want smart investors. Smart investor is better for the entire asset management industry. We should not run away from markets that are opaque. We should always be trying to find ways of making more transparency in terms of risk. In terms of Aladdin, greater risk analytics, whether it's liquidity analytics or stress test analytics, is a very large positive for the future direction and needs of clients utilizing Aladdin. As I said in my prepared remarks, Aladdin is growing 11% a year. We are in deep dialogue with many clients right now, and I feel very good about how Aladdin is the risk management platform of choice by so many investors worldwide."

If we can, our hope is to -- and our intention is to link our FutureAdvisor technology with our Aladdin technology to help our distribution partners to have both better risk analytics and most -- and better client interface information, so they can be providing better guidance to their clients.

So -- but it is very important to note  because they never really talk about it, putting Aladdin -- putting FutureAdvisor into our BlackRock Solutions platform really gives us this ability to really create a third-party platform to provide independent information for our clients that's very similar to what BlackRock Aladdin does for our clients, independent risk management.

It's my pleasure to be here to present results for the third quarter of 2015.Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and busine",1471,"Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. This is Gary Shedlin. It's my pleasure to be here to present results for the third quarter of 2015.
Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results, and as usual, I will be focusing primarily on our as adjusted results.
Against a challenging market backdrop, BlackRock's third quarter results demonstrate the stability of our diverse global platform, highlighted by continued organic growth, stable operating margins and systematic capital return. Third quarter revenue of $2.9 billion was 2% higher than a year ago, while operating income of $1.2 billion was up 1%.
Earnings per share of $5 were down 4% compared to a year ago, reflecting lower nonoperating results and a higher tax rate in the current quarter.
Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $6 million of net investment gains, largely driven by gains on private equity and real estate investments, which offset market-driven losses on certain hedge funds and unhedged or partially hedged multi-asset and fixed income seed investments.
Our as adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 29.3% compared to a 26.2% a year ago, reflecting several favorable [ph] nonrecurring items. We currently estimate that 30% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2015. And based on what we know today, reflecting changes in our geographic business mix, estimate that 31% is a reasonable projected tax rate for 2016.
BlackRock generated $35 billion of quarterly long-term net flows, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 3%. Flows were positive across investment styles and client types, reinforcing the value of our broad-based, diversified business model. In a volatile market characterized by double-digit quarterly declines in a number of global equity indices and significant FX movement, clients continued to look to BlackRock for strong risk management and long-term investment solutions. In total, market depreciation and FX impact reduced the value of our assets under management by approximately $265 billion during the quarter.
Over the last 12 months, BlackRock generated approximately $186 billion of long-term net new business, representing a 4% long-term organic AUM growth rate and a 6% organic base fee growth rate, as faster growth in our higher-fee channels contributed to a favorable overall change in our base fee mix.
Third quarter base fees were approximately flat year-over-year despite over $200 billion of negative FX impact and market depreciation over the last 12 months. On a constant-currency basis, we estimate that quarterly base fees grew approximately 3% year-over-year. Sequentially, base fees were down 3% due to lower quarterly average AUM, a seasonal decline in securities lending activity and the impact of divergent beta on our fee rate as emerging and commodities markets underperformed developed markets. Going forward, our fourth quarter entry base fee level will be impacted as we enter the quarter with lower spot AUM than our average AUM for the third quarter.
Performance fees of $208 million were up 56% from a year ago, and while broad based, benefited from a single European hedge fund that delivered exceptional full year performance and locked in the third quarter. BlackRock Solutions revenue of $167 million was up 1% year-over-year and 4% sequentially.
Aladdin revenue, which represented 81% of BRS revenue in the quarter, grew 11% year-over-year, driven by several sizable client implementations and has now more than doubled since 2009.
Strong connectivity between our BRS and institutional client teams is facilitating improved dialogue with our most sophisticated clients as we continue to see increased demand for global investment platform consolidation and multi-risk solutions.
Revenue in our Financial Markets Advisory business was down $11 million from a year ago, but flat sequentially as revenue in the third quarter of 2014 reflected the impact of several large ECB AQR advisory assignments. Despite lower levels of opportunistic revenue post financial crisis, FMA is benefiting from a more stable revenue profile, driven by an increased number of mandates and more repeat engagements in the current market environment.
Total expense rose $48 million year-over-year or 3%, driven primarily by compensation expense, which increased $52 million from a year ago due to higher headcount, higher levels of performance fees and increased deferred compensation expense, partially offset by the impact of a stronger dollar.
G&A expense decreased $7 million from a year ago, due to lower levels of marketing spend, offset by a lower benefit from the FX impact, remeasuring dollar exposures held overseas to their respective functional currencies. Recall that our GAAP G&A expense a year ago reflected an additional $50 million charge related to the reduction of an indemnification asset, which has been excluded from our as adjusted results. Sequentially, G&A expense increased $7 million, primarily due to higher levels of professional fees in the third quarter.
Our third quarter as adjusted operating margin of 43.9% reflected expense awareness in the current market environment. Looking forward, we continue to be mindful of our discretionary level of spend as markets evolve, but currently anticipate a higher level of G&A spend during the fourth quarter, driven by seasonal factors and transaction-related expense associated with recently consummated acquisitions. As we stated in the past, we do not manage the business to a specific margin target. We do remain keenly focused on delivering long-term value to our shareholders and will work to strike an appropriate balance between strategic investment needs and prudent discretionary expense management. We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business, and then returning excess cash to shareholders in a consistent, systematic manner. In line with that commitment, we closed the acquisitions of I Cuadrada, the leading independently managed infrastructure investment business in Mexico, and FutureAdvisor, a leader in digital wealth management, earlier this month. We do not expect these transactions to have a material impact on BlackRock's consolidated financial results.
During the third quarter, we also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares, and view that as a good planning rate for the remainder of the year.
In a quarter where our clients faced significant market volatility, BlackRock generated $50 billion of total net flows, including $35 billion of long-term net inflows, reflecting the benefits of a diverse investment and distribution platform and a commitment to alpha generation. BlackRock's Global Retail franchise saw long-term net inflows of $7 billion, positive across all asset classes, representing 5% annualized organic growth for the quarter and 10% organic growth over the last 12 months.
International retail net flows of $5 billion were paced by strong flows into international equities and unconstrained fixed income, highlighting the global nature of our platform. BlackRock's U.S. retail business generated long-term inflows of $2 billion, demonstrating resilience in what was a challenging quarter for the U.S. mutual fund industry. BlackRock's flows were led by broad-based fixed income activity, where strong and consistent performance across the platform continues to differentiate us despite industry outflows in a number of product categories, including unconstrained fixed income and high yield.
Global iShares generated $23 billion of net new flows, representing 9% annualized organic growth for the quarter and 12% organic growth over the last 12 months. iShares value proposition, especially with respect to liquidity and transparency, was extremely evident in a market characterized by heightened volatility, and year-to-date flows remained in record territory. iShares fixed income inflows of $18 billion reflected ongoing adoption of ETFs as a means of rapidly accessing and investing in fixed income markets. iShares equity inflows of $5 billion were led by flows into developed market exposures, including our Japan and Eurozone funds. We saw increased investor focus on risk-aware smart beta products, with our minimum volatility funds raising more than $2 billion during the quarter and gaining the #1 ranking within the domestic product category. Our institutional client business saw over $5 billion in quarterly long-term net inflows, driven by higher fee active offerings as clients increasingly partnered with BlackRock to generate alpha across active solutions and alternative mandates.
Institutional active net inflows of $6 billion reflected over $4 billion of cross fixed income strategies and nearly $2 billion into core alternatives, and marked our sixth consecutive quarter of active institutional inflows. Alternatives flows were broad-based, including infrastructure, private equity, real estate, fund-to-fund and alternative solutions offerings. In addition, strong fundraising momentum continued with an additional $1 billion of illiquid alternative commitments raised in the third quarter, bringing total unfunded commitments, a source of future inflows, to approximately $11 billion.
Overall, our third quarter results reflect the benefits of the investments we've made to build a differentiated, global business model. Diversification across investment styles, distribution channels, products and geographies enables us to serve clients irrespective of market environment or investment preference. Our goal remains to deliver consistent and differentiated growth over time.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Our third quarter results were driven by clients' continued trust in BlackRock's ability to manage risk and deliver holistic investment solutions as they look to achieve long-term goals and navigate uncertainty in an increasingly volatile economic environment. A slowing economy in China, persistent weakness in commodity prices, uncertainty around the Fed's decision on rates and continued fluctuation in currency valuation has contributed to a significant decline in global markets. Emerging-market equities were down 19%. Natural resources stocks were down 23%. And European and U.S. indexes were -- fell 9% and 7%, respectively, in just the last quarter.
Government actions continue to influence markets as central banks policies have caused imbalances in interest rates and currencies. Emerging-market currencies have experienced significant volatility, falling nearly 9% in the third quarter before rallying over the past several days. More than ever, our clients value the model we built at BlackRock. BlackRock's global, multiproduct platform, our market-leading risk management capabilities through Aladdin and our focus on long-term solutions enables us to have a more robust conversation with more clients as they address portfolio composition and asset allocation. These conversations are not just focused on what products BlackRock can sell. They are focused on outcomes our clients are looking for, and how we could bring together capabilities across our global platform to help our clients achieve their goals. This approach has resulted in stronger, longer-lasting relationships with our clients than ever before, which truly contributed to more than the $50 billion of net inflows this quarter.
Clients not only turn to BlackRock to manage assets, but to help them to understand the longer-term impact on developments in the financial landscape. The BlackRock Investment Institute continues to lead that discussion and hosted several client calls in the third quarter to address market volatility, with BII's most widely attended call reaching more than 4,000 client participants. This heightened level of client engagement is translating into consistent growth, and BlackRock saw $35 billion of long-term net flows in the quarter, positive across, as Gary suggested, investment styles and client types. The fact that we are seeing such diverse inflows in a volatile market speaks to the power of our platform that we built over time at BlackRock and the differentiating experience we provide to our clients.
We continue to grow our global distribution footprint and product set to serve a diverse set of clients with a holistic range of outcome-oriented solutions, as clients are looking for income and uncorrelated returns in the current investment environment.
In the U.S., we anticipate client demand for income-focused products. And since they were launched, our Strategic Income Opportunity and Multi-Asset Income Funds have garnered more flows through the third quarter than any fund in these categories, with more than $35 billion of total inflows.
Building upon the strength of these funds in the U.S., our global versions of BlackRock unconstrained Fixed Income and Multi-Asset Income Funds are gaining momentum with clients internationally. Year-to-date FIGO, our global unconstrained offering, saw net inflows of $3.8 billion. And our global Multi-Asset Income Fund saw net inflows of more than $1.4 billion.
On the institutional side, client demand for active fixed income and alternative strategies continues to drive positive organic base fee growth. For example, while official institutional clients have generally been environmentally driven net sellers in low-fee index equity exposures, we have seen enhanced demand from the same clients for our active and alternative products and solutions, which have driven positive overall revenue growth among these clients this year. And this is some focus that we've talked about over years, having clients navigate from index into active and back and forth, and the biggest differentiating feature of BlackRock today versus a few years ago, we have both active and passive products.
BlackRock recognizes that even the most comprehensive and global set of solutions will be insufficient without strong investment performance. As a global firm, our objective is to outperform consistently while our entire investment -- throughout our entire investment platform. We remain focused on embracing a team-oriented approach, leveraging our connectivity, our knowledge-sharing forums and to translating all this information into insights from technology and big data to drive top-tier performance across all asset categories and investment strategies.
We've seen consistency in areas where we were strong and improvement in areas where we've been reinvesting in talent. In our scientific active equity business, 97% of the AUM performed above benchmark or peer median for the 3-year period. And in our active taxable fixed income business, 90% of assets performed above benchmark or peer median for the 3-year period. Over the last few years, we've invested in our fundamental equity business in hiring new talent, in technology and in unifying this global equity platform to be more effective to tap the resources entirely throughout BlackRock.
We're seeing the benefit of this investment. And in our fundamental active equity business, 80% and 58% of our AUM is now above benchmark or peer median for the 1-year and 3-year, respectively.
And importantly, our global platform continues to deliver results. BlackRock's European and BlackRock's Asian Fundamental Equities platforms have 99% and 91% of their assets, respectively, above benchmarks or peer median for the 3-year period.
Investors continue to turn to iShares amidst the heightened volatility to gain market exposures and enhanced portfolio construction. And iShares saw, as Gary discussed, $23 billion in net total inflows. iShares captured the #1 market share of the net new business globally in the U.S. and in Europe, and in the third quarter year-to-date. iShares flows were driven by fixed income as investors' utilized fixed income ETFs as an effective tool for diversification and liquidity. Equity flows were driven by $5 billion into European-listed iShares, and we saw positive inflows in Canada and Asia Pacific as well.
Extreme market volatility resulted in a disjointed market open on August 24. Lack of pricing clarity, widespread delays in stock openings and an unprecedented number of trading halts impacted a large number of both U.S.-listed single-name stocks and equity ETFs. We have spoken with many different market participants, and based on our own experience and these conversations, we have made several recommendations with respect to U.S. equity market structure in a Viewpoint article titled, U.S. Equity Market Structure Lessons from August 24, which we published on our website last week. Demand for iShares has remained strong, and net iShares flows following August 24 has been robust at nearly $25 billion through yesterday.
Despite near-term market fluctuations, we continue to focus on the long run by investing in areas that we believe will result in a more complete offering for our clients and delivering value for our shareholders. Over the last 2 years, our institutional clients rebalancing survey indicated that institutes plan to increase allocations to real assets. We continue to expand our real asset offerings, including BlackRock's infrastructure platform, which provides clients with current income diversification, income protection and potential for capital appreciation, while helping to drive economic growth and job creation. As Gary mentioned earlier, this month, we closed on the acquisition of I Cuadrada, Mexico's leading infrastructure investment firm, and BlackRock now manages nearly $7 billion in infrastructure investments on behalf of clients worldwide.
Technology is another area where we've built on our existing strength through recent investments to enhance the way we serve our clients. We continue to enhance our Aladdin platform by building out our multi-asset capabilities, driving 11% revenue growth year-over-year. And we're seeing growing demand as investors become more focused on risk management in the evolving financial and regulatory landscape.
Earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of FutureAdvisor, a leading digital wealth management platform. As consumers increasingly engage with technology to invest, BlackRock and FutureAdvisor are positioned to empower our distribution partners to better serve their clients by combining FutureAdvisor's high-quality, technology-enabled advice with BlackRock's multi-asset investment capabilities, our proprietary technology, and most importantly, our risk analytics.
We've built and continue to invest in our platform and our people so that we can have a deeper dialogue with our clients and deliver consistent results for our shareholders, especially through times of heightened uncertainty.
On a very personal note, as many of you know, Charlie Hallac, who was named our Co-President last year, passed away in September, following a lengthy battle against cancer. Charlie is missed by many of his friends across BlackRock. Our greatest tribute to him will be to carry forward his life work by continuing to deliver excellence to our clients, to constantly innovate, and more importantly, to look relentlessly for ways to evolve, as Charlie always did.
Finally, I want to thank our employees for their continued focus and dedication in creating better financial futures for our clients.
So let's now open it up for questions."

That has settled down. Certainly, newcomers in the market may look to use price as one of the ways to enter the market, but I haven't seen that really in the last quarter. Going forward, I think smart beta is one of the areas that's going to continue to be a successful product and a necessary product. We currently have about $125 billion in client assets across a variety of factor-based products and smart beta products. We actually, recently, hired Dr. Andrew Ang, and he is going to lead our factor-based strategies group so that we can lead in the factor-based investing and portfolio construction. And we're going to combine our skill set and his systematic investment skill set, along with Aladdin, to focus on the factor and the smart beta area. So I think you are astute in seeing that that's something that clients are going to look for. We have already have a number of these. One is our minimum volatility fund. We've raised about $2 billion. And we are the leader in U.S. ETFs in the smart beta area. But just to step back on the price, please keep in mind that price is only one reason of why people buy ETFs. They're looking for precision or what you're discussing, a new approach in smart beta or factor investing. They're certainly looking for liquidity, which means you have to have a fund that has some sort of size. And depending upon the type of investor, they could be a core investor, which we call a buy-and-hold, or they're looking to be more active. So price is important, but it's one -- only one aspect. And I just haven't seen the price pressure that we've seen a year ago and up to the first half of this year."

So I think Asia Pac has been dominated more by 3 or 4 large institutions moving around. I think I'm talking about the whole ecosystem of the markets. And then what we saw, as I -- we saw more consistent flows in Asia Pac iShares. We are seeing actually more utilization of dollar assets today related to our institutional clients. And I would say -- and in some parts of Asia, as Rob suggested, in the fourth quarter, there's more and more movement towards multi-asset. So I don't see any major change in the specifics of BlackRock in the third quarter. We did have index outflows in the APAC, and however, as I suggested in my formal speech, some of these clients moved into more active products. And so we had actually a positive overall revenue growth in that region. So I would say nothing that was extraordinary, just some large actions.

I think it's very important that we have better disclosure on liquidity for all funds, we have better disclosures on stressing funds. There's certainly more and more dialogue about one-directional trades worldwide from the regulators. And so I actually believe the SEC is leading this effort and trying to come up with the appropriate analysis to help guide investors, understand the embedded issues, risk or opportunities in mutual funds. So we look at this as a net positive that we're always in favor of better disclosure. The one cautionary thing we would say to any regulator, let's not make retail products less competitive than institutional products. So for instance, the base suggested that a mutual fund product should have a higher cash buffer, and that would probably mean most institutional clients would move to a separate account.
We may not achieve what we're trying to achieve. So we are in favor of better disclosures. I think through better disclosures, you're going to have better processes, possibly stress testing of funds, depending on the methodologies. That may work too. So we have an open mind. And I don't know, Bill, exactly where it's going, but we want to play a constructive role globally on these issues. If I would say, as we talked about over the last few years, regulators worldwide have gone from analysis of firms related to SIFI designation to activities, so -- and we were a big supporter of that as a firm, and these are the type of activities that most certainly the regulators are going to be focusing on. As I said, we are -- we have constructive, positive dialogue with the regulators throughout the world on this. So we'll wait and see."

So some of it's from changes in regulation, but a lot of it is due to education and people having knowledge that iShares can actually play a big role in achieving the results that people want in their portfolio."

We're focusing on helping clients meet the needs of their liabilities. Many clients have liabilities that are very long-dated. Many clients have under-invested, and so they actually have a gap between their length of the duration of their liabilities versus the duration of their bonds. As interest rates rise, if they rise, I think they will rise one day, we are actually going to see an accelerated movement towards clients buying longer-duration assets, and that's -- I mean, I'm not talking about trading strategies, but clients that are pension-fund-oriented or long-dated insurance type of products, they're going to use this an opportunity to buy different long-dated assets. Clients who are more interested in any trade, obviously, they're going to get out of long duration and move into low duration or something like our Strategic Income Opportunity Fund, where they're not going to be -- they're not going to be constrained to a duration. It will be an unconstrained product. So what the third quarter saw, we saw lots of movement. We saw some clients were adding duration. We saw some clients were reducing duration. We saw some clients taking advantage -- and this is one thing that I haven't seen in the narrative -- we saw -- we have clients who are taking advantage of the rising high-yield market because high yield underperformed in the third quarter, and we saw clients are moving back into high yield because the coupon and risk-adjusted basis in some categories are achieving their needs to match their liabilities. So this is a -- this is an important component of why I believe we have differentiated ourselves because we are working with our clients, trying to keep the narrative on what is their outcome that they're seeking. It's not about trading in and out. It is about how can they best achieve the composition of assets to meet their liabilities. And by continuing to drive home this concept of long-term-ism and outcomes instead of the noise at the moment has allowed us to have deeper dialogue. And I think the flows in fixed income have shown the results of having deeper dialogues and focus on outcomes."

MAI -- and keep in mind, I think, also there's just one other additional point is that when we talk about multi-asset that you're looking at in the context of our reporting, we're really talking about bundled outcome products that I think you're talking about. There's lots of other multi-asset discussions and solutions that are going on around the firm that frankly fit into lots of other categories. But as you talked about bundle products like LifePath and Global Al, which obviously are 2 of our flagship products, they did see flattish flows in the quarter. And I think while we would say that MAI's flows were not as strong as prior quarters, it still was positive to the tune of $500 million, and it still remains our top selling -- or the top-selling Multi-Asset Income Fund since its launch about 3 years ago. Larry talked a lot about SIOs and other similar products, which is a fixed-income product, and obviously that, and in addition to that, with LDI and some other things, we've seen very positive flows there. But there's no question that as we saw some slowing flows, where it was MAI, DDG or even LifePath, we did see some slows -- some slowing of the flows. I think it's early for us to figure out whether, in particular, around target date, that, that is an industry phenomena or not. Obviously, we did see unprecedented volatility. I think that if we actually look across a lot of those products with respect to the different dates, we definitely did see more flows in so-called near-term maturity dates as opposed to the long term, which may suggest that as people who are looking to basically approach retirement more quickly, they saw volatility and were deciding to eliminate some of the equity exposure in the near term. But I think we'll be watching that very closely and see to what extent those change direction in the next few quarters."

So as futures became more expensive to use than ETFs, it opened up a whole new world that we didn't even think about because of the collateral cost behind futures contracts. So when we are going into the capital markets, and we are meeting lots of fixed income and equity clients, and having these discussions and talking to them about uses, most of the time, we walk away with some other ideas that we didn't think about that they have needs for. So as you know, now ETFs are being used as a surrogate for futures across many institutional accounts. So we think that's going to continue. And how big can that be? Just think about the size of the futures market. And certainly, regulation is going to play a big role in that as well. So as capital costs are going up for a lot of institutions, ETFs are starting to play a bigger role. So that's sort of where we're at. And I would tell you in the fixed-income side, fixed income really lagged the equity market when it came to new uses, and we are -- we have added a bunch of people in our capital markets group for iShares to go out and to really work with different institutions in both education, and also both learning what some of their needs are, so that we can innovate those products for them."

We are -- this is one of the big reasons we are building out our infrastructure platform, continuing to build out our hedge fund platform, our real estate platform. So as I said earlier, we are in deeper conversations with clients than we've ever been before. Much of it has to do with the quality of our relationships, our focus on risk management and our ability to deliver solutions. So I mean that sounds like a lot of talk, but it's now -- that positioning has now transformed us to have those dialogues. 5 years ago when we were -- in many relationships where we strictly had a beta relationship, we were not -- we did not have the ability to provide the products or have the dialogue with many more clients. I believe, today, we have more dialogue. We have deeper dialogues with clients worldwide that is going to allow us, if the opportunity prevails, when a client is looking to reduce beta exposures, to go into other forms of alpha exposures. Whether it's just active equity management, active fixed income or alternatives, we have those dialogues, and I -- once again, I do believe the third quarter is starting to show that evidence that we're able to navigate. Rob and I spend a great deal of time on the road. We have -- we're constantly reminded that if we can provide this holistic solution to our clients, and we can provide a deeper analysis what the needs of our clients, we have seen consistently that we're able to have a broader product-range solution for our clients. And as we continue to drive that and build these relationships, I think you're going to see that navigation in our flows and our business. If you look specifically in the third quarter, we had -- we grew many different types of alternatives. We had $2 billion in positive flows. We had another $1 billion in forward commitments. And the most positive thing I could tell you related to those flows, those flows principally came in 6 different products, which is another statement of the growing product breadth that we are developing for our clients."

On the surface, it will change the relationships with the distribution partners with their clients. We have to adapt our business with our distribution partners on that business. I think one thing is very clear how this all plays out: It means greater emphasis in beta products and ETFs. But until we see how this is rolled out, and we've had comments on it that are very public about our opinions related to the DoL fiduciary role. I would also say that if investors feel more confidence because of -- however the DoL rule plays out. But if investors feel more confident that they can invest fairly, securely, we're all benefited by that. Now I'm not sure how that will play out, but we've always believed if we could have a marketplace where our clients feel more secure, that they have an opportunity to earn a fair return over a long cycle, everyone will be benefited by that: the clients, obviously; our distribution partners; and investment management team. So we -- once again, we try to take a constructive approach to the SEC, mindful that some of the SEC fiduciary rules would change the relationships with our distribution partners, and we try to work with the regulators in terms of finding a sensible solution that meets the challenges of our distribution partners, the asset manager, but importantly, giving the end client the trust that they need in terms of investing for the future."

We spent a lot of time and money, as you know, in China to rebuild our efforts there and the teams, and I feel very good about this. Certainly, in Europe, our team there has been together longer. Their record across the board is now very strong, and now we're starting to see the same efforts in the U.S. through our Capital Appreciation Fund, our Equity Dividend Fund. So the performance is actually really good. Now on top of that, the Scientific Active Equity Group, the more quantitatively-driven and model-driven portfolios, the 3-year record, which is what a lot of the consultants look at, the 98% of the assets are above the benchmark or peer median. We had work to do domestically, and today, the fundamental active equity business, 81% of the assets are above the benchmark for the 1-year period. So as time goes on, the performance is really, really much better. So when you see better performance, it translates directly into flows, and we're starting to see those flows. We're having much better dialogue with our consultants, who are now putting us in the mix for proposals, and we're also internally very focused on building out the equity effort. And you're going to hear a lot more from us, from our marketing teams and the rest of the teams across the firm because we are going to be much bigger in the active equity space, and we're very happy to have the performance to back that up. So very important are -- and we're still building. We're still adding people, but we're getting results and are seeing good, positive feedback from our clients now."

High yield has somewhat less liquidity than an investment-grade product. A treasury fund has more liquidity than an investment-grade corporate product. You are paid a higher income for those types of returns, and I do believe having a measurement, hopefully, it's a dynamic measurement, a dynamic measurement will allow investors -- and we're talking mostly retail investors having a better understanding. And so if we can come up with a metrics that is dynamic, that is informative about the liquidity of any one product and differentiating that liquidity amongst different funds, because some funds, some different -- some mutual funds have systematically always -- even in the asset categories of, let's say, high yields, have been consistently invested in the lower-grade high yield with less liquidity, and some mutual funds have invested in the higher-grade high yield that had more liquidity, and so some form of dynamic measurement is probably good. I don't -- I actually believe -- once again, as investors are becoming more informed and they better understand the risks and the returns, I actually believe it will lead to greater investments in different asset categories. This is something we should all embrace. So I don't -- as I said, I look at this as a positive. It's a constructive way of analyzing. We just need to make sure that we don't cause so much problems that all institutions run out of mutual funds and go to separate accounts, and we may not be achieving everything that is necessary. But we want smart investors. Smart investor is better for the entire asset management industry. We should not run away from markets that are opaque. We should always be trying to find ways of making more transparency in terms of risk. In terms of Aladdin, greater risk analytics, whether it's liquidity analytics or stress test analytics, is a very large positive for the future direction and needs of clients utilizing Aladdin. As I said in my prepared remarks, Aladdin is growing 11% a year. We are in deep dialogue with many clients right now, and I feel very good about how Aladdin is the risk management platform of choice by so many investors worldwide."
